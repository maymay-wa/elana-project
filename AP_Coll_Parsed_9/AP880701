international celebrities including 
music star paul simon have joined in a campaign to save the 
worlds largest example of portuguese colonial architecture in 
downtown salvador one of the western hemispheres oldest cities 
the 91acre district is now a slum 
it is called pelourinho the portuguese word for pillory 
stemming from salvadors former slave trade 
pelourinhos largely abandoned facades line the narrow streets 
of the city that also was brazils first capital and sometimes is 
known to outsiders as bahia the name of the coastal citys state 
in addition to paul simon other international celebrities 
involved in the campaign include the spanish crooner julio iglesias 
and akio morito president of the sony corp 
of the districts 978 buildings some dating as far back as the 
1500s 300 are close to collapse 48 are in ruins and about 10 
slide down hillsides every year in seasonal rainstorms according 
to maria del carmen coordinator of the savepelourinho campaign 
pelourinhos spacious mansions housed the elite when salvador 
was until 1763 the capital of portugals vast south american 
colony today it is a skid row home to prostitutes drug dealers 
and muggers 
pelourinho must be the worlds largest baroque slum said 
the bahia state secretary for culture gilberto gil who also is a 
popular singer and composer there are people in this city who 
havent dared venture into pelourinho for the past 20 years 
but for the first time authorities encouraged by private 
business have launched a massive campaign to clean up the winding 
streets and halfcollapsed mansions which in 1987 were designated 
by unesco as part of mankinds cultural heritage the buildings 
are protected from demolition by a local decree 
if we dont do something now the whole beautiful area will be 
completely irrecoverable in 10 years said ms del carmen an 
engineer 
but conversely it was after the unesco designation that the 
colonial buildings arcades courtyards and cobblestone streets 
began fell into greater disarray 
landlords refused to invest in their properties which were 
inhabited by tenants who could pay almost no rent gil said 
and they werent allowed to tear down their buildings so the 
strategy was to let the buildings literally fall down with 
tenants inside them 
so far the socalled historical park of pelourinho operating 
with 150 functionaries borrowed from various municipal government 
offices has raised the equivalent of about 7 million in 
government grants and loans ms del carmen said but organizers 
hope a media campaign that began in february directed at foreign 
and domestic business communities will bring in much more 
morita simon and iglesias are featured in 60second public 
service announcements asking for donations and encouraging 
businesses to invest in the area 
we need brazilians and others to feel responsible for the 
area to understand that brazil was born here and want to leave 
this for their children ms del carmen said most of the 
people who actually live here exist in subhuman conditions and 
could care less about pelourinho 
black groups have been some of the most active in rallying to 
save the decaying center as part of a slow but growing 
blackconsciousness movement in mixedrace brazil 
pelourinho was a major port of entry for slaves from africa from 
the 1500s through 1888 when slavery was abolished in brazil one 
of the areas most beautiful buildings the rosary of the blacks 
church was built over a period of 150 years by and for slaves 
every stone here was laid with the sweat of blacks said an 
area resident known only as zoinho we have to save this 
area its a monument to our suffering 
paulo de jesus 18 lives with his father and four brothers and 
sisters in two rooms of a massively subdivided old home he was 
born in pelourinho 
i wouldnt leave this place he said this is my home but 
if you knocked down our old home and built an apartment building in 
its place wed be much happier 
some residents are worried that increased property values will 
drive out longtime inhabitants 
we have to make sure we dont turn pelourinho into a picture 
postcard ms del carmen said the sense of community here is 
rich and very strong we need to bring in jobs schools health 
facilities and give people the chance to appreciate the fabulous 
historicl setting

president reagan sent a letter to president 
miguel de la madrid regarding mexicos refusal to extradite a 
puerto rican separatist accused of being a terrorist the us 
embassy said friday 
us ambassador charles pilliod delivered the letter to de la 
madrid friday afternoon us embassy spokesman arturo montano said 
he said he did not have any details of the message concerning 
37yearold william morales who was freed from a mexican prison 
june 24 and allowed to leave on a flight to cuba 
a spokesman at de la madrids office said the president would 
respond to reagans letter as soon as possible he did not 
comment on the contents of the reagan message but said de la madrid 
told pilliod he has instructed the foreign ministry to respond to a 
state department protest delivered earlier this week to the mexican 
ambassador in washington 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
pilliod had personally carried the letter to de la madrid but she 
also would not discuss the contents 
mrs oakley said there had been no change in the us 
governments outrage at the release of morales 
the state deparment has called morales a convicted terrorist 
and murderer 
montano said pilliod returned to mexico thursday night from 
washington where he had been recalled for consultations tuesday 
mexico did not advise the united states that it had released 
morales until tuesday us officials have said 
mexican officials frequently characterized morales as a 
political fighter not a criminal and local news reports 
usually did not mention morales conviction in mexico for murder 
morales was released after serving five years of an eightyear 
sentence for the 1983 slaying of a mexican police officer and for 
entering the country illegally 
at the time of that killing morales was an escaped convict from 
the united states having fled in 1979 from a us prison after 
being convicted of weapons and explosives charges in new york 
after his capture in mexico the united states pressed without 
success for his extradition

officials could relax state restrictions 
on pesticide spraying in an effort to control the pear thrips an 
insect blamed for defoliating thousands of acres of maple trees in 
southern vermont 
officials of the state department of forests parks and 
recreation along with experts from the university of vermont and 
entomologists experienced with thrips from other northeastern 
states have come up with a research project designed to learn more 
about the insects habits life cycle and impact on maple crops and 
products 
pear thrips are insects whose feeding habits have damaged and 
weakened thousands of acres of vermont sugarbush particularly in 
bennington and windham counties 
the plans that experts have laid to improve the lot of maple 
trees may involve asking gov madeleine kunin to relax her 1986 
policy strictly limiting pesticide spraying by state agriculture 
and transportation officials 
william paine deputy commissioner of agriculture has done a 
control pesticide test spray on a sugarbush in londonderry with 
state permission to discover the most effective stage to spray in 
the thrips life cycle 
state forester bill guenther said recently the committee also 
wants to check for trends using an earthorbiting satellite that 
takes color coded infrared snapshots of vermont forest land 
the photos which would cost between 10000 and 12000 could 
give foresters a better idea of what next years maple crop will 
look like since the camera picks up signs of weakness and disease 
that human eyes can miss 
project members also plan to send out questionnaires to all 
known vermont sugarmakers asking them to comment on the extent of 
thrips damage

ronald and nancy reagan recall the white lies they 
told each other on their first date and reagans daughter 
maureen remembers her surprise when a friend told her she found 
the us president sexy 
these are a few of the tidbits of reagan lore that british 
television viewers will see on july 8 when the first of a 
threepart series on the life of reagan is broadcast 
the film shown to journalists thursday is filled with varied 
assessments of reagan 
to secretary of state george p shultz the president is a 
revolutionary and hes changed the agenda in the most sweeping 
presidency in this country probably since franklin roosevelt 
former budget director david stockman calls reagans economic 
policies the singular greatest episode of sustained economic 
mismanagement in the 20thcentury history of the united states 
but mrs reagan says of her husband i think he made people 
feel good about themselves good about the country we now have a 
strong economy unemployment is down interest rates are down 
the film traces reagan to his midwestern boyhood interviewing 
friends and schoolmates 
actress olivia de havilland recalls reagan and the late actor 
errol flynn lining up as soldiers so that flynns shoulder obscured 
reagan 
she says reagan quietly kicked the sand into a mound higher 
and higher and finally when the photographer said all right 
everybody lets smile the future president of the united states 
stepped up on the mound and towered over errol flynn 
interviewer godfrey hodgson asked reagan why he spied for the 
fbi on colleagues in the screen actors guild of which he was 
president 
they the fbi came wanting some advice some findings on 
people that i had dealt with and i got an insight into what was 
happening to the motion picture business it did give me a real 
understanding of the communist menace reagan says 
mrs reagan recalls their first date when mutually wary they 
both said they had early morning calls so that they could leave 
early if they didnt like each other 
they got home at 230 am she says i think by that time both 
of us knew that neither one us of had an early morning call 
maureen reagan reagans daughter by his first marriage to 
actress jane wyman says a friend who saw reagan doing a tv ad 
dressed as a cowboy exclaimed to her that hes so sexy 
i said my father sexy you must be kidding no no hes 
wonderful and he is wonderful miss reagan says 
during his 50minute interview reagan describes his wife as a 
helpmeet such as i think every man dreams of having a relationship 
that sort of matches your dreams of marriage when you were an 
adolescent 
he laughs about claims that she interferes in policymaking 
she doesnt go down and get involved in affairs like 
disarmament or anything else she advises me of what she thinks is 
good for me and i feel free to confide in her the things that are 
going on 
as a matter of fact shes a help just by my knowing that shes 
up there when i go to meet her at the end of the day

the constitutionality of the death penalty for 
juvenile killers again will be on the supreme courts agenda next 
term a welcome surprise for capital punishment foes 
leigh dingerson head of the national coalition to abolish the 
death penalty said its very encouraging i assumed it would be 
another couple of years before they took the issue up in another 
case 
henry schwarzschild of the american civil liberties union said 
the courts willingness to restudy the issue is very startling 
but he cautioned against reading too much into the courts 
announcement 
its foolish to try and predict what the court will do he 
said 
the justices on thursday provided a dramatic epilogue to their 
198788 term by agreeing to consider banning capital punishment for 
all juvenile murderers when the court returns for the next term on 
the first monday in october 
just 24 hours earlier the court had come close to banning the 
death penalty for those who commit murders before they are 16 
few expected it would move so quickly to reexamine capital 
punishment for juvenile killers 
but the justices said thursday they will use cases from georgia 
and missouri to reconsider the fate of young killers the court 
said it will decide sometime in 1989 whether use of the death 
penalty for anyone under 18 when the crime was committed violates 
the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment 
the court will consider overturning the death sentences of 
georgia death row inmate jose martinez high who was 17 when he 
participated in a 1976 murder and missouri death row inmate heath 
wilkins who was 16 when he committed a 1985 murder 
high was just weeks shy of his 18th birthday when he took part 
in a gas station robbery in taliferro county ga in which an 
11yearold boy was shot to death 
wilkins helped rob an avondale mo liquor store nancy allen 
a store clerk was fatally stabbed 
the national coalition to abolish the death penalty said 30 
death row inmates nationwide out of a total of 2100 were under 
18 when they committed their crimes 
of the 100 men and women executed in the united states since the 
supreme court reinstated capital punishment in 1976 three 
committed their crimes when they were 17 since 1948 no one has 
been executed for a crime committed when he or she was younger than 
17 
if the supreme court bans the death penalty for those under 18 
it would affect most of the 37 states with death penalty laws 
including those that do not specify a minimum age for killers 
subject to capital punishment and states that specify age limits 
under 18 
on wednesday four justices said the death penalty is 
unconstitutional for those who were younger than 16 when they 
committed murder three justices said the constitution does not set 
such age limits for executions 
justice sandra day oconnor provided a fifth vote to throw out 
the death penalty for a convicted oklahoma killer who was 15 when 
he helped kill his former brotherinlaw but oconnor stopped just 
short of calling for abolition of capital punishment for killers 
under 16 
a key vote in next terms cases will be provided by justice 
anthony m kennedy who joined the court in february too late to 
participate in the oklahoma case 
in other action thursday the court 
agreed to study alleged race discrimination in alaskan salmon 
canneries setting the stage for an important sequel to the courts 
ruling on wednesday that makes it easier for workers to prove their 
bosses are guilty of illegal bias 
cleared away the last legal obstacle to a 180 million 
settlement with interest now worth some 240 million between 
vietnam veterans and manufacturers of the herbicide agent orange 
the court let stand rulings dismissing lawsuits by about 300 
veterans who challenged the settlement in which as many as 250000 
others could participate 
agreed to decide whether states may ban virtually all lawyer 
advertisements that feature testimonials or client endorsements 
the justices will review a california rule that presumes such ads 
are false or misleading

even in the jet age a 55hour trip is a 
pretty brisk pace for a us secretary of state 
how does george shultz do it also why 
he does it by relying on what appear to be enormous reserves of 
energy but why did he decide to sweep through guatemala el 
salvador honduras and costa rica in his first trip to the region 
since 1986 
some senior members of congress are puzzled is shultz trying to 
lay the groundwork for a new us drive to win support for the 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
and why did he ignore appeals from the nicaraguan leader daniel 
ortega that he stop in managua 
a senior official who briefed reporters before shultzs 
departure wednesday said renewed aid for the contras would not be a 
major focus of the trip 
shultz apparently shunned ortega because us policy calls for 
avoiding sandinista leaders until they display what the reagan 
administration regards as serious interest in moving toward a 
democratic system 
from ortegas perspective that would be a lot easier to do if 
the united states stopped trying to overthrow the nicaraguan 
government 
sandinista leaders have been appealing to the contras to resume 
peace talks but the contras say the nicaraguan government would 
have to take certain steps first 
these include granting permission to open a television station 
not run by the government allow the taking of public opinion 
polls declaring a general amnesty and suspending military 
recruitment 
and so round and round they go with the prospect of renewed 
fighting always there 
peace talks ended june 9 the ceasefire has lasted three 
months but the thousands of contra soldiers who took sanctuary in 
honduras during the lull may be ready to fight again they are 
rested and have received food clothing and medicine from the 
united states 
shultz hopes the leaders of guatemala el salvador honduras and 
costa rica will pressure nicaragua to take a more flexible position 
on peace talks with the contras 
us aid to the rebels ended feb 29 and the mood on capitol 
hill is strongly against a resumption ostensibly the 
administration is trying to decide what to do conservatives on its 
right flank do not want to see the contras foresaken 
critics have insisted from the start that president reagans 
objective is to overthrow the sandinista government one way or 
another 
shultzs harsh rhetoric over the past six years has lent support 
to this theory the sandinistas seek to build totalitarian 
society on the back of a massive military machine he said 
thursday in honduras 
the softened tone reagan and shultz have taken lately toward the 
soviet union is not duplicated in this hemisphere cuba and 
nicaragua remain anathema to them and a test of us resolve in 
central america 
the military takeover in haiti was a setback to us hopes the 
state department has stopped ticking off proudly the number of 
countries in the hemisphere deemed to have turned democratic since 
reagan entered the white house 7 years ago 
but shultz made the point in tegucigalpa on thursday that 
nicaraguas perperson income is the lowest in the region while the 
picture is brighter elsewhere 
nicaragua is out of step a country isolated by its rejection 
of freedom growth and the security of its neighbors he said 
fidel castro is firmly in charge in cuba and ortega may be in 
nicaragua but there is an armed resistance in nicaragua and reagan 
and shultz have not lost hope the rebels will force a change in 
managua before the administration shuts down in january

the first fiscal 1989 appropriations bill a 
barebones energy and water development package is a senate vote 
away from heading to president reagans desk 
the 1783 billion package worked out by house and senate 
negotiators cleared the house on a 38417 roll call thursday and is 
expected to win easy senate approval next week following the july 
fourth recess 
the spending bill the product of a tightmoney year is more 
noteworthy for what it lacks than what it contains 
there is no money to begin construction of the superconducting 
super collider and lawmakers say not a dime to start work on new 
army corps of engineers and bureau of reclamation water projects 
members of congress and staffers say they cant recall when even 
huge budget deficits prevented at least a few new dams or harbor 
projects from being tossed into the traditional pork barrel bill 
the administration is not happy about the lack of construction 
money for the ssc the multibillion dollar highenergy physics 
project that backers say is needed to keep the united states 
technologically competitive 
the white house however has not made any veto threats against 
the energy and water bill as it has against a number of the other 
12 spending bills under consideration in congress 
leaders on both sides the capitol agreed to give the energy 
department 100 million next year to continue preliminary work on 
the ssc but they said a decision to build it should be made by the 
next president 
the bill contains money to continue construction work on more 
than 200 corps and bureau water projects 
although the administration sought six new corps starts the 
house and senate appropriations committees approved none taking 
the position that just one new start would set off a clamor among 
lawmakers for more 
more than twothirds of the money in the bill 1316 billion 
is headed for the department of energy with that agencys nuclear 
activities for the defense department accounting for 81 billion 
the nondefense portion of the departments budget would finance 
a variety of activities including research into solar and other 
renewable forms of energy and environmental restoration and safety 
programs 
at the senates insistance the bill contains 3 million to 
study the greenhouse effect the global warming trend that 
scientists say threatens the earth with climate changes and rising 
ocean waters 
the corps would have 11 million less next year than in fiscal 
1988 to spend on dams harbors and other work including a growing 
number of shoreline erosion projects 
the bureau of reclamation which operates irrigation and power 
facilities in the west would get 40 million more in fiscal 1989 
with more than 40 percent of the money going to three large 
projects central arizona central utah and central valley in 
california

contrasting pictures of the economy as republicans continued work 
on a party platform that they said would have more meat than the 
democratic document 
the disagreements over how well off americans really are 
occurred as dukakis prepared to visit a united auto workers union 
hall in dayton ohio and bush returned to his vacation home in 
kennebunkport maine for a celebration of his mothers 87th 
birthday today 
dukakis was returning tonight to boston where he and his wife 
kitty planned to celebrate the fourth of july with jesse jackson 
and his wife jackie 
jackson who has pressed for an offer of the no 2 position on 
the democratic ticket will meet monday night with dukakis said 
dayton duncan dukakis campaign press secretary the aide gave no 
indication what the two might discuss 
the massachusetts governor faced continued heat from opponents 
in the statehouse who criticized him for campaigning while the 
state ended its fiscal year with a nearly 400 million deficit 
thursday and without a budget for the next year a series of tax 
bills and feeraising measures to help the state pay for expanded 
spending in fiscal 1989 was nearing enactment 
bush told a luncheon group in new york that paid 10000 a 
couple to hear him speak that the country has been enjoying an 
economic recovery since late 1982 the longest peacetime expansion 
in history he said that two years ago economists predicted a 
downturn that hasnt arrived 
wrong wrong wrong bush said no wonder its called the 
dismal science 
bush said liberals promise compassion but they deliver 
misery 
dukakis told employees at a reynolds aluminum co plant outside 
chicago that the average weekly wage for jobs lost between 1979 and 
1985 was 440 while the average weekly pay for new jobs during 
that period was only 270 
too many of our families are struggling to hold on challenged 
by change anxious about their jobs burdened by the rising costs 
of health care and housing and college tuition troubled by the 
lack of quality affordable child care dukakis said 
republicans meeting in los angeles to draft a party platform 
criticized the democrats platform document as lacking content and 
trying to conceal a tax and spend policy 
senate minority leader bob dole of kansas said the democrats 
kept their platform short because they dont have much to talk 
about i mean who wants to talk about raising your taxes and 
more regulation and more spending 
dole asked if he wanted the no 2 job said i dont think 
its a question of wanting it its a question of winning the 
election helping your party and trying to help your country id 
want to be majority leader if i had my choice 
rep jack kemp of new york told reporters at the meeting he does 
not expect to be picked by bush as a running mate but said dole 
might be 
im not after it because i dont think its going to be 
offered said kemp adding that from all of the signals all of 
the press reports coming out of the bush campaign it sounds to me 
like theyre leaning to bob dole 
dukakis won the backing thursday of the political action 
committee of the national education association the nations 
largest teacher union the 19million member unions board is 
scheduled to meet today and almost certainly concur with the pacs 
choice 
nea officials said the endorsement applies only to the 
democratic nomination the union wont make a final presidential 
endorsement until sept 8 after both parties have held their 
conventions 
jackson refused to comment on whether he would use the dukakis 
visit to disclose whether he wants to pursue the second spot on the 
ticket 
at this point i will simply pursue the process and convey my 
private conclusions to gov dukakis later he said 
bush and dukakis played a game of role reversal thursday in 
response to a pair of polls that showed the two candidates tied or 
bush trailing dukakis only slightly earlier polls have given 
dukakis doubledigit leads 
i can only say what ive been saying for 16 months dukakis 
said early polls are meaningless 
bush in new york declared im feeling like harry truman 
and depicted himself as a comeback winner

responsible for ensuring that each woman has only one child and 
that the number of births in the county does not exceed the birth 
target set by the state 
parents are penalized for having more than one child and 
officials are penalized if the county goes over the number of 
births that it is allowed officials however are financially 
rewarded if births stay within the target 
some parents did not register births of their second or 
subsequent children to avoid paying the fine the paper said fines 
vary from region to region but are generally 270 or more per year 
for five years a huge fine by chinese standards 
some local officials seeing their bonuses jeapordized by too 
many births simply refuse to register new babies the paper said 
in one city in southwestern chinas sichuan province local

many nicaraguans are critical of their leftist 
government and dont believe it is democratic but they think 
soviet policies are better than those of the united states 
according to a private poll 
a survey presented thursday as the first independent poll of 
nicaraguan opinion under nine years of sandinista rule indicates 
strong support for president daniel ortega 85 percent opposition 
to us contra aid and 68 percent disapproval of us policies in 
central america 
asked what they most admire about the united states 42 percent 
of those polled said nothing which was the most prevalent 
answer 
the reagan administration for the past seven years has supported 
rebels attempting to overthrow the nicaraguan government 
the poll of 1129 adults in nicaragua was sponsored by the 
catholic university in managua and research groups in california 
and mexico 
william bollinger director of the cosponsoring interamerican 
research center of los angeles said the newly formed private 
nicaraguan institute of public opinion used accepted scientific 
polling methods employing students at catholic university which 
he described as the nations most politically neutral university 
the students interviewed 1129 adults selected at random in five 
types of managua neighborhoods on june 45 
bollinger did not offer a margin of error for the poll but he 
said at a news conference that several steps were taken to ensure 
its integrity and objectivity 
but he did note that many educated people who might have given 
antisandinista views have fled to the united states with their 
homes taken over by government officials and military officers he 
said about 27 percent of those polled worked for the government 
and they were the most supportive of the sandinistas 
thirtyeight percent of the respondents believed the ruling 
sandinistas management of the nicaraguan economy has been either 
bad or terrible while 36 percent described it as fair and only 22 
percent said it was good or excellent 
seventyfour percent of those interviewed said they rated their 
familys economic situation worse than a year ago while only 7 
percent said it was better 
fortyeight percent said they did not consider the sandinista 
government democratic while 40 percent said they did but there was 
general support for sandinista peace efforts and the governments 
foreign policies 
a majority supported incorporation of the contras into the 
countrys political life but most of those interviewed also said 
they doubted the fighting would end soon 
the overall results show the us economic blockade of 
nicaragua along with us support for the contra rebels has 
alienated even many antisandinista nicaraguans bollinger said 
the soviet union received higher positive responses than the 
united states among all income levels on several questions with 
higherincome groups being more prosoviet and prosandinista than 
poorer and lesseducated nicaraguans 
future polls the research group plans one of people in several 
latin american countries later this year will attempt to obtain 
more detail about reaction to soviet policies said bollinger 
only 1 percent of the respondents described us central 
american policy as excellent 7 percent called it good 17 percent 
said fair 40 percent said bad and 28 percent called it terrible 
asked the same question about soviet policy 14 percent said it 
was excellent 43 percent good 14 percent fair 9 percent bad and 
4 percent terrible 
in evaluating ortegas management of the government over the 
last four years 42 percent said it was good or excellent 29 
percent fair and 21 percent bad or terrible 
bollinger said this is a high rating in latin american terms he 
said in a similar poll conducted in el salvador only 13 percent of 
respondents gave president jose napoleon duarte a good or excellent 
rating 
the poll showed that 28 percent of those interviewed claimed 
affiliation with the ruling sandinista party 9 percent with 
liberal or conservative opposition parties and 59 percent said they 
belonged to no party 
bollinger said the nicaraguan government did not interfere with 
the survey even though laws apparently are still on the books 
prohibiting independent polling in the country

construction of a permanent silkworm battery 
by iran near the entrance to the persian gulf and the feared 
addition of a more advanced antiship missile to the iranian 
arsenal may heighten risks to passing tankers says the commander 
of us forces in the region 
gen george b crist the marine fourstar who heads the us 
central command told reporters thursday that completion of the 
iranian silkworm battery at kuhestak and the possible addition of 
another chinese antiship missile the ca08 could make passage in 
or out of the gulf more dangerous 
but he said that since a daylong naval battle on april 18 in 
which iran lost two of its four frigates iranian forces have 
steered clear of us warships and aircraft 
they have been very careful not to engage us said crist 
a crack team of electronics experts sent from the united states 
to the gulf determined several weeks after the clash that despite 
reports to the contrary iran had not fired a silkworm missile at 
us forces during the fray he said 
the false reports were generated by computers hooked up to 
radars aboard us warships that mistook a us sm1 missile fired 
at an iranian target for a silkworm he said 
for about two years iran has had silkworm missiles at the port 
of bandar abbas near the strait of hormuz with the ability to set 
them up at temporary sites to fire within a matter of hours said 
crist 
but the permanent earth and concrete bunker with a 57mile 
range missile will cover the entire strait of hormuz it will 
allow iran to have the missile ready to be fired within five 
minutes he said 
work on the bunker first reported in early 1987 was 
continuing crist said in his first briefing with reporters since 
the united states allowed kuwaiti tankers to fly the stars and 
stripes last summer and began escorting them through the gulf 
crist said he was pondering what weapons would be needed to 
destroy the bunker but meanwhile was stationing the cruise uss 
vincennes equipped with advanced aegis radar and airdefense 
missiles in position to protect any merchant ship passing throught 
the straits 
crist said the cruiser would be ordered to fire against any 
silkworm launched regardless of its intended target 
the threat is not to our ships which have been equipped with 
defenses against missiles like the silkworm but to unarmed 
merchant ships said crist 
we are not at war with iran said crist therefore before 
he orders the site bunker destroyed iran will have to do 
something to violate international law said the general 
stationing an aegis cruiser at the strait of hormuz may make the 
decision to fire easier because if a silkworm is fired i think 
it will be a little hard to tell who the target is and the us 
warship will try to destroy the attacking missile he said 
and under the rules of engagement in the persian gulf us 
warships and aircraft are under orders to respond agressively to a 
ship plane or shore installation they believe is attacking them 
if they fired a silkworm at me i would go get them said 
crist 
crist said that despite repeated protests from the united 
states china was continuing to sell advanced arms to the iranians 
he could not specify the exact arms but said that a ship from 
china or north korea unloaded weaponry from those countries about 
once every three months at bandar abbas 
he said iran is believed to have about 20 silkworms in the 
southern gulf probably kept at bandar abbas and more such 
missiles in the northern gulf and he fears that china has also 
sold iran ca08 missiles 
the ca08 has a more sophisticated guidance system than the 
silkworm which he described as primitive but carries a 
500pound warhead compared to the 1100pound warhead on the 
silkworm

republican leaders are looking to construct a 
conservative platform that builds on the partys triumphs in 1980 
and 1984 while carving out expanded new planks on such hot issues 
as drugs aids education and child care 
republican party chairman frank j fahrenkopf jr and other top 
gop officials pledged at a platform hearing here thursday that they 
will offer american voters a clear picture of what policies a bush 
administration will pursue in contrast to what they called the 
deliberate vagueness of the michael dukakisinspired democratic 
platform 
nebraska gov kay orr the platform chairman told reporters 
every indication to me is that we will have much the same 
platform we had in 1984 we clearly have been successful with 
the american electorate with that platform 
she added that it would reflect a conservative political 
philosophy 
sen robert w kasten jr rwis cochairman of the platform 
committee said the republicans 1984 vow not to raise taxes at a 
time when walter mondale was promising a tax increase was the 
basis on which we won 49 states 
kasten called the democrats 2000word draft platform approved 
in denver last saturday a bland compromise designed to 
camouflage the true intentions of dukakis and his party but as the 
election nears kasten said the disguise will come off and 
michael dukakis will be exposed for the narrowminded liberal wolf 
in sheeps clothing that he really is 
kasten told reporters that while the 1988 gop platform draws 
heavily from the 1984 platform on taxes the economy and defense 
the republicans must pay more attention this time to such issues as 
drugs aids education and child care 
the debate and the discussion and the dissension will probably 
be on those new issues which were going to rassle with in the 
platform committee said kasten 
five members of what will ultimately be a 106member gop 
platform committee presided at the daylong hearing on the economy 
and jobs along with fahrenkopf and maureen reagan cochairman of 
the republican national committee 
fahrenkopf challenged the democrats to meet us on the 
battlefield of ideas with a platform that spells out not only 
what we want to accomplish but how we intend to get there he 
said the party platforms take on even more importance this year 
the first presidential election in two decades without an incumbent 
in the race 
the gop platform will actually be written in new orleans 
starting aug 8 the week before the convention 
at thursdays hearing drugs were a main concern 
the platform committee heard an assistant police chief of los 
angeles robert vernon call for draconian measures against drugs 
and drugrelated crime including denial of business and 
professional licenses to those who test positive for drugs 
we are approaching a civilization crisis a literal 
civilization crisis said vernon who called for a world war 
iilike mobilization to fight drugs it should be unpopular and 
costly to abuse drugs in any form 
fahrenkopf and kasten said later they felt taking away business 
licenses might be going too far but the wisconsin senator added 
that the toughest part of the drug issue for us to decide is the 
mandatory vs voluntary parts 
los angeles county sheriff sherman block said drug education 
must start in fourth grade because it is too late once kids have 
had the taste of big money from drug dealing he said drugs were 
draining hundreds of millions of dollars from the american economy 
and he questioned why the us keeps sending aid to countries where 
the drugs come from 
its like handing a firearm to somebody who is threatening to 
kill you said block theres no country in the world today 
who short of a nuclear attack could mount the kind of offensive 
that would even come close to equalizing the level of death 
destruction and human misery that is being generated by substance 
abuse in this country 
a black businessman barry baszile testified that drug dealers 
are entrepreneurs too and might turn to legal businessed if 
economic development funds were available in black communities 
two former rivals to george bush sen bob dole and rep jack 
kemp said that to keep the white house the republicans must 
attract independent and crossover democratic voters 
kemp told reporters flatly that he does not expect to be picked 
by bush as a running mate and predicted dole would be 
dole asked if he wanted the no 2 job i dont think its a 
question of wanting it its a question of winning the 
election helping your party and trying to help your country id 
want to be majority leader if i had my choice

an estimated 10200 electric boat employees 
went on strike at the companys shipyard here friday after contract 
talks with the submarine builder broke down 
we expect the strike to be strong and wellsupported said

electric boat a division of general dynamics corp is one of 
only two shipyards making nuclear submarines for the navy and the 
only manufacturer of subs capable of carrying the giant trident 
ballistic missile 
talks broke down at 1120 pm thursday after a threehour 
lastditch effort and the walkout began after midnight 
no new talks were planned 
earlier in the day the navy awarded this years third and final 
ssn688 fastattack submarine contract to electric boat the 3474 
million contract will go to ebs main shipyard in here and its 
other plant in north kingstown ri 
the strike does not affect the rhode island plant 
in a letter to employees shipyard general manager fritz g 
tovar said a strike will not stop submarine construction at the 
shipyard here eb arranged to assign 3000 salaried employees to 
shipyard jobs in the event of a strike 
the two sides stalemated over the unions demand for percentage 
wage increases and the shipyards insistence that it could afford 
no more than cash bonuses to remain competitive in its pursuit of 
navy contracts 
union members voted earlier thursday 4921 to 3140 to reject 
the companys latest offer but returned to the bargaining table 
with 4 hours to go before the strike deadline in a lastditch 
effort to reach a settlement 
talks began in november to replace a threeyear contract that 
expired friday the last strike at the shipyard was in 1975 when 
the union walked out for five months and the regions economy 
sagged 
in hartford state labor commissioner betty tianti said she 
would meet on friday with members of the states congressional 
delegation and others to see what could be done to lessen the 
economic impact of the strike 
the union wanted straight hourly wage increases of 5 percent 4 
percent and 4 percent over three years 
electric boats last best and final offer presented 
monday calls for bonuses totaling 4250 over three years for a 
firstclass mechanic making 1202 an hour said thomas sotir vice 
president of human resources 
the company cited increased competition from the only other 
submarine shipyard in the country the newport news shipbuilding 
and drydock co of virginia 
newport news which pays its workers 60 cents an hour less than 
electric boat recently won two contracts for nuclear attack 
submarines after it underbid electric boat

courts trying to determine if defendants will 
commit violent crimes in the future would do just as well to flip a 
coin as to listen to the expert testimony of psychiatrists and 
psychologists a study published today indicates 
the inaccuracy of judgments by trained clinicians raises 
substantial doubt that psychologists or psychiatrists meet legal 
standards for expertise says the report published in the journal 
science 
the study was conducted by david faust an associate professor 
of psychology at brown university and jay ziskin a california 
lawyer and psychologist 
they found that laymen without degrees or clinical experience 
often can make courtroom evaluations of violent defendants as 
accurately as psychologists and psychiatrists 
and making decisions by just the flip of a coin faust said 
often is more accurate than the judgments of the experts 
life or death decisions by juries may be influenced by 
psychological experts who are called to testify in criminal trials 
on the mental state of defendants or their potential for violence 
in many states the punishment phase of capital murder trials 
takes into consideration a prediction of the continued violent 
behavior of the defendant prosecutors and defense lawyers 
frequently call on psychologists or psychiatrists for opinions 
but faust in a telephone interview thursday said the accuracy 
of the these opinions is questionable 
in many studies the error rate well exceeds the accuracy 
rate faust said there is virtually no evidence that experts 
are any better equipped to make those judgments than are lay 
individuals 
he said some studies have shown that experts are accurate in 
their predictions less than half the time 
if you flip a coin you ought to be right 50 percent of the 
time said faust so there are studies showing accuracies of 
less than chance 
education he said often has little to do with predicting 
violent behavior 
one study using high school students showed that their 
accuracy was similar to that of experts in predicting violent 
behavior faust said 
in the science article faust and ziskin cited a series of 
studies that they said showed clinicians are wrong at least twice 
as often as they are correct in predicting violent behavior 
they said one study followed 967 patients who had been placed in 
maximum security hospitals on the basis of a psychiatric 
determination of dangerousness they later were transferred to 
ordinary mental hospitals after four years only half of the group 
was still in the hospitals and only 26 patients who had been judged 
potentially violent had actually committed violent acts during that 
time 
in the article the authors said they conducted their research 
to learn if expert psychological witnesses achieve reasonable 
certainty of facts and aid in establishing the truth in trials 
the scientific evidence clearly suggests that clinicians fail 
to satisfy either legal standard for expertise they said 
psychological clinicians often are unable to agree on diagnoses 
much less provide trustworthy answers to more difficult 
forensic questions which often demand projections backward and 
forward in time the article said 
expert testimony often can have what the article called a 
prejudicial effect on juries 
confidence and accuracy can be inversely related and yet the 
jury may well accept the opinion of an expert who exudes confidence 
over that of an opposing expert who expresses appropriate 
caution the authors said 
evidence from experts they said is readily subject to 
abuse due to subjectivity and bias 
the involvement of experts wastes many hours of already too 
scarce court time and costs taxpayers millions of dollars the 
article says 
when an expert testifies that a psychologist or psychiatrist can 
predict violent behavior he endorses a falsehood and could 
create the risk for malpractice suits against colleagues the 
researchers said 
faust in the interview said he has testified as an expert in 
trials in the past but now refuses to do so because of his belief 
that his science at its present state of development is unable to 
achieve the expected level of accuracy 
other experts said the question of reliability of psychological 
testimony has been a matter of controversy but that it is not 
clear that such expertise is as unreliable as faust and ziskin 
contend 
i dont know of an opinion like that that is generally 
accepted in the scientific community said james c miller a 
professor of psychology at george washington university that is 
a controversial position 
dr jon obrien a forensic psychiatry expert at georgetown 
university said no professional could give a guarantee that an 
individual will or will not act violently 
but he said trials can still benefit from the testimony of 
experts

within three years all but the very smallest 
commuter aircraft must be equipped with socalled black box 
recorders under a new regulation from the federal aviation 
administration 
large jetliners already are required to have the recorders which 
provide information about an aircrafts performance and provide a 
30minute loop tape of conversation in the cockpit 
the devices have been critical in finding the cause of many 
airliner crashes over the years the national transportation safety 
board recently cited several commuter accidents in which 
investigations were hampered because adequate information was not 
available 
but commuter planes of less than 30 seats are not required to 
have the devices 
under a final faa rule announced thursday multiengine turbine 
powered commuter planes carrying more than six passengers and flown 
by two pilots will be required to have cockpit voice recorders 
slightly larger commuter planes carrying 20 or more passengers 
will have to be equipped with digital flight data recorders that 
store such information as air speed altitude aircraft pitch and 
heading 
commuter airlines must have the black box recorders within three 
years of the effective date of the rule which is expected to be in 
90 days 
the cockpit voice recorders must be included in new aircraft and 
retrofitted into planes already in service the flight data 
recorders must be in both new and inservice aircraft with 20 or 
more seats there is no retrofit requirement for flight data 
recorders in the smaller commuter planes of less than 20 seats 
although the fdr and cvr do not enhance safety by themselves 
they have proven to be invaluable accident investigation tools and 
have led to numerous improvements in aviation safety said faa 
administrator allan mcartor 
last year congress directed the faa to expand its requirements 
for the black box recorders to include commuter airlines which 
last year carried about 32 million passengers

angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi says he has 
been trying to get his message across to american blacks for seven 
years and is finally making headway even though his movement is 
supported by south africa 
i can assure you here that we have made a very modest small 
but firm start in talking to the black leaders savimbi said at 
the national press club on thursday 
before visiting washington this week savimbi went to alabama and 
mississippi to seek support at black churches and from civil rights 
leaders 
he met with some success and appeared at the white house for a 
meeting with president reagan on thursday accompanied by the rev 
ralph david abernathy of the southern christian leadership 
conference and a handful of other blacks 
we have to do all that we can to see to dr savimbi having the 
support that is necessary abernathy said im sure that he 
needs our blessing and support and because of his location he is 
facing many problems 
savimbi has been treated as a pariah by american civil rights 
leaders because his unita forces receive aid from south africa in 
their struggle against the sovietbacked angolan government 
opposition to him here has by no means disappeared about 40 
protesters shouting antisavimbi slogans demonstrated against him 
in fayette miss last saturday and he said he encountered other 
protests in the south 
about 25 people demonstrated outside the national press building 
during his appearance and a man interrupted his speech from the 
open door of the dining room to shout three times savimbi is a 
murderer 
savimbi says he first sought a meeting with the congressional 
black caucus in 1981 and again when he was here in 1986 he said 
thursday that he is still hoping for a meeting with the black 
members of congress this time 
he said he wanted to explain the problems of unita in order 
for the people to know to listen and to judge i think those are 
the fundamentals of democracy 
savimbi told the conservative heritage foundation that he saw 
his first member of the caucus rep louis stokes dohio this 
trip when stokes chaired his meeting with the house intelligence 
committee he said stokes treated him politely 
the committee oversees us aid to unita 
to the criticism of his links with south africa savimbi says he 
opposes apartheid but will take support from anyone willing to 
give it he says he is a democrat who only wants freedom and 
independence for his country 
when he fought against portuguese colonial rule of his african 
homeland in the 1960s and 1970s us aid was unavailable to him 
because the united states was allied with portugal 
so he turned to the soviet union which rejected him and then 
to china which gave him guerrilla training 
unita lost to the sovietbacked mpla after the portuguese left 
angola in 1975 so he retreated to the bush and sought support from 
the only source available south africa 
congressional sources who asked not to be identified say he is 
receiving an estimated 200 million to 300 million in direct south 
african aid this year plus the support of the south african 
military in angola and neighboring southwest africa or namibia 
us conservatives favor his movement because of its opposition 
to the soviets conservatives succeeded in winning congressional 
repeal of a law banning aid to unita and in 1986 reagan announced 
15 million in military aid 
while the details are classified the aid continues and is 
estimated to have climbed to between 30 million and 40 million 
this year including stinger antiaircraft missiles that savimbi 
credits with stopping air strikes against his headquarters

rep les aspin says he and defense secretary 
frank c carlucci are on the same wavelength although the 
defense department sharply criticized aspins call for a freeze in 
new contracts to companies mentioned in the pentagon bribery 
investigation 
the wisconson democrat chairman of the house armed services 
committee said he and carlucci spoke on the telephone late 
thursday shortly after a pentagon spokesman had sharply criticized 
aspins proposal 
i called him up and when he talked we discovered that were 
on the same wavelength here aspin said i dont think were 
that far apart in what were thinking my goal is to make sure the 
contracts that are being let now not the ones involved in the 
investigation are free of any taint thats his goal too 
aspin had called wednesday for a delay of six to eight weeks in 
awarding contracts to firms mentioned in the 2yearold 
investigation of fraud and bribery in pentagon weaponsbuying no 
charges have yet been filed 
but aspin in an interview with the associated press said hes 
not wedded to the sixtoeightweek time frame thats just an 
idea i threw out he said 
aspin said he plans to write carlucci a letter outlining aspins 
proposals i need to get these ideas down on paper and then he 
said hed respond 
but said aspin carlucci and i have the same goals he said 
hes got people working to come up with a way to make sure the 
current contracts arent tainted 
aspin and other committee members attended a closeddoor 
briefing thursday by the naval investigative service about the 
case two legislators said later they expect numerous indictments 
rep barbara boxer dcalif said officials are very very 
sure of their caseits pretty ironclad 
rep larry hopkins rky said many many indictments will 
be forthcoming i dont think it will be too long before the 
first of them will be coming down 
rear adm ted gordon director of the nis detailed the case for 
the legislators he outlined a series of interlocking rings of 
people kind of like the olympic flag in which several groups 
operated independently according to one source speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
earlier the pentagon had rejected aspins call for a halt a 
freeze could raise weapon costs force plant layoffs and hurt 
military readiness said spokesman fred s hoffman 
we would be glad to discuss with the congress the question of 
freezing awards of new contracts while the justice department is 
investigating allegations of procurement fraud hoffman said 
but at this point we feel it would be imprudent to apply such a 
freeze or moratorium 
the investigation has also spawned its first two pieces of 
reform legislation 
one would overhaul and centralize the purchasing system while 
the second would try to end to the socalled revolving door 
between the private sector and government 
the first measure would create a single buying office known as 
the defense acquisition agency to replace the current mix of 
purchasing agencies scattered throughout the defense department 
the second would require pentagon officials to wait two years 
after they quit before working for a defense contractor

the national rifle association says it will 
try to pluck a handgun waitingperiod provision out of an antidrug 
bill when the measure comes up for a vote in the house 
well work to break it out of the drug bill on the floor and 
get an upordown vote on that issue only said james baker the 
nras chief lobbyist 
on thursday the house judiciary committee tucked an amendment 
into the drug bill that would require prospective purchasers of 
handguns to wait seven days before taking possession to allow for 
background checks 
we will be incapable of making substantial headway in our war 
against drug trafficking unless we are also prepared to disarm drug 
dealers and drug traffickers and drug users said rep edward 
feighan dohio who offered the waitingperiod amendment 
the proposal withstood a challenge from rep bill mccollum 
rfla who attempted to substitute an amendment requiring that a 
system be developed to identify felons who attempt to buy firearms 
the mccollum substitute was defeated 2212 and the waiting period 
was then approved by a voice vote 
feighan noted that republicans on the committee did not ask for 
a recorded vote and said that is an indication that most members 
do not want to be publicly reported as opposing such a sensible 
guncontrol measure 
the nra is losing credibility in this institution and 
nationally because they have opposed the most reasonable efforts at 
gun control said feighan their insanity doesnt end 
the nra contends that waiting periods dont work 
we think that lawabiding citizens will be the only ones 
affected and criminals will continue to evade the law baker said 
during the waiting period law enforcement agencies could try to 
determine whether a prospective buyer has a criminal record or a 
record of mental incompetency 
the measure would exempt those who present dealers with 
certificates from police stating that the purchasers lives have 
been threatened 
twentytwo states have some form of waiting periods with 
california having the longest at 15 days the amendment would 
supersede less stringent state waitingperiod laws but leave 
stronger laws standing

government leaders are fretting over a plan to 
import millions of tons of us household trash to a dump in 
northwest england 
one lawmaker said in thursdays debate in parliament that the 
united states should look into disposing its waste in its own 
deserts rather than in britain legislator chris taylor said he 
feared creating the 130foothigh dump on 390 acres in his home 
constituency of warrington could introduce us crop diseases into 
the area 
who would pick up the bill if the colorado beetle infected the 
cheshire potato crop he asked 
americans should find a place in their deserts perhaps to 
deal with their own garbage rather than add to our own 
environmental problems said taylor of prime minister margaret 
thatchers governing conservative party 
the garbage is to be shipped from the east coast of the united 
states at the rate of 15 million to 2 million tons a year for five 
years by a british company power water and waste according to 
environment undersecretary colin moynihan 
several african nations have recently expressed outrage over 
dumping of waste from western countries including the united 
states within their borders 
in one case the government of guinea in west africa said it 
found 15000 tons of toxic ash shipped from philadelphia and dumped 
on an island off its coast by a norwegian company 
nigeria recently announced it was posting vigilantes around its 
coast to block such dumping by foreign countries 
moynihan defended disposing of foreign waste in britain as a 
legitimate trade 
but he said this particular plan gives grave cause for 
concern he said the waste is undoubtedly different in kind and 
scale from the imports we have received so far 
he said us household garbage contains garden and food waste 
so imports must involve the risk of pests and diseases being 
carried with it he said 
the cheshire county council approved the plan and moynihan said 
he would be holding talks later with that body

a union representing 12000 state 
clerical workers and counselors went on strike at midnight 
thursday its president said 
paul krissel president of the pennsylvania social services 
union said 56 percent of pennsylvanias secondlargest state 
employees union voted to reject a threeyear contract offer 
krissel said the strike would affect statewide operations in 
welfare and unemployment offices some bureaus under the department 
of labor and industry and some counseling services in prisons and 
mental institutions 
he said the strike would become evident when offices opened in 
the morning and picket lines went up outside the bulk of the 
membership is in philadelphia and pittsburgh and surrounding areas 
the union president said 
john taylor a spokesman for gov robert casey said supervisors 
and nonstriking employees will keep offices open 
were prepared to do whatever we have to do to maintain 
services the governor said at an afternoon briefing 
pssu struck for two days in 1985 and three weeks in 1975 
at issue is the states effort to institute a twotier wage 
scale and vacation package that the union said discriminates 
against new employees and those at the lower end of the scale 
krissel said 
we seek a fair acrosstheboard wage increase for all workers 
as well as some added financial recognition for loyal longerterm 
employees he said 
although 25 percent of the employees represented by the union 
are not members krissel said he expected they would honor picket 
lines union members in supervisory positions about 2000 people 
are barred from striking he added

fbi affidavits unsealed in the pentagon 
bribery investigation list nine government contracts on which 
agents allege that consultant mark c saunders had insider 
information 
the affidavits unsealed thursday in dallas allege that 
saunders got most of his information from navy procurement official 
george stone and passed it to another consultant thomas muldoon 
here is a listing of each contract and some of the information 
allegedly passed by saunders 
from september 1987 through april 1988 saunders got from stone 
a steady stream of information including sealed bids of 10 
competing companies about a 120 million marine corpsnavy 
contract for an advanced tactical air command control system 
saunders got advance word in december 1987 from stone about a 
32 million contract for secure navy radio equipment 
stone called saunders at home in january 1988 to give him the 
names of the finalists which he called the inside skinny on a 
10 million navy contract for a tactical environmental support 
system saunders told muldoon that this data was hard to get and 
now we cant even make any money on it 
in november 1987 saunders provided muldoon with a draft of the 
governments plan for acquiring a 50 million fiber optics cable 
system 
in august 1987 saunders told muldoon the company he was 
working for rated poorly on the technical aspects of its bid for a 
more than 100 million digital wideband transmission system 
contract 
in august 1987 saunders told muldoon about an internal navy 
split over how to handle a 10 million contract for a prototype of 
a sonar system 
in july 1987 saunders told muldoon that a 100 million 
antisubmarine warfare operation center contract might have to be 
restructured and rebid 
in november 1987 stone told saunders of a decision that day 
about a 100 million digital communications terminal contract 
the ninth contract was to be for radios at an undisclosed 
price in this case the fbi said saunders had been awarded a 
9000 government subcontract to develop the governments plan for 
buying the radios the fbi said saunders worked with joe bradley 
marketing vice president in dallas for varian continental 
electronics to rig his work so that varian could win the radio 
contract 
the fbi said that in a series of conversations from september to 
december of 1987 bradley and saunders discussed how to write the 
acquisition plan to make it difficult for other companies to 
compete with varian

thanks to astrids law dogs tails in 
sweden are safe from cosmetic trimming and barnyard animals are 
guaranteed a better life at least until they get to the 
slaughterhouse 
the law which took effect july 1 was the result of a campaign 
by childrens author astrid lindgren creator of pippi longstocking 
and a host of other characters who have enchanted children in 
dozens of countries 
it was a remarkable achievement even for a woman who once 
helped bring down a government it reflected the reverence with 
which swedes regard a storyteller who has spellbound three 
generations 
the law was mrs lindgrens birthday present from the 
government when she turned 80 last november prime minister ingvar 
carlsson visited her stockholm apartment to tell her the the animal 
protection law was being drafted and would be informally but 
affectionately called lex astrid 
we are going to take much more consideration of the animals 
health and well being he told her 
mrs lindgren a farmers daughter long had agitated against 
cruelty to animals but the campaign gained momentum last year when 
she wrote in an open letter to carlsson every pig is entitled to 
a happy pig life 
she complained that calves often were locked in barns and 
slaughtered without ever seeing a summer pasture she asked 
carlsson to make life a little bit easier for many unhappy 
animals in our country 
the wideranging law guarantees cattle the right to graze and 
cows and pigs the right to stalls with straw and bedding it says 
chickens should be freed from their coops within 10 years and 
animals should be protected from undue suffering before slaughter 
it also outlaws the drugging of horses in racing and riding 
competions and says animals may not be beaten repeatedly with a 
stick or whip beyond a light strike riding schools and fur 
farms must be licensed 
it made sweden the second country after norway to ban the 
cropping of dogs tails for cosmetic reasons 
it was not the first time mrs lindgren ventured from her 
fantasy world to shake up the politicians 
in 1976 she wrote a satirical fairy tale widely publicized in 
the daily press dramatizing her complaint against the system of 
taxation that finances the generous social benefits of the swedish 
welfare state 
mrs lindgren calculated that she paid more than 100 percent in 
taxes on her income because of a quirky combination of local tax 
income tax and social tax for the selfemployed 
her indignation at having to pay to write profitable books 
contributed to a growing fatigue among the voters with the social 
democratic party which had governed sweden for 44 unbroken years 
rightwing opposition parties had decried the tax system as 
unfair for years but mrs lindgrens lament had a far wider impact 
in the 1976 election the social democrats were ousted returning 
to power in 1982 
mrs lindgren has political punch because she is a nonpolitical 
national symbol whose books are universally embraced they are as 
much a part of growing up in sweden as dancing around the maypole 
in summer and eating herring at christmas 
many of her 70 books have been translated into 60 languages and 
have been the source of 29 films or television series she has won 
35 swedish or international awards since publishing her first book 
in 1944 
her stories were often set in rural sweden where children 
romped through green forests in summer skated on frozen lakes in 
winter and went fishing in the autumn 
her most popular character is pippi longstocking a rebellious 
girl with red pigtails a chest full of money and incredible 
strength 
pippi mocks societys venerated institutions such as charitable 
old ladies and doesnt go to school the book was an instant hit 
when it was published in 1945 
her books betray her early interest in animals pippi has a 
horse who lives on the veranda and a monkey named nilsson who 
sleeps in the house emil an endearing rascal from another popular 
series also has a horse and a pet pig 
mrs lindgren recently collaborated on an american production of 
a pippi longstocking film and is working on a new book

military prosecutors took too long to bring 
army col james e longhofer to trial the us army court of 
military review ruled in overturning his 1986 courtmartial 
conviction a published report says 
longhofer 50 who headed the special operations division in 
1981 and 1982 was convicted in april 1986 of disobeying a lawful 
order dereliction of duty and conduct unbecoming an officer 
the military appeals court ruled thursday that the delay in 
bringing longhofer to trial violated the speedy trial 
requirement of military law the washington post reported in 
todays editions 
the trial was not begun within 120 days after longhofer was 
charged the court ruled blaming the delay on army prosecutors 
inexplicable unfamiliarity with procedures for obtaining 
security clearances for longhofers civilian attorney 
thank god for the constitution and my lawyers longhofer 
told the post after the ruling im going to ask that i be 
restored to what i would have been had they not violated my 
constitutional rights 
longhofer spent 63 days in prison at fort leavenworth kan 
before being released pending appeal he originally had been 
sentenced to two years in prison a reprimand and 24000 in pay 
forfeiture but his commanding officer later cut the penalties in 
half 
allegations of financial illegalities by members of his unit 
prompted longhofers suspension in december 1983

a september 1986 tip that a private consultant 
was peddling secret bid information on a marine corps contract 
triggered the pentagon bribery probe that now encompasses scores of 
companies consultants and officials fbi documents show 
affidavits unsealed thursday in dallas say the fbi and the naval 
investigative service were told that a consultant had approached an 
employee of a company that had bid on the marine contract offering 
to provide competitors costs and bid data and government bid 
evaluations 
with the employees consent agents recorded his conversations 
with the consultant who subsequently was confronted and agreed to 
cooperate in recording conversations with other individuals 
this group of recordings revealed the fbi said that defense 
consultant william parkin a retired navy missile buyer served 
as a middleman who paid government employees for inside information 
and sold it to contractors in january 1987 a court ordered 
tapping of parkins office and home telephones 
by april 1987 the fbi said those wiretaps led agents to tap 
the telephones and bug the offices of consultant william galvin 
by june 1987 taps and bugs were authorized for the office 
telephones and office of consultant melvyn paisley who had 
resigned three months earlier as assistant navy secretary for 
research engineering and systems 
one month later the fbi said it began tapping consultant thomas 
muldoons telephones in washington the fbi got a court order to 
tap consultant mark saunders telephones in virginia in september 
1987 
the fbi later tapped or bugged consultant donald illeman in 
southern california illeman who had not been previously 
identified with the case did not immediately return a telephone 
message 
later taps or bugs were placed on consultants fred lackner 
charles gardner and jim rapinac

an 18year study that revealed the atomic 
structure of earths most abundant protein could lead to higher 
crop yields better drugs to combat cancer and heart disease and 
even to more effective laundry detergents scientists say 
the study by biochemist david eisenberg of the university of 
california los angeles is very significant work said dr 
john norvell health science administrator at the national 
institute of general medical sciences in bethesda md 
it will add a lot to the understanding of how these complex 
proteins work and therefore may help researchers trying to 
design proteins to combat several diseases including diabetes and 
cancer norvell said 
eisenberg and his students published their study today in the 
journal science they spent 18 years bombarding crystals of the 
protein named rubisco with xrays before they successfully 
produced computer images showing the threedimensional arrangement 
of the 37792 atoms in the protein which ultimately sustains life 
by making every plant grow 
learning the structure of this protein will aid researchers 
who are hoping to increase crop yields by altering the protein so 
it makes plants grow more quickly said eisenberg a physical 
chemistry and molecular biology professor at ucla 
rubisco stands for ribulose15bisphosphate 
carboxylaseoxygenase a protein present in all green plants it 
transforms carbon dioxide into sugar to start photosynthesis the 
sunlightaided process that makes plants grow 
this protein is vital to all life said retired ucla plant 
physiologist sam wildman who discovered rubisco in 1947 we all 
depend on photosynthesis for food this protein performs a key 
function in photosynthesis by knowing the structure clever people 
like eisenberg can plot how to modify the structure so the plant 
would make more matter which is what we eat 
the study also is another step in helping scientists learn the 
rules by which amino acids the building blocks of life form 
complex proteins 
such knowledge eventually may help researchers design proteins 
to kill cancers destroy blood clots that cause heart attacks 
degrade toxic wastes and even make better laundry detergents 
norvell eisenberg and washington state university biochemist bruce 
mcfadden said in telephone interviews 
plants on earth produce 11 tons of rubisco each second or 35 
million tons per year eisenberg said rubisco which is 10000 
times smaller than the width of a human hair constitutes half the 
soluble protein in all plants making it the most abundant protein 
on earth he added 
mcfadden has already altered rubiscos structure to make 
photosynthetic bacteria double their uptake of carbon dioxide if 
he can do the same thing in plants an effort that should be aided 
by eisenbergs study we hypothesize we will obtain 
fastergrowing plants it could be in the offing in the next five 
years mcfadden said from pullman wash 
eisenberg and fred hartman acting director of biology at oak 
ridge national laboratory in tennessee said 10 years was more 
likely 
success would create crops with twice the yield from the same 
amount of acreage hartman said 
knowledge gained from the structure of rubisco and other big 
proteins might help scientists design proteins that could be 
injected to degrade nutrients and growth factors that promote 
cancer hartman said 
eisenberg coined the name rubisco as a play on the brand name 
nabisco because wildman once hoped to sell the protein as a cheap 
food source and eisenberg suggested it could be sold in cracker 
form 
the study took 18 years because eisenberg had to have perfect 
crystals of the protein which is extracted from tobacco leaves 
get xrays to hit the crystals properly and improve the computers 
ability to measure brightness of 40000 points of scattered xrays 
and assemble them into a picture

the american medical association on thursday 
called on the states to trace the sexual partners of people 
infected with the aids virus and urged prisons to test inmates for 
exposure to the deadly disease 
in addition the ama urged doctors as a last resort to breach 
confidentiality rules and warn sexual partners of aids patients 
the ama approved the measures by voice vote along with a package 
of other aids proposals before adjourning its annual policymaking 
convention 
i think that contact tracing of sexual partners at least in 
the heterosexual community has the potential to substantially 
reduce the proliferation and spread of aids said dr james 
sammons executive vice president of the 295000member ama 
the amas 420member house of delegates also approved policies 
aimed at prohibiting athletes from using steroids posting health 
warnings on tanning booths urging airlines to ban smoking on all 
domestic flights and evaluating whether health warnings should be 
required on alcoholic beverages 
the delegates passed an amendment that says doctors as a last 
resort have an obligation to depart from their hippocratic vow of 
confidentiality to warn sexual partners of persons infected with 
the aids virus 
the policy says that doctors should try to persuade patients who 
are infected with the virus to inform their sexual partners if the 
infected person refuses the doctor should report the person to the 
local public health department so the officials can warn the sexual 
partners under the policy 
and if that fails the doctor should tell the people who are 
at risk directly said dr m roy schwarz chairman of the amas 
aids task force and the associations assistant executive vice 
president for medical education and science 
dr don chaplin a delegate from burlington nc warned that 
doctors must emphasize the need to protect the identities of aids 
victims 
i caution us to be very careful to do anything we can to 
protect confidentiality and to fight any discrimination because it 
would thwart our efforts to bring this disease under control 
chaplin said 
the doctors organization renewed its call for mandatory 
aidsvirus testing of all inmates because of the problems of 
intravenous drug use and homosexuality in prisons practices that 
spread the disease 
the ama adopted a similar prisontesting proposal last year and 
reapproved it thursday despite objections from several doctors that 
it would accomplish little 
the doctors approved what chaplin said would be broad 
expansions on contact tracing of sexual partners to slow the 
spread of aids among heterosexuals 
sammons said contact tracing had been effective in reducing such 
other sexually transmitted diseases as syphilis and gonorrhea 
the delegates also called on federal and state governments to 
expand treatment programs for intravenous drug abusers because they 
pose the most explosive potential for spreading aids into the 
heterosexual population 
by 1991 the nation likely will have 270000 cases of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome said an ama progress report issued 
during the convention there is no known cure for the disease 
some of the other aids policies approved by the ama call for 
vigorous enforcement of existing antidiscrimination laws to 
protect aids victims against bias in employment housing and other 
areas and urge women to avoid breast feeding if they are infected 
with the aids virus to reduce the chance of giving the disease to 
their children 
another measure calls for the us president to keep public 
attention focused on the epidemic by creating a new national aids 
commission identical to the one that just finished its work 
such a panel would be a clearinghouse for aids research and 
provide the essential coordination between public and private 
institutions that are addressing aids the ama said 
in other action 
the rapid growth of the commercial tanning industry with an 
estimated 17500 parlors nationwide prompted the ama to declare 
that tanning booths pose potentially significant health risks 
delegates voted to lobby the federal government to require 
warnings in tanning parlors about the increased risks of skin 
cancer caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light in tanning 
booths 
delegates continued their longtime war on tobacco use urging 
commercial airlines to ban smoking on all domestic flights federal 
regulations now prohibit smoking on flights of two hours or less 
the ama urged state legislatures to prohibit athletes from 
using steroids to enhance physical prowess improper use of 
steroids poses dangerous risks such as impairment of a persons 
sexual functions

a soviet journalist said four delegates to a 
nationwide communist party conference were suspected of 
bribetaking tass said the charge was made after a passionate 
debate on the power of the press to criticize leaders 
vitaly korotich of the weekly magazine ogonyok gave a list of 
the delegates to mikhail s gorbachev at thursdays session of the 
party gathering but he did not publically identify them the 
official news agency said he demanded an investigation of the 
allegations 
the edition of ogonyok published sunday said delegates from the 
central asian republic of uzbekistan had taken bribes it said 
acceptance of bribes by delegates to the first general party 
conference in 47 years was an indication that largescale 
corruption still exists in the central asian republic 
korotich said the investigation that uncovered the bribetaking 
was part of a larger probe that implicated the soninlaw of the 
late soviet leader leonid i brezhnev 
in january tass reported that brezhnevs relative yuri 
churbanov would go on trial for accepting bribes equal to 270 
years pay for the average soviet factory worker 
korotich said the suspected bribetakers could not be called to 
account because of connections between the courts and the party 
tass reported 
he addressed a session on the third day of the conference his 
remarks were punctuated by applause and shouts from the floor 
where almost 5000 delegates were seated 
i would very much like it if the party control commission and 
the general procurator of the soviet union at last gave an 
evaluation of what the investigators are saying and either punish 
those about whom we are talking or punish the investigators and 
journalists who allowed themselves to put innocent people under 
suspicion he said to loud applause 
in an apparent reference to korotich later uzbekistan party 
chief rafik nishanov said demagogues are operating under the 
cover of perestroika the name gorbachev has given his plans for 
social and economic reform 
korotich took the floor after georgy razumovsky head of the 
conference credentials committee said a long investigation would 
be needed to find out if ogonyoks allegations were true 
the editor said the magazines material was supplied by 
investigators who still were following a trail of bribery and 
corruption tied to former uzbekistan party leader sharaf rashidov 
and churbanov brezhnev died in 1982 and rashidov in 1983 
brezhnevs soninlaw was first deputy interior minister while 
brezhnev was alive but was fired soon afterward two uzbekistan 
officials have been executed after being convicted of corruption 
soviet television showed korotich documents in hand turning to 
the dais with gorbachev directly behind him after a cut it showed 
the editor answering questions while gorbachev straightened a sheaf 
of papers 
korotich would not identify those suspected of bribery saying 
only the four people listed in the documents are delegates to 
the party conference 
the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya said thursday the 
investigation of churbanov had been completed and he would be tried 
on charges of systematic bribetaking along with former uzbekistan 
interior minister k yakhyayev two of yakhyayevs deputies and 
five regional police chiefs 
it said two senior officials implicated in the case committed 
suicide but did not name them 
the bribetaking allegations were referred to the credentials 
committee on wednesday during a passionate debate about the power 
of the staterun press to criticize party and government officials 
official reports said gorbachevs program of reforms has 
emboldened the media to report more openly on once taboo topics

researchers have nearly halted the progression 
of multiple sclerosis in some patients for up to four years by 
aiming radiation at specific sites in the body a new study says 
the fouryear response is longer than any seen with other 
experimental therapies scientists said 
the radiation was aimed at depleting the bodys supply of white 
blood cells that are believed to cause symptoms of the disease by 
attacking nerve tissue 
an estimated 250000 americans have multiple sclerosis an often 
crippling condition that can include weakness difficulty in 
coordination dizziness and loss of balance 
patients in the study had chronic progressive ms an unremitting 
form that steadily worsens the disease also has an 
exacerbatingremitting form in which a patient suffers 
isolated attacks 
about a third of ms cases begin in chronic progressive fashion 
of those that start out as isolated attacks instead about 60 
percent eventually convert to the chronic progressive form 
while radiation is probably not the ultimate answer to multiple 
sclerosis study coauthor stuart cook said right now if i had 
chronic progressive ms i would be very interested in taking part 
in a trial that was using this 
i think its promising said dr william sibley chairman of 
the national multiple sclerosis societys committee on therapeutic 
claims what it needs is confirmation from another group 
the work is described in the july issue of the journal neurology 
by cook chairman of the neuroscience department at the university 
of medicine and dentistry of new jerseynew jersey medical school 
raymond troiano of the medical school corinne devereux of the 
clara maass medical center in belleville nj and colleagues 
the researchers focused the radiation on the spleen and lymph 
glands in the neck under the armpits in the chest and abdomen and 
above the groin 
twentyseven patients received radiation and 21 others 
unwittingly received sham treatments so that experimenters could 
account for any psychological benefit from experiencing treatment 
the radiation treatments lasted about five weeks 
then the patients were followed for up to 48 months to see how 
many deteriorated at least one notch on a disabilityrating scale 
when compared at sixmonth intervals 20 percent to 30 percent 
fewer of the radiationtreated patients than the shamtreatment 
patients showed that deterioration 
researchers also analyzed results from the 17 radiationtreated 
patients who showed the fewest remaining white cells three months 
after treatment stopped they showed only minimal deterioration in 
ms disability averaging less than one notch on the scale when 
checked for periods ranging up to four years cook said 
the other irradiated patients fared significantly worse 
no major side effects appeared in the irradiated patients cook 
said nausea hair loss diarrhea and other problems sometimes led 
to shortterm postponements of therapy sessions researchers said 
one death apparently related to the treatment was reported from 
complications of a respiratory infection 
as for risk of cancer cook said other researchers gave twice as 
much radiation in a similar treatment program for hodgkins 
disease a form of cancer and patients in that study have shown 
low risk of developing additional cancer 15 years after treatment 
the next step is to see if other researchers can duplicate the 
results of the new multiple sclerosis experiment and to compare 
the radiation treatment to other experimental therapies he said 
sibley said the radiation technique has been used for some time 
in treating hodgkins disease and its risks are well known and 
minimal 
its probably less toxic than many of the other treatments 
for ms that are being recommended these days sibley said

atlanta police officials are urging the courts 
not to expand facilities for demonstrators during next months 
democratic national convention 
police said thursday it would confound security plans for the 
event 
an umbrella dissident group alternative 88 is suing the city 
of atlanta in us district court for additional space for protests 
near the omni the site of the july 1821 convention 
the city has leased two parking lots covering about two acres 
about half a block from the omni on marietta street several groups 
have applied for parade permits down marietta 
but deputy police chief willie taylor testified the premits were 
denied because demonstrators might chose to lie down in marietta 
street as a form of protest and that would block delegate access to 
the convention hall 
judge orinda evans who is hearing the case without a jury 
continued it until today after two days of testimony

president daniel ortega said secretary 
of state george p shultzs trip to central america could reignite 
nicaraguas civil war and that sandinista troops will be on guard 
despite the renewal of a truce 
ortega said thursday he was extending a unilateral ceasefire 
until july 31 he also proposed new peace talks with the 
usbacked contra rebels which have been fighting the leftist 
government since 1981 
the rebels have not yet replied to his proposal for a new round 
of talks in managua july 2729 
in guatemala city shultz and leaders of the nicaraguan 
resistance on thursday discussed reviving the talks and using a 
carrotandstick approach with the sandinistas 
contra leader alfredo cesar said they talked about offering us 
aid to the sandinistas to induce them to enact promises of 
democratic reforms they also discussed renewed military aid to the 
rebels if the sandinista refused 
contra commander enrique bermudez who met with shultz said the 
ceasefire announcement was not important he said the rebels have 
said all along that they have no intention of resuming the fighting 
but will defend themselves if attacked 
the rebels rejected a similar invitation for june saying the 
nicaraguan capital did not have an atmosphere conducive to 
negotiations 
in a pastoral letter issued earlier this week nicaraguas 
bishops pleaded with the combatants to resurrect the stalled talks 
and heed the nicaraguan peoples heartbreaking clamor for peace 
ortega said shultz had come to central american bearing a 
message loaded with hate for the people of nicaragua directed at 
seeking how to isolate it and seek more resources in congress to 
continue the war against nicaragua 
shultz has criticized nicaragua as a totalitarian society 
during his threeday trip and compared it unfavorably to the 
regions four usbacked democracies costa rica el salvador 
honduras and guatemala 
ortega said many dramatic things can occur in the coming days 
or weeks because something must come of this trip by shultz a 
military escalation 
in washington administration officials have said president 
reagan may ask congress to renew military aid to the contras 
the united states has been funding the nicaraguan rebels since 
1981 but military aid to the contras ran out shortly before the 
peace talks began 
ortega spoke thursday before 1200 military officers and 
announced the truce renewal shortly after returning from an 
official visit to cuba his announcement came just hours before the 
latest in a series of truces with the contras was to run out 
in cuba ortega signed a 150 million assistance agreement under 
which cuba will pardon a 50 million debt and give economically 
crippled nicaragua oil food and technical assistance with sugar 
refineries and an industrial plant 
ortega said the pact shows the willingness of the cuban people 
and government to cooperate with the people and government of 
nicaragua to better face the critical situation that north american 
aggression is imposing on us 
while cuba makes these decisions the american government acts 
in a contrary line he said 
the united states regards cuba and nicaragua as the hemispheres 
prime communist threats and has trade embargoes against both 
nations 
ortega called his decision to extend the truce a demonstration 
of common sense and responsibility because we dont want to give up 
the possibility of a negotiated solution 
but this does not mean that we are going to let down our guard 
because we know that they the contras are not going to keep 
their word and are infiltrating forces from honduras 
the contras and the sandinistas agreed to a 60day truce and 
peace talks on march 23 ortega later renewed the ceasefire and 
the contras agreed to go along since then talks between the two 
sides have broken down and each has accused the other of violating 
the truce

chinese officials handed out cassette players 
today to 18 family planning heroes and urged diligence in stemming 
a new baby boom at a ceremony marking the day of 3 billion in asia 
the day was proclaimed by the asian forum of parliamentarians on 
population and development to draw attention to asia reaching a 
population of 3 billion this year 
speaker after speaker stood up at the great hall of the people 
in central beijing to warn that rapid population growth poses a 
threat to economic development 
we cannot think that we can have more children because of 
economic development nor can we relax our efforts because of 
progress in family planning said hu keshi forum vice chairman 
china has limited most families to one child since the early 
1980s in an attempt to keep its population now 108 billion from 
exceeding 12 billion at the turn of the century 
but the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years and 
officials now tacitly acknowledge that ceiling will be exceeded 
after several years in which the population grew by 11 percent 
annually it soared in 1986 and 1987 to 14 percent as a return to 
family farming and private enterprise inadvertently encouraged 
couples to have more children as potential sources of income 
another reason for the baby boom is that 360 million children 
born during the last boom from 1962 to 1975 have reached 
childbearing age peng peiyun head of the state family planning 
commission told the gathering 
she described chinas population problem as severe and said 
we must take a firm hand and never slacken our efforts 
premier li peng delivered the same message in a speech on 
national television and radio thursday night but noted the task 
will not be easy and population problems cannot be solved within 
a short period of time 
officials have responded to the baby boom by intensifying family 
planning propaganda announcing punishments for local officials 
whose districts exceed their birth quotas and rewarding successful 
officials 
at todays ceremony 18 family planning workers doctors and 
representatives of local districts were given radiocassette 
players for outstanding performance in implementing our 
population policy 
none of the speakers mentioned a growing phenomenon reported 
thursday in the official media in which families and district 
officials fail to register babies that exceed the local quotas 
rendering them official nonpersons such children lack residence 
permits and cannot register for school or receive government ration 
cards for rice and edible oil 
aprodicio laquian a representative of the un fund for 
population activities in beijing said one reason for the boom is 
that local governments often lack the funds to give couples 
promised incentives for having only one child 
the pull of tradition also is strong and many women whose first 
child is a girl have a second in hopes of bearing a son to carry on 
the family line 
but in a speech at the ceremony laquian said chinas efforts 
should be a lesson to other asian countries with higher growth 
rates such as bangladesh at 261 percent and indonesia at 174 
percent 
he said india growing at 172 percent per year likely will 
surpass china as the worlds most populous country by the year 2050

jack and lorna rhine dryland farmers 
who depend solely on rainfall feel almost guilty talking about 
their thriving wheat fields while farmers in the droughtstricken 
midwest and south pray for rain 
they lose and we gain someone has to suffer to make anything 
now jack rhine said 
around them farms are dustchoked but the rhines have enjoyed 
more than double the usual rainfall for this time of year and are 
looking forward to one of their best winter wheat harvests ever in 
addition they stand to benefit from wheat prices driven up by crop 
damage elsewhere 
were just abundant and you go 100 miles southeast of here 
and its dry said rhine on wednesday 
abundance for the rhines means 6 or 7 inches of rain in the last 
two months compared to about 3 inches during those months most 
years and an average annual rainfall of about 14 inches 
so far this year they also have managed to escape the hailstorms 
that can wipe out a wheat field in an hour 
the rhines 3000 acres lie about 40 miles east of denver and 
the rocky mountains a single dry creek runs across the property 
the only water their wheat gets comes from rainfall and the rhines 
are more susceptible to moisture levels than farmers who irrigate 
rhine vice president of the adams county farm bureau said most 
farms along the front range are faring well this year a string of 
90degreeplus days in the middle of june caused some heat stress 
he said but not as much as in areas farther east and south 
the rhines plan to harvest their wheat in two to three weeks a 
couple of weeks earlier than usual they expect to get 35 bushels 
per acre near the limit the thin soil can produce rhine said 
on wednesday the rhines had to stop tilling a fallow field when 
the tractor wheels began kicking up clods of mud after a midday 
rain shower 
this is more like hawaii or florida weather than colorado 
said mrs rhine 
the rhines havent always been so lucky jack rhine 57 lived 
in the same area in 1935 and remembers his wheatfarmer father 
scraping by growing just enough food to feed the family while the 
fields turned to dust 
the rhines got their own farm in 1954 a year that brought a 
poor harvest they recall floods that washed away their crops hail 
that damaged their fields and more than a few dry spells 
in the last five or six years wheat cost more to grow than it 
was worth at market they say and they lost some extra revenue 
when two oil wells on their property went bust a few years ago 
rhine said that thanks to the drought in much of the country 
wheat prices which recently topped 4 a bushel likely will stay 
higher than the 325 to 350 he invests per bushel 
other parts of colorado havent escaped the drought and 
scorching temperatures which come on the heels of a dry fall and 
winter colorado state university agronomist jim echols has 
predicted the states winter wheat crop could be reduced by as much 
as 25 percent 
the drought helps us but its really a disaster for those 
people said rhine i dont think a person should brag very 
much because it really isnt a very fair thing its worked 
just the opposite other times

the nations largest maker of woodstoves 
threw a party to mark the demise of its popular defiant model the 
victim of environmental regulations effective today that require 
new stoves to burn more cleanly 
the defiant is a symbol of the end of an era vermont 
castings inc chairman duncan syme said thursday calling the 
woodstove his companys answer to the model t 
syme decided to forego the gnashing of teeth and complaints 
about government regulation instead his company designed some new 
stoves and threw a big party for the companys retiring mainstay 
born in 1975 of the energy crisis a backtotheland ethic and 
a desire by many to thumb their noses at opec and the big oil 
companies the defiant quickly became a symbol of a lifestyle more 
than 130000 stoves have been sold 
syme was an architect who was trying in the early 70s to 
integrate woodstoves into some of his designs we looked around 
and didnt see any good ones he said 
he got together with his now deceased brotherinlaw murray 
howell a wall street investment banker 
we sensed that there was a consumer need for a goodlooking 
stove on which you could open the doors and celebrate this thing 
of bringing flame into your livingroom syme said 
they caught the markets wave just before it swelled and the 
company became an overnight success sales have declined since the 
heyday but syme said the company has settled into a comfortable 
niche marketing colorful new stoves often to upscale city dwellers 
and suburbanites who want a livingroom showpiece 
thanks to the defiant vermont castings grew to become the 
nations largest woodstove manufacturer and now employs about 400 
people most of them at plants in randolph and nearby bethel 
responding to environmental concerns over woodsmoke pollution 
and the new regulations the company has introduced two new models 
designed to cut down on particulates and some of the gasses in 
woodsmoke 
the new epa rules require stove makers to cut particulates in 
smoke by 77 percent effective today and by 81 percent from the 
pre1988 standard in 1990 vermont castings officials wary of a 
patchwork of regulations in states concerned about winter haze 
helped the epa devise the new rules said david kimbell the 
companys vice president for marketing 
the new stoves meet the standards by burning wood more 
efficiently kimbell said adding that the company has been working 
with a catalytic combuster designed to burn most of the woodsmoke 
syme 50 who wore a straw hat and bow tie thursday as he 
addressed the crowd of vermont dignitaries company employees and 
dealers who milled about among balloons ale and other props under 
yellowandwhitestriped party tents 
this is like a commencement he said its as if weve had 
a fun time together these last four years in the ivy halls and 
i think were on the threshold of a new and exciting future

rural satellite dish owners moved one step 
closer to legally receiving cable television programming with a 
house subcommittee vote approving a bill giving independent 
distributors rights to sell the scrambled programming 
the bill was approved thursday by a narrow 1311 vote of the 
house energy and commerce telecommunications subcommittee with 
many supporters saying they would prefer the industry work out its 
own solution 
we are not convinced there is a true marketplace at work 
said committee chairman rep edward j markey dmass 
under the bill approved 1311 any cable programmer that sells 
its programming to at least one distributor other than a cable 
operator would have to make that programming available to all other 
distributors 
congress has been concerned that some cable programmers have 
been unwilling to sell their programming to thirdparty 
distributors thus shutting out potential competitors 
but the fate of this legislation rests as much in the hand of 
the affected industries as it does in the hand of congress 
markey said

massachusetts republicans criticized gov michael 
s dukakis for campaigning for president out of state the day the 
states fiscal year ended with a nearly 400 million deficit and no 
new budget in sight 
the dukakis administration has acknowledged that the state 
government was technically 397 million short of funds for fiscal 
1988 which ended thursday due to an unexpected slowdown in tax 
payments and the cost of courtordered corporate tax abatements 
the shortfall comes at an awkward time for dukakis the probable 
democratic presidential nominee who has stressed his managerial 
skills on the campaign trail for the last several years 
massachusetts has had only budget surpluses 
to address the problem the governor filed a supplemental budget 
with the legislature containing a 20point plan to tap cash 
reserves and make bookkeeping adjustments to close the 397 million 
gap 
but house minority leader steven pierce charged thursday that it 
was inconceivable that the democratic governor would be out of 
state campaigning with the budget crisis unresolved 
dukakis spokesman steve crawford said the governor would be 
working in his office today saturday and possibly monday 
he is in constant contact with his office his chief of staff 
and his secretary of administration and finance are regularly 
discussing the budget process with legislative leaders crawford 
said 
in recent years the state government has often gone several 
days or even weeks into a new fiscal year without a budget which 
must be balanced under the state constitution 
administration and finance secretary frank keefe said the 
government could keep functioning without a budget through 
wednesday when millions of dollars in checks must be issued to 
cover the state payroll welfare payments and other obligations 
lawmakers are nearing final approval of a series of tax bills 
and feeraising measures that would help pay for expanded state 
spending projected for fiscal 1989 
meanwhile thursday the state revenue department was busy 
opening envelopes in a drive to collect every possible tax dollar 
that can be attributed to fiscal 1988 to help cover the 397 
million deficit 
for the coming year the house and senate have endorsed separate 
budgets that call for spending approximately 118 billion or 
about 8 percent more than fiscal 1988 but the two versions differ 
in details and a team of negotiators plans to work through tuesday 
on a compromise 
dukakis and the democratic legislative leaders have agreed on a 
spending target of 118 billion next year and they have embarked 
on a program of at least 200 million in higher taxes fines and 
fees to support the higher spending 
dukakis already has signed a 40 million cigarette tax measure 
the house passed and sent to the senate three more revenue bills 
that would raise another 163 million by bringing the state income 
tax back into conformance with federal rules by closing a 
corporate tax loophole raising fines for traffic violations 
increasing wetlands filing fees and claiming unclaimed soft drink 
and beer bottle deposits 
republicans have charged that dukakis is knowingly 
overestimating state revenues in order to claim that the budget is 
in balance

some doctors and other health workers 
exposed to the aids virus are taking the drug azt as a preventive 
measure despite potentially serious side effects associated with 
the antiaids medication 
azt the only federally approved antiaids drug can cause 
muscle aches nausea headaches and severe anemia additionally 
medical experts have mixed opinions about using azt now known as 
zidovudine to prevent infection after exposure 
dr julie gerberding of san francisco general hospital said she 
is often asked whether the side effects of azt outweigh the chances 
of infection after a health worker is pricked with an aidstainted 
needle 
ive been bombarded with calls from health care workers around 
the country said gerberding who is directing a study on the 
risk of aids infection among health workers 
researchers believe azt may keep the aids virus from installing 
itself on the genetic material of cells if the drug is taken soon 
after exposure thus preventing aids infection however the 
medical community is split over whether the drug should be 
administered before a patient develops aids symptoms 
dr paul volberding an aids authority at san francisco general 
said the odds of aids infection in a health care worker with a deep 
cut who comes in contact with the virus may run as high as one in 
100 he said 22 health workers worldwide have become accidentally 
infected 
last month burroughs wellcome co the only maker of azt began 
a nationwide study of health workers accidentally exposed to the 
virus 
karen collins a spokeswoman for the drug company said workers 
are required to enroll within five days of exposure half will 
receive a sixweek supply of the drug free of charge and half will 
get a placebo she said 
researchers at the national institutes of health in bethesda 
md said thursday they are seeking approval from the federal food 
and drug administration for a similar study that could start within 
a month the nih study which would concentrate on workers facing 
massive exposures to the virus would not use placebos said 
debbie katz who is coordinating the project 
gerberding said she knew two workers at her hospital who took 
azt after being exposed to the aids virus through tainted blood 
william owen a doctor in private practice who treats aids 
patients said he prescribed the drug to a surgeon who cut his hand 
with a scalpel while operating on a patient with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
since patients may acquire azt through their personal 
physicians the number of people taking the drug as a preventive 
measure is not known 
like everything else with aids its quasiunderground said 
dr june fisher who runs the citys center of municipal 
occupational safety and health a health clinic 
volberding said he has enough faith in the drugs efficacy that 
he could not in good conscience advise aidsexposed workers to 
enroll in the burroughs wellcome study because hed be afraid they 
would get the placebo 
however dr martin hirsch of massachusetts general hospital 
said if he was accidentally exposed to the virus he probably would 
enroll in the burroughs wellcome study rather than take the drug on 
his own

a 2yearold who was kidnapped as a 
baby and adopted by an israeli couple returned home clutching her 
brazilian parents and a teddy bear 
her mother said she would someday allow her child to decide if 
she wants to meet her adoptive parents in israel even though her 
lawyer said the tel aviv couple knew something was amiss in the 
adoption 
bruna vasconcelos arrived thursday at sao paulos international 
airport with her parents rosilda and luis vasconcelos on a flight 
from london they had stopped there en route from tel aviv 
i feel as if bruna and i never had been separated that she 
was never kidnapped the childs mother told reporters while the 
brownhaired girl played with their tape recorders and microphones 
the child also smiled and waved 
the vasconcelos twoyear ordeal started oct 13 1986 when 
their child then 4 months old was abducted from their home in the 
southern city of curitiba one year later the child was located in 
israel and the couple regained custody after a court battle with 
her adoptive parents 
asked if she would one day allow bruna to visit her former 
adoptive parents mrs vasconcelos said when she is older i 
will tell her the whole story of what happened to her then she 
will be able to decide on her own whether or not she wants to see 
them again 
shortly after arriving back in brazil the child dressed in a 
green jump suit romped through the baggageclaim area rode the 
conveyor belt and wheeled around a pushcart occasionally she 
interrupted her play to embrace her parents 
the family later boarded a plane for curitiba where parana 
state authorities planned a big reception and meeting with gov 
alvaro dias 
at a brief news conference held in the airports press room 
mrs vasconcelos looking tired but composed held bruna on her lap 
and said i never doubted i would be reunited with my daughter 
its a marvelous feeling having her back and i owe it all to my 
faith in god luck persistence and the many people who helped me 
police say brunas kidnapping was the work of one of many 
babytrafficking rings that abduct or buy infants from mothers in 
poor areas and sell them for hefty profits to childless foreign 
couples 
adoption by foreigners is legal in brazil but it is a 
timeconsuming bureaucratic process that sometimes takes several 
years with phony or even legitimate papers obtained through 
corrupt officials the babytrafficking rings can arrange an 
adoption within weeks police say 
the israeli couple who adopted bruna yaacov and simone 
turgeman paid 25000 to intermediaries but said they acted in 
good faith believing the high fee and documents were legal 
but shimon schuber the israeli lawyer who helped the brazilian 
couple get their daughter back said the turgemans may not have 
known bruna had been kidnapped but they certainly knew something 
was fishy they knew the documents were phony 
schuber who accompanied bruna back to brazil said they had 
to know something was illegal about the whole thing no one goes to 
paraguay to adopt a brazilian child and thinks its all legal 
almost immediately after her abduction bruna was taken across 
the border to neighboring paraguay where she was handed over to 
the turgemans 
about one year afterward bruna was located near tel aviv her 
parents contacted brazilian authorities for help in getting her 
back and earlier this month the israeli supreme court decided she 
should be returned to her parents in brazil 
mrs vasconcelos said that at first her relationship with the 
turgemans was just fine they seemed understanding and were 
willing to cooperate but later the relationship deteriorated 
she declined to say why 
olavo de souza a curitiba radio reporter who covered the story 
in israel for more than a month said the relationship soured when 
the israeli couple tried to convince the vasconceloses to abandon 
the idea of taking bruna home 
when they saw the vasconceloses would not consider such a 
proposition they filed an appeal in the supreme court to postpone 
brunas return but the court turned them down souza said 
mrs vasconcelos said the turgemans treated her daughter well 
but the way they raised her was nothing special she said 
they didnt do anything i would not do

a novice nun abducted by her family from a 
renegade catholic convent says she wasnt kidnapped and doesnt 
want to press charges but a convent official accused the womans 
parents of brainwashing her 
mary susan greve 22 also known as sister mary cecilia 
voluntarily appeared at the hamilton county sheriffs department 
thursday with her parents james and susan and the familys lawyer 
she expressed to us that she has no animosity or any bad 
feeling toward members of her family or anyone else and that she 
is where she is with her parents because she wants to be where 
she is said raymond hulgin chief of detectives 
misdemeanor charges have been filed in new york state against 
four of her relatives for the alleged abduction sunday police did 
not arrest the family members because the charges are misdemeanors 
from another state 
ms greve a novice at st joseph novitiate convent for 20 
months was allegedly pushed into a waiting car by her brother 
david as she walked with two nuns on a street near the convent in 
roundtop ny 
hulgin said the parents told police they took their daughter 
because they were upset by a lack of communication with the 
convent which calls itself a traditionalist roman catholic 
convent the sect holds services in latin and rejects the liberal 
teachings of the second vatican council of the 1960s 
the sect called the society of st pius v split from the 
recognized catholic traditionalist society of st pius x in 1983 
over philosophical differences the sect is not recognized by the 
roman catholic church 
a tape of the local police interview with ms greve has been 
mailed to new york state police who will use it to decide whether 
to drop charges hulgin said 
ms greve appeared to be clearheaded and comfortable during the 
interview hulgin said 
she seemed to be in total control of herself she had no 
reservations about speaking to us he said she was very 
cooperative she gave us no firm commitment as to what her future 
intentions were 
despite ms greves statement to police the convents spiritual 
adviser the rev clarence kelly said thursday he was not 
convinced she was acting on her own 
i would like to talk to her without her parents present to 
determine in fact that she is acting according to her own free 
will kelly said 
there was no question about the force used in her abduction 
now she is being held in captivity for a number of days im afraid 
theyve subjected her to some type of brainwashing he said 
in april the family took ms greve from the convent for a 
medical checkup but a nun was waiting for them in cincinnati and 
persuaded ms greve to return to the convent said her brother john

city officials have pulled the plug 
at least temporarily on two entrepreneurs who want to reintroduce 
the electric rolling chair to atlantic citys famed boardwalk 
antique wicker rolling chairs that now transport tourists down 
the wooden way are pushed by hand for a fee but ernest english and 
stuart mcginnis discovered that mechanical chairs were popular 
several decades ago and want to restore them in an updated version 
they recently bought all 100 dormant licenses for electrically 
propelled rolling chairs from the city then they created a 
prototype of a new chair a version that looks more like an 
enlongated covered golf cart than the wicker original 
thats when the rolling chair war began 
its a power play english said rolling chairs can earn 
about 350 a day so its a money thing i understand that over 40 
people came in this week looking for electric chair licenses weve 
become a commodity that everyone wants 
atlantic citys legal definition of a rolling chair contained 
in a 1950 ordinance is a wheeled vehicle for hire for the 
transportation of two or three people a later ordinance restricts 
their length to 88 inches or slightly more than seven feet 
the prototype electric chair introduced by english and mcginnis 
is 10 feet long and seats five plus the driver 
city officials pulled the partners licenses thursday ordering 
the new contraption off the boardwalk after only four days in

the nations largest group of doctors says 
physicians as a last resort must breach their centuriesold 
tradition of confidentiality by warning the sexual partners of 
those infected with the aids virus 
the move during thursdays final session of the american medical 
association convention was part of a package of tough policies for 
battling the aids epidemic including calls for mandatory testing 
of prison inmates and expanded programs for intravenous drug users 
this is a landmark in the history of medical ethics said 
dr james e davis the new president of the ama 
we are saying for the first time that because of the danger 
to the public health and the danger to unknowing partners who may 
be contaminated with this lethal disease the physician may be 
required to violate patient confidentiality 
however another ama official said the policy was not new 
this is a restatement of a position the ama has had for at 
least a half a year and possibly as long as a year said dr m 
roy schwarz chairman of the amas aids task force and the 
associations assistant executive vice president for medical 
education and science 
the amas 420member house of delegates said thursday that as 
the first course of action a physician should try to persuade a 
patient infected with the aids virus to notify his sexual partners 
if the patient refuses the doctor should report him to the 
local public health department so that health officials can warn 
his sexual partners a practice called contact tracing 
and if that fails the doctor should tell the people who are 
at risk directly said schwarz 
although the tradition of doctorpatient confidentiality goes 
back to the hippocratic oath schwarz said the landmark 
decision if there is one is that this is the first time somebody 
has called for contact tracing in every jurisdiction 
dr james sammons executive vice president of the 
295000member medical association said contact tracing at least 
in the heterosexual community has the potential to substantially 
reduce the proliferation and spread of aids 
sammons said tracing had been effective at reducing other 
sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea 
dr don chaplin a delegate from burlington nc warned that 
doctors must protect the identities of aids victims 
i caution us to be very careful to do anything we can to 
protect confidentiality and to fight any discrimination because it 
would thwart our efforts to bring this disease under control 
chaplin said 
the notification policy was attacked by a gayrights group 
which said it could make aids patients or those who suspect they 
have been exposed to the disease wary of seeking treatment 
according to a report in the new york times 
if patients feel doctors are going to rat on them whether 
theyre homosexual or heterosexual theyre not going to go to 
their doctors said thomas b stoddard executive director of the 
lamda legal defense and education fund in new york 
the ama also said that in conjunction with the notification 
policy it would back legislation to grant immunity to doctors in 
states with strict patient confidentiality laws 
the ama also called for mandatory aids testing of inmates 
because of the problems of intravenous drug use and homosexuality 
in prisons practices that spread the disease 
the ama adopted a similar proposal last year and reaffirmed it 
thursday despite objections from several doctors that it would 
accomplish little 
the delegates also called on federal and state governments to 
expand treatment programs for intravenous drug users because they 
pose the greatest danger for the further spread of aids into the 
heterosexual population 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the bodys ability 
to fight disease it is fatal and incurable 
before adjourning its fiveday convention the delegates also 
approved policies aimed at prohibiting athletes from using 
steroids posting health warnings on tanning booths urging 
airlines to ban smoking on all domestic flights and evaluating 
whether health warnings should be required on alcoholic beverages

the state senate defeated a bill to create 
a holiday honoring slain civil rights leader martin luther king 
jr a proposal that touched off widespread criticism of former 
gov evan mecham when he opposed it 
the king measure fell two votes short of the 16 needed in the 
30member republicancontrolled senate 
two republicans who initially supported the bill john mawhinney 
of tucson and carol macdonald of safford voted against it thursday 
in what they said was a protest against heavyhanded efforts by 
democrats to force a vote on the issue 
i dont vote for extortion mrs macdonald said 
tucson democrat jaime gutierrez said he believed that they voted 
against the bill because they both face tough reelection fights 
and do not want to alienate conservatives 
democratic gov rose mofford had campaigned for the bill and 
still could try to designate a holiday by executive proclamation 
but republican attorney general bob corbin has said such a move 
would be illegal and could subject a governor who tried it to legal 
costs 
thengov evan mecham a republican in 1987 cited corbins 
advice when he rescinded such a proclamation made by mechams 
predecessor democrat bruce babbitt for a king holiday for state 
executive branch workers 
the move incited nationwide criticism of mecham who was 
eventually impeached and removed from office on unrelated charges 
babbitt a former attorney general himself has insisted such a 
proclamation is legal 
mrs mofford has repeatedly refused to say what she would do if 
lawmakers did not enact the measure gubernatorial chief of staff 
george cunningham said after thursdays vote that she was still 
studying options that included calling lawmakers back into special 
session on the measure or going ahead with a proclamation 
senate president carl kunasek had blocked the king measure from 
coming to the floor all session and democrats demanded a chance to 
vote on it as part of their price for supporting a tax bill needed 
to help eliminate a projected budget shortfall

mikhail s gorbachev made an emotional plea for 
his proposals to redistribute power in the soviet union 
emphasizing that political change is essential if his economic 
reform is to succeed where similar attempts failed 
he took the floor for the second time before 5000 delegates at 
the communist party conference he called to assess his reform 
program 
in his 40minute speech thursday gorbachev suggested that 
soviet socialism will die if his proposals to restore more real 
power to local legislative councils are blocked 
society is waiting for it he said the whole of socialism 
is waiting for it 
soviet president andrei a gromyko criticized by some delegates 
thursday for having fallen behind the times opened todays 
session soviet television reported without giving details 
pollution was among the topics raised today fyodor morgun the 
head of the soviet unions new environmental protection agency 
said the rush to build giant factories had destroyed fertile soil 
ruined forests raised air pollution above healthly levels and 
contaminated water supplies 
those who created these problems should be identified and give 
their due morgun said his remarks to the closeddoor session of 
the first party conference in 47 years were carried by tass the 
official news agency 
gorbachevs speech ate into the schedule of a conference where 
only 47 delegates of 261 who asked for the floor have spoken 
officials originally said the gathering would end today 
also breaking into the schedule was a conflict over the 
reformist journal ogonyoks allegations that certain delegates from 
the central asian republic of uzbekistan took bribes 
uzbekistans party chief in an apparent reference to the 
magazines editor vitaly korotich countered that demagogues are 
operating under the cover of perestroika the name gorbachev 
has given his plans for reform 
among those waiting to speak an official said is boris n 
yeltsin ousted as party boss in moscow last fall for criticizing 
the slow pace of reform 
a moscow area delegate demanded yeltsin be given the floor so 
the conference could hear his views 
in his speech thursday gorbachev said that a call he made in 
his first speech tuesday for vesting real power in legislative 
councils known as soviets had been misunderstood 
we do not abandon the leading role of the ruling party in the 
country gorbachev said on the contrary we emphasize it 
gorbachev proposed tuesday that local party heads should be 
elected chairmen of the soviets in a secret ballot 
the proposal seemed designed to ensure that the communist party 
retains its traditional control over soviet society but operates 
through a forum elected by the people rather than a government 
executive body 
under the proposed reforms party leaders of all ranks will 
be selected in secret ballot multicandidate elections 
gorbachev did not say if this would apply to his own post of 
general secretary nor whether he would stand for the proposed new 
post of president to be elected by a proposed 2250member congress 
of deputies 
in thursdays speech gorbachev recalled how earlier economic 
reforms in the 1950s and 1960s were swallowed up because there 
was no accompanying political change 
his perestroika could go the same way without political 
reform gorbachev indicated 
doubt lack of confidence that would be the greatest gifts to 
the opponents of perestroika he said 
socialism lenin that is the creative activity of the 
masses he said but that activity will die unless we reform 
the political system 
earlier gorbachev broke into a speech by a delegate who said 
people feel party stalwarts cannot work under gorbachevs reforms 
if they previously carried out the nowdiscredited policies of 
leonid i brezhnev who died in 1982 
maybe you have some concrete suggestions gorbachev asked 
delegate vladimir melnikov from his position on the dais were 
sitting here and dont know is he talking about me or somebody 
else 
i was referring first of all to comrade solomentsev and to 
comrades gromyko afanasyev and arbatov replied melnikov head 
of the party in the komi region of siberia 
the exchange was shown on national television in an extremely 
rare attack on named members of the ruling politburo such 
criticism has not surfaced despite the recent growing independence 
of the soviet press 
gromyko and another politburo member mikhail s solomentsev 
have been members of the policymaking central committee since the 
1960s georgy a arbatov one of the soviet unions foremost 
experts on american affairs has headed the usa and canada 
institute since 1967 
there are at least two delegates with the surname afanasyev one 
is viktor g afanasyev editor of the communist party daily pravda 
since 1976

the owners of blitz a prize bull should 
not be compensated for the bulls death or the loss of his valuable 
semen a jury has decided 
alvene and emily leinweber had sued ed and karen hinnenkamp for 
150000 claiming blitz was fatally wounded in 1983 while 
defending his herd against a trespassing hereford owned by the 
defendants 
the leinwebers claimed blitz was the foundation of their 
breeding business palouse pinzgauer breeders 11 miles north of 
colfax they said blitz had to be put to sleep months after the 
alleged fight since he couldnt stand up long enough to have his 
semen extracted 
blitzs semen cost about 20 a sample and was sold throughout 
the united states the leinwebers said 
the hinnenkamps acknowledged their bull broke out of its pasture 
and flirted with blitzs cows but denied it attacked blitz 
after an eightday civil trial in whitman county superior court 
jurors decided wednesday the hinnenkamps were not liable for their 
herefords rambling nor were they negligent for not preventing the 
bulls activity 
the decision came despite an earlier plea from the leinwebers 
attorney linda schaubleruff to award damages 
the leinwebers are approaching their golden years and were 
looking forward to the financial comfort blitz could have given 
them she told jurors but that cant happen now theyve got 
only 800 units of semen left to hoard 
gary libey the hinnenkamps attorney said blitz could have 
died from accidents other than a fight he suggested blitz may have 
simply overexerted himself while mating injuring both hind legs

despite gloomy reports of drought damage 
to the nations breadbasket the midwest is far from a basket case 
and the final impact of the dry spell remains unclear experts say 
people are ready to write the whole midwest off said jerald 
barnard director of the university of iowas institute of economic 
research i think theres a reason to have some moderation in 
this 
were not likely to see a disaster on one side and were 
also not likely to see the crops come through unscathed he said 
in a telephone interview thursday from his iowa city office 
at iowa state university in ames researchers at the center for 
agricultural and rural development said that because of the great 
variation in the droughts impact it could be disastrous for some 
farmers and beneficial to others it recommended any government 
relief programs target assistance to just those farmers hurt by the 
drought 
crop farmers who lose all or almost all of their crops will 
suffer obvious losses said william meyers the centers 
associate director livestock producers are caught in a tight 
squeeze higher feed and forage prices cause early marketings that 
are reducing current livestock prices 
however farmers whose crops are less affected by the drought 
will gain significantly from higher crop prices as will those who 
have grain in storage said meyers 
meanwhile a federal reserve bank analyst in chicago backed away 
from an earlier warning that the drought could cut short a recovery 
by farm banks 
farmers look like they have some staying power farm bankers 
too said george gregorash banking analysis officer of the fed 
of chicago who surveyed agricultural banks in iowa wisconsin 
northern illinois and northern indiana 
just two weeks earlier in preparing an annual review of midwest 
farm banks gregorash made a more dismal assessment saying the 
drought could make the 1987 gains shortlived 
but after surveying bankers this week gregorash said the 
news is fairly good 
all of the analysts say the droughts final impact remains 
unknown and point to the huge fluctuations in commodity markets 
each time rain falls in the farm belt or is even forecast as signs 
of the uncertainty 
changing weather is likely to result in wide swings in prices 
between now and harvest said stanley johnson director of the 
center at isu 
isu said the best that can be hoped for through a shift to 
ideal conditions for the rest of the growing season is average 
national corn yields dropping 156 percent to 100 bushels an acre 
soybeans dropping 91 percent to 30 bushels an acre and wheat 
dropping 6 percent to 36 bushels an acre 
average normal yields are 118 bushels an acre of corn 33 of 
soybeans and 383 of wheat said research associate patrick 
westhoff 
the most severe forecast comparable to a drought like that of 
dust bowl days would reduce corn yields by 40 percent soybeans by 
27 percent and wheat by about 15 percent 
a moderate scenario based on a slight intensifying of current 
drought conditions would fall midway between the best and worst 
outlook and would reflect conditions as severe as any drought of 
the past 25 years westhoff said

khmer rouge guerrillas planted 
explosives that injured 33 people in cambodias capital last year 
and tried to blow up a strategic bridge there in 1984 a vietnamese 
army officer said today 
col dinh nhu ninh commander of an elite unit assigned to 
protect phnom penh provided a rare disclosure of guerrilla 
infiltrations 
but he said the capital has been very secure since vietnam 
invaded cambodia in late 1978 and set up a provietnamese 
government he dismissed the khmer rouge the main guerrilla 
infiltrators as leftovers of an army that was beaten up and 
became bandits 
ninh said the last members of his unit 1200 men returned home 
on june 6 as part of vietnams plan to withdraw 50000 troops or 
half its force in cambodia by the end of the year 
vietnam says its military command and all military advisers 
returned home on thursday turning responsibility for the war over 
to cambodian officers 
about 50000 cambodians according to official count turned out 
on the streets of their capital as about 300 vietnamese commanders 
left phnom penh and flew to ho chi minh city formerly saigon 
hanoi acknowledged it lost 25000 men in the war but most of 
the fighting was away from the capital ninh said that no 
vietnamese soldiers had been killed in phnom penh since he took up 
his post in january 1979 there were no major attacks on the city 
and most intrusions were on its outskirts he said 
vietnams army rarely provides details of operations the only 
reports of guerrilla infiltration into phnom penh have come from 
highly exaggerated khmer rouge claims or sketchy accounts from a 
few western aid officials 
fanatic khmer rouge communists killed millions of people when 
they ruled cambodia from 1975 until the vietnamese invasion 
ninh spoke with foreign journalists invited to cover the 
vietnamese pullout 
he said the worst period was from march 23 to july 20 last year 
when khmer rouge agents planted 44 chinesemade explosives on the 
outskirts of the city the plasticcovered bombs about 4 inches in 
diameter and 1 inches wide exploded when touched he said 
the intention was to scare people he said they laid the 
explosives in the peoples water tanks bus terminals staircases 
of peoples houses or on the road 
ninh said 33 people all civilians were wounded including six 
vietnamese living in cambodia 
the leader of the saboteurs a khmer rouge battalion commander 
was sentenced to death and another suspect a khmer rouge 
underground activist sentenced to life imprisonment ninh said 
authorities also captured 15 others whom the khmer rouge had 
paid 500 for each bomb they placed he said they received shorter 
jail terms or were put in political reeducation camps 
he said the second most serious attack was the firing of two 
h12 rockets into the city on dec 27 1986 both crashed into 
paddy fields causing no injuries and a khmer rouge operative who 
launched the rockets was captured he said 
ninh also said six khmer rouge operatives were caught in an 
abortive plot to blow up the son ngoc bridge the capitals 
biggest which links its eastern and western sectors the plot was 
organized in 1983 and explosives were to be planted in early 1984 
he said 
ninh said the chief plotter mon ly was sentenced to death and 
the five others were given prison terms or probation 
while ninh said guerrillarelated incidents in phnom penh were 
declining he did not discount claims by diplomats that the khmer 
rouge was lying low to prepare for attacks in 1990 when vietnam 
says its last soldiers will leave cambodia 
he said some cambodians in phnom penh reacted to this years 
pullout with apprehension about the return of the khmer rouge 
ninh said guerrillas also conduct limited psychological warfare 
in phnom penh distributing handwritten leaflets saying that 
khmer cambodians should not fight khmer the khmer should fight 
the vietnamese 
the vietnamese colonel said military intelligence indicated the 
khmer rouge exaggerated its strength in referring to division 
18 the unit that was behind the 1986 rocket attack and the 1987 
explosions 
a division should have about 10000 soldiers he said but 
they have only 250 people and call themselves a division nonsense 
they dont have any strategy or tactics

a lawmaker belonging to the ruling 
nationalist party charged today that a cabinet official sought to 
protect premier yu kuohwa by covering up a bribe attempt 
the allegation was the latest in a series of accusations 
launched against yu by lawmaker wu yunghsiung 
next week the nationalist party will hold a key party congress 
during which the premiers conservative policies may come under 
attack by younger politicians 
opinion polls indicate yu 74 is not as popular as other taiwan 
leaders and some nationalist lawmakers have called for his 
resignation 
wu claimed that wang changching secretary general of the 
cabinet was ordered to bribe him on yus behalf 
the lawmaker claimed tuesday that yu told wang to pay 11360 to 
silence wu from attacking the premier during sessions of the 
legislative yuan taiwans highest lawmaking body 
wu has repeatedly accused yu of having an affair with a 
prostitute but has failed to provide details other than a womans 
name yu has denied the allegation 
wang has denied that the money he paid wu was a bribe he said 
the cash was a personal gift to help finance the lawmakers trip to 
visit labor welfare programs in japan and the united states 
newspapers have reported that wus accusation has embarrassed 
yus supporters as well as his opponents who fear that the 
allegations may be interpreted as part of a plot to force yu to 
step down 
today wu displayed a bundle of cash he claimed was handed to 
him by wang in april he said he repaid the money tuesday by check 
but did not make clear why he had waited two months 
wu said he used his own money for the trip to japan and the 
united states 
the lawmaker refused to answer questions today as he left the 
legislative yuan other than to deny that his accusations were part 
of a plot to topple yu 
yu said at a weekly cabinet meeting thursday that he was not 
aware of wangs payment to wu

workers at eight cemeteries ratified a 
new contract ending a monthlong strike that forced funeral parlors 
to store hundreds of bodies awaiting burial but a strike continued 
at nine other cemeteries 
the 71 eastbay members of cemetery workers and greens attendants 
local 265 approved the pact thursday and were scheduled to return 
to work today union officials said 
the settlement does not affect a strike by workers at nine 
cemeteries on the san francisco peninsula who also walked off the 
job may 30 there are no talks scheduled in that dispute which 
involves about 87 workers 
no details of the eastbay settlement were immediately available 
the major issue that prompted the strike was the cemetery owners 
use of contract workers to do jobs that local 265 officials said 
should be performed by union members 
the striking workers included gravediggers gardeners and 
maintenance personnel 
cemetery owners attorney john cantwell said he was unsure how 
many burials have been delayed by the strike in 1985 a sixweek 
strike by the same union local resulted in more than 800 bodies 
going unburied during the walkout

officials today denied western reports that 
police killed several peasants and brutally beat others who tried 
to stop the release of polluted water from a reservoir near beijing 
the official xinhua news agency late thursday issued the first 
official report of the june 21 protest during which peasants tried 
to stop a petrochemical company from releasing contaminated waste 
water from a reservoir into a local stream 
the peasants said the water would poison their wells and crops 
officials said the water level in the reservoir had risen too high 
and that there was danger of flooding 
wang zuoseng local communist party secretary criticized 
foreign reporting of the protest and accused western reporters of 
violating government regulations this week when they visited the 
reservoir in guce village 
authorities there turned away some western reporters this week 
and confiscated film and audio tapes 
guce which is under the beijing municipal administration is 37 
miles southwest of the city center 
wang cited the same regulation that was used last october to 
expel 14 western reporters from tibet following violent 
proindependence antichinese riots by tibetans in lhasa 
the regulation requires foreign reporters to apply for 
permission when traveling to report in areas open to foreigners 
reporters previously had interpreted it to apply to places outside 
beijing and officials have never before invoked it in greater 
beijing 
the new interpretation would significantly widen the scope of 
the regulation and severely limit foreign reporting in china 
at todays news conference wang said the july 21 protest was 
much smaller than peasant witnesses have said he denied witness 
accounts that thousands of armed police were brought in and scores 
of peasants were badly hurt 
villagers told the associated press on thursday that more than 
1500 farmers clashed with at least 2000 armed police and 60 to 
70 protestors were seriously injured when police beat them with 
nightsticks and used electric cattle prods 
some villagers told western reporters that three people were 
killed but those who spoke to the ap said they could not confirm 
any deaths 
what youre talking about is what a small number of people are 
saying i was at the site i can assure you that there were no more 
than 500 farmers wang said he said about 200 unarmed local 
police were at the scene 
he denied that anyone was killed or seriously injured but said 
some people might have been slightly hurt during the scuffle 
villagers also said 150 people were arrested the day of the 
protest and that 10 remained in custody but wang said only five 
people were being interrogated he said they have not been formally 
arrested or charged 
he did not say if others had been detained and released 
the waste stored in the niukou reservoir came from the 
stateowned yanshan petrochemical co wang said it was produced 
after the plant dismantled its old waste treatment equipment and 
before it had installed new equipment 
wang said he did not know what chemicals were in the water or 
what affect they could have on human health and crops 
by midjune the water in the reservoir had risen to a dangerous 
level and had to be released to avoid flooding he said beijing is 
having its annual rainy season 
wang said the petrochemical company will compensate the farmers 
for all losses they suffer in their summer wheat harvest and for 60 
percent of losses of their autumn grain crop

fortythree years after he died in 
selfimposed exile in new york the remains of composer bela bartok 
are on the way to reburial in his native hungary 
the remains left england today on the second stage of their 
journey the liner queen elizabeth 2 which brought the remains 
here from the united states on thursday set sail at 1133 am for 
cherbourg france and was expected to arrive there seven hours 
later 
in cherbourg the brownpainted sealed wooden box will be put 
on a train to begin a slow fiveday journey through france west 
germany and austria 
memorial concerts were scheduled today in cherbourg and sunday 
in munich and the body was to lie in state monday in vienna before 
the ceremonial state burial in budapest next thursday 
bela bartok was one of the greatest musical figures this 
century his genius has enhanced the reputation of hungarian 
culture throughout the world british prime minister margaret 
thatcher said at a memorial concert thursday night at southampton 
university 
bartok gave 50 piano performances in britain between 1904 and 
1938 he died in 1945 at age 64 in the united states having quit 
his homeland in disgust at the governments close ties with nazi 
germany 
we have no doubt that he belongs to hungary the composers 
son peter 64 of homosassa fla told the concert audience 
attending were david mellor foreign office minister of state 
representing the british govrnment and hungarian ambassador matyas 
domokos 
peter bartok and his brother bela bartok jr 78 who lives in 
budapest the hungarian capital are accompanying their fathers 
remains from new york to hungary 
it was difficult for a long time for us to accept that his 
grave should be disturbed but finally we knew if we did not the 
opportunity to go home with our father wont always exist and the 
thought of not going with him we could not accept peter said 
two works of bartok were performed at the concert 
violinist gyorgy pauk and pianist peter frankl both 
budapestborn and living in britain presented the sonata no2 for 
violin and piano and britains lindsay string quartet played the 
string quartet no 6 
quartet violinist ronald birks asked later if bartoks music is 
difficult to play replied very you have to know it

menuhin for whom the composer wrote his sonata for solo violin in 
1943

picture to the bartok brothers for their fathers old home in 
budapest now a memorial museum 
peter bartok said his fathers bones were in the simple 
zinclined box that rested on the queen elizabeth 2 overnight and 
that the box would be buried as it was 
we thought of having an elaborate casket but the thought of 
all the disturbance was repugnant to my brother and i he said 
he said someone cheated the family and the american society 
of composers authors and publishers which arranged the funeral in 
1945 
we ordered a steel coffin because we were all sure that our 
father would one day go home but when we exhumed him in ferncliff 
cemetery june 22 we found the coffin was wood which had 
disintegrated the younger brother said

ford motor co has offered outofcourt 
settlements of less than 1 million to each of the families of the 
24 children killed in a fiery may 14 church bus crash a newspaper 
reported today 
ford which made the bus chassis also offered payments to the 
estates of the three adults who died in the accident near 
carrollton and to the 40 survivors based on the severity of their 
injuries the courierjournal reported today attributing the 
information to unidentified lawyers 
ford spokesman robert waite told the newspaper that delicate 
negotiations were under way but would not comment on whether a 
settlement had been offered 
lawyer michael hance who represents the families of two of the 
dead children said a settlement was being offered by ford and all 
manufacturers responsible for producing the bus including sheller 
globe corp of toledo ohio which assembled it 
hance declined to disclose the size of the offers but described 
them as attractive financially to the families and also a good 
deal for ford 
sheller globes spokesman did not return phone calls seeking 
comment the newspaper reported 
lawyer don skeeters a spokesman for the radcliff firm of 
skeeters amp bennett which is representing most of the remaining 
plaintiffs refused to confirm or deny that an offer had been made 
lawyers who have handled similar cases told the courierjournal 
it would be highly unusual if not unprecedented for such a major 
case to be settled so quickly before lawsuits were even filed 
washington lawyer john coale who represents one family and has 
been active in several airdisaster cases said it would be 
unconscionable to settle so quickly without exploring whether 
ford might be liable for punitive damages he predicted the cases 
might be worth as much as 120 million 
coale who represents the parents of shannon fair who was 
killed in the crash said his client intended to take ford to trial 
even if all other plaintiffs settle out of court although he 
acknowledged it would be difficult for one client to finance such a 
battle 
hance said he would present the bus makers proposal today to 
his clients the parents of patty nunnallee and sandy brewer in 
hances view the families must decide between accepting the 
offers which he called a sure thing or the reality of 
fighting one of the largest corporations in the nation for four or 
five years 
while he described the offers as attractive he said ford might 
be forced to pay 60 million to 70 million for compensatory 
damages alone if the case is tried the total value of the proposed 
settlement offer is nowhere close to that he said 
hance also said his clients whom he described as more 
interested in bussafety reforms than money also might refuse to 
accept fords stipulation that settlement values be kept secret 
the converted school bus owned by the radcliff first assembly 
of god church was returning 67 people mostly children to the 
church after a day at the kings island amusement park near 
cincinnati police say the accident was caused by a drunken driver 
traveling the wrong way on interstate 71 
however investigators have said other factors combined to 
increase the loss of life including the bus lone rear exit door 
and crowded conditions inside 
authorities also cited the bus gas tank which ruptured and 
burst into flames the resulting smoke was blamed for all 27 deaths 
the bus was apparently one of the last manufactured in 1977 
before a new federal rule required bus fuel tanks be sheathed in 
protective cages

iraqs foreign minister today 
acknowledged that his country had used chemical weapons in its war 
with iran 
foreign minister tariq aziz was asked at a news conference about 
iranian allegations that iraq had used the deadly weapons against 
its persian gulf war foe 
the un report says both sides have used them iran started 
its use we were victims many times since the early beginning of 
the conflict aziz said 
asked whether both his country and iran had used such weapons 
he replied both sides 
it was the first direct admission by iraq that it has used 
chemical weapons in its war with iran 
the united nations security council has condemned the use of 
chemical weapons in the iraniraq war and their general use is 
outlawed by international agreement 
on april 25 un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said 
there was evidence that both sides were using chemical weapons in 
the 7yearold war 
the un chief had sent a physician from geneva to visit both 
iran and iraq and examine victims of alleged chemical attacks 
aziz repeated assertions that iran started the war by invading 
iraq and that his country had the right to choose the means for its 
defense 
every nation has the right to protect itself against 
invasion aziz said 
aziz defended his countrys use of chemical weapons in the war 
saying iran was a great threat to iraq 
there are different views on this matter from different 
angles you are living on a civilized continent you are living on 
a peaceful continent aziz told western reporters 
iran claims iraq killed 5000 people mostly iraqi kurds in a 
mustard gas and cyanide attack on the iranianheld halabja 
territory of iraq in march 
iraq did not deny the charge then and said it would use all 
necessary means to repel iranian forces it also accused iran of 
using chemical weapons 
aziz accused iran of not only using chemical weapons but also 
of violating international accords on the treatment of war 
prisoners 
lately 7000 iraqi prisoners of war disappeared we dont yet 
know what their destiny is said aziz 
when we want peace we have to respect all conventions but 
you cannot say im going to respect all these conventions and give 
the other side the liberty not to respect them he added 
aziz did not say when iraq last used chemical weapons in its war 
with iran 
aziz also said that iraqs recent war successes do not mean that 
his country has changed its position of wanting to find a peaceful 
solution to the conflict 
on may 9 the un security council condemned the use of 
chemical weapons in the iraniraq war and called on both sides to 
refrain from future use of the weapons 
iran has pushed for security council condemnation of iraq for 
using chemical weapons diplomats said iran was displeased that the 
resolution did not single out iraq

procedures to warn the sex or drugsharing 
partners of people infected with aids virus are now under way in 
every state according to a new report from the national centers 
for disease control 
the cdc reported thursday that all 50 states encourage partner 
notification through programs by which infected people are urged 
to inform partners with whom they have had sex or shared needles 
fortyeight states have in place referral on request 
programs to inform partners when an aidsinfected patient asks them 
to the other two georgia and nebraska have programs to inform 
partners in certain case such as women of childbearing age or rape 
victims 
in addition a georgia law going into effect today specifies 
that health authorities may contact spouses sex partners or other 
parties for disclosure purposes after first trying to inform the 
patient that they plan to do so 
aids caused by a virus is transmitted chiefly through sex or 
contaminated drug needles partner notification the cdc noted has 
been a key part of efforts to fight sexually transmitted diseases 
since the advent of penicillin to treat syphilis in the 1940s 
the cdc recommends that aidsinfected people should be 
instructed in how to notify their partners and to refer them for 
counseling and testing the agency also recommends that if 
infected people cannot or will not get their partners to seek 
counseling physicians or health department personnel should use 
confidential procedures to assure that the partners are notified 
all the states are giving counseling to patients about the 
need to inform their sex partners and needlesharing partners 
said dr kathleen toomey a cdc researcher 
having a third party notify people at risk has been shown to 
be effective but costly the cdc said in its weekly report 
because of limits on money and other resources having patients 
inform their own partners has played an increasingly important 
role 
in four of the states offering outside notification of sex or 
drug partners colorado idaho south carolina and virginia the 
percentage of partners identified through the programs who agreed 
to aids tests and showed signs of infection ranged from 14 to 39 
percent ms toomey said 
by identifying such individuals the partnernotification 
process can target riskreduction messages to those at greatest 
risk of acquiring or transmitting infection the cdc said 
more than 65000 aids cases have been reported in the united 
states 88 percent have occurred among homosexual males or 
injectible drug abusers according to the cdc more than 37000 
patients have already died

five soviet teams will arrive in san francisco 
tonight to begin inspections intended to verify compliance with the 
ussoviet mediumrange missile treaty 
the soviet government notified the united states early today 
that the five teams will land in san francisco at 8 pm pdt said 
kendall pease a spokesman for the us agency working with the 
soviets 
under the treaty the soviets need not list the sites they want 
to visit until they have been in the united states 48 hours pease 
said 
other soviets inspectors will inspect sites in the eastern 
united states but their arrival time has not been relayed to the 
united states pease said 
the united states annouced thursday that a us team would 
arrive in moscow this afternoon to begin inspections of soviet 
facilities 
the teams have 60 days to carry out the baseline 
inspections designed to verify the exact number of missiles and 
related components to be destroyed under the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty signed at the washington summit dec 9 
the us team will be headed by brig gen roland lajoie chief 
of the onsite inspection agency 
under the terms of the treaty the two sides must give each 
other 16 hours notice of their intent to make an inspection the 
us team had not given notice of the exact sites to be inspected 
preferring to wait as late as possible pease said 
in addition to the shortnotice spot inspections the inf treaty 
allows the soviets to station up to 30 inspectors for the next 13 
years in magna utah site of hercules plant no 1 where 
mediumrange american missiles were produced 
the us government in turn has the right to station 
inspectors near a soviet missileproducing site the votkinsk 
machine building plant 
the treaty the first to allow such onsite inspection is 
viewed as a trial for the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty 
which would slash arsenals of longrange superpower nuclear weapons 
by 3050 percent and involve much more complicated verification 
procedures

roman catholic bishops are urging supporters 
of excommunicated traditionalist archbishop marcel lefebvre to 
affirm their loyalty to the pope and remain united with the church 
on thursday in econe switzerland lefebvre defied the vatican 
and consecrated four bishops of his st pius x fraternity 
declaring that the church had become corrupted with modernism 
the vatican denounced the rebel prelate for provoking the first 
schism in 118 years and declared lefebvre and the bishops expelled 
from the church 
the vatican will announce its position on the priests and lay 
supporters of lefebvre in the coming days vatican spokesman 
joaquin navarro said today under church doctrine lefebvre will 
always be a bishop since he was appointed as a successor to the 
apostles said a vatican official 
navarro has estimated lefebvres supporters at 80000 to 
100000 but other vatican officials say around half a million 
people turn to his priests for various church functions and 
lefebvre says he has millions of sympathizers 
those who are sympathetic to archbishop lefebvre and may have 
found it almost impossible to accept the renewal of the church life 
endorsed by the second vatican council are now faced with a painful 
choice said cardinal basil hume the archbishop of westminister 
i would urge them to reaffirm their loyalty to the successor 
of st peter and to remain within the unity of the catholic 
church he said to continue in support of the archbishop and 
to worship with the fraternity of st pius x is to leave the 
catholic church 
vatican officials were visibly angered by the consecrations a 
concert scheduled thursday evening at the vatican was canceled to 
express deep pain over the schism 
lefebvre rejected a lastminute appeal by pope john paul ii 
before elevating the bishops less than two hours later the 
vatican said the five had excommunicated themselves by defying 
papal authority 
an excommunicated roman catholic is unable to receive the 
churchs sacraments which include the eucharist and last rites 
also known as the sacrament of the sick 
a vatican statement said the consecrations were a formally 
schismatic act a schism is a formal rupture with the vatican 
lefebvres act provoked the first major split in the church 
since the old catholics broke with the vatican after the first 
vatican council proclaimed the doctrine of papal infallibility in 
1870 
the vatican identified those excommunicated as lefebvre and the 
four bishops bernard fellay bernard tissier de mallerais richard 
williamson and alfonso de galarreta 
reports from econe said brazilian prelate antonio de castro 
mayer bishop of campos assisted at the rites and also faced 
excommunication but navarro said the vatican was awaiting 
clarification on his role in the ceremony 
lefebvre an 82yearold frenchman called the sanctions null 
and void and told his supporters not to pay any attention to 
them he said canon law permits his actions in a state of 
emergency 
he contended in his homily that the vatican not he was on a 
schismatic course because it accepted errors once condemned 
that were leading to the destruction of the church 
lefebvre and his followers reject many of the modernizing 
reforms of the second vatican council of 196265 including 
openings to other religions and christian denominations 
interviewed at random people in lefebvres audience estimated 
by organizers at almost 10000 all said the sanctions left them 
unshaken in their loyalty to the tradionalist faith 
but the vatican expects that many will have second thoughts 
appeals are being readied by the swiss french and west german 
conferences of bishops exhorting lefebvres followers to reject a 
man who now is barred from receiving the sacraments 
the italian episcopal conference issued a statement expressing 
its sorrow and saying the bishops and the church in italy shared in 
the suffering of the pope 
but public opinion polls conducted in france and west germany in 
the past few years seem to support lefebvres claim that the 
tradionalist movement has millions of sympathizers most favor 
restoration of the 16th tridentine mass in latin which was replaced 
by the mass in local modern languages termed by lefebvre a 
bastard rite 
despite a ban issued 12 years ago that suspended him from his 
priestly functions lefebvre has ordained 220 priests who are 
officiating in 28 countries he likes to compare the growth with 
the decline in ordinations in the official church 
the fraternity has seminaries in switzerland france west 
germany the united states and argentina with more being planned 
in gabon australia and mexico it claims to have chapels or 
centers throughout the world including a floating chapel anchored 
in the netherlands

of maaleh adumim home to over 15000 jews with jerusalem 
the radio did not say whether police made any arrests police 
spokesman rafi levy could not be reached at his home or office for 
comment on the report 
also thursday prime minister yitzhak shamir accused arab states 
of encouraging palestinians in the occupied lands to keep up their 
destructive and futile actions he vowed that the uprising 
would fail 
in a speech to leaders of the quasigovernmental jewish agency 
shamir rejected the view that the recent arab summit in algiers 
adopted moderate resolutions toward israel

president reagan and mikhail s gorbachev signed the intermediate 
nuclear forces treaty in washington that accord eliminated 
groundbased short and mediumrange missiles 
we all feel this is a historic mission lajoie told 
reporters before boarding a us air force jet for moscow its 
impact on international relations cannot be underestimated we are 
proud to be a part of this important moment in history 
lajoie said one team would travel to the soviet city of 
votkinsk the site of a plant that formerly built the soviets 
ss20 missiles the ss20s are covered by the treaty along with 
usbuilt pershing 2 missiles and cruise missiles based in western 
europe 
the other us team must tell the soviets within 48 hours after 
arrival where it intends to begin conducting inspections lajoie 
said he did not disclose which site that would be 
were going in with the attitude trust everybody but always 
cut the cards lajoie said 
the general said that although there are 1800 missiles whose 
destruction must be checked other related items including 
storage and transport missile containers and special hauling 
vehicles bring the actual number of items to be inspected to at 
least 5000 
the inspection teams will be checking for numbers of missiles 
and individual components will be measured and weighed under the 
inspection process agreed upon with the soviets said lajoie 
in the next two months the inspectors will visit 126 sites in 
the soviet union including 33 in eastern siberia lajoie said 
the soviets will inspect 26 sites in the united states and 
western europe including 11 in the continental united states 
according to onsite inspection agency officials 
the us teams include linguists and specialists in nuclear 
missiles 
although the inspection teams are comprised of members of all 
branches of the us military and civilian government employees 
the inspection agreement calls for all of them to wear civilian 
clothes during their stay in the soviet union 
in london nato commander gen john r galvin said he was 
confident the verification arrangements would work he said he had 
been surprised at the openness the soviets have shown in the visits 
to us elimination sites so far

the government proposed 
legislation today that would strengthen residential segregation but 
also would allow creation of the first legal multiracial 
neighborhoods 
government opponents condemned the three proposed measures 
saying they would force the evictions of thousands of blacks now 
living peacefully but illegally in whites only areas 
the government indicates once again its absolute obsession 
with skin color as a norm on which to base south africas 
political social and economic life said the antiapartheid 
independent party 
tian van der merwe member of parliament for the antiapartheid 
progressive federal party called the measures so harsh and so 
brutal that up to 200000 blacks could be evicted on short notice 
under the group areas act all residential areas are segregated 
by race however thousands of nonwhites are living illegally in 
neighborhoods designated for whites in johannesburg cape town and 
other urban areas 
one of the proposed measures the group areas amendment bill 
would make it easier to confiscate property and to evict and 
prosecute people living in areas not designated for their race 
group 
the maximum fine for a person living outside his group area 
would be increased from 175 to 4300 the maximum prison sentence 
would be increased from two years to five years 
the government has not strictly enforced the 35yearold group 
areas act in recent years angering conservative whites opposed to 
integrated neighborhoods the proposed bill is widely seen as an 
accommodation to rightwing whites prior to nationwide municipal 
elections in october 
president pw bothas governing national party favors gradual 
race reform but says it is committed to preserving white group 
rights such as segregated schools and neighborhoods 
the national party has dominated south african politics for 40 
years but has been losing ground to the extremeright conservative 
party which opposes all concessions to the nations 26 million 
black majority under south africas system of apartheid blacks 
have no vote in national affairs 
a second proposed bill the free settlement areas bill would 
allow creation of residential areas open to all races but before 
such areas could be established a government committee would check 
the necessity or desirability of an area being opened to all 
races 
a third bill would set up guidelines for multiracial political 
participation by residents in open areas 
the three bills are to be debated in the next session of 
parliament in august

aerospace experts developing star wars 
technology have successfully tested a tiny 2ounce rocket engine 
designed to power satellitebased missile killers 
the engine tested at rocketdynes santa susana field laboratory 
on thursday is slated for use as a directional thruster for a 
spacebased interceptor in the strategic defense initiative program 
the goal is to neutralize incoming enemy nuclear missiles before 
they reenter the atmosphere by using lasers and interceptor 
rockets 
the new engine dubbed by designers as the most efficient in the 
free world would guide the interceptor from its base on a 
satellite toward an approaching nuclear missile the missile would 
be destroyed on impact 
officials from the air force space division rockwell 
international and rocketdyne called the test successful praising 
the engines weighttothrust ratio a measure of its power and 
efficiency thrust is the forward force produced in reaction to 
gases escaping rearward from the engine 
the engines we were running with around five years ago were 
1to20 said ernie bunch a rocketdyne engineer in the 
spacebased interceptor or sabir program 
the tiny engine tested has a weighttothrust ratio of 
1to1200 said frank patota engineer in charge of the test area 
the engine was fired or pulsed for five milliseconds and then 
was shut off for 110 of a second this cycle was repeated dozens 
of times during each of the three testings the result sounded like 
machine gun fire 
the interceptor rockets would be equipped with four of the 
tested engines and four smaller thrusters

white house announces staff drug tests aclu critical 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
presidential employees will get letters next 
week telling them they face random drug tests in about 60 days a 
step the american civil liberties union said today likely would not 
have caught five white house drug abusers 
both president reagan and his wife nancy who has campaigned 
extensively against drug use expressed dismay thursday at the 
disclosure that two female national security council secretaries 
had resigned and three secret service officers were suspended 
during a drug probe 
i think its just evidence of what weve been saying no 
one is exempt reagan said adding this problem crosses all 
kinds of lines 
mrs reagan through her spokeswoman elaine crispen voiced 
disappointment and said drugs are everywhere in the work 
place movie industry sports fields and college campuses its 
time everyone became involved and aware and intolerant of drug 
use 
her husband however advocated treatment rather than 
intolerance for the white house employees implicated in the case 
reagan said during brief comments to reporters that if its 
just a case of using drugs rather than dealing i would like to 
see us do our best to get them into a drug treatment organization 
and that they will agree to accept a cure 
aclu lawyer lauren siegel said urine testing is a serious 
intrusion of privacy rights 
the response of the president which is to line up many 
dedicated civil servants who have given a good part of their 
careers to life in public service to pee on command in order to 
prove their innocence is really not the best way to deal with this 
problem in the white house said ms siegel in an interview on 
abctvs good morning america 
in the opinion of the aclu what happened at the white house 
seems to make the case against drug testing because in fact these 
people were caught as the result of a problem that was triggered by 
somebodys legitimate suspicion she said adding that if the 
white house had relied on drug testing these people may have 
slipped right through 
neither white house spokesman marlin fitzwater nor secret 
service spokesman bob snow would identify the individuals involved 
or the illegal substances allegedly used published and broadcast 
reports have said the probe focused on cocaine and marijuana use 
fitzwater said letters will be sent to the 1600 presidential 
employees next week warning that a mandatory random program of 
drug testing will commence 60 days hence 
fitzwater said the tests will be conducted six times a year 
with each round involving about 2 percent of the staff 
included are employees of the office of management and budget 
the national security council and the offices of the vice president 
and the first lady 
fitzwater said two female clerical employees admitted drug use 
and were separated from the nsc several months ago the spokesman 
refused to say whether they had sensitive positions on the agency 
the white house unit that advises the president on a wide gamut of 
foreign affairs and security issues 
adding to the disconcerting news was the alleged involvement of 
uniformed members of the secret service the men and women who 
guard the white house grounds travel with the president to help 
provide security and protect other key washington locations such as 
embassies and the vice presidents home 
fitzwater said none of the allegations involved the 
nonuniformed secret service agents who act as the presidents 
bodyguards 
snow declined to specify the sex of the uniformed officers 
involved he said some 960 officers serve in the uniformed division 
fitzwater said that on july 13 the secret service will begin 
its own program of preemployment drug testing for job applicants 
the washington post which first reported the drug investigation 
and suspensions quoted an unidentified source as saying that at 
least one sale of cocaine allegedly occurred on white house 
property fitzwater said that we have been advised that drugs 
were not used or sold on the white house premises snow would not 
comment on that although he did say that no charges had yet been 
filed 
snow said the three secret service officers who have civil 
service protection were placed on administrative leave with pay 
and that their status will depend on whether charges are brought by 
the us attorneys office in the district of columbia the 
officers were placed on leave during the past week snow said 
the secretaries who do not have civil service status lost 
their positions because they serve at the pleasure of the 
president officials said 
the disclosure of the drug investigation shook the white house 
at a time when reagans zerotolerance antidrug abuse campaign 
is in disarray reagan has sought so far unsuccessfully to get 
democratic congressional leaders to take part in a bipartisan task 
force on the problem 
moreover the latest uproar came on a day in which reagan 
received recommendations from his drug policy board headed by 
attorney general edwin meese iii among the proposals was one to 
require companies doing business with the government to demonstrate 
effective plans for a drugfree workplace 
the board also recommended that federal student aid programs be 
made conditional upon the adoption of effective antidrug programs 
by colleges and universities and said students with records of drug 
offenses should not be given assistance

the house intelligence committee is 
investigating allegations that the national security agency engaged 
in electronic eavesdropping of congressmen and american citizens 
the plain dealer reported today 
the alleged telephone bugging was accomplished through 
interception of satellite signals the newspaper said 
it said the allegations surfaced during secret testimony earlier 
this year by margaret a newsham 45 a former employee at lockheed 
missiles and space co in sunnyvale calif 
maj alan freitag public affairs duty officer for the defense 
department in washington said thursday night he was not familiar 
with ms newsham or her allegations and could not comment on the 
report 
ms newsham a former software configuration management analyst 
for space projects at lockheed handled classified assignments 
overseas and possessed nsa special access clearances 
she lost her top secret access after becoming a 
whistleblower on waste in a government program and making 
accusations that she was sexually harassed according to the plain 
dealer which said she was fired from lockheed for alleged 
timecard violations 
ms newsham told rep louis stokes dohio chairman of the 
permanent select committee on intelligence that the monitoring was 
being done with the cooperation of british authorities and from 
english soil the newspaper said 
while nsa eavesdropping on ordinary telephone calls is barred in 
the united states loopholes in the law allow the agency to do it 
by monitoring microwave frequencies outside us borders said 
james bamford author of puzzle palace a book on the nsa 
sen strom thurmond rsc who is said to have been among 
those whose personal calls were monitored by the pentagon security 
agency said he looked into the allegations after being informed of 
them by the plain dealer he said he does not believe they are true 
ms newsham was among sources confirming the existence of her 
topsecret session with stokes and two committee staffers the 
newspaper said 
asked about the allegations ms newshams credibility or why 
other members of the committee were not involved in the meeting 
stokes said i dont discuss intelligence business 
the military watchdog group project on military procurement has 
been working with stokes on the probe the plain dealer said

it may have been the chicago white sox 
biggest victory since they won the american leagues west division 
in 1983 
like a manager trying to spark a lateinning rally gov james 
r thompson worked the floor of the house and senate and coaxed 
lawmakers to go to bat for the american league club 
they responded early today by narrowly approving an incentive 
package to keep the team from moving to florida 
this is a political resurrection from the dead a baseball 
resurrection from the dead a jubilant thompson said i even 
told myself a couple times this was dead but i decided i was not 
going to let them go 
the deal would tie the teams rent on the new 150 million 
statefinanced stadium to attendance and give the state a share of 
the teams gate receipts television royalties and other revenue 
when attendance tops 12 million 
the chicago white sox are elated at the outcome of the 
stadium vote the team said in a statement 
in st petersburg fla officials who tried to lure the team 
south conceded defeat 
it was clearly their turn at bat and they hit a homer said 
rick dodge the assistant city manager who led the negotiations 
with the white sox were obviously very disappointed about the 
vote in illinois 
final passage came on a tense 6055 vote in the house as time 
ran out on the last regularly scheduled day of the 1988 session a 
short time earlier the package cleared the senate on a 3026 vote

a mountainsized asteroid smashed into the 
south pacific 23 million years ago and exploded with a force of 12 
billion tons of tnt sending so much water vapor aloft that it 
could have helped accelerate the last ice age scientists reported 
today 
a study published in the journal science says the asteroid more 
than a quartermile across and weighing more than 6 trillion 
pounds hit the ocean just southwest of south america near 
antarctica and splashed billions of tons of water vapor into the 
upper stratosphere 
frank t kyte a member of the research team at the university 
of california at los angeles said the asteroid actually could have 
been much larger than a quartermile across but researchers can 
confirm only a minimum size 
kyte and his colleagues lei zhou and john t wasson of ucla 
calculated the size of the asteroid by studying the composition and 
distribution of core samples taken from six sites on the pacific 
ocean floor 
he said the researchers were able to identify some of the 
samples as unmelted asteroid material heavily laced with salt 
other samples had metal grains and all were rich in iridium a 
chemical characteristic of meteorites 
kyte said the asteroid would have hit the ocean at about 12000 
miles an hour the energy of the mass and velocity would instantly 
have been converted into an explosion that would have blasted water 
aloft and vaporized most of the asteroid he said 
it would have made any atomic bomb look like a toy kyte 
said in a telephone interview 
the explosion would have equaled the force of 12 billion tons of 
tnt he said the us bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945 had a 
force of 19000 ton of tnt 
in what he said is strictly speculation kyte said tons of water 
vapor sent into the upper stratosphere by the blast could have 
formed clouds that reflected sunlight away from the earth this he 
said could have been sufficient to cause a rapid decrease in 
global temperature and an increase within a season in the amount of 
land covered by snow 
kyte said the asteroid hit the ocean about the time that the 
last great glacier age started about 23 million years ago but he 
said he and his coauthors are not claiming that the asteroid 
triggered the glacier age only that the two events occurred about 
the same time and that the asteroid impact may have contributed to 
the cooling 
most scientists believe the glacial age which lasted until 
about 10000 years ago was brought about by a gradual global 
cooling perhaps triggered by a movement of the continents that 
blocked the exchange of warm water between oceans at the equator 
jim kasting an impact expert at nasas ames research center in 
california said he regarded as highly speculative the theory 
that the asteroid impact could have added to the global cooling 
kasting said some studies have indicated that clouds formed in 
the upper stratosphere by water splashed aloft by an impact could 
actually contribute to warming the earth by allowing sunlight to 
pass through and then trapping heat reflected from the planet 
surface 
the clouds could warm or cool the planet depending on their 
thickness he said

the worlds most polite audiences today and the american brand of 
unbridled circus won some new fans 
the ringling bros and barnum amp bailey combined shows made its 
debut in japan in a huge tent in this city on the northern island 
of hokkaido the audience was the first in japan to see an american 
circus 
a nearcapacity matinee crowd of about 4000 attended the debut 
and clapped enthusiastically for the 200member troupe after a 
little encouragement from the clowns 
we had been prepared for a reserved quiet crowd this is not 
texas ringmaster dinny mcguire told the associated press after 
the performance but they clapped fervently i did not expect 
them to be as overwhelmingly demonstrative 
ringling brothers has brought a version of the 118yearold show 
to japan as an experiment it will give 44 performances in sapporo 
then 96 shows in tokyo in august and september 
the japan educational association the local promoter of the 
tour wanted a production as big as the two ringling troupes 
touring the united states said publicist joe gold 
the 40 ticket price for adults about four times the average 
price in the united states still is considered reasonably priced 
entertainment in japan 
to help audiences understand the acts ringmaster mcguire 
learned his introductions in japanese also japanese characters 
were put on many of the clown costumes to identify them to children 
finally we brought in 120 kids last week for a dry run 
gold said 
ringling ownerproducer ken feld said the production will cost 
10 million plus incidentals such as the 8 million tent 
at the matinee viewers first smiled instead of laughing and 
clapped politely instead of loudly but the clowns went into the 
stands for direct contact with youngsters then staged elaborate 
stunts and broke the ice with a comedy highwire act called the 
mount fuji aerial adventure 
slapstick always plays well said glen little the head 
clown wearing a blue wig 
sachiko okawara said she liked the performance very much 
the performancers the animals the costumes the lights and 
the band the band was beautiful she said 
for 5yearold miku kusakabo the list of favorites was shorter 
the elephants she said through an interpreter and nodded 
vigorously when asked if she wanted to come back

a prosecution witness has 
written president pw botha to seek clemency for six black people 
whose death sentences have sparked international outrage a 
newspaper reported today 
joseph manete who said that police tortured him so he would 
give false testimony reportedly described his police interrogation 
and pleaded for the release of the socalled sharpeville six 
i am writing this letter in order to tell you the truth 
what i have told the court was not my words according to a text 
of the letter published today by city press the largest 
circulation newspaper for blacks 
botha refused to intervene in the case despite appeals from 
many foreign governments to halt the hanging of the five black men 
and one woman convicted of the mob killing of a black town 
councillor 
a day before they were due to hang in march attorneys obtained 
a stay of execution from the trial judge willem human on the 
basis of a statement that manete had given his lawyer 
the lawyers said manete wrote an affidavit saying police coerced 
him into falsely identifying two of the defendants as being part of 
the crowd that stoned and burned ouncilor jacob dlamini in 
september 1984 
during a hearing last month human said he had not relied on 
manetes testimony and had not been shown the affidavit human said 
reopening the case to investigate interrogation of other 
prosecution witnesses would be absurd 
human gave the defendants until july 19 to seek a stay of 
execution from the chief justice of the appellate court pj rabie 
in the letter printed today manete described his interrogation 
saying that from the outset he told police he didnt know the names 
of dlaminis killers 
they threatened and pressurized me he wrote one of the 
white policemen pushed my head against the wall and i was clapped 
several times on the face 
he said a policeman read him the names of the six defendants and 
told him he would be imprisoned and tortured daily if he did 
not name two of them as having been present at the killing 
finally manete said i agreed with them 
during the interrogation i was afraid that very soon i will 
reach the point of no return that is death he said 
the six defendants are mohalefa sefatsa reid mokoena oupa 
diniso theresa ramashomola duma khumalo and francis mokgesi 
manete said he was told to identify khumalo and mokgesi he told 
botha other prosecution witnesses also were unhappy about 
statements they had given under police interrogation

when the lights flickered inside the 
cheyenne club the last call sounded for 19 and 20yearolds 
enjoying their last night of legal drinking in wyoming until they 
turn 21 
the flickering marked midnight the witching hour for those 
working to make the most of the time before the state joined the 
rest of the nation in making 21 the minimum legal drinking age at 
1201 am today 
i think everybody has one last chance and they are taking 
advantage of it said 20yearold michelle wileman of cheyenne 
i kind of have to because i cant go back in and drink for the 
next 10 months 
the clock on wyomings alcohol drinking age began ticking in 
march when gov mike sullivan and legislators reluctantly agreed 
they could no longer hold out against federal blackmail the 
withholding of federal highway funds because the state had not 
raised its drinking age 
after singing along to the beastie boys you gotta fight for 
your right to party the shouldertoshoulder crowd moved toward 
the doors waving to a network television crew and carrying a young 
woman on their shoulders 
some went home others waited outside for the bar to reopen and 
serve nonalcoholic drinks to those under 21 those affected by the 
law were almost unanimously against it 
what bothers me is wyoming is recognized as the equality 
state said cheyenne resident jeff white if we are the 
equality state and the first to take chances on things like women 
voting we should take a chance on taking a stand 
my husband is 21 so i like to go to the bar with him said 
19yearold hope green of laramie for a year weve been coming 
to this bar together all of a sudden they say to me hes 
responsible but youre not any more you cant do that 
under the law passed by congress in 1984 states had to raise 
the drinking age to 21 or lose a percentage of their federal 
highway funds the law went into effect in 1986 and wyoming 
sacrificed 118 million in two years 
wyoming stood to lose another 82 million in federal funds if 
the drinking age increase was not in place by today wyoming 
officials said the state could have lost 413 million in highway 
funds during the next four years 
the reasoning behind the move made little difference to many of 
those out thursday night such as dianna estes who celebrated her 
19th birthday in laramie with a few last drinks 
i dont live with my parents she said i make my own 
decisions if i can do all of that i can drink responsibly

a world war ii veteran plans to fly solo across 
the atlantic to return to the german battlefield where a snipers 
bullet left him a paraplegic 43 years ago and west german 
officials are waiting to honor him 
clark harrison 63 a real estate company owner and bank 
chairman in suburban decatur took off at about 930 am today 
from dekalbpeachtree airport in a singleengine cherokee piper 
equipped with hand controls and an extra gas tank 
what scares me the most is rolling around in this wheelchair 
and getting in and out of it he said the easy part is the 
flying once i get on the ground thats the hard part 
the residents of stolberg west germany will be celebrating 
what city manager heinrich romer called harrisons spirit of 
enterprise and courage as he completes a 4669mile solo 
transatlantic flight via greenland and great britain 
the reception at stolbergs historic castle is scheduled for 
july 11 the day harrison hopes weather permitting to arrive at 
the nearby airport in aachen west germany 
harrison flies in a cramped twoseat cockpit filled with his 
wheelchair his luggage a life raft survival kit and an auxiliary 
fuel tank he gets in and out of the plane by crawling onto the 
wing which sits about three feet off the ground and then pulling 
the wheelchair up or letting it down with a strap 
harrison a founding director of the shepherd spinal center in 
atlanta hopes his trip will raise enough money for a center for 
independent living at the hospital to help the newly paralyzed 
learn to care for themselves 
supporters are pledging to the hospital up to 1 for each of the 
4669 miles he plans to cover 
harrison who has already flown solo to alaska and back says 
flying alone has great attraction for someone for whom more routine 
tasks can be difficult 
when i was a kid and i first got shot harrison said 
recalling his days as a 20yearold infantryman i was in a 
hospital for a year and a half they didnt know what to do with 
us we were just invalids when that happens when youre young you 
miss out on a lot so when you have a chance to transport yourself 
over great distances it has a lot of appeal 
harrison had planned to be a pilot in world war ii because he 
thought it would be glamorous but he was assigned to the infantry 
and joined the 104th division for the armys push into germany 
after dday 
four days after he arrived he was shot by a sniper on the 
battlefield near stolberg he plans to visit a friend dragged him 
to a nearby farmhouse 
harrison who finally learned to fly until age 55 plans to 
guide his spirit of shepherd plane up the east coast and across 
canada to the us air force base at sondrestrom greenland where 
he will spend july 4 
flying by visual flight rules about 2000 feet above the ground 
harrison then will cross the greenland ice cap and go on to 
reykjavik iceland bagar island in the faeroe islands stornoway 
scotland biggin hill england and aachen west germany 
the pilot said he might sell his plane in germany and plans to 
take a commercial flight home after a 10day visit 
harrison said hes making the journey for me for all 
paraplegics for everyone who feels trapped by their bodies he 
hopes the trip will inspire paralyzed people so when they think 
theyll never be able to do anything theyll remember that this

michael dukakis with a grinning john glenn 
standing by indicated today he does not think talk that glenn is 
dull and boring and ran a disastrous presidential campaign four 
years ago should disqualify the ohio senator from the vice 
presidency 
dull and boring i kind of like that said the democratic 
presidential nomineetobe who himself has been accused of failing 
to excite audiences 
as for the criticism of glenns failed 1984 effort to become the 
democratic presidential nominee dukakis said ive won campaigns 
and ive lost campaigns ive run good campaigns and have had one 
disastrous campaign so im very sympathetic 
glenn appeared with dukakis at a united auto workers union hall 
the final stop on a midwest campaign swing by the governor 
while dukakis emphasized economic and family issues in his 
speeches much of the attention was diverted to his continuing 
search for a running mate 
during a stop thursday night in terre haute ind dukakis was 
joined on stage by rep lee hamilton of indiana one of several 
members of congress mentioned as potential vicepresidential 
choices 
monday night back home in boston dukakis and his wife will 
have dinner with jesse jackson and jacksons wife a meal certain 
to include discussion of the democratic vice presidential 
nomination which jackson has said he deserves to be offered i 
think part of that will be discussed at some point said dukakis 
aide nick mitropoulos 
at the uaw hall today there was no question who was the crowd 
favorite for a spot on the democratic ticket 
ive been taking a poll all over america about running mates 
what do you think about john glenn dukakis asked the union 
audience 
the response was loud applause and whistles dukakis turned and 
shook glenns hand then turning back to the microphone said 
sounds unanimous to me 
later when he opened the event to questions from the audience 
14yearold tammy watts asked him who his vicepresidential choice 
would be 
who do you like asked the candidate 
john glenn she replied 
im grateful for your advice and counsel he said 
glenn who became a national hero when as a marine pilot and 
astronaut he became the first american to orbit earth has served 
on the senate foreign relations committee and now on the armed 
services panel 
hamilton was chairman of the house panel that investigated the 
irancontra affair he joined the house foreign affairs committee 
as a freshman congressman in 1965 now is second in line behind 
chairman dante fascell and is seen as likely to come into the 
chairmanship eventually after the 1984 election he was picked to 
chair the house intelligence committee 
much of the speculation about the sort of running mate dukakis 
should choose has centered on the need for someone with experience 
dealing with foreign policy and defense issues 
jackson has repeatedly cited his own qualifications for the vice 
presidential nomination beginning with his finish second to 
dukakis in the race for the top spot on the ticket 
but while saying his strong showing in the primaries and 
caucuses earned him the right to consideration for a place on the 
ticket jackson has not said whether he actually would accept it if 
offered 
recently the former civil rights activist said he had made his 
decision but he refused to disclose it even to dukakis 
their upcoming dinner might offer him the opportunity to do that 
mitropoulos said it was during a flight wednesday from 
washington to des moines iowa that dukakis said hed like to 
invite jackson and his wife jacqueline to have a holiday dinner 
with him and his wife kitty at their brookline mass home 
nobody could say who would do the cooking or what the menu might 
be 
there also was a possibility they would go to the hatch shell on 
the shore of the charles river for the annual holiday concert by 
the boston pops orchestra 
mrs dukakis father harry ellis dickson is a former associate 
conductor of the pops 
throughout all the speculation about the vice presidency 
dukakis remained adamant about making his decision on his timetable 
i have the luxury of having the time and being able to do this 
thoughtfully and deliberately he told reporters at an aluminum 
company plant outside chicago 
im not going to hurry it he said ill make a decision 
when im ready to make a decision

human error and design flaws 
contributed to the collision of two army helicopters that killed 17 
soldiers during night training at fort campbell according to a 
report released today 
human errorpilot error is presumed to be the cause of this 
mishap said the report released at a news conference 
but the report added because the accident was fatal to the 
crew of both aircraft it is impossible to determine exactly what 
caused the two aircraft to fly into each other 
the report said one of the two uh60 black hawks did not have 
its anticollision strobe turned on as required at the time of the 
march 8 accident 
the report also cited other factors including limited pilot 
training using nightvision goggles and exterior and interior 
design flaws of the black hawk 
the report said there was no evidence of a mechanical 
malfunction 
there should be no action taken against anyone as no 
foundation for negligence can be established the report said 
the accident was not due to lack of diligence nor unreasonable 
or unprofessional conduct 
the accident occurred when a black hawk returning from a solo 
instruction flight collided with the lead helicopter in a formation 
of three returning from a mission to pick up soldiers in the field 
the lead helicopter struck broadside carried 13 soldiers the 
other craft carried four all were killed the other two 
helicopters were not damaged and landed safely 
the 17 victims belonged to the 101st airborne division at fort 
campbell 
the investigation concluded the collision was the result of 
the two air crews being unable to see each other in the final 
moments of flight according to a statement read by maj randy 
schoel publicaffairs officer at fort campbell 
restrictions to vision caused by door posts and structural 
components of the aircraft and the limited field of view of the 
night vision goggles being used by both crews hampered their 
ability to see and avoid each schoel said 
the lights on the helicopter leading the formation could very 
easily have been obscured and blended into city lights schoel 
said 
crew members on the undamaged helicopters said there was little 
warning that another helicopter was approaching 
up to the point of impact the missions were formed just as 
briefed schoel said 
chief warrant officer steven shockney pilot of the third 
helicopter told investigators the lone helicopter did not have its 
anticollision strobe on the strobe is attached to the front of 
the black hawk 
that is the one thing that really catches your eyes under 
goggles he said if he would have had his anticollision light 
on we would have seen him for miles and miles 
investigators theorize the crew forgot to turn the 
anticollision strobe light on after a fuel stop the report said 
compounding the problem the report said was the lack of 
lighting on the helicopters the report said the number and size of 
position lights on the outside of the 46 million black hawk are 
inadequate 
moreover the pilot and copilot of the incoming helicopter 
could have been tired the report said

a federal judge has given thousands of foreign 
sugar cane workers an opportunity to qualify for permanent us 
resident status under a program for seasonal farm workers 
us district judge thomas f hogan ordered the immigration and 
naturalization service to accept applications from sugar cane 
workers to obtain legal resident status under streamlined 
procedures to accommodate a nov 1 deadline 
under the 1986 immigration reform and control act seasonal 
workers have that date to file applications to qualify for the 
program 
hogan also ordered ins to grant work authorization papers to the 
applicants and barred the agency from initiating deportation 
proceedings against those individuals 
equity demands that these sugar cane workers be afforded an 
opportunity to stay in the country pending the final outcome 
regarding the status of sugar cane in the program for seasonal 
workers hogan said wednesday 
hogan who ruled in april that the agriculture department had 
not justified excluding sugar cane harvesters from the program 
chided usda for the continuing delay in drafting new regulations 
he gave usda until july 11 to propose the new regulations and 
set an august 19 deadline for issuing the final rule 
usda could still issue regulations that exclude sugar cane 
harvesters from the program but the agency would have to give 
hogan further justification for its decision 
usda had sought to issue its new regulations in september but 
hogan said further delays would not give the workers enough time to 
qualify for legal status if the department ultimately decided they 
could participate in the program 
the court views with skepticism usdas claims that 
despite at least three drafts which have been rejected the agency 
still is grappling with the drafting of the regulation hogan 
said

the government is investigating reports that 
filipino donors were paid to give up a kidney for japanese patients 
willing to pay the price an official said today 
the health and welfare ministry official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said the ministry started the investigation after 
reports that a filipino prison inmate was paid to donate a kidney 
to a 51yearold japanese man in june 
our position is that the sale of kidneys by unrelated living 
donors is undesirable and at this point we are trying to confirm 
those reports the official said 
a person can live with one healthy kidney 
the japanese government is also investigating whether to ask the 
philippines to ban such operations there on japanese citizens the 
official said 
according to noel litan executive assistant to philippine 
health secretary alfredo bengzon two japanese citizens have 
received kidneys in manila in the past month and both operations 
were performed at the private kidney center of the philippines 
he said one of the kidneys came from an inmate at a state 
penitentiary and the other from a japanese donor 
under japanese law patients are allowed to receive kidneys from 
relatives or from the dead the use of organs for transplant from 
braindead donors is not recognized in japan and liver pancreas 
and heart transplants seldom are performed 
arrangements for the two japanese nationals to undergo 
transplant operations in the philippines were handled by tadashi 
nakayama director of the kidney transplant foreign medical affairs 
research association 
nakayama told the associated press he did not know that the 
kidney donor was a prison inmate and denied any knowledge of money 
being paid to the donor or to his family 
according to a report released thursday by the japan society for 
transplantation about 9000 people are waiting for kidney 
transplants in japan only an estimated 572 people received kidney 
transplants in japan in 1987 the report said 
it was a courageous decision by the filipino doctor to conduct 
the operation nakayama said it was an emergency the patient 
was dying 
nakayama said he agrees it is unethical to pay donors he added 
his nonprofit organization which charges 138000 for 200 days of 
medical care by a fourmember team lost money on the june case 
the government here doesnt allow transplants from unrelated 
living donors but such operations are legal in the philippines 
said an employee of the private japan health associations kidney 
transplant research department another group that refers kidney 
patients to doctors in the philippines 
the employee who refused to be further identified said he 
believes kidneys are being sold in the philippines

an amish man has been sentenced to seven 
days in jail and two dozen others believe they could soon follow 
in a longstanding clash between religious beliefs and a state 
highway safety law 
state law requires nonmotorized vehicles to have a redoutlined 
orange reflective triangle mounted on the back to warn approaching 
drivers 
but the amish say displaying the signs would violate their 
religion because of their bright color and because they are worldly 
objects 
amish leaders and state legislators worked out a compromise law 
two years ago allowing the amish to use a whiteoutlined black 
triangle during the day and the orange sign at night 
but the amish community has divided over the compromise some 
refuse to use the orange sign at night and some especially older 
and more conservative amish use no signs whatsoever 
gideon d hershberger was one of 24 amish men and women who 
appeared thursday before fillmore county district court judge 
margaret shaw johnson 
hershberger was ticketed in october and again in february he 
refused to pay a 20 fine or perform five hours of community 
service and was cited for contempt of court 
after finding him guilty johnson offered him a choice of a 150 
fine doing 30 hours of community service or serving seven days in 
jail hershberger chose jail what else can a conscientious 
objector do he asked later 
each of the other defendants pleaded not guilty to violating 
state law but then admitted the facts against them were true 
the judge found them guilty religious conviction in this case 
is not a defense to the charge she told one defendant 
though they were only fined most of the amish said they think 
theyll eventually follow hershberger to jail they have until 
november to pay fines or perform community service

west berlin police today chased nearly 200 
squatters from a disputed piece of land near the berlin wall after 
a monthlong struggle that pitted environmentalists against city 
developers 
when the removal order came the squatters found an unusual 
escape route over the berlin wall into the citys communist side 
east german border guards helped them over the barrier which 
divides the city of berlin into allied and communist sectors 
most of the estimated 186 environmentalists who fled to east 
berlin had returned to west berlin by noon nine protesters were 
arrested in the raid eight have since been released police said 
the demonstrators were protesting plans to build a highway 
through a park nearby 
when more than 900 west berlin police moved in to clear the 
area nearly 200 protesters were already sitting on the 
13foothigh wall 
they earlier declared that they would seek political asylum 
in east berlin if west german police tried to rout them 
east german guards backed trucks up to the eastern side of the 
wall to make it easier for the environmentalists to jump down and 
escape the west berlin police 
one smiling east german guard even helped one of the protesters 
by pulling his bicycle over the wall 
the action to clear the squatters from the 10acre piece of 
property known as the lenne triangle occurred after it formally 
came under west berlins control one minute after midnight 
it was handed over under the terms of a deal worked out with 
east berlin this year 
the protesters occupied the area on may 26 and quickly set up a 
shantytown and erected barriers to protect them from police charges 
the property has been the scene of frequent violent skirmishes 
between police and demonstrators protesters often attacked police 
with bottles stones and molotov cocktails and officers responded 
with tear gas and water cannons 
police could not legally enter the property until it came under 
west berlin control

parliament today condemned a romanian 
plan to resettle ethnic hungarians and called on bucharest to 
reconsider the move 
the resolution made no reference to romanias decision this week 
to close a hungarian consulate and expell its staff it also didnt 
mention the order to close a hungarian cultural center in the 
romanian capital 
matyas szueroes head of the foreign relations committee that 
drafted the document appealed to hungarians not to yield to 
emotions regarding the disquieting developments reported from 
romania 
hungary maintains the program of moving residents of 7000 
villages to new agriculturalindustrial centers would destroy 
ethnic hungarian culture and tradition in romania romania says it 
would help villagers by providing services now enjoyed only in 
cities 
romanias treatment of its 17 million hungarian residents has 
long been a sticky issue between the two warsaw pact allies 
hungary claims the hungarian minority is discriminated against 
bucharest says hungarys criticism is interference in romanias 
internal affairs 
romania on tuesday closed hungarys consulate in cluj in 
transylvania home to most of romanias ethnic hungarians to 
protest a demonstration by 50000 people in budapest against the 
resettlement program 
bucharest also insisted that the hungarian embassy move out of 
rooms rented for a cultural center 
official media in hungary reported that romanian authorities 
also were sending back some hungarian travelers without giving any 
reason for the move a hungarian border official who spoke on 
condition he not be identified said today there was no official 
ban 
the parliamentary document which is to be sent to the romanian 
legislature said the beginning of the romanian program would 
further weaken hungarianromanian relations 
the document said hungary hoped romania would reexamine its 
plans and will refrain from their implementation 
this would remove an important obstacle to the rapprochement 
between the hungarian and romanian people the document said 
on thursday communist party chief karoly grosz appealed for 
dialogue with romania 
grosz who is also premier said the tension was temporary and 
warned against drawing longterm conclusions 
he told western journalists he would go ahead with a planned 
visit to romania because if we dont talk to each other we cannot 
understand each other 
no date for the trip has been announced but it is believed 
grosz will go to bucharest after visits in july to moscow warsaw 
and washington 
on thursday a hungarian diplomat in bucharest said romania had 
declared hungarys cultural center in the romanian capital closed 
and ordered the embassy to vacate the building 
the cultural center was never issued a permit to start operation 
and has been used as a storage for the embassy in recent years

romanias move to shut down a hungarian 
consulate was unprecedented in the warsaw pact alliance and shows 
how historically rooted ethnic strife can foul up sovietled 
attempts to forge unity in east europe 
seventy years after romania gained the region of transylvania 
from hungary the two neighbors are still bickering over treatment 
of the 17 million ethnic hungarians who live in the fictional 
homeland of count dracula 
in the past two years the dispute has escalated sharply 
pointing up the difference between hungarys reformminded 
communism and the inflexible regime of nicolae ceausescu which is 
increasingly isolated even among its east bloc allies 
romanias decision tuesday to close the general consulate in 
clujnapoca in transylvania came in retaliation for an 
antiromanian rally in budapest the hungarian capital on monday 
night about 50000 hungarians protested romanias plans to destroy 
7000 romanian villages including hundreds of hungarian 
communities 
today the hungarian parliament condemned the resettlement plan 
and urged bucharest to reconsider the move 
hungary maintains the plan would destroy the hungarians 
cultural heritage and ultimately wipe out hungarian and other 
minorities in romania 
romanian officials said the villages to be razed by the year 
2000 would be replaced by agriculturalindustrial centers designed 
to remove differences between country and city dwellers 
hungarian officials at a mass meeting on budapests heroes 
square monday evening said hungary probably will seek international 
support to pressure romania to cancel the project 
but ceausescu on tuesday rejected hungarian protests as 
nationalistic chauvinistic antiromanian and antisocialist 
ceausescus address indicated that relations have reached their 
lowest ebb in postwar communist history 
hungary long has complained about acts of official 
discrimination against its hungarian minority across the border and 
asserted that its people are denied important cultural and ethnic 
rights 
the ethnic hungarians known in romania as magyars live in a 
21000squaremile area of some of the most picturesque mountain 
and farm land in the balkans 
the land was under hungarian control for nine centuries but was 
given to romania on dec 1 1919 as part of the dismemberment of 
the austrohungarian empire after world war i 
nazi dictator adolf hitler returned much of the land to hungary 
during world war ii in appreciation of the loyalty of the countrys 
ruler adm nicholas horthy after the war the allies gave 
transylvania back to romania 
the romanians support their claim to the land by arguing that 
romanized dacians their apparent ancestors stayed in the area 
after the romans withdrew from what is now romania in the 3rd 
century ad 
but hungarian scholars maintain the dacians withdrew along with 
their roman protectors south of the danube river and that the 
magyars found a largely empty country when they drifted in from 
asia in the 9th century 
budapest relinquished its claim to transylvania by signing the 
1975 helsinki agreements recognizing postwar borders but the 
hungarian government and people remain deeply interested in the 
areas hungarian minority 
treatment of national minorities in romania is synonymous with 
south african apartheid hungarian poet gyula illyes said 10 
years ago 
the romanian government says its treatment of the hungarian and 
german minorities is fair it accuses budapest of chauvinism and 
interfererence in its internal affairs and says hungary is trying 
to regain transylvania 
last april hungary strongly criticized romania for decreeing 
that romanianlanguage place names must be used for cities and 
villages traditionally known to the countrys ethnic minorities in 
their own language 
in march hungary took the unprecedented action of approving 
about 6 million to help thousands of ethnic hungarian refugees who 
have fled the shortages and harsh living conditions in romania 
the refugees believed to number up to 20000 now also include 
several hundred romanian speakers who are seeking to settle in the 
west

president kurt waldheim today withdrew a 
slander suit filed against edgar bronfman president of the world 
jewish congress a spokesman said bronfman last year called 
waldheim part and parcel of the nazi killing machine 
spokesman gerold christian told the associated press that 
waldheim cited three reasons for the move in a letter sent to the 
vienna prosecutors office 
first the us justice department has refused legal 
assistance which is in contrast to international legal norms 
and this ruled out a quick court action christian said 
second the international commission of historians private 
undertakings as well as international historians have determined 
waldheims personal innocence 
third there is an endeavor on the part of the president to 
contribute to calming down and reconciliation he said 
the us justice department said in december 1987 that it has 
evidence of waldheims complicity in the transfer of civilian 
prisoners to the nazi ss for exploitation in labor camps during 
world war ii the deportations of jews from greek islands to 
concentration or death camps the execution of allied prisoners and 
the execution of hostages and other civilians 
waldheim has denied wrongdoing 
christian said waldheim stopped the suit also to calm things 
down for austria because the country always has priority over 
personal matters 
it was believed that waldheim decided to stop legal proceedings 
against bronfman because there was virtually no chance for the 
court action ever to take place in austria and even less chance 
that it would take place in the united states 
with the justice department unwilling to cooperate by having 
bronfman testify in a us court and with bronfman refusing to 
appear in an austrian court the lawsuit might never have been 
resolved 
a report issued by an international commission of historians in 
february did not say if waldheim was involved in wartime atrocities 
but it made clear that as an intelligence officer in the german 
army he was aware of them and did nothing to prevent them 
the document seriousl questioned waldheims integrity and led to 
widespread calls for his resignation but the austrian head of 
state refused to comply insisting that the historians had cleared 
him of all charges 
waldheim called on the vienna prosecutors office to sue 
bronfman on may 7 1987 two days after the world jewish congress 
president said he was part and parcel of the nazi killing 
machine while serving in the balkans during the war 
according to a presidential statement issued at the time the 
lawsuit was also based on a comment by bronfman who reportedly said 
if waldheim has any patriotism in his soul whatsoever his 
doctors would find reasons for him to resign his post 
the third bronfman comment cited by the president said 
waldheims misdeeds and his lying about his past were so 
obvious that it would be almost a crime against humanity to have 
very much to do with this man

an inmate has been transferred from a 
federal prison for violating a ban on working as a reporter and 
the prisoners editor called the move punishment for criticizing 
the warden in print 
dannie m martin 48 whose june 19 article on conditions at 
lompoc federal penitentiary appeared in the san francisco 
chronicleexaminer was moved thursday to another facility said 
lompoc associate warden paul hofer 
i feel dannie has been transferred as a punitive response to 
material the chronicle chose to print in order to keep its readers 
informed on important issues said peter sussman editor of the 
sunday feature section that has published 20 articles by martin in 
the past two years 
convicts have the right to communicate with news media under 
special mail rights and the paper had a first amendment right to 
publish he added 
hofer said in a statement that martin was transferred for 
violating prison regulations against inmates working as journalists 
sussman said he could not discuss whether martin was paid for 
his articles 
martin serving time for bank robbery was put in an isolation 
ward for 24 hours last week by warden richard rison after a story 
by martin accused rison of turning the prison into a caldron of 
fear hatred and violence 
the headline over the story read gulag mentality 
among other things martin criticized risons policy of keeping 
the recreation yard closed until noon those of us who work on 
night jobs and ran and exercised in the mornings now sit in gloomy 
cell blocks watching the sun shine through the window bars he 
wrote 
rison said that he put martin in confinement to protect him from 
other inmates angered by the article he said a reference to 
possible riots at the maximumsecurity prison could spark a 
demonstration 
martin was returned to the general prison population after an 
investigation determined he was under no threat 
hofer said martins intention to continue writing for the 
newspaper jeopardizes the safe and orderly operation of the 
institution and cannot be tolerated 
martins destination could not be released until he arrived 
there prison officials said 
martins next article will appear sunday and describes his stay 
in confinement said sussman martin talks about his fear of 
transfer in the report 
the two san francisco papers produce a joint edition on sunday 
with the examiner handling news and the chronicle handling features

norden systems inc under investigation 
for allegedly receiving confidential bidding information on a 
marines corps air command system has withdrawn its bid on the 120 
million contract its parent company said today 
norden became the first known contractor to fall out of a 
competition in the wake of the us defense department scandal 
norden based in norwalk had been considered a top contender for 
the advanced tactical air command control contract 
the company which manufactures radar systems and other military 
electronic materials is a subsidiary of united technologies corp 
a leading defense contractor based here 
norden pulled out of the competition on june 24 10 days after 
investigators disclosed that the company was among those implicated 
in the illegal sharing of classified or proprietary information 
among pentagon employees private consultants and defense industry 
contractors 
no reassignments or change in duties have been made in 
connection with the investigation larry bingaman a utc 
spokesman said today 
utc made the letter public after an inquiry from a reporter 
bingaman said the los angeles times reported nordens withdrawal 
from the competition in todays editions 
we believe at this point in time that it is of paramount 
importance for the public as well as the government to have full 
confidence in the integrity of the procurement process louis 
a antonucci norden manager of contracts wrote in the letter 
given the background of the current investigation and that the 
relevant facts have not yet been developed we have concluded that 
norden systems withdrawal from the competition is the best 
course for us to follow the letter continued 
the letter states that norden would be pleased to reconsider 
its decision to withdraw if the government were to delay a final 
decision on awarding the contract until more details of the scandal 
are known 
on june 14 federal investigators searched norden offices in the 
east norwalk section of norwalk bridgeport and trumbull a day 
later the shelton home of james e rapinac a norden senior vice 
president for business development also was searched 
the contract that norden sought calls for the construction of a 
hightech portable shelter used near a battlefield to control 
aircraft in all kinds of weather an fbi affidavit said the 
contract is worth about 120 million 
the affidavit said navy civilian employee george g stone called 
defense consultant mark c saunders at home on sept 30 1987 and 
read him sealed bid figures on the contract by 10 potential 
suppliers including norden norden had submitted its bid on aug 
24 1987

the steelblue early hairstreak 
butterfly was spotted in massachusetts for the first time in nearly 
a century a naturalist said 
edna dunbar said she saw 20 early hairstreaks considered one of 
the rarest butterflies in the united states in the beginning of 
june on mount greylock the states highest peak 
dunbar saw four early hairstreaks on june 13 one of which she 
netted in the two weeks that followed several more were spotted 
by her and other audubon members on greylock 
when i netted it i knew it was something i hadnt seen 
before she said i looked it up in the guide and realized what 
i had 
naturally i was excited she said when a fisherman 
catches a big fish he gets excited its the same idea 
chris leahy director of the audubon societys conservation 
department and coordinator of the massachusetts butterfly atlas 
project called the early hairstreak one of the great mysterious 
species of the world

butterfly leahy said since then nobody has seen it and it is 
right at the top of the list of everybodys great finds

gasoline stations across poland on friday 
struggled to cope with demand when gasoline without ration coupons 
went on sale legally for the first time since 1981 
customers at gasoline station no 560 on silver street in warsaw 
waited an average of four hours in the hot sun to pay 269 a 
gallon compared with the ration price of 158 a gallon 
by midday station manager roman magnuszewski and his coworkers 
had pumped as much gasoline as they normally had in an entire day 
when the station sold rationed gasoline 
faces fell when a young man asked for 364 gallons at a cost of 
98 about the average monthly wage he filled his car and six big 
canisters enduring hostile comments from fellow customers 
at noon a truck delivered more gas reassuring those at the end 
of the 120car line monitored by police to prevent double parking 
the primarily male clientele read picnicked and played cards 
while waiting 
the delivery driver brought word that four more gas stations 
would sell the unrationed gas in addition to the two stations 
initially authorized for warsaw a city of 15 million people some 
of the customers made a mad dash for the newly added stations 
people are satisfied because they can at least get gasoline 
now said magnuszewski 
staterun tv reported the new regulations and said customers 
interviewed had thanked the state gas monopoly for the opportunity 
to buy unrationed gas 
the impatient customers at station no 560 seemed to think 
otherwise 
its a bad idea a scandal its very uncomfortable to stand 
in this crowd of machines i see the crowd and i dont want to 
stand in line said krzystof tom he ultimately took a place in 
line 
some people feared the new regulations are a government ruse to 
raise prices even further 
the government announced the regulations tuesday 
the central oil products monopoly initially planned to make the 
unrationed gasoline available at 64 gas stations nationwide 
the state monopolys director jerzy szewczyk said about 60 
million gallons nonrationed gasoline would be sold at the higher 
price this year less than 10 percent of all gasoline to be sold in 
poland and that if demand exceeded supply the price would be 
raised 
a sufficient supply of gas is a constant concern for polish car 
owners under current regulations every private car owner receives 
a monthly gas ration based on the car size 
owners of small cars are entitled to 62 gallons while those 
with medium and large cars can get 94 gallons additional gasoline 
could be purchased on a blackmarket basis at some stations but 
even that source does not meet demand 
the government introduced rationing in mid1981 when panic 
buying during the solidarity period resulted in periodic shortages 
most of the oil poland needs to manufacture gasoline comes from 
the soviet union which has been reluctant to increase supplies to 
its east bloc allies especially now that it too faces energy 
shortages poland lacks hard currency to buy much crude on the 
world market

secretary of state george p shultz 
met today with president oscar arias after discussing with 
nicaraguan rebels possible ways of making arias regional peace 
plan succeed 
hundreds of flagwaving costa rican children greeted shultz 
after he flew here following visits to guatemala honduras and el 
salvador 
shultz is on the last stop of his threeday central american 
tour he spent thursday night in guatemala city adolfo calero a 
leader of the nicaraguan rebels said today in guatemala that the 
administration and prorebel members of congress are considering a 
30 million aid package for the rebels over a sixmonth period 
a portion of the money perhaps 7 million would be placed in 
an escrow account and released as military aid for the contras if 
nicaraguas government does not meet democratic reforms mandated in 
arias peace plan calero said 
there was no immediate word on what shultz and arias discussed 
administration officials said shultz and rebel leaders only touched 
briefly on the contra issue 
arias won the nobel peace prize in 1987 for drawing up a plan 
that calls for ceasefires in central americas wars democratic 
reforms and an end to outside aid to insurgents 
shultz met with the rebel leadership after visiting el salvador 
and honduras for talks with top officials thursday he began his 
central american tour in guatemala wednesday 
shultz said thursday in tegucigalpa honduras that he has 
shared ideas with central american leaders on a diplomatic solution 
to the nicaraguan problem but he gave no details 
he said he planned to discuss these ideas with president reagan 
and members of congress after his return to washington 
contra supporters in the congress have been discussing the 
possibility of seeking approval for new military aid for the rebels 
to be placed in an escrow account 
the contras have received no military aid since feb 29 and 
congressional approval of a new package of lethal assistance 
without conditions is thought to have scant support among lawmakers 
congress approved a 17 million humanitarian aid package in late 
march after the rebels and the sandinista government agreed on an 
interim ceasefire 
efforts by the sandinistas and the contras to reach agreement on 
a permanent ceasefire broke down june 9 and no new talks have been 
scheduled 
the contras have said the sandinistas backed away from their 
earlier promises to enact democratic reforms the sandinistas have 
said the contras were just using the talks as a pretext to get more 
us military aid 
a senior us official who briefed reporters after shultz 
meeting with the contras said the possibility of resuming 
negotiations was discussed 
so far the administration has said only that it plans to seek 
renewed aid for the contras but no final decision on a package was 
to be made until after shultzs trip 
the administration by weighing the possibility of offering us 
assistance to the sandinistas appears to believe that nicaragua 
may be receptive to a proposal that would benefit it economically 
despite massive support from the soviet bloc the nicaraguan 
economy has continued to unravel crippled by the civil war 
on several occasions during his central america trip shultz has 
quoted sandinista officials as saying nicaraguas inflation rate 
this year is running at 20000 percent 
economic aid would be a sharp reversal of reagan administration 
policy in addition to funding the contras the administration has 
a trade embargo against nicaragua

the us missile frigate samuel b 
roberts headed for home friday riding out of the persian gulf on 
the back of another ship 11 weeks after an iranian mine nearly sank 
it 
the 3600ton warship rode in a special cradle atop the mighty 
servant 2 a heavylift cargo vessel the navy chartered from a 
dutch salvage firm for 13 million 
emergency repairs to the frigates badly ripped hull were made 
at dubai its early morning departure from the emirate in the 
southern gulf was a surprise because us military officials had 
indicated earlier the roberts would pass through the narrow strait 
of hormuz at night for security reasons 
as the mighty servant 2 and its piggyback cargo approached the 
strait the the us missile cruiser vincennes fired an artillery 
salute the vincennes was on patrol near hormuz where iran has 
threatened shipping with gunboats and missile batteries since early 
in its 8yearold war with iraq 
about 30 of its crew members are accompanying the roberts to 
newport ri on a trip expected to take about 40 days us 
officials said the frigate would be rebuilt at the shipyard in 
bath maine where it was launched in 1986 
officials have denied reports the 400 million ship would be 
scrapped but hull damage from the april 14 mine explosion was so 
extensive that salvage experts advised against trying to tow it 
across the stormy atlantic 
departure of the sammy b as crewmen called their ship

about 6000 pounds of cocaine concealed 
in blocks of melted chocolate was confiscated and three men were 
arrested in what authorities described today as the largest seizure 
of cocaine in the northeast 
the drugs have a street value of about 480 million said robert 
stutman head of the federal drug enforcement agency in new york 
the cocaine was discovered june 24 aboard a us cargo ship 
coming from ecuador into port newark nj said us customs agent 
peter baish in charge of the newark office baish said it was a 
cold hit meaning inspectors had no previous tip about the 
shipment 
he said inspectors decided to drill a hole in several of 1200 
cardboard cartons marked cocoa because it had come from ecuador a 
frequent exporter of cocaine 
the smugglers had poured melted chocolate on the bottom of each 
carton concealed the cocaine in a metal container and plastic 
sleeve in the center and then poured melted chocolate over it 
letting it harden baish said 
at least 779 of the cartons had cocaine in the middle said 
stutman he said officials were still opening the boxes 
customs agents resealed the boxes and watched as they were taken 
to toronto imports inc in an industrial section of hicksville on 
thursday baish said 
when the men inside the warehouse began opening the boxes some 
50 law enforcement agents moved in stutman said 
he said the three men arrested are believed to be connected to 
the ochoa family in medellin colombia which he described as one 
of the largest producers and exporters of cocaine 
they were identified as absalon borrero 42 of miami jaime 
caro 48 of anza colombia and oscar nunez 28 of queens 
stutman said they were charged with importation and distribution of 
cocaine and conspiracy to distribute cocaine

soviet president andrei a gromyko was honored 
with the chairmanship of a session of the national communist party 
conference on friday one day after he was criticized for 
contributing to the countrys stagnation 
soviet television showed gromyko 78 standing at a lectern in 
the kremlins palace of congress as he opened the morning session 
on thursday vladimir i melnikov party boss in the russian 
republics region of komi told the conference that soviets want 
high officials who served under leonid i brezhnev removed 
those who in the past actively promoted the policy of 
stagnation may not serve and work on the central party and 
government bodies now melnikov said 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev interrupted to ask who 
melnikov had in mind and among those the komi official listed was 
gromyko 
the official news agency tass said a delegate later sent a note 
to the conference organizers saying gromyko who spent 28 years as 
foreign minister had devoted his life to communism 
but it added we have worked him too hard and comrade gromyko 
today has fallen behind the times 
when gromyko was named to the largely ceremonial post of 
president in 1985 observers believed this was a graceful way to 
move the elder statesman out of the mainstream of soviet 
policymaking the criticism of him at the conference might 
indicate he will be eased out of the leadership entirely 
the chairmanship of the conference is also largely ceremonial 
and was rotated among most of the 13 members of the partys ruling 
politburo another of melnikovs targets mikhail s solomentsev

when rep lee hamilton was picked to chair the 
house panel investigating the irancontra affair the 
wellrespected but relatively littleknown indiana democrat found 
himself thrust into the limelight 
during the weeks of nationally televised joint house and senate 
hearings amid a cast of colorful characters like fawn hall and 
oliver north hamilton displayed the traits he was best known for 
on capitol hill caution fairness evenhandedness 
when the hearings ended hamilton resumed his usual low profile 
but in recent weeks hes been flirting with fame again mentioned 
as a possible running mate for democratic nomineetobe michael 
dukakis 
hamilton appeared with dukakis as the massachusetts governor 
made a campaign visit to indiana on thursday night at a town 
meeting in terre haute local democrats were selling 
dukakishamilton buttons for a dollar each 
not bad not bad dukakis said when he was presented with 
one has kind of a nice ring to it doesnt it 
dukakis aides say the two got acquainted at a dinner before 
indianas may 3 primary which dukakis won handily 
i think there is a great deal of mutual respect said 
dukakis spokesman mark gearan 
hamiltons office says he has complied with the dukakis 
campaigns request for detailed background information being sought 
from prospective running mates on everything from his finances to 
his driving record 
christopher edley issues director for the dukakis campaign 
said the massachusetts governor has consulted hamilton on a variety 
of issues particularly foreign affairs 
hamilton 57 joined the house foreign affairs committee as a 
freshman congressman in 1965 he is now second in line behind 
chairman dante fascell and is seen as likely to come into the 
chairmanship eventually after the 1984 election he was picked to 
chair the house intelligence committee 
many observers believe dukakis will choose a running mate with 
strong foreign affairs experience to make up for his own lack of 
background in that area 
but even with his foreignpolicy expertise as a selling point 
hamiltons chances of being tapped for the no 2 spot on the 
democratic ticket appear remote he himself plays down the prospect 
i guess i still feel it would be rather unusual for him to 
come to indiana for a nominee hamilton told the indianapolis 
news were a relatively small state we dont have a large 
number of electoral votes 
and hamilton might not even be able to deliver his home state in 
the general election indiana is traditionally republican 
however that rule doesnt seem to apply in hamiltons district 
he was elected by a landslide in 1964 and has won reelection by 
large margins in 1976 the republicans didnt even bother fielding 
a candidate 
the son of a methodist minister hamilton shares some 
personality traits with dukakis neither could be described as 
flamboyant both are cerebral types lawyerly lawyers 
they have in common a dogged competitive streak hamilton was a 
high school basketball star in evansville ind leading his team 
to the state finals and he played college basketball at depauw 
university 
like dukakis hamilton has a reputation for being earnest and 
straitlaced hamilton for decades has sported a 1950sstyle crew 
cut he told an interviewer last year that he has let his hair grow 
out only once while he was attending goethe university in 
frankfurt west germany on scholarship before going to law school 
at indiana university 
it was the only time i ever let my hair grow long he said 
i just wasnt comfortable with it 
hamilton appears to share dukakis conviction that a 
wellmanaged government can cure many ills when the irancontra 
hearings ended many of the committee members especially 
democrats expressed dismay about the foreignpolicy fiasco that 
had unfolded in the testimony they heard 
hamilton agreed with his fellow legislators that the hearings 
had been depressing but he also struck a positive note saying 
the process has been refreshing 
we know better what happened and what mistakes were made 
hamilton said we can see more clearly what needs to be done to 
make our system work better

along just 35 miles of interstate 
state police cpl robert j durnan confiscated 7 million worth of 
drugs money and guns last year during otherwise routine stops for 
traffic violations 
you get a sense like youre absolutely doing something good 
said durnan who isnt sure how many arrests he made on delawares 
short segment of i95 nothing beats the thrill of making that 
arrest 
durnan 35 is one of a special breed that federal drug 
enforcement administration official ron gospodarek calls super 
cops 
in 33 states highway patrol officers on routine patrol are part 
of operation pipeline using traffic stops to collar criminals 
and make big drug busts instead of just writing speeding tickets 
he said 
nationwide 8 percent of the nations cocaine seizures in 1987 
were executed during traffic stops and 186 million in cash was 
seized according to the dea 
operation pipeline which began slowly in 198384 has 
forced a nationwide rerouting of drug traffic said gospodarek who 
coordinates the program 
but it is also drawing criticism from defense lawyers and the 
american civil liberties union who contend the stops are pretenses 
for drug searches and therefore violate the fourth amendment 
prohibition against unlawful search and seizure 
in some cases the stops are discriminatory said atlanta 
attorney don samuel 
the real question is whether the people are stopped for 
absolutely legitimate reasons and subsequently an officers 
suspicion is aroused and he then asks consent or if a cop sees two 
hispanic males in a cadillac with florida plates and sees them 
going 66 mph thats not a legitimate stop said samuel 
samuel said the courts have not ruled definitively on the issue 
some courts say if the cars going 66 mph in a 65 mph zone 
thats a reasonable stop he said other courts say if the only 
person stopped is a hispanic male driving a cadillac thats not 
reasonable 
state police and dea officials say the key to the arrests is 
good police work and that they do not have a profile of the type of 
person to pull over 
its strictly a traffic officer who makes a legal traffic stop 
and looks beyond it said gospodarek a lot of troopers making 
the seizures are the same guys over and over theyre super cops 
the officers say their success is based on awareness 
i believe after youve made your first one it just gets in 
your system the adrenalin gets flowing said georgia state 
patrol officer mike ralston 34 who patrols i75 a northward 
route out of florida it makes you want to get back out there and 
make another one 
i got it bad ill stay out there all night said another 
georgia state patrol officer benji hodges dea estimates 154 
pounds of cocaine an hour pass through georgia on the interstate 
he said 
hodges 27 and ralston each seized about 400 pounds of cocaine 
last year 
its a lot of fun you never know what youll get into 
hodges said 
after making a traffic stop officers look for a number of signs 
among those listed by durnan hodges and other officers were 
nervousness signs of false walls or altered gas tanks the smell 
of air freshener conflicting stories from driver and passenger or 
the driver of a car not listed as stolen who cant identify the 
owner 
officers then ask permission to search the car or get a search 
warrant gospodarek said 
he and other officers interviewed said rarely does a driver 
refuse consent 
albuquerque nm defense attorney nancy hollander says thats 
because stopped drivers arent often asked but several officers 
said its because traffickers are confident the drugs are well 
hidden 
drug traffickers attempt to avoid areas of high numbers of 
arrests but they dont always succeed 
new jersey state police detective walter butz said he and his 
colleagues have made lots of arrests where they had maps to avoid 
new jersey he said the traffickers got lazy and ignored their 
route instructions

extraordinarily valuable to the ticket

construction spending advanced 11 percent in 
may as strength in office and factory construction offset weakness 
in other areas the government reported friday 
the commerce department said building activity rose to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4071 billion in may following 
a 02 percent dip in april 
the may gain the strongest since a 28 percent rise in march 
came entirely from gains in nonresidential construction which 
rose 43 percent to an annual rate of 989 billion 
the increase was led by a 78 percent advance in office 
construction which pushed this category up by 11 percent over may 
1987 and a 77 percent advance in factory construction where 
activity was 228 percent higher than a year ago 
analysts said the rise in office construction after a sustained 
period of weakness reflected strong activity in certain sections 
of the country such as the northeast and a halt to the giant plunge 
in building which had occurred in the southwest hard hit because 
of troubles in the oil patch 
cities such as chicago new york boston and washington dc 
are enjoying good economic growth and a fair amount of offfice 
construction said richard peach senior economist for the 
mortgage bankers association this is happening while the sharp 
declines in other areas have at least bottomed out 
peach said the big jump in factory construction reflected the 
capital spending boom occuring as manufacturers rush to expand 
capacity to meet sharply higher demand for us exports 
residential construction fell 1 percent during may to an annual 
rate of 1934 billion reflecting a 13 percent drop in 
construction of singlefamily homes which offset a 24 percent rise 
in the smaller apartment sector analysts do not expect much 
strength in this area during the year particularly because of high 
vacancy rates in the apartment sector and the loss of tax 
advantages for investing in housing real estate 
government construction projects edged down 03 percent in may 
to an annual rate of 789 billion with highway construction the 
biggest segment in the government sector suffering a 74 percent 
decline 
the various changes left overall construction spending 23 
percent higher than it was a year ago

a federal appeals court has refused to 
allow the reagan administration to begin random drug testing of all 
13000 federal prison employees during an appeal of a ruling 
prohibiting the program 
in an order made public friday judges dorothy nelson and 
william norris of the 9th us circuit court of appeals denied the 
administrations request to let the testing program proceed while 
the case is appealed 
us district judge stanley weigel blocked the program from 
taking effect as scheduled may 23 and then issued a preliminary 
injunction june 16 that continues the ban until a unions lawsuit 
against the program goes to trial 
weigel said the government had shown no justification for 
testing innocent lawabiding and wholly competent workers he 
noted that the proposed drug testing would apply to clerical 
employees outside the prison walls as well as armed guards 
the bureau of prisons is appealing his ruling and asked the 
appeals court for a stay that would have allowed testing to begin 
the bureau was to have been one of the first federal agencies to 
implement drug testing under a september 1986 executive order by 
president reagan who ordered testing of all federal workers in 
sensitive jobs the bureau has declared all of its employees 
hold sensitive jobs 
the program would require random testing of 5 percent to 10 
percent of the bureau of prisons staff each year with additional 
testing of managers probationary employees and those involved in 
accidents workers showing signs of illegal drug use could be 
disciplined the first time and fired the second time 
the suit by the american federation of government employees 
contends drug testing without individual suspicion of drug use 
violates the constitutional ban on unreasonable searches and 
seizures the suit also claims violations of federal laws banning 
discrimination against the handicapped and requiring discipline to 
be based on job performance 
the supreme court has agreed to rule on reagan administration 
drug testing programs involving customs employees and railroad 
workers in cases to be heard in the term that begins this fall

salvage workers today resumed 
efforts to raise a sunken tanker after toxic chemicals began 
leaking from the ship dutch television reported 
television reports said workers sawed the dutch chemical tanker 
anna broere into two pieces and planned to hoist the parts from the 
floor of the north sea it said none of the highly poisonous 
acrylonitrile stored in tanks escaped during the operation 
on thursday salvage crews had to flee when an acrylonitrile 
tank suddenly sprang a leak during efforts to lift the ship a 
coast guard spokesman said no injuries were reported 
workers used a 16ton chain to separate the ships back section 
which contains the engine room from the front part where the tanks 
are located the television report said 
crews have been trying to salvage the ship and its dangerous 
cargo since may 27 when the anna broere sank after a collision 
with a freighter off the netherlands west coast it was carrying 
1600 tons of acrylonitrile a highly carcinogenic and inflammable 
agent used by the plastics industry 
the two sections were expected to lifted to the surface during 
the weekend the report said 
water samples taken during thursdays salvage attempt showed a 
sudden increase in the levels of acrylonitrile in the water at the 
site according to a coast guard official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
he said that at about 930 pm thursday those levels rose to 
more than seven times the amount considered safe by the dutch 
environment ministry 
the divers immediately boarded small boats kept nearby for 
emergencies after the release of the toxic chemicals the spokesman 
said 
a first attempt to salvage the anna broere failed when two of 
the four steel cables holding the vessel broke causing the ship to 
disappear in the waves again

grasshoppers and other insects left hungry by 
the drought are wreaking havoc on what remains in farm fields 
while young trees are depending on young people scooping buckets of 
water from city lakes to sustain them 
the good news is a low mosquito population this summer but 
id rather have the moisture on my grass says ross green of 
the metropolitan mosquito control district in st paul 
yellowjackets and wasps may take the place of mosquitoes and be 
more aggressive at picnics and near garbage cans as they search for 
food said university of minnesota entomologist jeffrey hahn 
it could be that they just die from a lack of food but it 
also could be that they will be driven to interact with people when 
they might not normally do that he said 
other insects also are taking a toll 
weve definitely seen more treatment for grasshoppers than at 
any time i remember said carlyle holen area extension agent in 
crop pest management in northwestern minnesotas crookston office 
many thousands of acres have been treated over the past month 
and there still are fields that need treatment that perhaps the 
farmers havent even discovered yet he said 
wheatstem maggots normally found in 1 percent of the fields in 
the red river valley are showing up this summer in 30 percent to 
40 percent of the fields holen said the maggots sever wheat and 
barley stems 
dry weather appears to be responsible for a large drop in the 
number of european corn borers that feed on corn plant leaves and 
later bore into the stem 
record dryness coupled with nearrecord heat during the past few 
months has stressed young trees and forced wildlife to change their 
habits 
young trees planted in minneapolis over the past several years 
to replace those ravaged by dutch elm disease are facing the dual 
threat of insufficient moisture and hungry insects such as aphids 
and bark beetles said hahn 
the minneapolis park board this week recruited 260 innercity 
young people to dip buckets into the citys lakes and pour the 
water on young trees nearby the lakes highly popular for sailing 
swimming and picnicking are down slightly 
the city already maintains its 160000 young trees planted in 
the past 10 years with 23 water trucks but the concern now is to 
spread the word via the bucket brigade to homeowners 
we thought that if people down at the lakes saw all the kids 
down there watering the trees that are starting to wilt and dry 
people will catch on to the news that many of the small trees are 
wilting and severely stressed and that they all should be out there 
watering said parks board special projects director paul domholt 
minneapolis which draws all its water from the depleted 
mississippi river has instituted limited lawn sprinkling 
restrictions adjacent st paul is seeking voluntary conservation 
both cities have agreed to take stronger measures if the river 
falls below a certain point 
duckhunters face a shortened waterfowl season this year as the 
birds move to regions with more moisture in search of nesting 
sites said tim bremicker resource manager for the minnesota 
department of natural resources 
the drought quickly deteriorated a lot of the good breeding 
wetlands bremicker said the ducks then delay nesting or they 
dont nest at all they move into the northern parklands in 
minnesota where we still have a lot of water comparatively 
biologists also are concerned about other game 
any animal has a preferred climate and when you move outside 
that preferred climate birds or mammals become stressed

for the month the us geological survey reported friday 
the mississippi normally the nations largest river slipped to 
third place in terms of water flow survey figures showed 
falling river levels resulting from the nations ongoing 
drought have stalled barge traffic threatened water quality and 
reduced availability of water for drinking and other uses 
the june flow of the mississippi st lawrence and columbia 
rivers marked a decline from may when their flow was 37 percent 
below normal the survey reported their total flow had been 8 
percent below average in april which is considered within the 
normal range

gallons per day during june the agency said 
the lowest previous combined june flow for the three in 60 
years of record keeping was 484 billion gallons per day in 1934

cleaning up environmental contamination and 
correcting existing problems at the nations nuclear weapons plants 
could cost between 40 billion and 70 billion according to a 
government report released friday 
and the department of energy report said the price tag could be 
as high as 110 billion in order to maintain the environmental 
safety and health standards at the plants through the year 2045 
the report was released by sen john glenn dohio who had 
requested it as chairman of the senate governmental affairs 
committee 
glenn said the report puts a price tag on the departments 
shameful neglect toward the health and safety of the public 
we have a choice of paying the price with money or with the 
health and safety of our children and grandchildren glenn said 
those who would choose to poison our own people in order to make 
nuclear weapons should be asked what the weapons are supposed to 
protect us from 
the department issued two sets of estimates an expected 
projection representing the most likely requirements for each site 
and a high projection of what could be required to meet more 
stringent interpretations of existing laws regulations and 
policies that could reasonably be imposed on the defense plants 
within those bounds the cleanup of contaminated sites and 
corrective actions could require between 40 billion and 70 
billion in addition to an ongoing base program of 700 million per 
year the department concluded 
however glenn said the estimate does not include the cost of 
highlevel waste disposal longterm monitoring the 
decommissioning of abandoned nuclear reactors and modernizing the 
weapons complex 
the figure of 110 billion is labeled a high estimate by 
doe but i believe it is more likely to be a floor rather than a 
ceiling glenn said 
the departments evaluation included 18 defense plants it said 
most of the remedial cleanup actions could be completed within 20 
years 
environmental corrective actions could include such things as 
improvements in stack exhaust construction of radioactive waste 
treatment facilities upgrading drinking water supplies and other 
activities 
the department cautioned that the cost projections do not 
represent proposed action by the reagan administration it said the 
report identifies needs and will be used to formulate 
longrange plans but that a decision to adopt the actions has not 
been made 
by far the largest single price tag for cleanup and corrective 
actions is for the hanford nuclear reservation in richland wash 
the facility established in 1943 recycles uranium and extracts 
plutonium from irradiated nuclear fuel 
the department estimated that cleanup and other costs at hanford 
could reach 48 billion and that it could take until the year 2045 
to complete the job 
the department of energy has finally admitted the size and the 
scope of the defense waste cleanup problems at hanford said sen 
brock adams dwash adding that when estimated costs of other 
projects not included in the report are added the total price tag 
for hanford could reach 64 billion 
the department said a sampling of possible major environmental 
projects at the defense production plants includes 
an environmental restoration program at los alamos national 
laboratory in new mexico 14 billion 
environmental restoration at the hanford site 650 million 
a buried waste program at idaho national engineering laboratory 
in arco idaho 500 million 
environmental restoration at the rocky flats plant in golden 
colo 345 million 
a basin closure program at the savannah river plant in aiken 
sc 70 million 
groundwater and soil investigations at lawrence livermore 
national laboratory in livermore calif 59 million 
waste pit and silo cleanup at the feed materials production 
center near fernald ohio 40 million 
cleanup of polychlorinated biphenyls at the portsmouth gaseous 
diffusion plant near piketon ohio 38 million 
environmental health and safety actions at the mound plant in 
miamisburg ohio 30 million 
the agency also said major safety and health projects could 
include plantwide fire protection at the savannah river plant 200 
million an upgrade of the ventilation system at the fernald plant 
55 million and an asbestos management program at los alamos 52 
million

the head of a traditionalist roman catholic 
seminary in connecticut who was excommunicated as soon as he 
became a bishop said friday he feels some sorrow for pope john 
paul ii and the fight has just begun 
bishop richard williamson also said history will prove 
archbishop marcel lefebvre who consecrated four bishops thursday 
in defiance of the pope is right in opposing modernism in the 
church the vatican excommunicated all five men after the ceremony 
in econe switzerland 
williamson a briton who converted from the anglican church 
recalled that the early christian theologian athanasius was 
excommunicated in the 4th century but eventually made a saint 
athanasius was a champion of orthodoxy in the 4th century intrigues 
over what became known as the arian heresy 
it was proved that athanasius was right all along he told 
the associated press in a telephone interview from econe the site 
of lefebvres swiss seminary 
the schism created by the consecrations and resulting 
excommunications was the first major split in the church since the 
socalled old catholics broke with rome in 1870 after the doctrine 
of papal infallibility was proclaimed 
when asked what practical consequences he expected the vatican 
sanction to bring williamson said 
the fight has just started i hope that the issues begin to 
clear and we will come out of this dreamland in which the devil has 
got vast numbers of people asleep completely unaware there is a 
problem the archbishop said today that he hopes this event will 
lance the abscess of modernist rome 
williamson shrugged off a statement by vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro who predicted 80 percent of lefebvres followers will 
leave him after the excommunication 
poor father navarro he said he lives in a different 
world than from the world i live in 
he was asked whether followers might be shocked by a sentence in 
lefebvres letter to the four new bishops that mentioned 
antichrists occupying the chair of peter and the posts of 
authority in rome 
in response he said christians believe there are many 
antichrists doing the work of the antichrist the one who is 
coming at the end of the world 
any enemy of the church is an antichrist he said it is 
strong language but you have to remember what the church was 30 
years ago and see it today there is no comparison there has been 
a tremendous work of destruction since the second vatican council 
his reference was to the 196265 council that produced reforms 
lefebvre says are spreading the cancer of liberalism in the 
church 
williamson said he was not sorry that the archbishop refused 
to enter into any compromise with those who do not understand 
tradition 
to a question about whether the traditionalists were in schism 
he replied that church documents prove lefbvre is on the side of 
the absolute truth and rome is not therefore it is obviously not 
the archbishop who can be in schism 
williamson 48 said he did not know of the traditionalist 
movement when he converted to catholicism in 1971 when asked why 
he went to lefebvres seminary he said 
i was sent there by a mainstream priest who did not agree with 
the archbishop he is an irishman who said if you keep on opening 
your big mouth there is only one place for you and thats econe 
he said he planned to return on july 7 to his own seminary in 
ridgefield conn which he said has 38 students

a severe drought in mexicos 
northwestern grainbelt is rapidly depleting wells and irrigation 
dams leaving farmers with little more to do than stare at the 
sky 
vital cropland sits idle cattle are dying and the government is 
wondering how it will pay for all the food it will have to import 
weve got 15000 tractors and 2000 harvesting machines doing 
nothing said nicolas de los rios research chief for the 
confederation of agriculture associations in the northwestern 
pacific coastal state of sinaloa 
recent rains in other important agricultural areas prevented a 
national catastrophe although wheat yields are down about 15 
percent and other crops are expected to be off due to late planting 
and low soil moisture 
but farmers and cattle ranchers in the northwest are facing what 
some have said is the worst drought in nearly half a century 
most affected are sinaloa and the northwestern border state of 
sonora they have been dry for nearly a year 
sinaloa is experiencing its worst drought in memory rios 
said in a telephone interview 
more than 20000 head of cattle have died in sonora alone 
arturo ortega president of the state cattle ranchers union told 
the mexico city newspaper el universal 
insufficient moisture in baja california and chihuahua still 
threatens nonirrigated fields and pastureland 
cattle losses in chihuahua mexicos largest state bordering 
texas and new mexico are into the thousands and large parts of the 
state bypassed the cornplanting season due to parched cropland 
chihuahua began importing cattle from the united states last 
week 
in other years farmers would be working intensely right now 
said kenneth shwedel an agriculture economist in mexico city for 
the national bank of mexico 
instead said shwedel theyre staring at the sky 
it has rained in the northeastern border state of nuevo leon 
whose capital is monterrey but the state government in this 
semiarid industrial center announced this week a plan to seed 
clouds so to raise damwater levels 
de los rios said 970000 acres of cropland have been left 
barren meaning production of soybean rice sorghum and corn will 
drop by 11 million tons in sinaloa alone 
were talking about a loss of 15 billion pesos 65 million 
in direct salaries to workers he said 
agriculture production on the northwestern desert lands depends 
largely on irrigation but low water levels in the dams forced the 
cancellation of the spring planting season in some areas 
all of mexicos soybeans half the sorghum and most of the corn 
beans and rice are planted during the spring cycle 
de los rios said the water supply in sinaloas seven dams has 
fallen to 8 percent to 10 percent of total capacity 
sonoras 17 irrigation dams are down to about 25 percent of 
capacity and the supply is dropping said hector roman de vega 
president of the state confederation of agriculture organizations 
cultivations of soybean and sesame have been restricted to 
almost zero in the entire yaqui and mayo valleys de vega said 
the two valleys total nearly 775000 acres 
shwedel said the federal governments inflationfighting program 
will face some tough challenges because of the drought 
were walking on a tightrope he said 
under a plan to reduce inflation that hit a record 159 percent 
last year the government has pledged to reduce spending and froze 
wages and prices of dozens of basic consumer goods 
although many crops have been salvaged mexico still is faced 
with spending 100 million to 700 million more than it did last 
year on imported food and feed according to shwedel in 1987 
mexico spent 13 billion he said

health insurance bill signed into law by president reagan on friday 
hospital full coverage for 365 days a year of hospital bills 
after a onceayear deductible estimated at 564 in 1989 the 
deductible is indexed to rising hospital costs medicare now 
charges a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and 
provides full payment for just 59 days a year 
doctor bills full payment of reasonable and proper doctor 
bills after a 1370 annual cap is met medicare continues to pay 
80 percent of charges after a 75 deductible both the initial 
deductible and the 20 percent patient copayment will count toward 
the 1370 cap patient remains responsible for that portion of 
fees thatexceed the amount allowed by medicare 
drugs medicare pays 50 percent of outpatient drug costs after 
a 600 annual deductible starting in 1991 medicare pays 60 
percent the following year and 80 percent in 1993 and thereafter 
with the deductible to be indexed to rising drug costs medicare 
now has no acrosstheboard prescription drug coverage 
costs to be paid solely by medicare beneficiaries current 
part b premium of 2480 to increase by 4 a month in 1989 by 
1993 the catastrophic monthly premium is projected at 1020 
in addition to whatever the regular part b premium is at that time 
more than 60 percent of total program costs are to be financed by 
an additional supplemental premium that is linked to federal income 
tax liability the supplemental starts at 2250 a year per 150 of 
tax liability in 1989 rising to 42 a year per 150 of tax 
liability in 1993 there is an 800 cap per covered person on the 
total supplemental premium in 1989 rising to 1050 in 1993

medicaid the bill phases in over four years a requirement 
that state medicaid programs pay all medicare premiums deductibles 
and copayments for the elderly and disabled with incomes below the 
federal poverty line but too high to qualify for medicaid coverage 
this improvement varies widely from state to state depending on 
what the state already does 
spousal impoverishment gradually raises the income that may be 
retained by a spouse remaining in the community when the husband or 
wife has to go to a nursing home at medicaid expense starting oct 
1 1989 the spouse at home can keep at least 786 per month or 
122 percent of the federal poverty level for a twoperson family

follow what he called the north atlantic treaty organizations 
example of maintaining only the military forces needed for 
defensive purposes

wellpublicized new thinking in the soviet union and warsaw 
pact he said

military commander in europe who warned the west not to be lulled 
into a false sense of security by gorbachevs reforms 
galvin speaking to a group of american reporters today in 
london said moscow has shown no change in military policy 
i see a lot of wishful thinking a lot of romanticism about 
the way things are going galvin said on the military side 
i can find nothing really that has changed 
the two spoke as american and soviet inspectors traveled to each 
others countries to begin the task of verifying compliance with 
the superpower intermediaterange nuclear missile treaty signed in 
december 
woerner is the seventh nato secretarygeneral the appointment 
holds no fixed term 
fluent in english and french he holds a doctorate in 
international law and served as a conservative christian democratic

the man who may become the nations foreign 
minister said friday it should be israels policy to deport 
palestinian activists and to open fire on rioters to crush the 
7monthold rebellion in the occupied lands 
a palestinian woman died of gunshot wounds to the head suffered 
in an army raid on her village may 18 said officials at mukassad 
hospital in jerusalem 
only a harsh crackdown can restore israels ability to deter 
revolt among the 15 million palestinians of the west bank and gaza 
strip said benyamin netanyahu a former ambassador to the united 
nations and a leading candidate in the november parliamentary 
election 
netanyahu could be the next foreign minister if his rightwing 
likud bloc wins the election likud and the rival centerleft labor 
party share a tenuous national unity coalition and recent polls 
show them running even in the election campaign 
soldiers shot fatima kassem 24 during a raid on abwein an 
isolated west bank mountain village and killed another villager 
the hospital officials said 
her death brought to 214 the number of palestinians killed since 
violence began dec 8 in the west bank and gaza which israel 
captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war four israelis also 
have been slain 
netanyahu told the associated press on friday that israel should 
expel the main core of inciters who plan organize and execute 
the riots we are talking about hundreds of people 
thousands of arab activists have been arrested in the past seven 
months but netanyahu said prison terms no longer serve as a

even the balloons and bunting are supposed to 
have a hightech look at this months democratic national 
convention 
we want the people to see this thing as an organized unified 
convention people whove got their act together dan lee 
deputy chief executive officer for the july 1821 event said in an 
interview friday 
bold tones of red white and blue will be replaced by soft 
blues soft reds and gray tones on the podium lee said this 
more futuristic look will be used around the omni and to some 
degree will replace traditional bunting 
its not exactly bunting lee said of the decorations 
planned for the skyboxes for vips but he promised plenty of color 
using paint bunting and flags 
balloons in some entry areas will take the form of air 
tubes thick airfilled creations that will be intertwined in 
some of the architectural structures lee said 
although michael dukakis campaign has yet to set final plans 
for the demonstration following his acceptance speech lee 
suggested balloons wont simply drop from nets 
there are a lot of different ways to use balloons these days 
balloon structures different ways of releasing them he said 
still lee promised the celebration of the nominee will include 
lots of flags confetti balloons noisemakers lots of 
traditional things 
less dramatic moments in the convention are being planned with 
an eye toward projecting a calm uncluttered image a main goal of 
the podium design 
in past conventions lee said there were always a lot of 
people walking behind the speaker and everything we just wanted to 
eliminate a lot of that 
so only a handful of convention officials will have seats on the 
main speakers platform and they will not be in the line of prime 
camera angles party staffers will be seated with reporters beside 
the platform 
above two giant screens will project closedcircuit views of 
the speaker promotional films or graphics illustrating speeches 
lee said 
for the first time the party will broadcast floor proceedings 
and interviews with various officials over a satellite feed making 
it available to anyone with a satellite dish 
don fowler the conventions chief executive officer has said 
previously the conventions futuristic look will be enhanced by the 
computer terminals which will be used to record and count many 
preliminary votes 
the traditional roll calls for the presidential and vice 
presidential candidates still will be held however

manfred woerner natos new secretary 
general has a dapper and often combative style that led to a 
fashion magazine cover and scandal over the firing of a general 
falsely accused of homosexual contacts 
woerner who is natos seventh general secretary since the post 
was created in 1952 took over the alliances highest civilian post 
on friday he was the first west german appointed to the post 
the 53yearold former west german defense minister replaces 
britains lord carrington who held the job since june 1984 
his appointment followed a failed bid by norway to have its 
former prime minister kaare willoch named to the post 
nominees are generally agreed upon in negotiations between the 
european allies and the tussle sparked a rare public dispute that 
embarrassed officials at the alliances brussels headquarters 
early in his political career the former west german air force 
pilot created a dashing image for himself he was often 
photographed climbing into the cockpit of a fiat g91 fighter or 
relaxing in sports cars 
during his parlimentary career woerner retained his reputation 
as a stylish public official with a knack for oratory 
in 1977 the duesseldorfbased der herr mens fashion magazine 
featured him in a cover photo and story 
but the air force reserve colonel is also known for his penchant 
for combativeness and controversy 
in a 1970 budget speech to the bundestag or west german 
parliament his attacks on the thengoverning social democratic 
government were so stinging that former chancellor willy brandt 
stormed out of the session 
woerner was also the subject of intense public debate in 1983 
and early 1984 over a widely publicized scandal involving his 
firing of a top nato general guenter kiessling 
the defense minister dismissed the west german general following 
reports that alleged he had frequented homosexual bars in cologne 
the rumors were subsequently proven false forcing woerner to 
reinstate kiessling one month after his dismissal 
during the scandal woerner survived repeated calls for his 
resignation by opposition leaders 
woerner was born in stuttgart the son of a prosperous textile 
retailer as a child he belonged to the jungvolk a junior branch 
of the hitler youth organization 
he has a doctorate in international law and was voted into the 
bundestag in 1965 he served four years as the christian democrats 
party chairman and has been a member of its national executive 
committee since 1973 
woerner was defense minister for nearly six years 
he is fluent in english and french natos official languages 
the new nato secretary has said he regards narrowing the soviet 
superiority in conventional arms as the key challenge for nato 
he is also a proponent of plans for closer francowest german 
defense cooperation and opposes the withdrawal of all nuclear 
weapons from western europe

democrat michael dukakis auditioned sen 
john glenn for vice president friday before a cheering homestate 
crowd and said he rather liked dull and boring a description 
sometimes attached to both men 
after his joint appearance with the ohio senator to wind up a 
quick midwest campaign trip dukakis returned to boston for a 
holiday weekend that will be capped by a fourth of july dinner with 
jesse jackson 
republican george bush was in kennebunkport maine celebrating 
his mothers 87th birthday he planned to spend the holiday 
campaigning in michigan illinois and missouri 
as he approached the final two weeks before the democratic 
national convention in atlanta dukakis had his partys 
presidential nomination firmly in hand and was deep into the 
business of choosing a running mate a process he was determined to 
keep as closed to scrutiny as possible 
when pressed for a vice presidential preference dukakis 
repeatedly offered no hint of his choice and said he would make a 
decision when im ready to make a decision 
he told reporters in ohio that he expected to notify those he 
doesnt choose before making any public announcement 
i generally have the practice of notifying people i dont 
pick he said might jackson receive such notice over dinner on 
monday 
dukakis shook his head from side to side 
were going to have dinner and listen to some good music he 
said 
dukakis invited jackson and his wife jacqueline to join him 
and his wife kitty for a holiday dinner at their home in 
brookline mass and then attend a boston pops concert kitty 
dukakis father harry ellis dickson is a former associated 
conductor of the orchestra 
meanwhile mayor andrew young of atlanta said he doubted jackson 
would press to be the vice presidential nominee 
every poll ive seen shows that the only instance in which 
dukakis is losing to george bush is with jesse jackson on the 
ticket said young the democratic party isnt suicidal and 
neither is jesse jackson the last thing he wants to be is the vice 
presidential nominee on a losing ticket 
as for glenn young said the senator would be extraordinarily 
valuable to the ticket 
twice during his midwest trip he shared a platform with a local 
favorite and each time he gave the crowd a teasing hint that their 
choice might also be his 
with rep lee hamilton standing by during an appearance in terre 
haute ind dukakis said somebody handed me a button dukakis 
and hamilton that has kind of a nice ring to it doesnt it 
the crowd responded with a cheer 
twelve hours later he was in an auto workers union hall in ohio 
sitting across a stage from glenn the former astronaut who is the 
states senior senator 
ive been taking a poll all over america about running 
mates said dukakis what do you think about john glenn 
the crowd erupted with loud cheers and whistles dukakis turned 
to the senator and shook his hand returning to the microphone the 
massachusetts governor added sounds unanimous to me 
at a news conference after his speech dukakis was asked if he 
agreed with assessments that glenn was dull and boring and had 
run a disastrous campaign for president four years ago 
glenn standing behind dukakis grinned and blushed dukakis 
smiled 
dull and boring said the candidate whose has heard those 
words used to describe him i kind of like that 
as for the rap against glenns 1984 campaign dukakis said 
ive won campaigns and ive lost campaigns ive run good 
campaigns and have had one disastrous campaign so im very 
sympathetic dukakis lost the governors office in 1978 but 
rebounded in 1982 and was resoundingly reelected in 1986 
glenn refused to comment on whether he deserved to be called 
dull and boring 
in fact at the uaw hall glenn was positively animated compared 
to hamilton the night before a highly respected member of the 
house who was a senior member of the special committee that 
investigated the irancontra affair hamilton has a professorial 
speaking style he hardly moved while sharing the stage with 
dukakis 
when glenn entered the union hall he drew louder applause than 
dukakis 
smiling broadly the senator gave a double thumbs up sign to the 
crowd and then pointed to dukakis who also looked happy with the 
crowd reaction

proclaimed the national communist party conference a success 
gorbachev spoke after the conference of 5000 party members 
adopted resolutions in what the tass news agency called an 
unusually stormy and long debate 
the conference formally closed after gorbachevs address 
according to tass 
the soviet communist party leader called for construction of a 
monument to the victims of dictator josef stalin in moscow saying 
i think we must agree to this and such a monument must be 
constructed in moscow 
gorbachev summing up the work of the fourday conference said 
the conference has created the necessary impetus to perestroika 
deepening of perestroika and the guarantee of its irreversibility 
referring to his proposals to restructure the soviet government 
strengthening its legislative branch and giving the president new 
powers the soviet leader said the conference will continue 
living in the society in the discussions in the society but now 
we know how we must transform the political system 
tass said the conference adopted a packet of six resolutions 
saying the debate on bureaucracy interethnic relations and 
glasnost were particularly thorny 
it did not immediately say what the resolutions said 
gorbachev also gave a lengthy critique of the work of former 
moscow party boss boris yeltsin who appealed to the conference 
earlier in the day to absolve him of blame for his criticism of the 
slow pace of reform 
yeltsins criticisms cost him his job and his spot on the ruling 
politburo gorbachev said yeltsin was chosen to run the moscow 
party organization because of his experience and energy but 
ultimately proved he could not handle the job 
gorbachev praised the open atmosphere of the conference 
one of the heroes of our conference was glasnost because our 
conference was a result of the atmosphere of sincerity that is 
being reflected in our society we also discussed its limits he 
said 
he called on the soviet media to publicize the real 
achievements of the real heroes of perestroika and proclaimed 
that no one has a monopoly on the truth 
in an apparent reference to the time of stalin he said the 
printed word was a servant of arbitrary totalitarianism in 
contrast he said the conference had showed how the interparty 
debate must be carried out

lowerranking government officials and 
intellectuals linked to the banned trade union solidarity met 
secretly this week to try to reopen dialogue stymied since the 
imposition of martial law in 1981 
the discussions which one participant described as in the 
nature of a first meeting focused on the possibility of an 
anticrisis pact in which the two sides would unite behind a 
program to end the countrys economic crisis 
it was certainly a success that this meeting took place 
according to the participant referring to the virtual absence of 
direct talks between the government and opposition in poland since 
the imposition of martial law in 1981 
martial law was lifted in 1983 but opposition groups including 
the solidarity trade union remain officially banned 
the fourhour meeting tuesday took place with the knowledge of 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski and politiburo member jozef 
czyrek said a source familiar with the event he said it might 
lead to meetings with participation of higherranking officials 
the participant speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
meeting ended with a decision for a later meeting that would be 
more concrete devoted to selected problems no date was set 
about 25 people were invited by marek goliszewski editor of the 
monthly newspaper konfrontacja confrontation and its editorial 
board the publication linked with the official national unity 
organization pron began publishing in january and has been 
promoting the anticrisis pact idea 
goliszewski confirmed he called the meeting other sources from 
the opposition and the official side demanding anonymity provided 
details to the associated press 
among those reported attending from the opposition were 
solidarity advisers bronislaw geremek and ryszard bugaj andrzej 
stelmachowski president of the catholic intellectuals club of 
warsaw and aleksander paszynski head of a nationwide association 
of private entrepreneurs which has applied for official recognition 
from the authorities were col stanislaw kwiatkowski head of 
the government public opinion polling center mariusz gulczynski 
deputy director of the institute of state and law of the polish 
academy of sciences and a parliamentary communist party leader 
ryszard wojna the sources said 
the meeting was known to be controversial within the opposition 
which is wary of being used one roman catholic intellectual 
lawyer tadeusz mazowiecki said he stayed away because i thought 
it wasnt wise to hold such a meeting at this time 
there were no politicians there was no walesa said the 
participant referring to solidarity chief lech walesa 
of the representatives from the official side he said they 
are important advisers but of lower rank 
the discussion was definitely a political one an outlining 
of positions or stands he said and i think that the next 
meeting will be more pragmatic or technical 
the sources said some of the participants insisted it not be 
publicized it took place on neutral grounds a hall at warsaw 
university he said 
the source familiar with the meeting said it was an opportunity 
for the government to poll a broad spectrum of the opposition on 
what solutions it might accept to solve polands problems 
the nation was hit by a wave of strikes last month and there has 
been little public enthusiasm for government economic reform steps 
including steep price increases to save polands debtburdened and 
inefficient economy 
both sides expressed approval of the need for rapid changes in 
the economy the source said but the opposition stressed the 
opinion that the changes have to be very radical 
the most emotional discussion was reported to focus on trade 
unions with the opposition demanding legalization of solidarity a 
suggestion rejected by the officials the opposition side said it 
was willing to hear other government proposals that would create 
trade union pluralism the source said 
the sides agreed on the desirability of independent 
associations political discussion clubs and a coalition form 
of governing in which representatives of independent circles 
would enter the government and the parliament the source said 
but the officials taking part in the discussion said they had no 
authority to make firm offers and would have to consult with their 
superiors while the opposition stressed that it was not interested 
in artificial actions from the government or attempts to split 
its ranks said the source 
geremek proposed talks on an anticrisis pact in an 
interview published by konfrontacja earlier this year czyrek the 
politburo member repeated the formulation in an interview 
published in may 
however the two sides have been at odds publically over what the 
pact would cover and who would be the governments negotiating 
partner 
officials have said the government could not talk to groups paid 
by a foreign power or people who want the situation in poland to 
worsen descriptions normally applied by the official media to 
solidarity 
the source said such language was absent from tuesdays meeting

postal mortems just ask h sam ansell jr 
ansell owner of the truesdale funeral home here recently 
received a 100 check from an alletta demuir rue for embalming her 
mother and a letter praising the staff for its efforts 
the letter bore a 2cent stamp postmarked nov 17 1930 in 
detroit it also thanked founder george p truesdale for extending 
credit for the work done on her mother who apparently died in the 
kalamazoo area and was buried elsewhere 
you have been most kind in letting us have this time to pay 
and we sincerely thank you wrote rue who listed a return 
address in detroit 
the check was dated april 4 1930 and issued by the bank of 
detroit but that name had been crossed out and subsituted in 
handwriting with that of jackson park national bank in chicago 
i rather doubt i can present that for payment to a bank 
ansell said 
david mastervich an account representative at the post office 
in nearby kalamazoo said the letter probably encountered a fate 
common to longdelayed mail 
we probably moved some equipment thats been there 50 years

a former governors declaration of new 
mexico as a sanctuary state was vague enough to be construed as 
carrying the weight of law and a journalist and minister can use 
it as a defense against alien smuggling charges a judge has ruled 
thengov toney anaya declared new mexico a sanctuary in 1986 a 
largely symbolic action aimed at people fleeing war in central 
america it was rescinded when gov garrey carruthers took office 
in january 1987 
demetria martinez a freelance religion writer and the rev 
glen remerthamert a lutheran minister were indicted by a federal 
grand jury in december on charges of conspiring to smuggle two 
pregnant salvadoran women into the country in 1986 
the minister contends he tried to help the women because of his 
religious beliefs and because he considered them to be refugees 
fleeing a wartorn country he also maintains the women were to put 
their babies up for adoption in the united states because they 
feared conditions in their homeland 
the us attorneys office has said remerthamert was motivated 
by a socalled adoptionforprofit scheme 
martinez has maintained she accompanied remerthamert in her 
role as a journalist and should never have been indicted 
prosecutors have tried to prevent the minister from using his 
religious beliefs as a defense they also have tried to prevent 
both defendants from using the sanctuary declaration 
us district judge john conway ruled thursday the pair should 
not be prohibited from offering evidence which could arguably 
show that the defendants reasonably relied upon the proclamation 
the proclamation while interesting never mentions the fact 
that it is symbolic only conway wrote 
trial is scheduled july 13

legislative branch and give the president new powers gorbachev 
said the conference will continue living in the society in the 
discussions in the society but now we know how we must transform 
the political system 
tass said the conference adopted a package of six resolutions 
saying the debate on bureaucracy interethnic relations and 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or more openness were 
particularly thorny it did not say what the resolutions said 
the tass report said there were several votes on amendments and 
that the conference rejected proposals by space scientist roald 
sagdeyev on elections to government councils 
an amendment calling for the communist party newspaper pravda to 
be taken out of the hands of the policymaking central committee 
received only 56 votes it said 
gorbachev praised the open atmosphere of the conference 
one of the heroes of our conference was glasnost because our 
conference was a result of the atmosphere of sincerity that is 
being reflected in our society we also discussed its limits he 
said 
he called on the soviet media to publicize the real 
achievements of the real heroes of perestroika and proclaimed 
that no one has a monopoly on the truth 
in an apparent reference to the time of stalin he said the 
printed word was a servant of arbitrary totalitarianism in 
contrast he said the conference had showed how the interparty 
debate must be carried out 
before the conference debate ended however the longsimmering 
feud between yeltsin and kremlin no 2 leader yegor k ligachev 
broke into the open 
yeltsin was judged as being politically mistaken by the party 
but he said friday his only mistake was poor timing 
gorbachev said yeltsin was chosen to run the moscow party 
organization because of his experience and energy but ultimately 
proved he could not handle the job 
ligachev at whom much of yeltsins criticism was leveled took 
the floor friday evening to oppose his return saying yeltsin 
committed many errors and still hadnt learned his lesson 
the 57yearold yeltsin a leading reformer and former protege 
of gorbachev was fired from his moscow job as head of the moscow 
communist party after he attacked the slow pace of reform during a 
speech in october to the central committee the speech has not been 
published 
yeltsin was reassigned as first deputy of the state construction 
committee a ministeriallevel post he was dropped from the 
politburo in february but retained sufficient status in the party 
to be chosen a delegate 
i think my only mistake was that i spoke too early before the 
70th anniversary of the october revolution yeltsin said it was 
a time when the party was trying to display unity and celebrate its 
successes 
taking to heart what happened i ask the conference to change 
the decision of the plenum of the central committee yeltsin told 
the delegates if you find it possible to do this you will 
rehabilitate me in the eyes of communists 
yeltsin took the floor to answer questions from many delegates 
about the circumstances of his ouster and about his demand that 
ligachev resign he had told western reporters during the 
ussoviet summit meeting in moscow that ligachev was the party 
official most responsible for holding back gorbachevs reforms 
ligachev said yeltsin had not drawn the necessary conclusions 
from his mistakes and the principled criticism of his party 
comrades 
other delegates also criticized yeltsin charging that he had 
been tactless on a visit abroad and gave interviews to foreign new 
agencies just to boost his own prestige some rose to yeltsins 
defense in an open debate 
earlier friday the nations top environmental official demanded 
punishment for planners responsible for pollution disasters and a 
reformist publisher defended the new openness of the press 
at other times during the conference delegates have openly 
disagreed on the concrete results of gorbachevs drive for 
perestroika which was launched after he took power in march 1985

the state department said friday it welcomes 
chinas statement of support for a negotiated political settlement 
in cambodia and secretary of state george shultz will discuss the 
issue with chinese leaders during his visit to beijing later this 
month 
the chinese statement mirrors our own views that a vietnamese 
withdrawal and free and fair elections and a secure atmosphere are 
essential conditions for a lasting solution to the cambodian 
conflict department spokeswoman phyllis oakley told reporters 
mrs oakley also said the current announced withdrawal from 
cambodia of 50000 vietnamese occupation soldiers including senior 
command elements if fully implemented would represent a positive 
step toward stability in the region 
she added however that the announced withdrawal would still 
leave in cambodia at leaart 50000 to 70000 vietnamese troops 
whose presence would prevent any genuine expression of cambodian 
political selfdetermination 
we continue to maintain that the resolution of the cambodian 
problem would require a settlement agreement which provides for 
complete withdrawal of vietnamese troops from cambodia 
vietnamese forces invaded cambodia in 1978 ending bloody rule 
by the khmer rouge blamed for the death of millions of cambodians 
mrs oakley said it is not known if the current withdrawal will 
lead to a total vietnamese pullout from cambodia and she did not 
address concerns about a possible khmer rouge return to power in 
cambodia after the vietnamese leave 
however shultzs talks in beijing later this month will be 
preceded by extensive meetings in bangkok with leaders of the 
association of southeast asian nations 
the united states has been working closely with asean countries 
in seeking an end to the vietnamese occupation of cambodia as well 
as a solution to the khmer rouge problem 
a senior us official said later the united states has made it 
clear to china the strongest supporter of the khmer rouge that 
return to power by the khmer rouge is out of the question the 
united states hopes that cambodian prince norodom sihanouk will be 
able to find a solution to the future government structure added 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity

a juvenile courts decision to return two 
young children to a home with a severe and prolongued history 
of child abuse must be reconsidered the minnesota supreme court 
said friday 
in a 52 decision the states high court said the child abuse 
documented in 1982 is almost incredible and sent the case back 
to hennepin county juvenile court for further findings 
the history of child abuse in the home has been both severe 
and prolonged associate justice glenn kelley said in the 
majority opinion 
in 1982 the father was convicted of seconddegree assault for 
physical abuse against his seven children who range in age from 8 
to 20 in 1983 a juvenile court judge found that he had sexually 
abused the two youngest children court documents state 
but a juvenile court ruled last year that the two youngest 
children who had been in foster care since 1982 should be 
returned to the home anyway the five older children had already 
returned to their parents the court said 
the dissenting judges said that instead of merely studying the 
case further the courts should terminate the parents rights to 
the youngest children immediately the courts have exercised 
judicial caution long enough justice rosalie wahl said it is 
unconscionable to prolong these proceedings 
according to court documents in a 1982 order taking the children 
from him the father once forced several of the children to stand 
on stools and placed a chain that had been positioned over a roof 
beam around their necks as he threatened to kick the stool from 
underneath each child 
on other occasions the father chased a child with a bowie knife 
and held it to the childs throat the documents state he also 
once ordered several children outside clad only in their 
nightgowns when the windchill was 80 degrees below zero 
the mother also was physically abused by the father according 
to court documents 
fridays order stems from a july 1987 juvenile court ruling that 
denied a social services petition to terminate parental rights for 
the two youngest children 
the five older children had testified at that time that 
conditions in the home had improved the court said but the ruling 
noted that the testimony came from children who for most of their 
lives had been physically abused by their father and who had 
themselves never volunteered to report the continued abuse

the kickoff friday of the 125th 
anniversary observance of the battle of gettysburg thrilled allen 
nelson for a very personal reason his father fought in it 
nelson 70 a retired career army officer drove in from 
sanford fla for the ceremonies he wore the uniform of a union 
colonel as he watched mock soldiers pass in review to mark the 
start of the battle which was fought here july 13 1863 
his father pvt george h nelson fought with the 2nd vermont 
volunteers at gettysburg and later was wounded in the battle of the 
wilderness in virginia 
nelson whose father was in his 70s when he was born was the 
only known firstgeneration descendant at the national park where 
what many historians view as the central battle of the civil war 
took place 
the opening event drew only about 1000 spectators well below 
park officials estimates that 20000 or more visitors would be at 
the battlefield for each day of the anniversary 
last weekend more than 100000 visitors attended a threeday 
reenactment of the battle on private property several miles from 
this adams county community 
i do think that a lot of people think last week was the actual 
anniversary said bob moore the battlefield parks media 
director i think some people mistakenly thought that once the 
events of last week were over that that was the end of it 
the first days schedule mirrored the first day of the battle 
not much happened 
but just as the fighting intensified on the second day and 
reached its climax with the union victory on the third the pace of 
events will pick up saturday and sunday with a symbolic exchange 
of battle flags a dedication of the newest monument at the 
battlefield and a relighting of the eternal peace light memorial 
obviously friday and saturday are when the people are 
hopefully going to be here moore said 
the last time there were overflow crowds in gettysburg was 1938 
the 75th anniversary of the clash between union and confederate 
troops that was the last major reunion of soldiers who fought here 
nelson was here then with his father who was in his mid90s he 
remembers touring the battlefield and being able to envision what 
happened 
but he said he didnt hear much about the battle from his father 
or the other veterans 
he didnt talk too much about it said nelson most of the 
veterans wouldnt talk too much about it i guess they wanted to 
forget 
those who turned out friday were quickly gripped by the 
fascination of the once bloody ground later the scene of abraham 
lincolns famous gettsyburg address 
weve come a long way to see this said londoner john 
funnell its fantastic 
his wife betty agreed but said she was still hoping for one 
more thrill at gettysburg 
i would like to see something like rhett butler she said 
referring to the dashing character in gone with the wind

pilot error most likely caused the 
collision of two army helicopters that killed 17 soldiers during 
night training at fort campbell last march according to a report 
released friday 
pilot error to wit a reasonable mistake in judgment is the 
most probable explanation for the cause of this accident said 
the report compiled by an investigation board of six fort campbell 
officers all aviators 
but the report concluded there should be no action taken 
against anyone as no foundation for negligence can be established 
the accident was not due to lack of diligence nor unreasonable or 
unprofessional conduct 
up to the point of impact the missions were formed just as 
briefed said maj randy schoel public affairs officer at the 
army base 
the report said there was no evidence of a mechanical 
malfunction in the two uh60 black hawks involved in the march 8 
crash 
nor can it be confirmed that there were any procedural errors 
on the part of either crew schoel said 
the report however cited other factors including exterior and 
interior design features of the uh60 black hawks and limited pilot 
training with nightvision goggles 
compounding the problem the report said was the lack of 
lighting on the helicopters the report said the number and the 
size of position lights on the outside of the 46 million black 
hawk are inadequate 
the helicopters were made by sikorsky aircraft division of 
united technologies corp in stratford conn company spokesman 
robert stangrone said the company not seen the report 
but he said all aircraft have some degree of fieldofview 
limitation obviously the ideal cockpit is a glass bubble with an 
unobstructed view its a matter of design tradeoffs that consider 
structural integrity ballistic tolerance survivability and so on 
design and operational tradeoffs also determine the extent and 
intensity of exterior aircraft lighting 
the investigation found that the collision was the result of 
the two air crews being unable to see each other in the final 
moments of flight according to a statement read by schoel 
the report said one of the two helicopters may not have had its 
anticollision strobe light turned on as required thats the 
only item in question the strobe light schoel said 
because the accident was fatal to the crew of both aircraft 
it is impossible to determine exactly what caused the two aircraft 
to fly into each other the report said 
the accident occurred when a black hawk returning from a solo 
instruction flight collided with the lead helicopter in a formation 
of three returning from a mission to pick up soldiers in the field 
the lead helicopter struck broadside carried 13 soldiers the 
other carried four all 17 victims who belonged to the 101st 
airborne division at fort campbell were killed the other two 
helicopters landed safely 
crew members on the undamaged helicopters said there was little 
warning that another helicopter was approaching the pilots were 
wearing nightvision goggles which amplify very small amounts of 
light 
restrictions to vision caused by door posts and structural 
components of the aircraft and the limited field of view of the 
nightvision goggles being used by both crews hampered their 
ability to see schoel said at the news conference the report 
did specifically cite the door posts 
the lights on the helicopter leading the formation could very 
easily have been obscured and blended into city lights he added 
pilots wearing night goggles are supposed to scan left and right 
repeatedly because the goggles provide only a 40degree field of 
view schoel said 
one of the helicopters involved in the crash was in a climbing 
righthand turn with its crew members looking to the right as it 
turned while the crew members of the other helicopter to the left 
were looking straight ahead schoel said 
the helicopter making the right turn would have been slightly 
nose up left wing high so the field of vision to the left 
would have been obscured schoel said 
stangrone said one effort being made to enhance cockpit 
visibility is smaller instrument panels that allow for a larger 
wind screen this effort is paced by computer technology that 
will result in smaller black boxes and instrument displays he 
said

defense secretary frank c carlucci announced 
today that the pentagon has suspended payment on 1 billion in 
contracts that may have been tainted by bribes and fraud 
the suspensions will not damage national security he said 
carlucci said that he took the action as a result of documents 
in the case unsealed by a judge in federal district court in 
dallas the affidavits disclosed that a defense consultant passed 
along inside information on nine navy contracts worth more than 
522 million in a conversation that was monitored by the fbi 
additionally carlucci said the department was beginning 
suspension procedures against three individuals and a company named 
in the documents reviewing existing contracts with four implicated 
companies and freezing new contracts on nine weapons systems 
the affidavit provides the department with evidence concerning 
individuals and companies he said 
the navy has initiated suspension procedures with respect to 
george stone mark saunders joe bradley and the continental 
electronics division of varian associates inc he said 
carlucci said the companies and officials involved were being 
notified of the petagon action 
and he said the department would take further actions as 
evidence in the case becomes public 
wherever we have specific evidence we will take action as i 
have indicated previously we do not need to wait for 
convictions or even trials for that matter he said 
we are in an ongoing dialogue with the department of 
justice which is conducting the investigation he said the 
department of justice quite correctly points out that what they are 
dealing with is grand jury information and it would be 
inappropriate for them to supply this information to us at this 
time but as soon as they are able to they will be supplying 
information to us and as soon as we get the information we will 
act 
until pentagon officials see what is in other affidavits in the 
case he said until we have all the information from the 
deparment of justice we cant make judgements all we can do 
is wait for the wheels of justice to take their course 
carlucci said the current actions did not gravely impair 
national security but that additional suspensions might 
if you say impact on national security clearly anything 
that slows down the process of producing defense equipment or 
requires us to reopen contracts has an impact on our ability to get 
equipment in the field he said 
if you are talking about grave or serious impact on readiness 
or modernization programs i would not yet put what we have done 
today in that category but clearly it has an impact he said 
carlucci said the pentagon was reviewing existing contracts with 
four companies named in the affidavit litton industries inc 
norden hazeltine and emhart of the four only litton has been 
named by the pentagon as among the top 100 companies with which it 
does buiness 
the largest single weapons system on which payments are being 
frozen is called the antisubmarine operating center a 712 
million system of shorebased command and control centers to 
coorinate efforts to locate and in time of war destroy submarines 
the second most costly weapons system mentioned by carlucci was 
the digital communications terminal a 150 million program to 
develop a handheld computerized unit to compose messages to be 
transmitted in short bursts by military field radios to minimize 
the possibility that they could be intercepted or decoded by enemy 
forces 
the next largest was the advanced tactical air command central 
a 118 million program to replace existing installations that used 
advanced electronics to coordinate air defenses 
the other six weapons systems on which new contract actions were 
being suspended were the tactical environmental support system a 
58 million navy program a 51 million fiber optical project the 
digital wideband radio set being developed at a cost of 49 
million a 38 million antisubmarine warfare electronics display 
unit the 30 million bancroft radio for tanks and the marine 
corps light armored vehicles and a 63 million project to 
develop very low frequency and low frequency communications gear

average beginning teacher salaries pushed 
past 18000 for the first time this past school year and average 
pay for the entire profession reached a record high of 28085 a 
union survey revealed friday 
teachers earned 17 percent more on average than all american 
workers in 1987 and 10 percent more than all government workers 
the american federation of teachers said 
the public is really supporting teachers its the seventh 
straight year salaries have exceeded inflation said f howard 
nelson an assistant research director of the aft which released 
the survey on the eve of its biennial convention 
the aft survey of state departments of education found starting 
salaries for the school year that just ended were 18557 up 54 
percent from a year earlier and more than double the 9085 
beginners were paid in 1977 
the average salary for all teachers was up 55 percent over 
1987 and jewell c gould the afts director of research 
predicted a similar increase for the school year starting this fall 
the aft salary data shows alaska at the top of the pay scale 
with average salaries of 40510 and south dakota at the bottom 
with 19758 
but the aft also ranked the states by costofliving and by how 
teachers pay compared to salaries of other workers 
the adjustment for differences in the cost of living shows 
that michigan alaska california and minnesota pay teachers the 
most louisiana arkansas hawaii and south dakota are on the 
bottom 
adjusted for inflation the record 28085 average salary is 
just 665 more than teachers earned in 1972 the average 1972 
salary of 9705 is the equivalent of 27420 in todays prices 
likewise the beginning salary of 6970 in 1972 is the 
equivalent of 19739 in todays dollars more than todays 
starting salaries 
gould singled out pittsburgh rochester ny and the state of 
connecticut as places that are setting a new standard for teacher 
salaries 
the 665000member aft represents nearly a halfmillion of the 
nations 24 million public school teachers primarily in big 
cities the 19 millionmember national education association 
which opens its convention monday in new orleans has 15 million 
members 
connecticut reported the highest salary increase 158 
percent for 198788 pushing its average pay level to 33776 
fifth in the nation the aft report said 
al fondy president of both the pittsburgh and pennsylvania 
federations of teachers said that under a new fouryear contract 
average salaries in pittsburgh will rise from 38000 to 46000 by 
1991 with topscale veterans earning 51000 
rochester has a contract that will push its top scale past 
55000 plus the possibility that lead teachers will earn nearly 
70000 
although teaching pays more on average than other government 
work and more than the average job in the private sector the 
report said the average male yearround worker earned 14 percent 
more in 1987 than the average teacher who gets summers off 
the average female yearround worker made only 73 percent as 
much as teachers most of whom are women 
the aft said alaska california connecticut michigan new york 
and new jersey all have starting salaries in excess of 20000 
while only vermont and idaho start teachers off at less than 
15000 
although they earn more on average in real dollars than they did 
in 1972 todays teachers are also more experienced with nearly 16 
years in the classoom compared with less than 11 years then the 
aft said

a federal judge sentenced a former kuwait 
airways sales manager to a sixmonth prison term friday for 
stealing 25 million from the airline in what the defendant 
claimed was a plan with the cia to woo moderates in iran 
the sentence was criticized immediately by a prosecutor as being 
too lenient 
robert m sensi received a threeyear sentence with all but six 
months suspended for 21 counts of mail fraud theft and interstate 
transportation of stolen securities 
a further order crediting sensi with the four months he spent in 
a british jail following his 1986 arrest means he will only serve 
two months 
us district judge george revercomb acknowledged that the 
sentence will strike some as extremely lenient 
but the judge said the kuwait government had not produced all 
knowledgeable witnesses who might have supported sensis claim 
there has been some knowledge some acquiesence perhaps some 
complicity on the part of others 
sensi 37 had contended that he was authorized by the kuwaiti 
royal family to spend the money including 1 million to help 
finance an initiative with the cia to make contact with moderates 
in iran 
during the trial sensi testified that he met with cia director 
william j casey in 1986 before embarking on a trip to iran where 
he planned to meet with the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
sensi was arrested in london on the first leg of the trip to 
iran 
outside the courtroom assistant us attorney theodore shamanda 
said we accept the judges sentence as one that is within his 
power to impose 
but shamanda added that as the trial prosecutor i do believe 
that to be too lenient when you steal 25 million of your 
employers money and get a sixmonth sentence what signal does 
that send to the community 
sensi could have received fiveyear prison terms for each of six 
mail fraud counts and 10year sentences for each of the 14 theft 
and interstate transportation of stolen securities counts 
revercomb imposed the sentence after he rejected sensis motion 
to set aside the verdict on the basis of newly discovered evidence 
to support his claim that the royal family authorized his 
expenditures 
in may sensis lawyers produced an affidavit from the airlines 
former new york manager who said he was aware of a special bank 
account used by sensi to funnel the money from the kuwait airways 
accounts 
inder sethi who couldnt be located to testify at the trial 
said in the affidavit that it was clear to me that many people 
both in the united states and in kuwait were aware of mr sensis 
activities 
to the best of my knowledge no one questioned the propriety 
of mr sensis actions during the entire time that i served as a 
regional manager the affidavit said 
but thomas j whalen who represented kuwait airways in a 
related civil suit said in another affidavit that when he 
interviewed sethi last year sethi denied any knowledge of special 
accounts kept by sensi 
mr sethi said that he was shocked or used some similar term 
when he learned about what sensi had done whalen said 
before taking the bench revercomb met with sethi in his 
chambers based on his conversation the judge said he determined 
that sethis statements did not provide sufficient evidence to 
warrant setting aside the verdict and ordering a new trial

a simmering feud in the soviet leadership 
dominated the floor friday and the first national communist party 
conference since 1941 adjourned with a burst of candor not seen 
since the soviet unions infancy 
mikhail s gorbachev encouraged both sides in the longrumored 
dispute over dismissed moscow party boss boris n yeltsin to have 
their say 
yeltsin asked the conference to clear him of blame for an angry 
outburst against party conservatives last fall that cost him his 
job and a nonvoting membership on the ruling politburo 
his most powerful opponent kremlin no 2 man yegor k ligachev 
took the floor to say yeltsin committed many errors and had not yet 
learned his lesson 
more delegates also rose to criticize the wayward onetime 
protege of gorbachev they accused yeltsin of being tactless on a 
trip abroad and giving interviews to foreign new agencies just to 
boost his own prestige one claimed yeltsin drove an underling to 
suicide 
others defended yeltsin in an open debate the highlights of 
which were shown on television the broadcast did not break away 
even for live coverage of gorbachevs speech closing the conference 
tass the official news agency said yelstin told his 5000 
fellow delegates that his only mistake in criticizing the 
bureaucracy last october was in speaking too soon 
extraordinary criticism of the communist establishment was a 
hallmark of the fourday meeting including at least one call for 
resignations of the old guard 
yeltsin 57 is an outspoken reformer who became popular with 
muscovites by demanding that stores provide more food and better 
consumer goods gorbachev brought him into the leadership but 
joined in denouncing him after yeltsins speech to an october 
meeting of the policymaking central committee 
yeltsins speech to the closed meeting has not been published 
but reports said he offered to resign out of frustration over his 
inability to control the entrenched bureaucracy in moscows party 
organization his comments later were branded politically 
erroneous and he was fired 
he rekindled the controversy during last months ussoviet 
summit in moscow by calling for ligachevs resignation during an 
interview with western television correspondents 
in an account carried by tass yeltsin told the conference 
friday i think my only mistake was that i spoke too early 
before the 70th anniversary of the october revolution 
taking to heart what happened i ask the conference to change 
the decision of the plenum of the central committee if you find it 
possible to do this you will rehabilitate me in the eyes of the 
communists 
ligachev widely viewed as a conservative counterweight to the 
reformminded gorbachev took the rostrum friday evening as one of 
the final conference speakers 
defending his own credentials as a supporter of perestroika as 
gorbachevs ambitious modernization program is called ligachev 
said josef stalin had executed some members of his family and 
expelled others from the party 
he helped his region become selfsufficient in food while 
working as a party leader in siberia ligachev said whereas the 
district where you boris worked for nine years now has rationing 
of food 
ligachev also denounced yeltsin for criticizing the old guard 
he credited veteran politburo members andrei a gromyko mikhail s 
solomentsev and viktor m chebrikov with helping gorbachev gain 
power at a crucial meeting of the central committee three years 
ago without their efforts ligachev said others might be 
sitting here now on the dais 
he said the leadership is united behind gorbachev and declared 
there are neither conservatives nor reformers among the 
leadership 
yeltsin has not drawn the necessary conclusions from his 
mistakes and the principled criticism of his party comrades 
ligachev said 
gorbachev in his closing speech friday dealt yeltsin the final 
blow 
he defended the decision to give yeltsin the floor saying we 
must remove all the shrouds of secrecy then reviewed events that 
led to his dismissal confirming many reports that have circulated 
in moscow for months but never appeared in the official media 
taking responsiblity for the decision to promote yeltsin to the 
key moscow party post gorbachev said the politburo saw his 
excesses but did not act quickly enough 
at a certain stage we saw that something was wrong he 
said and it became apparent yeltsin was not up to the task of 
running moscow 
according to gorbachevs account yeltsin began losing his 
temper barking orders and being rude and attacked his own 
party organization 
at first we thought he might be right gorbachev said but 
when he began changing one after another of the party functionaries 
we became concerned and told him so it was a time when practical 
problems had to be solved but he did not act accordingly 
he said the politburo supported yeltsin until during 
gorbachevs vacation last summer the moscow party chief wrote him 
asking to be relieved of his responsibilities 
gorbachev said he kept the letter confidential until they met 
when he returned from vacation we decided to wait after the 
70th anniversary celebrations the first week in november he said 
but then yeltsin spoke out at the central committee meeting 
as gorbachev recounted the story he referred to a record of the 
secret proceeding he said the central committee wanted to accept 
the resignation but he decided to wait until after the anniversary 
when the celebrations were over gorbachev went to the moscow 
party headquarters to participate in the meeting at which yeltsin 
was ousted he said at the time that yeltsin was overly ambitious

reagan not to renominate stalon because he could not be confirmed 
stalon said he did not know what was behind the opposition to 
his renomination 
the announcement still does not settle the commissions 
membership uncertainties ms hesse has not been confirmed as 
chairman a year after her nomination anthony sousa has resigned 
effective later this month and charles trabandts term expires in

the excommunication of archbishop marcel lefebvre 
marks one of the few times in recent years that the roman catholic 
church has pronounced someone removed from the body of believers 
in the churchs history excommunication often had political 
consequences and could even result in the death penalty 
today however the censure is intended to cut off an 
individuals participation in the churchs spiritual life and 
persuade the offender to repent 
the penalty has been applied to leaders from henry viii to 
former argentine president juan peron as well as rebels against 
church teaching such as martin luther 
peron president of argentina from 194655 and 197374 was 
excommunicated in 1955 after launching an anticlerical campaign 
it was lifted after he repented according to vatican sources 
excommunication was even applied to communist voters in 1949 
under the militantly anticommunist pope pius xii an action aimed 
at the italian communist party in recent years however the 
church has dropped all mention of communists or their supporters 
being excommunicated 
its certainly now a purely religious punishment a vatican 
official said friday speaking on condition of anonymity 
during earlier times in christian society it had many social 
and political effects but that doesnt exist any more the 
official added 
an excommunicated catholic cannot participate in worship or 
receive the sacraments and is refused a christian burial 
in the early days of the church catholics were advised to shun 
people who had been excommunicated by the 15th century the church 
decided that such behavior was only necessary with the most serious 
offenders those known as vitandi a latin term meaning to be 
avoided 
most of those excommunicated including lefebvre are considered 
tolerati to be tolerated 
among the actions that can cause excommunication are abortion 
violation of the confidentiality of confession and consecration of 
a bishop without vatican approval it was the latter act that 
resulted in lefebvres excommunication thursday 
during the holy roman empire from about 800 to 1806 
excommunication was considered grounds for the death penalty 
although it was not always carried out 
political considerations sometimes played a part in 
excommunications 
roman emperor frederick ii was excommunicated twice in 1227 and 
1239 because his growing empire threatened the independence of the 
papal states 
another major excommunication battle occurred in the 16th 
century over henry viiis request for a divorce the king tried 
from 152733 to persuade the vatican to grant him an annulment 
the church did not budge and henry subsequently declared the 
english church independent of rome he was promptly excommunicated 
by pope clement vii 
perhaps the most significant excommunication was that of martin 
luther the founder of the 16th century reformation and of 
protestantism 
in 1517 luther complained about the church practice of selling 
indulgences in exchange for a reduction in the penalty for sin he 
widened his criticism attacking papal authority and calling for a 
greater role for individual conscience pope leo x excommunicated 
him in 1521 
in recent years the vatican has excommunicated government 
officials who have attacked the church and roman catholic priests 
who have refused to give up government positions

top policymakers at the federal reserve voted 
in midmay to push interest rates higher as a way of fighting 
inflationary pressures according to minutes of the discussions 
released friday 
the federal open market committee which sets monetary policy 
for the central bank voted 92 at a meeting on may 17 to tighten 
credit conditions slightly in the weeks following the meeting 
the two dissenters lee hoskins president of the federal 
reserve bank of cleveland and robert parry president of the 
federal reserve bank of san francisco argued that a more 
substantial tightening move was needed to dampen inflationary 
pressures 
fed policymakers met again on wednesday and thursday of this 
week and many analysts believe the central bank discussed boosting 
its discount rate the interest it charges to make bank loans 
an increase in the discount rate which was last raised in 
september is the strongest signal the central bank can send of its 
intention to push interest rates higher 
the minutes of the may meeting confirmed what many analysts had 
already suspected that the fed moved in late may to tighten credit 
conditions because of concerns that the economy was growing so fast 
in the first part of the year that it was putting severe pressures 
on prices and wages 
the last tightening move followed two earlier moves to push 
interest rates higher in late march and in early may the central 
banks goal was to restrain credit and thereby restrain overall 
demand in the economy 
it accomplished this objective by restricting slightly the 
amount of money that banks have available to make loans thus 
pushing up the price of that money interest rates 
a variety of interest rates including the bank prime lending 
rate and mortgage rates did move higher in the spring partly as 
a result of the feds tightening moves 
the minutes of the may meeting showed that fed officials 
remained concerned about the rate of economic growth 
the members generally agreed that some further tightening of 
reserve conditions was needed to counter the risks of rising 
inflationary pressures in the economy the minutes said a 
failure to act in a timely fashion not only would be inconsistent 
with the committees commitment to achieving price stability over 
time but would in fact compound the difficulties of accomplishing 
that objective 
the two dissenters argued that the central bank should be doing 
more than the small tightening steps it was contemplating 
hoskins and parry argued that the risks were considerable that 
price and wage inflation would accelerate from rates that were 
already too high they said unless the fed did more it ran the 
risk that it would have to drive interest rates up even more 
sharply later in the year to get inflation under control 
the minutes said that parry argued that the two tightening moves 
that had occurred in the weeks prior to the meeting were of 
insufficient magnitude to have much effect on the economy 
many economists are looking for a boost in the discount rate 
before the end of the month to 65 percent from the current 6 
percent they believe the fed will be forced to act to keep this 
rate in line with other rates which have been pushed higher 
they argue that the fed will hike the discount rate now rather 
than run the risk that an increase later would become an issue in 
the presidential campaign 
the fomc made up of the fed governors and presidents of six of 
the feds regional banks also reviewed monetary policy through the 
first half of the year to decide whether any changes were needed in 
the monetary growth targets 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan will reveal the results 
of those deliberations when he testifies before the senate banking 
committee on july 13

the federal aviation administration 
technical center celebrated its 30th anniversary friday touting 
its many research developments and contributions to passengers 
safety 
we have some of the finest scientists in the world who live 
here this is probably one of the finest research environments in 
the world said edward t harris the centers director who 
officiated at a small cakecutting ceremony 
the center is believed to be the largest research facility of 
its kind in the world more than 2000 people work at the 
5059acre complex and it has an annual payroll of 85 million for 
employees and contractors 
the center just outside atlantic city has helped develop 
fireretardant seat cushions emergency evacuation chutes that 
wont melt in a fire floor lights to guide passengers through 
smoky aisles computer programs for air traffic controllers and a 
new warning device to help pilots avoid midair collisions well 
before other planes are in sight 
researchers also are working on projects that include finding 
ways of detecting bulk explosives and plastic weapons to avoid 
terrorist hijackings and using satellites to assist air 
controllers with overseas flights harris said 
the technical center is largely responsible for keeping the 
aviation industry in line with projected air traffic growth he 
said 
us rep william hughes dnj proposed a broadened role for 
the center 
there has to be a more direct link between our research 
facilities and universities and colleges were losing 
opportunities and this is an ideal site to develop a national 
aviation institute which would provide undergraduate and graduate 
training hughes said 
such an institute although still in the planning stage would 
incorporate the expertise of specialists in the aviation industry 
government and universities faa officials said 
technical center employees do much of their work in 
laboratories such as a giant hangar where fires are set in a 
hollowedout aircraft fuselage or the airport security lab that is 
surrounded by barbed wire but research also takes place in the air 
with test aircraft

a package of cable tv services that includes 
popular premium channels should be available to many rural home 
satellite dish owners this summer the national rural 
telecommunications cooperative said friday 
the services will be made available under an agreement the 
cooperative reached with six major programming services on 
thursday just hours after a house panel approved a bill requiring 
cable networks to sell their programming to independent 
distributors 
the agreement is the first involving an independent distributor 
and premium cable services the cooperative said it will add the 
channels to the program package it now markets through rural 
utility systems in 45 states 
included in the agreement are hbo cinemax the disney channel 
nickelodeon netlink usa and the nashville network 
congress has been concerned that some cable programmers have 
been unwilling to sell their programming to thirdparty 
distributors thus shutting out potential competitors and depriving 
the nations nearly 2 million dish owners of easy access to 
scrambled cable programming 
most of the popular cable programmers scramble their signals 
dish owners with a decoder can subscribe directly with these cable 
programmers but they have to subscribe separately with each 
the house energy and commerce telecommunications subcommittee on 
thursday voted 1311 to require programmers who sell to one 
distributor other than a cable company to sell to all other 
distributors but subcommittee members also urged the industry to 
work out its own solution and indicated the bill might be dropped 
if the industry showed competitive forces were at work in the 
marketplace

an estimated 6000 pounds of pure 
cocaine sealed in blocks of chocolate was seized at a long island 
warehouse in what may be the nations largest drug bust outside 
florida officials announced friday 
the seizure valued at 480 million is likely to drive up the 
price of coke in the new york city area this summer some officials 
said 
three colombian nationals thought to be members of a major 
colombian drug cartel were arrested in a raid of the toronto 
imports warehouse in hicksville by 50 agents thursday night said 
robert stutman special agent in charge of the drug enforcement 
administration in new york 
us customs inspectors stumbled on the cocaine shipment june 24 
during a routine check aboard the allison lykes at a port in 
newark nj according to peter baish agent in charge of us 
customs in new jersey 
the shipment was from ecuador and the inspection was a cold 
hit he said explaining that inspectors had no tip or advance 
warning of the contraband 
this was a picture perfect case baish said the hit is 
phenomenal for us 
he said the agents were attracted to the shipment 1200 cartons 
marked industrialized cocoa powder because ecuador is a source 
country for cocaine 
they sunk a drill into one of the cardboard boxes and hit a 
metal box hidden in the inner core of the hardened chocolate said 
baish 
agents opened the carton and found the cocaine inside the metal 
box he said they resealed it and kept a surveillance on the 
shipment with the help of electronic monitoring devices he said 
when the shipment was picked up thursday narcotics agents 
followed the trucks said art stiffel of us customs in new york 
the trucks were intercepted before reaching the warehouse and 
undercover agents took the place of the drivers according to 
stiffel 
he said the drivers were not part of the scheme and were unaware 
of the contents of their cargo 
the agents and the three defendants unloaded the boxes into the 
warehouse a few hours later when the suspects began moving some 
cartons out to their cars agents made the arrests 
oscar nunez 28 of jamaica ny absalon borrero 42 of 
miami and jaime caro 48 of anz colombia were charged with 
importation and distribution of cocaine and conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine 
they were ordered held without bail at their arraignment before 
us magistrate a simon chrein in us district court in brooklyn 
stutman said the suspects are believed to be members of the 
ochoa family of medellin colombia one of three leaders in 
cocaine production and importation 
each box weighed about 66 pounds each package of cocaine within 
weighed six to eight pounds and was marked with the initials of the 
person who had ordered it said stiffel stutman said 779 of the 
1200 cartons contained cocaine 
this is the largest seizure in the us outside of florida 
said stutman and there are only two seizures in florida that are 
greater 
stutman declined to comment on whether toronto imports was 
connected to the scheme he said more arrests are expected in the 
case 
authorities believe that agents have been successful in plugging 
up ports in florida which is putting pressure on smugglers to seek 
other areas such as the northeast as ports of entry 
stiffel estimated that the cost of cocaine around new york city 
will increase by 4000 a kilogram because of the seizure

the government on friday 
proposed tough measures to enforce residential segregation and 
critics said it could mean mass eviction of blacks from white areas 
the new amendment has a clear political message apartheid is 
alive and well said mahomed dangor spokesman for a group which 
has fought to block evictions of blacks living illegally in 
whitesonly areas 
government opponents condemned the proposal to tighten 
enforcement of the group areas act which segregates residential 
areas by race 
the government has not strictly enforced the 35yearold act in 
recent years angering conservative whites opposed to integrated 
neighborhoods the proposed amendment is viewed as an accommodation 
to rightwing whites prior to nationwide municipal elections in 
october 
the government indicates once again its absolute obsession 
with skin color as a norm on which to base south africas 
political social and economic life said the antiapartheid 
independent party 
tian van der merwe a parliament member for the antiapartheid 
progressive federal party called the new measures so harsh and 
so brutal that up to 200000 blacks could be evicted on short 
notice 
the group areas amendment bill calls for hiring inspectors to 
check for violations of the law it would make it easier for 
authorities to confiscate property and to evict and prosecute 
people living in areas not designated for their race group 
the maximum fine for a property owner who allows a person to 
live outside his race group area would be increased from the 
current 175 to 4300 the the maximum prison sentence would be 
increased from two years to five years 
the bill also would negate a court ruling that violators cannot 
be evicted until alternative housing is found 
a second bill proposed friday the free settlement areas bill 
would allow the creation of the first legal multiracial residential 
areas subject to approval by president pw botha and other 
officials no neighborhood could be intergrated against the wishes 
of its residents 
bothas national party favors gradual race reform but is 
committed to preserving white group rights such as segregated 
neighorhoods and schools 
the national party has held power for 40 years but has been 
losing ground to the farright conservative party which opposes 
all concessions to south africas 26million black majority 
the labor party which controls the mixedrace chamber of 
parliament said the group areas act cannot be amended and must 
be repealed 
we once again call on the nationalist government to repeal 
this immoral ungodly and iniquitous act that has been and still 
is the cause of so much hurt pain and suffering the party said 
south africa has a housing surplus in white areas and a severe 
shortage in black townships many whites have been moving from 
inner cities to suburban areas leaving urban landlords little 
choice but to rent to nonwhites in white neighborhoods such as 
hillbrow in johannesburg and woodstock in cape town 
the bill is to be debated at the end of august in the next 
session of parliament 
also friday antiapartheid church leaders called for an end to 
executions in south africa and said they would not comply with a 
directive to submit a church publication to censors 
the decisions were among more than 30 resolutions adopted at the 
close of a fiveday conference convened by the south african 
council of churches to which most major protestant denominations 
belong 
on thursday leaders of 16 churches affiliated to the council 
deliberately defied a stateofemergency regulation by announcing 
their opposition to participation in nationwide municipal elections 
oct 26 calls for an election boycott are outlawed under a 
regulation implemented june 10 
the clergymen like many other antiapartheid activists oppose 
black participation in local elections until the black majority 
obtains full political rights on the national level

irancontra prosecutors on friday urged a 
judge to reject fired white house aide oliver l norths renewed 
attempts to obtain secret documents concerning other covert 
operations he participated in or that came to his attention 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh claimed in court papers 
that norths latest request shows he wants to embark on a fishing 
expedition into the nations most sensitive classified materials 
he accused north of trying to convert the discovery rules into 
a vehicle for rummaging through files that are irrelevant to the 
charges in the indictment thereby delaying the trial of this 
matter 
north is awaiting trial on charges he conspired with president 
reagans former national security adviser john m poindexter and 
two arms dealers to divert usiran arms sale profits to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
his lawyers recently asked us district judge gerhard a gesell 
to reconsider his refusal to force the government to produce 
classified documents about other covert operations that he knew 
about or participated in while a national security council aide 
north is requesting documents about covert operations that used 
commercial cutouts foreign bank accounts or other methods or 
techniques similar to those allegedly used in connection with the 
iranian initiative or in connection with the support for the 
nicaraguan resistance 
material sought includes documents about covert operations 
undertaken without an express written presidential finding 
authorizing the activity 
walsh contended that none of the materials is relevant to any 
defense north might offer that he acted with authority of higher 
government officials 
no date has been set for norths trial 
gesell has also ordered separate trials for poindexter and arms 
dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v

an iraqi official acknowleged friday 
that his country used deadly chemical weapons in its 7yearold 
war with iran but claimed the iranians had used them first 
the comments by foreign minister tariq aziz appeared to be the 
first direct admission that iraq has used chemical weapons which 
are outlawed by international agreement 
but aziz defended his countrys use of chemical weapons saying 
iran was a great threat to iraq 
when we want peace we have to respect all conventions but 
you cannot say im going to respect all these conventions and give 
the other side the liberty not to respect them aziz told 
reporters in bonn 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
declined to comment on the acknowlegment by aziz except to repeat 
that the united states had condemned the use of chemical weapons in 
the iraniraq war which began in september 1980 
a un team arrived friday in tehran to investigate accusations 
that iraq used chemical weapons in a recent attack on iran 
according to irans official islamic republic news agency 
the irna report said iraqi chemical weapons killed 60 people and 
injured 4000 in a june attack on the western iranian city of 
ahwaz only 100 of the injured were hospitalized and 10 of those 
were in critical condition said the report monitored in nicosia 
on april 25 un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said 
there was evidence that both countries were using chemical weapons 
in their war 
the un chief had sent a physician from geneva to visit iran 
and iraq and examine victims of alleged chemical attacks on may 9 
the un security council condemned the use of chemical weapons in 
the iraniraq war 
the un report says both sides have used them chemical 
weapons aziz said iran started its use we were victims many 
times since the early beginning of the conflict 
asked if it was true both sides had used such weapons during the 
conflict aziz replied both sides 
iran also claims iraq killed 5000 people mostly iraqi kurds 
in a mustard gas and cyanide attack on the iranianheld halabja 
territory of iraq last march 
iraq did not deny the charge then and said it would use all 
necessary means to repel iranian forces it also accused iran of 
using chemical weapons 
iran denies that its forces have used such weapons 
aziz also accused iran of violating international accords on the 
treatment of prisoners 
lately 7000 iraqi prisoners of war disappeared we dont yet 
know what their destiny is said aziz 
aziz repeated assertions that iran started the war by invading 
iraq and that his country had the right to choose the means for its 
defense 
but the tehran government blames iraq for starting the war 
pointing out that iraq bombed iranian airfields in september 1980 
and saying irans military responded to that attack 
aziz also said that iraqs recent war successes do not mean that 
his country has changed its position of wanting to find a peaceful 
solution to the conflict 
we hope they iran will draw the correct conclusions from the 
present situation that the path to war leads only to 
continued killing and destruction he said but the question 
still remains whether they will reach that reasonable conclusion

the soviet union west germany and france 
on friday praised a compromise proposal at the stalled 35nation 
conference on european security 
speaking at a plenary meeting soviet chief delegate yuri 
kashlev indirectly criticized romania an eastbloc ally 
he said the question facing the conference is whether it can 
overcome a game of extremist counteramendments that could sink 
the compromise package worked out by nine neutral and nonaligned 
countries last month 
the conference on security and cooperation in europe began in 
november 1986 it is being attended by all signatories to the 1975 
helsinki conference including the united states canada and all 
european states except albania 
romanian delegate dumitru aninoiu reportedly rejected at an 
earlier meeting most of the human rights provisions in the 
compromise plan saying the nations that drafted the proposal had 
bowed to western demands 
kashlev referring to the romanian position said friday the 
question now is whether we will be able to adopt a final document 
representing a new word in the conference particularly in the 
military and humanitarian fields or whether we will fail to do so 
because some states are playing a game of extremist 
counteramendments in an attempt to ignore the legitimate 
reasonable and minimalistic positions of other delegations 
his unusual criticism of a sovietbloc member came as west 
german and french foreign ministers friday joined other delegates 
in praising the compromise plan designed to end the deadlocked 
conference 
the overall draft is a forward looking document that 
offers a basis for consensus and thus to our concluding efforts 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told the 
conference we must not lose any more time 
foreign minister roland dumas of france said the proposal which 
also calls for the convening of a human rights conference is not 
only the base the 35 nations can work on but also the balancing 
point that could lead to a final agreement 
neither genscher nor dumas indicated when they thought the 
conference might end 
among the remaining obstacles are romanias opposition to the 
compromise and nato and sovietbloc differences on whether to keep 
tactical nuclear weapons off the agenda as the west insists 
a final document must receive the approval of all 35 nations 
genscher referring to romania said the principle of consensus 
does not imply that a state can cling to proposals for which 
during the long negotiations it has been unable to gain the 
support of any other participating state 
dumas told reporters he planned to confer with romanian 
delegates in search of a solution i cant say that the romanian 
attitude will block the conference he said

a jury friday convicted gary heidnik of 
murdering two of six women he abducted and kept shackled in his 
basement torture chamber 
the case focused on whether heidnik knew right from wrong when 
he raped and killed women he lured to his north philadelphia home 
the defense argued he is schizophrenic and not responsible for his 
actions 
heidnik 44 was convicted of firstdegree murder kidnapping 
rape aggravated assault and involuntary deviate sexual 
intercourse he was acquitted of one count of the latter charge 
judge lynne abraham set saturday morning for the start of a 
penalty hearing prosecutors have said they would seek the death 
penalty 
jurors chosen in pittsburgh because of pretrial publicity here 
began deliberating wednesday afternoon and issued their verdict at 
330 pm friday thank god it was guilty of firstdegree said 
teresa lomax sister of sandra lindsay one of the women who died 
in heidniks house and who according to testimony had been sawed 
apart some of her remains fed to other captives 
thank god that the jury listened to the case she said he 
deserved guilty guilty guilty now im hoping for the death 
penalty that was a brutal way for my sister to die tortured 
nobody deserves to die like that 
another victims sister diane dudley whose sister debbie was 
electrocuted when heidnik touched live wires to her chains while 
she stood in a waterfilled pit said i feel good he got what 
he deserved 
now i hope he gets the chair and debbie can rest in peace 
ms dudley said 
defense attorney a charles peruto jr called the verdict a 
big letdown he said heidnik spoke to him after the verdict but 
declined to reveal the conversation 
whatever he said he had no emotion peruto said 
assistant district attorney charles gallagher said the jury 
did an excellent job 
it is a difficult task for a jury to perform that is to sit 
in judgment upon ones peer this case presented very difficult and 
complicated legal issues all of which the jury pondered for quite 
a bit of time and came to a just decision 
during the polling of the jury the 44yearold heidnik stared 
straight ahead showing no emotion 
the sole innocent verdict came in a charge involving josefina 
rivera a prostitute heidnik seized in november 1986 
it was ms rivera who eventually escaped and brought police to 
heidniks socalled house of horrors where he had imprisoned 
the women 
peruto had argued heidnik was insane a fruitcake who 
suffered from schizophrenia first diagnosed in 1963 for which he 
was discharged from the army 
this man conducted repeated sadistic acts on six defenseless 
persons gallagher argued what he did was premeditated 
deliberate murder he knew what he was doing and he knew it was 
wrong

testimony in the trial of ferdi elsas a 45yearold unemployed 
business consultant 
elsas is charged with abducting and killing heijn vice 
president of the ahold concern the netherlands biggest supermarket 
chain 
ahold also owns the giant food and bilo supermarkets in the 
united states 
van der veen said elsas killed a man in cold blood 
according to a welldevised plan elsas has said he picked his 
victim at random and planned the kidnapping for months 
heijns family paid 4 million in cash and diamonds for his 
release but elsas told the court friday he had shot and killed the 
56yearold kidnap victim with a 9mm pistol near heijns makeshift 
grave the day he was abducted 
it was money and diamonds that motivated elsas and everything 
else was subordinated to that van der veen said 
the court said it would rule july 13 
under the dutch penal system a life sentence means 20 years 
imprisonment a prisoner may be released for good behavior after 
serving twothirds of his term 
heijn disappeared sept 9 after leaving his home to go to a 
dental appointment his body was exhumed april 4 in a forest near 
renkum in the eastern netherlands 
elsas gave the court on friday a description of heijns final 
hours 
the two of us sat in the sun for a while and drank some orange 
juice he heijn had never suspected what was going to happen to 
him elsas said 
hank heijn the victims widow and three of their children 
attended the trial 
in october when heijns kin demanded some sign he was alive 
they received his little finger elsas told police he cut the 
finger off after he killed the grocery baron 
at the end of the eighthour trial elsas reading from a 
prepared statement said words cannot compensate the loathsome 
crimes i have committed and the immeasurable grief i have caused to 
the heijn family 
i want to say that i am sorry i now live in a nightmare from 
which i shall never awake 
a forensic psychiatrist told the court elsas was not fully 
responsible for his deeds at the time of the abduction 
if the court accepts that finding it could impose a limited 
jail sentence followed by openended confinement to an institution 
for the criminally insane 
police arrested elsas in a raid on his home in a small amsterdam 
suburb after a huge search 
elsas arrest followed discovery of a 250guilder note from the 
ransom payment in january by a bank employee in the dutch capital 
the note was traced back to a supermarket where the suspect did 
his shopping police recovered nearly all the ransom

mikhail s gorbachev won communist party backing 
friday for sweeping changes that would limit top officials to 10 
years in office and create a stronger presidency that he might 
assume while remaining party chief 
the fourday national conference of 5000 party members the 
first since 1941 closed with gorbachev saying the reforms would 
point the way to a new democratic image of socialism 
he also found himself in the middle of an open feud between the 
no 2 kremlin leader yegor k ligachev and former moscow party 
chief boris n yeltsin which was played out on television and gave 
millions of viewers an unprecedented look at cracks in the party 
monolith 
alexander lukyanov secretary of the party central committee 
told a latenight news briefing that several resolutions were 
approved 
he said the conference backed gorbachevs proposals to allow 
elected party officials only two fiveyear terms with no 
exceptions 
he also said the new stronger presidency would have the powers 
gorbachev requested to settle matters of foreign policy and head 
the defense council a position traditionally held by the party 
chief 
also approved was gorbachevs controversial recommendation that 
party leaders lead the corresponding legislatures all the way up 
to combining the job of president and party general secretary that 
could enable gorbachev to take an even firmer grip on power by 
assuming a stronger presidency while retaining the party leadership 
georgy razumovsky a nonvoting member of the ruling politburo 
said 209 delegates voted against that provision an extremely rare 
show of dissent in the party 
an amendment calling for the party newspaper pravda to be taken 
away from the policymaking central committee and turned over to 
the party as a whole received only 56 votes said tass the 
official news agency 
assessing the results of the conference just before it closed 
late friday night gorbachev said through democratization 
economic reform and changes in the political system we will make 
perestroika irreversible we will reach a fundamentally new state 
of our society a new humane and democratic image of socialism 
perestroika or restructuring is the name gorbachev has given 
the ambitious reform program on which he embarked soon after 
gaining the leadership in march 1985 
in his final address gorbachev also proposed a final break with 
the stalinist past by building a monument in moscow to the 
dictators millions of victims and said elections for stronger 
local and national legislatures should be held next spring 
tass said gorbachev presided over an unusually stormy and 
long debate on resolutions that reflected the extraordinary 
spirit of open criticism permitted during the meeting 
the main drama on the final day was provided by the bitter 
personal dispute between ligachev and yeltsin gorbachev devoted 
much of his final 40minute speech to a critique of yeltsins work 
as moscow party chief before his dismissal last november 
yeltsin appealed to the conference to absolve him of any blame 
for accusing entrenched bureaucracy of slowing down the pace of 
reform that criticism cost him his moscow job and his nonvoting 
seat on the politburo 
he has identified ligachev in foreign television interviews as 
the official most responsible for holding up reforms and called on 
him to resign 
ligachev thundered back in a speech friday that he made his 
region selfsufficient in food while working as a party leader in 
siberia but the district where you boris worked for nine years 
now has rationing of food 
gorbachev broke in at one point to quiet delegates and make sure 
yeltsin could finish his address as he closed the session he gave 
a lengthy account of yelstins failings 
resolutions adopted by the conference were not published 
immediately but razumovsky a gorbachev protege told the news 
conference the soviet leader has won his fight to reform the 
political system 
about the dissenting votes razumovsky said nothing of the 
kind has happened for a long time at a similar forum 
in his closing remarks gorbachev said the central committee and 
other party organs should settle questions of political reform on 
an urgent basis so a fall session of the supreme soviet can begin 
to implement it he said elections for the new legislatures could 
be held next april 
referring to his proposals for a new 2250member chamber of 
peoples deputies a smaller and more active supreme soviet and 
for presidential powers over defense and foreign policy he said 
the conference will continue living in the society in the 
discussions in the society but now we know how we must transform 
the political system 
stalin has become the object of increasingly sharp criticism 
since gorbachevs glasnost policy of greater openness made such 
comment possible but the decision to build a monument to his 
victims is the most definitive step soviet authorities have taken 
to repudiate him 
i think we must agree to this and such a monument must be 
constructed in moscow gorbachev said this would be an honest 
step and it will be supported by the entire soviet people

china on friday urged all cambodian factions to 
form a coalition government as vietnam withdraws its forces 
shifting policy in an apparent effort to keep the cambodian khmer 
rouge from becoming dominant 
china said that once an interim government is established a 
freeze should be imposed on kampuchean cambodian forces of all 
factions and these factions should refrain from interfering in 
free general elections 
the chinese government the main ally of the communist khmer 
rouge and other factions in cambodias antivietnamese resistance 
previously insisted no national reconciliation could take place in 
cambodia until vietnam withdrew all its troops vietnam invaded 
cambodia in late 1978 ousted the khmer rouge government and 
installed another communist regime 
cambodian prime minister hun sen and some countries including 
the united states have expressed concern that vietnams withdrawal 
will create an opening for the khmer rouge to again seize power 
the khmer rouge came to power after defeating the usbacked 
government in the spring of 1975 according to some estimates up 
to 3 million cambodians were killed under the khmer rouge regime 
china has backed a threeparty antivietnamese coalition headed 
by former cambodian prince norodom sihanouk the coalition includes 
sihanouks followers the khmer rouge and a noncommunist group 
under son sann 
the khmer rouge is believed to have a stronger fighting force 
than its coalition partners 
in a proposal issued by the foreign ministry china said vietnam 
should withdraw all of its estimated 140000 troops at the 
earliest possible date and the three resistance groups and hun 
sen should form a provisional government headed by sihanouk while 
vietnam pulls out 
vietnam said this week it had begun withdrawing 50000 troops 
and its military command from cambodia in an operation to be 
completed in december it said it will have removed all of its 
forces by 1990 
the foreign ministry proposal called for practical and 
effective international supervision of vietnams troop 
withdrawal the maintenance of peace in cambodia and free elections 
it did not elaborate on which countries it envisioned joining in 
the supervision or if they should send troops to form a 
peacekeeping force 
chinas proposal appeared timed for consideration by the four 
cambodian parties at informal talks to be held in indonesia later 
this month 
its conciliatory tone was in sharp contrast to other recent 
chinese statements that have called vietnams troop withdrawal plan 
inadequate and a possible hoax 
the us state department said last week that china had signaled 
in private its willingness to support a cambodian government 
without the khmer rouge but chinas foreign ministry denied that 
the new statement however appeared an effort to acknowledge 
concern over the khmer rouge and guard against the group taking 
sole power

secretary of state george p shultz 
ended a visit to central america friday and leaders of nicaraguan 
guerrillas said they discussed with him ways to win congressional 
approval for aid to the rebels 
alfredo cesar a leader of the rebels known as contras met with 
shultz on thursday and later said the package discussed could 
include direct us aid to the leftist sandinista government if it 
fulfills promised democratic reforms 
the united states cut all aid to the nicaraguan government in 
1981 
shultz spent six hours in san jose after a flight from 
guatemala where another rebel leader adolfo calero said there 
was discussion on a 30 million aid package for the insurgents 
calero said there have been informal talks about the possibility 
of setting aside 7 million and releasing it as military aid the 
sandinistas do not meet promises for greater democracy 
all sides agreed that no decisions have been made on a contra 
aid package the reagan administration has said only that congress 
will be asked to approve an unspecified amount of additional 
assistance 
the rebels have received no military aid since feb 29 congress 
approved a 17 million humanitarian aid package in late march after 
the rebels and the sandinistas agreed on a temporary truce 
calero said shultz responded positively to the idea of a new aid 
package in which a portion would be earmarked for military 
assistance and placed in an escrow account 
there is no doubt in my mind that hes very enthusiastic about 
it very enthusiastic calero said 
reagan administration officials accompanying shultz seemed 
annoyed that the contra aid issue was deflecting attention from 
shultzs principal message during his threeday tour of costa rica 
el salvador honduras and guatemala that the regions democratic 
countries are progressing while nicaragua is lagging far behind 
at an airport arrival ceremony in san jose attended by hundreds 
of flagwaving school children shultz said there has been a 
twothirds decline in living standards in nicaragua over the past 
four months 
but shultz did not mention a new aid package for the contras 
shultz met with costa rican president oscar arias and then told 
reporters at a news conference only that the administration is 
seeking obviously to support those who stand up and are ready to 
struggle against the sandinistas 
arias said shultz had proposed a meeting with the foreign 
ministers of the four countries he visited to be held before a 
scheduled central american summit that would include nicaragua in 
early august 
arias who won last years nobel peace prize for his regional 
peace plan said the shultz suggestion specifically excluded 
nicaragua from the proposed foreign ministers meeting 
he also said he told shultz that talks between the sandinistas 
and contras have not failed yet and suggested neither side has put 
its final bargaining position on the table arias said he hoped the 
two sides would agree to meet this month 
the idea of approving military aid and placing it in an escrow 
account has been discussed in recent weeks by procontra lawmakers 
in washington 
calero said he expects legislation to be introduced soon in the 
senate with the campaign spearheaded by democratic sens david 
boren of oklahoma and ernest hollings of south carolina 
joining them is sen gordon humphrey rnh calero said 
according to calero the aid package would be for the sixmonth 
period between october 1988 and march 1989 
the most innovative aspect of the aid proposal is the pledge to 
provide economic aid to the sandinistas if they meet contra demands 
for democratization 
cesar meeting with reporters thursday called the package a 
carrot and stick approach noting that sandinista 
noncompliance with promised reformed would trigger military aid 
for the contras 
the carter administration sought to woo the sandinistas with 
economic aid after the triumph of the revolution in july 1979 
about 120 million was spent but the reagan administration 
suspended the program in april 1981 citing alleged sandinista 
efforts to export their revolution 
shultz said friday that the sandinistas are continuing to 
subvert their neighbors 
i want to make it absolutely clear that the united states will 
not tolerate the subversion or destabilization of the democratic 
governments of central america shultz said

salvage workers on friday sawed in 
two the wreck of a sunken tanker loaded with a deadly chemical as a 
preliminary to raising the hulk dutch television reported 
none of the dutchflagged anna broeres cargo of 1600 tons of 
highly toxic acrylonitrile leaked from its tanks during the 
hourlong operation the tv report said 
salvage crews fled on thursday when an acrylonitrile tank sprang 
a leak during efforts to lift the ship but no injuries were 
reported

used by the plastics industry 
workers on friday used a 16ton chain to separate the ships aft 
section which contains the engine room from the fore part where 
the tanks are the report said it said this was done to facilitate 
hoisting the wreck to the surface later 
the sawing operation marked the latest episode in efforts to 
salvage the ship and its hazardous cargo after the anna broere 
collided with a freighter 40 miles off the netherlands on may 27

expected to be raised over the weekend the report said 
a first attempt to salvage the anna broere failed last month 
when two of the four steel cables holding the vessel broke 
a coast guard official said water samples taken thursday showed 
a sudden increase in the levels of acrylonitrile in the water at 
the site and divers quickly boarded small boats kept nearby for 
emergencies 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said that at 
about 930 pm thursday the levels rose to more than seven times 
the amount considered safe by the dutch environment ministry

about 220 west german environmentalists scampered 
over a 13foothigh section of the berlin wall into communist 
territory friday to dodge police trying to clear them away from a 
disputed spot near the wall 
most of them returned to west berlin later in the day police 
said nine protesters were arrested but eight were released later 
authorities issued a removal order friday after a 5week 
struggle that pitted environmentalists against city developers the 
demonstrators were protesting plans to build a highway through a 
nearby park 
when more than 900 west berlin police moved in to chase away the 
squatters the protesters were already perched on the wall 
they had earlier declared they would seek political asylum 
in east berlin if west german police tried to remove them 
east german border guards helped the protesters over the 
communistbuilt barrier which splits berlin into allied and 
communist sectors some guards backed trucks up to the eastern side 
of the wall to make it easier for the environmentalists to jump 
down and escape west berlin police 
one smiling east german guard helped one protester by pulling 
his bicycle over the wall others greeted cheering protesters with 
coffee warm sausages and cigarettes 
the protesters were occupying a 10acre piece of land which 
formally came under west berlins control at one minute after 
thursday midnight before then police could not legally enter the 
area 
the property was handed over under a deal worked out with east 
berlin this year 
the protesters began occupying the land may 26 they set up a 
shantytown and put up barriers to protect themselves from police 
the area became the scene of frequent violent skirmishes between 
police and demonstrators protesters often attacked police with 
bottles stones and gasoline bombs officers responded with tear 
gas and water cannons 
west berlin officials have repeatedly asked protesters to leave 
the area saying it could contain live ammunition from world war 
ii the area not far from where nazi leader adolf hitlers bunker 
was located was the scene of fierce battles in the final days of 
world war ii 
officials have said plans for the proposed highway are not yet 
finalized and have charged that many of the protesters are intent 
only on provoking violence with authorities 
east germanys staterun newspaper neues deutschland last week 
reported west berlin police were using terror tactics against 
the protesters indicating offical communist approval of the 
environmentalists actions

a prosecutor dropped criminal libel 
charges against a weekly newspaper editor friday at the request of 
two legislators who said the case was causing the poor rural area 
too much adverse publicity 
state rep bj gordon and state sen frank mcgill whom editor 
jim fitts accused of unspecified corruption and stealing delivered 
letters to solicitor wade kolb on friday asking him to drop the 
charges 
i see no useful purpose in furthering the prosecution of jim 
fitts mcgill said in his letter i realize that vengeance is 
not mine but gods 
gordon a baptist minister wrote god in his own time will 
rectify all situations 
kolb who agreed to drop the rarely used counts of criminal 
libel said of gordon and mcgill even though both felt seriously 
harmed they didnt want to harm williamsburg county they 
were distressed by the negative publicity that has made the county 
look bad 
fitts the 62yearold editor of a small weekly newspaper the 
voice was indicted by a grand jury monday and faced a possible 
sentence of a year in jail if he was convicted he was not 
immediately available for comment on fridays action a newspaper 
employee said 
wallace connor the attorney for the lawmakers said nobody 
ever thought this would reach the proportions that it did ive 
never in my 40 years of practice here seen anything that got such 
national attention 
the case set off a legal battle involving first amendment rights 
that caught the attention of journalists across the united states 
it was only the fourth criminal libel suit involving journalists in 
south carolina in 40 years and the first in the nation since 1984 
in his column of may 17 fitts who is black wrote in part 
i will say to you without fear of contradiction if every black 
in williamsburg county would start stealing today and steal every 
day for the rest of their lives they could not steal as much as 
those two have stolen during their time in power he did not 
elaborate 
gordon who is black and mcgill who is white signed warrants 
against fitts shortly after reading the column 
the two politicians have denied fitts charges 
but the state newspaper reported friday that an investigation 
completed in february by the state law enforcement division 
concluded that gordon while chairman of a center for mentally 
retarded adults that he founded in 1976 diverted state grant money 
and used it for personal benefit 
a prosecutor concluded there was not enough evidence of criminal 
activity to present to a grand jury the law enforcement division 
said 
connor said the state story had nothing to do with gordons 
decision to drop the libel charge i didnt see that theres 
anything there in the state story that would have justified him 
fitts saying what he did in the newspaper connor said 
kolb said gordon and mcgill told him last week that they were 
going to ask him to drop the charges after the grand jury 
indictment was unsealed monday 
although mcgill said i trust that the matter will be laid to 
rest the american civil liberties union is considering asking 
permission from fitts to ask a judge to declare the states 
criminal libel law unconstitional state aclu director steve bates 
said friday 
in any event this whole affair points out the need to abolish 
the criminal libel statute because it is an invitation to 
politicians to intimidate and silence their opponents in an attempt 
to hide the truth bates said

a publisher who ran a private 
investigation into the unsolved 1986 assassination of prime 
minister olof palme said friday he believed palme was killed on 
orders from iran 
ebbe carlsson said iran wanted palme eliminated because he was 
ending illegal deliveries of swedish arms to the tehran government 
and because he was appointed by the united nations to mediate an 
end to the iraniraq war 
a gunman shot and killed palme on a stockholm street on feb 28 
1986 police have failed to establish a motive and have offered a 
83 million reward for the killer 
carlsson is employed at bonniers one of swedens main 
publishing houses which publishes everything from books to weekly 
magazines 
the disclosure of carlssons unofficial probe created a 
political storm and led to the resignation june 7 of justice 
minister anna greta lejion who approved his secret mission and 
wrote a letter of introduction to foreign intelligence agencies 
carlsson said he was pursuing a possible middle east connection 
to the assassination a link that police investigated but failed to 
prove 
critics said carlssons maverick operation bordered on the 
illegal his bodyguard was caught smuggling outlawed surveillance 
equipment into sweden and added nothing to the official probe 
breaking his silence over the episode carlsson said on swedish 
radio iran is conducting a holy war where they put everything 
into the survival of their nation and they did not want any 
mediation or meddling 
he also said i think that olof palme was murdered because 
iran felt it was more difficult to buy war material since he had 
become premier in 1982 
iran and iraq have been at war since september 1980 
carlsson indicated he believed iran contracted the murder to 
kurdish extremists living in sweden who also had a grudge against 
palme 
several reports during the police investigation mentioned a 
small group of leftist kurdish exiles known as the kurdish workers 
party as perhaps organizing the killing the kurds are an ethnic 
group seeking a separate state in part of iran and iraq 
the palme government had classified the group as a terrorist 
organization and sentenced two of its alleged members to life in 
prison for the killing of two defectors from the group 
carlsson said police received a lot of tips about the behavior 
of the kurds in connection with the murder and that my simple 
contribution was drawing a possible link between the two theories 
attorney general hans stark said friday he would open a 
preliminary investigation against two security police officers who 
gave carlsson classified information on the palme case 
but stark releasing a 42page report on the carlsson incident 
cleared the heads of the security police and the national police of 
irregular behavior

the grownups paid 40 a ticket without a 
murmur and the children proved that kids are kids the world over 
when the greatest show on earth made its debut in this very 
unfamiliar part of the world on friday 
the ringling bros and barnum and bailey circus roused some 
familiar reactions even though it was performing 5000 miles from 
home the cavorting clowns and the dancing elephants still helped 
make the big top a big hit 
ringmaster dinny mcguire was ecstatic about the reception here 
following the afternoon performance and susannah smith vice 
president for public relations said the evening performance went 
even better 
some of the kids were dancing in the aisles she said 
we have been prepared for a reserved quiet crowd this is not 
texas mcguire said after the first performance 
but they clapped fervently i did not expect them to be as 
overwhelmingly demonstrative in their response 
the first ringling show ever to play in japan opened in a huge 
tent in this northern city its first time under canvas in 32 
years won the hearts of a reserved but lessthancapacity audience 
of about 4000 people 
after slow start the audience warmed to the troupe and 
applauded enthusiastically 
i told you this during the dress rehersal but today was the 
real test because we had real people and they loved it circus 
owner kenneth feld told the 200 members of his troupe after the 
show 
you really are the greatest show on earth feld said 
feld has brought an all new version of the 118yearold show to 
japan as an experiment 
it will give 44 performances in sapporo then 96 shows in tokyo 
in august and september feld said the circus will go on to play in 
osaka in southern japan in october before returning home 
the testing of the japanese entertainment waters comes at a time 
when the bolshoi circus from the soviet union already wellknown 
here also is touring japan 
but feld says the soviets dont compare with us theyre very 
plodding they cant match our rhythm and tempo thats the secret 
tempo 
the ringling tour of japan is being promoted locally by the 
japan educational association which asked feld to bring a show as 
big as the two ringling troupes touring the united states said 
show publicist joe gold 
feld also liked the idea because japan is a wealthy nation that 
can afford hefty admission prices gold said adult tickets went 
for 40 about four times the average price in the united states 
feld created a new gold unit with the best of the acts from 
the blue and red units touring america and worldclass 
acts from other countries 
to help audiences here understand the acts ringmaster mcguire 
had to learn his introductions and explanations in japanese also 
japanese characters were put on many of the clown costumes to 
identify them to the children 
finally we brought in 120 kids last week for a dry run 
gold said we went through the clown routines to find out 
what worked and what didnt 
feld said the production cost 10 million including 8 million 
for the tent 
after fridays matinee a smiling mrs sachiko okawara asked 
about performance said she liked the performers the animals 
the costumes the lights and the band the band was beautiful 
for 5yearold miku kusakabo the list of favorite items was 
much shorter the elephants she said through an interpreter 
and nodded vigorously when asked if she wanted to come back again

china marked the 67th anniversary friday of the 
founding of its communist party by issuing a new party theoretical 
journal and by cautioning the 47 million party members that their 
mission is a serious one 
each member from the day he joins the party is constantly 
tested the party newspaper peoples daily said in a frontpage 
editorial as times change so do the tasks and the tests 
it said members main tasks now are to uphold chinas 
marketstyle economic reforms and fight growing corruption that has 
accompanied the new prosperity 
there are a handful of members including some officials 
who instead of using their power to benefit the people and the 
country abuse it for personal gains the paper said we must 
resolutely expel them

1921 at a girls school in shanghais foreign quarter when police 
got word of the session delegates fled to nearby hangzhou and 
finished their meeting in a boat on a scenic lake posing as 
holidaymakers 
fewer and fewer members today are interested in marxist 
ideology as evidenced by the creation of the new livelier party 
journal 
the old party bimonthly red flag hong qi which put out its 
last issue in june carried lengthy jargonladen essays on such 
topics as the relationship between art and the masses and basing 
planning work on the foundation of the law of value 
the new journal called seek truth qiu shi takes its name 
from senior leader deng xiaopings pragmatic slogan seek truth 
from facts he advanced the slogan in the 1970s as a counterpoint 
to mao tsetungs emphasis on theory and the ideology of class

conservation groups applauded a 
decision friday by the international timber industry to promote 
environmentconscious logging in the amazon jungle the worlds 
largest tropical rainforest 
the usbased world wildlife fund said the decision the first 
of its kind by the timber industry could slow destruction of the 
amazon rainforest a key regulator of the worlds weather 
the international tropical timber organization an association 
of 42 producing and consuming countries approved a 4 million 
logging and conservation project in the remote jungle state of 
acre on brazils border with bolivia 2800 miles northwest of rio 
de janeiro 
the project calls for integrated development of jungle 
products such as brazil nuts and rubber as well as timber it 
also calls for loggers to consult with environmental groups 
government agencies native indians and local workers to plan 
longterm development to preserve the rainforest 
this was the big one we hope the acre project can serve as a 
model not just for the rest of the amazon but for all tropical 
forests adam markham press spokesman for the world wildlife 
fund told the ap at the end of a 10day meeting of the timber 
organization 
the organizations members control 95 percent of the worlds 
56 billion tropical timber trade 
as timber trade shifts away from the shrinking forests of africa 
and southeast asia the mahoganyrich amazon is seen as the next 
great source of hardwood 
but conservationists are worried about the effect on the climate 
of uncontrolled logging in the amazon basin a 2 million 
squaremile region as large as europe that covers parts of seven 
south american countries and contains a third of the worlds 
rainforest 
already the amazon forest is disappearing at the rate of some 27 
million acres a year mostly at the hands of small farmers and 
ranchers who cut and burn the trees markham said 
the rainforest is a gaseous sink for carbon dioxide the trees 
soak it up if we cut them down theres no way to get rid of the 
gas and that contributes to the greenhouse effect he said 
the greenhouse effect is a gradual warming of the earths 
surface because of excessive carbon dioxide and pollutants in the 
atmosphere that trap the suns heat like a greenhouse it is 
thought to be a possible cause of the current drought in the us 
midwest 
the acre project which will get about 3 million from the 
brazilan government and the rest from the timber organization is 
the largest approved since the organization was founded in 1986 
smaller conservation programs similar to the acre project were 
approved for bolivia and ecuador 
other proposals approved at the rio meeting were 
development of a news market service to help producing 
countries market better 
standardization of timber specifications among member 
countries to cut waste caused by conflicting measurements 
improvement of harvesting and processing equipment 
the next meeting of the organization is scheduled for november 
in yokohama japan

an 18year study that revealed the atomic 
structure of earths most abundant protein could lead to higher 
crop yields better drugs to combat cancer and heart disease and 
even to more effective laundry detergents scientists say 
the study by biochemist david eisenberg of the university of 
california los angeles is very significant work said dr 
john norvell health science administrator at the national 
institute of general medical sciences in bethesda md 
it will add a lot to the understanding of how these complex 
proteins work and therefore may help researchers trying to 
design proteins to combat several diseases including diabetes and 
cancer norvell said 
eisenberg and his students published their study today in the 
journal science they spent 18 years bombarding crystals of the 
protein named rubisco with xrays before they successfully 
produced computer images showing the threedimensional arrangement 
of the 37792 atoms in the protein which ultimately sustains life 
by making every plant grow

silence has greeted peter brooks lavish ninehour 
odyssey based on the rambling indian epic the mahabharata but 
for the cast the silence is golden 
playing to nearly packed houses in tokyo the last stop of a 
yearlong worldwide tour brooks adaptation of goods triumph over 
evil pits two warring clans in ferocious battle to gain control of 
a vast ancient indian kingdom 
the epic which comprises the worlds longest poem narrates a 
way of life in its dealings with feelings of hatred love and 
jealousy basic human emotions often hidden under a polite facade 
audiences in new york copenhagen paris and glasgow have responded 
with awkward embarrassed laughter 
that has been true with many audiences all over the world 
said malika sarabhai the only indian national in the performance 
we used to get very upset in the beginning 
in america they laughed at everything said sarabhai an 
accomplished danceractress in india anytime when there was 
something tense going on stage they would laugh because they 
are embarrassed they dont like to be confronted with very 
deep very basic emotions 
in tokyo the silence has been louder the japanese audience has 
laughed the least many japanese brook said have discovered that 
india is really the root of their culture 
kenichiro shirahama a theater critic and author of several 
books on plays said the mahabharata has allowed the japanese 
to reevaluate the meaning of life 
japan has drawn its culture from the centuriesold traditions 
of korea china and especially india he said but in their 
pursuit of money the japanese have forgotten how to live 
by watching the play the people are reminded of the richness 
of life and human nature 
in tokyo for an eightweek engagement as part of the sixmonth 
festival of india the mahabharata has earned rave reviews from 
the local media and saison theater personnel say tickets for the 
ninehour marathon sessions were sold out well in advance before 
the opening last month 
originally written in the ancient indian language of sanskrit 
the epic under brooks direction is staged in english and lines up 
a multinational cast of 50 people from over 15 different countries 
the cast of the centre international de creations theatreales 
company based in france has already toured in europe the united 
states and australia 
ironically india has not been part of its itinerary 
mariehelene estienne brooks assistant blamed the logistics 
of transporting a company of 50 plus into a nation notorious for 
its red tape but said a movie on the play next on the directors 
agenda will open in new delhi by september 1989 
doordarshan indias governmentrun tv network will sponsor the 
plays move to celluloid and will also cast the same group of 
actors with one notable difference the play will be cut to six 
hours the shortest length of time in which the story can be 
told brook said doordarshan he added initially wanted only 
two hours 
the epic is played out an a stage packed with dry earth 
complete with a pond in the front and a rippling stream in the 
back outdoor and indoor scenes within acts are signaled by 
changing floor mats brought out by the actors themselves doubling 
as stagehands 
the story is about two groups of cousins the kauravas and the 
pandavas who fight over control of an ancient indian kingdom the 
climax of the story is an 18day battle in which the pandavas 
representing good are victorious 
around this core are woven thousands of subplots which nearly 
fill an entire encyclopedia of 18 books 
the play is very true to the mahabharata very true to the 
spirit sarabhai said had i not been proud of the production 
both as an indian and as a woman i dont think i would have stayed 
party to it

environmentalists are mobilizing 
to save whats left of brazils oncevast atlantic forest the 
nations picturepostcard front door 
one of the species of trees near extinction is the brazilwood 
or paubrazil which gave the country its name 
when portuguese explorers discovered brazil in 1500 the 
atlantic forest covered some 170000 square miles along a 
3000mile coastal strip 
today with 80 million of the countrys 143 million people and 
most of its heavy industry crowded into the coastal zone only 
about 3 percent of the original primary forest remains in 
scattered patches 
some of the forests rare monkeys birds and trees many found 
nowhere else in the world face extinction 
we are in the process of destroying an entire ecosystem but 
theres still time to save whats left and prevent total tragedy 
said rodrigo lara mesquita the chairman of a group called the 
sos atlantic forest foundation 
the foundation has strong economic and political influence 
mesquita is an heir of the family that for a century has 
controlled the influential o estado de s paulo newspaper and media 
group others running sos include two multimillionaire 
industrialists the president of the countrys largest university 
and a retired admiral 
since 1986 the foundation has raised the equivalent of more 
than 4 million for nationwide newspaper and television publicity 
it intends to collect more for the satellite mapping of the forest 
zone and for actual conservation programs where the remaining 
forest is thickest 
this group is powerful and well organized said russell a 
mittermeier international vice chairman of the washingtonbased 
world wildlife fund and a consultant to the atlantic forest 
organization its not radical as unfortunately was the case 
with many well meaning but ineffective environmental groups that 
sprang up in the united states in the 1960s im very optimistic 
mittermeier has been coming to brazil since 1971 principally to 
work with atlantic forests endangered monkey species 
he said in an interview in rio de janeiro that brazil probably 
has the best chance for success of the three highestpriority 
ecological problems in the world the tropical south american 
andes in colombia ecuador and peru the african island of 
madagascar and the atlantic forest 
here in the atlantic forest it really is possible to save the 
remnants mittermeier said he mentioned specifically the 
muriqui south americas largest primate of which fewer than 100 
remain the golden lion tamarin another endangered monkey with 
about 400 left the increasingly scarce redtailed parrot the rare 
and valuable jacaranda tree and the almost extinct paubrazil 
today with few exceptions the only place you can still see 
paubrasil is in a botanical garden lamented mesquita 
early portuguese pioneers chopped down all the brazilwood they 
could find to extract dye later settlers hacked away the coastal 
forest to make way for sugarcane and coffee plantations and for 
settlements 
the sos atlantic forest foundations logotype is a stylized 
greenyellowandblue brazilian flag but with part of the green 
ripped away 
a foundation poster shows a map of brazil with an outline of the 
atlantic forest as it existed in 1500 with the words in 
portuguese i used to be like this then there is a map showing 
the scattered forest pockets left today and the words i wound up 
like this 
the foundations first specific project is to be in a 
stillrelatively untouched forest zone covering 3500 square miles 
along the coasts of the southeastern states of sao paulo and 
parana it intends to set up two ecological bases and buy a 
patroltype boat to sound the alarm against illegal tree cutting 
and the banned netting of coastal fish shrimp and oysters 
invasion of that region has long gone unpunished sos 
chairman mesquita said but we think we can stop it were 
organized weve got money and we have access to the authorities 
and the media 
the foundation also supported lobby efforts in brazils congress 
to place in the draft of a new constitution the legal concept of 
ecological crime 
were also attempting a process of environmental education 
said ibsen de gusmao camara the former admiral who now is a member 
of the sos board a lot of brazilians think development 
automatically means physical occupation its not that they 
purposely want to destroy the environment they just dont know any 
better 
well never see the atlantic forest again as it once was he 
added thats impossible but we will put a stop to the 
destruction and preserve and build up the forests genetic

two public television documentaries this week 
give names and faces and unique stories to a part of the population 
that is often faceless especially on tv the elderly 
one of the films is an uplifting fairytale romance the academy 
awardwinning short documentary young at heart airing 
wednesday 
the other is a realistic profile of six elderly women acting 
our age is half of the twohour premiere installment tuesday 
night of pov standing for point of view a new 
documentary series on pbs 
the film is by michal aviad an israeli filmmaker who decided to 
examine the effects of aging both physically and psychologically 
on a halfdozen thoughtful and intelligent women coping with 
different lifestyles married divorced and widowed some lonely 
some not 
theres nobody thats young thats not going to get old 
unless they die says enola maxwell 66 one of the women ms 
aviad profiles 
ms aviad allows her subjects to speak for themselves as a 
result they are portrayed sympathetically but realistically 
mrs maxwell is surrounded by an extended family but irja 
friend 74 is struggling with loneliness the older i get the 
fewer chances i have and the ones that i had i rejected its 
painful not to be wanted and i found that you just simply have to 
do without no one wants you for a spouse or a mate or a lover 
not the case for the adoring couple profiled in young at 
heart wednesday on pbs which won this years academy award as 
best shortsubject documentary 
it is a baldfaced love story with a happy ending louis 
gothelf 85 and reva shwayder 84 two artists he paints 
portraits she paints flowers she grows in her garden found that 
being old doesnt mean an end to romance 
the film was made by sue marx gothelfs daughter and pamela 
conn 
gothelf and mrs shwayder met when they went on a painting tour 
of england and were seated next to each other on the plane they 
talked all the way once they arrived it sounded like something of 
a twist on a room with a view 
louis had a large room with lovely scenery out the window mrs 
shwayder was stuck with closetlike accommodations she showed up 
at his door with her luggage and the rest was history 
they decided to live together because as mrs shwayder says 
when youre young you should get married but when youre old 
what difference does it make 
the film is captivating in its simplicity gothelf and mrs 
shwayder are two wise funny people whose bodies might be old but 
whose minds are young and open 
mrs shwayder has an especially good line that will likely end 
up tacked on a lot of walls housework is the worst enemy of an 
artist 
the camera follows the couple to an art gallery where they both 
coo over a john singer sargent portrait but later argue the 
relative merits of various examples of modern art 
mrs shwayder points out that gothelf learned to paint in the 
20 and 30s but she didnt begin until the 1950s so she has a 
more modern view 
later in the film we learn that gothelfs wife had alzheimers 
disease a progressive disorder that affects the mind he cared for 
her through 10 years of sickness before she died 
mrs shwayder had lost her entire family her son died of cancer 
in his 40s then her husband passed away her other son later 
drowned while scuba diving 
gothelf shows a portrait he painted of mrs shwayder a few weeks 
after the tragedy he couldnt get her to smile 
in one of the films loveliest scenes he paints a new portrait 
this time with mrs shwayder where shes happiest at her easel 
sitting together in the evening cocktails in hand mrs 
shwayder sums up the sentiment that leads the two to a marriage 
documented in the film were both getting older she says i 
hope if anything happens to him ill be able to take care of him 
and if anything happens to me hell take care of me thats what i 
call love 
this is what viewers will call a very nice program

the television documentary much neglected in 
recent years gets a special 10week showcase on public television 
beginning tonight 
the summer series pov filmmaker jargon for point of 
view will present a selection from among the best documentaries 
produced in recent years by independent filmmakers 
each film has a point of view said executive producer marc 
n weiss that makes them more interesting people can look at 
them and agree or disagree 
the first twohour program presents two documentaries 
american tongues by louis alvarez and andrew kolker takes a 
humorous look at how american speech varies from region to region 
the film won a peabody award this spring the second film is 
acting our age by michal aviad a paean to the spirit of six 
elderly women facing life and advancing age 
the premiere also includes previews of the other documentaries 
were going to show 12 documentaries during the 10 weeks 
said weiss we looked at an extraordinary number of documentaries 
to make our selection when we asked for submissions we got 500 
entries 
thats just the tip of the iceberg there are more than 25000 
independent filmmakers in this country theyre not all turning out 
films all the time it takes several years they have difficulty 
raising money the very best documentaries get made because the 
filmmaker got a bug they latched onto something they feel very 
passionate about the subject theyre filming its something they 
want to explore 
public television commissions only about a dozen documentaries a 
year outside of the venues of the national geographic society 
jacques cousteau and other nature films documentaries once 
flourished on the three commercial networks but have been virtually 
replaced by newsmagazine shows 
the only real sanctuary for the documentary today is cable tvs 
discovery channel which offers 18 hours a day of documentaries 
concerning nature science technology history human adventure 
and world exploration 
documentaries are also occasionally shown in theaters the 
academy of motion picture arts amp sciences awards oscars each year 
for best feature and shortsubject documentaries 
this whole thing had its genesis at a film festival in utah 
about a year and a half ago said weiss david fanning of 
frontline mentioned during a discussion that britains fourth 
channel had bought a lot of documentaries by independent american 
filmmakers an executive of the british channel said they have such 
a backlog of films that theyre running them as a special package 
after the discussion i went to fanning with the idea that we 
should do something similar here he said the only way it would 
work is if we had a consortium of stations behind it 
fanning arranged a meeting of weiss henry becton president of 
wgbh in boston and barry chase vice president for public affairs 
of pbs it ended up with pov having the same board of 
directors and stations as american playhouse 
weiss pointed out that the primary audience for most 
documentaries has been at schools and libraries 
very few filmmakers make any money he said they do it 
because they care about a subject many fall by the wayside because 
they havent got the money on the other hand that kind of 
tenacity is what makes these films extraordinary all of the work 
has an emotional punch and plenty of intellectual meat 
filmmakers only get a few shots thats why they pick their 
subjects so carefully and theyre independent because they dont 
want to comform to a format 
weiss who has been an independent filmmaker much of his career 
said he hopes pov will lead to a series people need to 
know when to tune in he said it needs some consistency were 
issuing a viewers guide to help people find this current series 
he said he believes pov will attract viewers who quit 
regular television because they have found nothing to interest them 
people are pretty bored with the documentaries they see on the 
networks weiss said

italys communist party is desperately searching for 
a recipe for success following its third electoral drubbing in a 
year when just a little over a decade ago it came close to winning 
power 
their most recent setback came at the end of june when they lost 
ground in local elections in northern italy 
this is one of the most difficult moments in our history 
said achille occhetto the new leader of the party which is the 
largest communist party in the west and italys second largest 
political party 
the communists dramatic decline reportedly helped force out the 
70yearold alessandro natta as the party leader his resignation 
following a heart attack marked the first time in the partys 
history that a communist leader had stepped down in italy 
occhetto 52 inherited a party divided over its identity and 
unsure how to appeal to an electorate which is less bluecollar 
and more conservative than in the past 
weve said we dont want to follow the russians the italian 
socialists or the americans said a communist senator stojan 
spetic were still searching for an answer 
the prolonged search has hurt the communists morale and their 
popularity 
a year ago the italian communist party known as the pci its 
initials in italian suffered its worst defeat in parliamentary 
elections in 20 years slipping to 266 percent of the vote 
in may the communists dropped to 219 percent of the vote in 
local elections down from 258 percent in 1983 the balloting in 
late june in the north reduced their share of the vote in two 
regions from 198 percent to 157 percent 
meanwhile the socialist party of former premier bettino craxi 
has surged challenging the communists for leadership of the left 
many communists are pinning their hopes for revival on occhetto 
occhetto is perfectly conscious of the necessity and the 
urgency of creating a new pci said la repubblica the 
leftleaning rome newspaper 
one of the partys pillars the bluecollar working class has 
declined in number during italys economic and technological boom 
young people who traditionally voted heavily for the communists 
are now spreading their votes among different parties 
todays young people dont have idealistic values sen 
spetic said in an interview they are much more pragmatic they 
want work careers 
in a speech to party members occhetto noted the shrinkage in 
the partys traditional bases of support and said this puts in 
question even us and it is from this consideration that we ought 
to draw our new course 
it would not be the first time the italian communists changed 
course 
in the 1970s communist leader enrico berlinguer proclaimed the 
partys independence from the soviet union gone were the days when 
the party was known as the other church with its pope in 
moscow italian communists sought to achieve power through the 
democratic system 
the party which had been kept out of the government since 1947 
won 34 percent of the votes in the 1976 elections just four 
points below the dominant christian democrats 
but berlinguer was unable to persuade the christian democrats to 
give him cabinet seats and he had to settle for being consulted on 
major issues 
since then the socialists have enhanced their reputation as an 
alternative through craxis position as head of the governing 
coalition for three years up to mid1987 
since the death of the charismatic berlinguer in 1984 the 
communist party has wrestled over what kind of alternative it 
should be 
party officials talked of reexamining its revolutionary roots 
or seeking a social democratic line perhaps even changing its 
name 
a poll by lespresso magazine of 234 communist supporters who 
had voted recently for a different party indicated that the largest 
group 30 percent complained of the lack of a clear communist 
political line 
an invigorated brand of communism in the soviet union has not 
given new luster to italys party 
mikhail s gorbachevs criticism of stalin and rejection of some 
marxist principles have been seen as indictments of the history of 
the italian party which supported stalin in its early days 
it is the lethal combination of the craxi socialist effect 
and the gorbachev effect which has thrown the pci against the 
ropes enzo bettiza a former european parliament deputy from the 
liberal party wrote in the newspaper la stampa of turin

palestinian singers usually known for 
sentimental love songs have found a new kind of music political 
anthems calling for violent revolt against israel and glorifying 
young arab stonethrowers 
israeli authorities have blacklisted the songs on grounds they 
incite rebellion but they are distributed secretly in recorded 
form and are heard widely in arab east jerusalem and the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
the current no 1 hit insurrection urges palestinian 
children to rise up with your stones it booms from music 
stores and portable radios in east jerusalem when israeli police or 
soldiers are not around 
in bethlehem junior high school students came from classes 
recently chanting the refrain of the song intefadeh arabic for 
uprising with firebombs and stones i make my revolution 
arab youths also gather around stereos at home and sing along to 
ballads such as palestinian whose lyrics say i fight for my 
identity i fight for freedom i fight for spring 
in jerusalem police have raided several music stores 
confiscated tapes of songs about the uprising and charged store 
owners with incitement 
in the occupied territories troops confiscate tapes of banned 
song if they find any during house searches but they dont look 
specially for them said a military official 
we act whenever we can but this is not our first priority we 
are too busy with other things 
since the dec 8 start of the uprising dozens of militant 
antiisraeli songs have surfaced in the occupied lands they range 
from mournful ballads about the more than 200 palestinians killed 
in clashes to stirring anthems glorifying teenage stonethrowers 
intefadeh songs are recorded in makeshift studios in jerusalem 
taped from syrian television or smuggled from arab countries some 
tapes are sold under the counter in music stores while others are 
copied at home and passed along to friends 
among the two most popular song collections are i am the son 
of gaza by the syrian band palestine roots and intefadeh 
by riad awad a singer from the west bank city of tulkarem 
palestine roots also sings insurrection while awad has 
recorded palestinian 
awad and others are part of the socalled western wave a 
new musical style popular among the young it builds on arabic 
music traditions but also uses synthesizers and electrical 
guitars placing greater emphasis on rhythm 
palestinian music store owners say that before the uprising 
sentimental love songs were the top sellers 
today 95 percent of my customers ask for intefadeh or 
nationalistic songs said an east jerusalem music store owner 
his store was raided earlier in june after he played 
insurrection over loudspeakers police confiscated dozens of 
intefadeh tapes and charged the owner with incitement he was 
released on bail the equivalent to 1300 
since the raid he has restocked his supply keeping the tapes 
in two small boxes under the counter but he no longer plays 
intefadeh songs loudly and scrutinizes customers to make sure they 
are not undercover police officers 
distribution of intefadeh songs is often unorthodox a friend of 
the jerusalemborn palestinian singer mustafa kurd recently made 
the rounds of the music stores carrying a single copy of kurds 
latest tape the children of palestine 
shopowners who wanted it made copies in their stores 
at a music store in jerusalems walled old city 
insurrection was booming from loudspeakers one recent day 
mingling with the sales pitches of street vendors in the 
cobblestone street riot police patrolled nearby but took no 
notice 
i play this because i believe in it said the store owner 
when the cops come i just change the tape he added that he 
was free on bail after being charged with incitement following a 
raid 
military officials said all songs and written material calling 
for violent revolt against the 21year israeli occupation are 
illegal and subject to confiscation 
however the officials added military officers have not 
compiled a list of banned material because they cant keep up with 
the number of intefadeh songs flooding the occupied territories 
but the songs also have their critics in the palestinian 
community 
hussein barghouti a literature teacher at the west banks bir 
zeit university said most have little to do with art 
art is buried in these songs what remains is sloganism 
said barghouti who writes songs for a jerusalem band as a human 
being you are touched only on a superficial ideological level 
he added that the quality of the songs might improve if they 
were written by the young activists confronting israeli soldiers 
with their stones and slingshots 
but the kids are too busy to write songs he said

tossed around in beijing chinas capital that tiny family farms 
in some areas should gradually give way to more efficient 
largescale cooperative ventures 
the peasants wont support group farming he said they 
would resist 
nine years ago wus production brigade secretly defied the 
commune and government policy by dividing up its land and letting 
each farmer be responsible for growing his own share 
production took off and fengyang county in central chinas 
agricultural heartland of anhui province became a national pioneer 
in the family contract system that has revolutionized the chinese 
countryside again leading the nation by 1982 all 45 communes in 
fengyang each with about 10000 people had been broken up 
today as the first decade of chinas agricultural reform 
closes the system is praised for lifting tens of millions out of 
poverty but serious doubts have arisen about the future ability of 
family farmers to feed this country of 1 billion people 
for example farmers paid artificially low prices for 
statebought grain are planting more lucrative vegetables and 
fruit leading to three straight discouraging grain harvests after 
a record 407millionton crop in 1984 
land under cultivation has decreased and irrigation systems 
once kept up by communal labor have fallen into disrepair 
some experts maintain that the family farmer on his average 15 
acres of land has outlived his usefulness 
rural residents millions of whom now are finding jobs in small 
factories in the countryside are being encouraged to cede their 
land to professionals or groups who can carry out mechanized 
farming on larger tracts some areas are experimenting with 
allowing farmers to lease land to more ambitious tillers of the 
soil 
in fengyang however the conditions are not ripe for 
largescale group farming said a local official deng zeyuan 
few factory jobs are available in an area where 500000 of 580000 
people are farmers he said and group farming still brings up 
memories of the leftist mistakes and extreme poverty of the 
past 
under the newly devised cooperative system farmers who 
voluntarily form a cooperative may do so and the state is now 
encouraging this in some areas 
rural residents who find jobs in factories can turn over their 
land to other farmers but since the land all belongs to the state 
normally they would not be paid for use of it 
a few areas however are experimenting in allowing farmers to 
lease land and receive benefits from future crops although the 
state owns the land it has assured farmers that it will not evict 
them against their will to form larger farm groups 
farmer wu doesnt like the concept and wants to continue as he 
is because he and others in fengyand have come so far along 
he said he earned 30 fen 8 cents a day working on the commune 
and even though we worked a whole year we only had food for half 
a year 
begging common in anhui for centuries continued after the 
communist takeover in 1949 and during the hard times people 
starved he said 
in 1979 in the first year of the family contract system in his 
village wu claimed he and his eight children produced more than 
the entire 98member work brigade turned out in the past last year 
his extended family earned 17000 yuan 4600 from grain and 
other crops before expenses 
wu said 17 of the 19 households in the village now have brick 
homes and their former mud homes are used as cowsheds about half 
have television sets and many have tape recorders and electric 
fans 
down a rocky dirt road gao mingzhen 32 recalled how her 
relatives received 110 yuan 30 a month raising geese on the 
commune last year she said her goose and chicken farm took in 
150000 yuan 40500 of which she reinvested 87000 yuan 
23500 in four incubators 
she also bought two trucks is installing a refrigerator house 
and a hatchery and last year financed her own trip to japan 
he xizhang a county magistrate spoke proudly of the 
achievements made under the family contract system 
our history in fengyang is one of going from begging to coping 
to contributing to the country he said 
he added that the area once dependent on the state for grain 
and other handouts now exports food to other parts of the country 
grain production has grown steadily from 163000 tons in 1978 to 
540000 tons in 1987 
the annual per capital income in that period climbed from 81 
yuan 22 to 480 yuan 130 on a par with farmers nationwide 
farmers must sell a contracted amount of their grain crop usually 
about 40 percent to the state at fixed prices but can sell the 
rest on the free market at prices about 20 percent higher 
electricity available to almost no farmers in 1978 now reaches 
almost every home half the farmers have brick houses 
not all in fengyang are properly clothed magistrate he said 
and some live in threestory homes while others still are in mud 
huts but people feel deeply that the reforms have brought them 
prosperity 
nonetheless primitive methods are still used on family farms 
women in conical straw hats plant rice stalk by stalk men plow 
fields behind plodding water buffalo 
irrigation crucial in this area plagued by alternating drought 
and flood is done either by operating small wooden pumps or 
tossing water from one paddy to another by bucket 
some farmers lacking threshing facilitities lay their wheat 
across the highways to let passing trucks help separate the grain 
from the chaff 
like elsewhere in china family farmers in fengyang worry about 
rising prices and must struggle to obtain fertilizer pesticides 
and diesel fuel which are in short supply and often fall into the 
hands of speculators or those with political influence 
agricultural official liu said the province can supply only 70 
percent of fertilizer needs some of that is obtainable only on 
free markets where prices can far exceed stateset levels 
county official deng said someday fengyang will follow the 
example of prospering coastal areas where farms are being turned 
over to talented farmers while surplus farm population is shifted 
to jobs in construction and light industry 
fengyang also needs to have more mechanized farming deng said 
while stressing that the family farm should be retained 
were still exploring he said

egypts decision to cut the price on its crude 
oil exports for the first half of july has raised prospects of a 
possible price war depressing oil futures prices to their lowest 
levels of the year 
the contract for august delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude oil dropped 27 cents thursday to 1516 per 
barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
it was the lowest level for wti since dec 21 1987 when the 
nearterm contract also finished at 1516 
among refined products traded on the exchange the july contract 
for home heating oil slipped 064 cent to 4088 cents a gallon 
the july contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 5194 cents 
down 068 cent from the previous strong session when prices soared 
on speculation that demand would grow as the july 4th holiday 
neared traders attributed thursdays decline largely to 
profittaking 
john oconnell a senior analyst for refco inc said egypts 
announcement made traders even more bearish about the outlook for 
oil prices than they had been in recent weeks 
traders have been worried about overproduction by oil nations 
who have created a glut that has been depressing prices 
egypts senior oil ministry official hammad ayoub said his 
country would reduce its oil export prices by up to 185 a barrel 
for the first half of july 
ayoub declined to comment further but in a later interview with 
the middle east news agency he blamed the deterioration in world 
oil prices on some opec countries that are exceeding the production 
quotas agreed to by all but one of the cartels 13 members 
oconnell said the action by egypt which is not a member of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries could prompt some 
opec countries to increase their production to remain competitive 
the oil futures market is nervous about what kuwait and 
saudi arabia might do if other opec members cheated further on 
their quotas oconnell said 
ayoub did not mention any opec countries by name but said that 
all countries should remain committed to their quotas and stay 
away from unclear selling tactics

italians are riding the range in arizona west germans are 
inspecting plantations in south carolina and japanese are teeing 
up wherever they find a nice golf course 
heading into the independence day weekend tourism officials 
were predicting the lure of the cheaper dollar would help bring a 
record 302 million foreign visitors to the united states this year 
the expected increase is modest up less than 2 percent from 
297 million last year and not all of the visitors are tourists 
many come for business as students or to visit friends and 
relatives 
but the financial power of foreign visitors they are expected 
to spend a record 221 billion here this year is reshaping the 
hospitality business 
the us is on sale william d toohey president of the 
travel industry association of america told foreign tour operators 
last month in a gathering held in dallas in may 
americans are learning to provide the amenities they get when 
they travel abroad multilingual signs are popping up some 
bigcity hotels now have sameday delivery of japanese newspapers 
tourism professionals also say they have to cater to the 
particular tastes of specific nationalities 
it turns out many west germans have a fascination with the 
precivil war south while europeans of all kinds feel they havent 
seen america without a pony ride way out west 
i have 82 italians here right now bob cote the owner and 
camp cook of the tanque verde ranch outside tucson ariz said 
thursday cowboys and indians are typically american so thats a 
strong image for them 
although for some foreigners the united states has not become a 
major travel bargain it is not much cheaper for canadians than it 
used to be and has become more expensive for mexicans shifting 
exchange rates have doubled the power of currencies such as the 
japanese yen and west german mark since early 1985 
the 118 million canadians who are expected to arrive this year 
vastly outnumber visitors from other countries while mexicans are 
second at 64 million according to projections of the us travel 
amp tourism administration 
but the border nations are getting less notice lately than the 
freespending japanese who are in third place and rising rapidly 
about 28 million japanese are expected this year up 30 percent 
from 1987 the fastest growth rate of any major country the growth 
should continue under japans ten million program which seeks to 
double the annual number of japanese tourists going abroad to 10 
million by 1991 
hawaii has been a popular japanese tourist spot drawing about 
12 million japanese visitors tourism officials have tried to help 
by putting up many signs in japanese perhaps too many 
some of them have come to me and said were going to visit 
in a foreign land we ought to be able to fend for ourselves 
said gene cotter senior vice president for marketing at the hawaii 
visitors bureau youre damned if you do and damned if you 
dont 
a step at a time cautious japanese tourists have ventured from 
hawaii to the west coast to new york city where shopping at 
tiffanys and bus tours through harlem are popular 
around 1986 the japanese began to discover washington all 
nippon airways which began direct flights between tokyo and 
washington that year says an expansion to daily service has been 
held back only by a lack of pilots and planes 
the united states is a paradise of fairways and greens to the 
japanese some of whom do most of their golfing back home on 
multitiered driving ranges because it is so hard to get a tee time 
on crowded courses 
japanese visitors tend to stick to welltraveled routes while 
europeans are more willing to rent a car and discover america but 
even the europeans dont spend a lot of vacation time in heartland 
states such as iowa 
farmers from more than 25 countries are expected to compete in 
the plowing match during the world ag expo at the amana colonies in 
september but sightseers from abroad are fairly scarce in iowa 
said skip strittmatter marketing manager for the state bureau of 
visitors and tourism 
south carolina capitalized on the popularity of the north and 
south television series about the civil war which was shown 
twice in west germany by offering a free trip to the palmetto 
state in a joint promotion with a german womens magazine das neue 
blatt 
the states locales and tourist attractions that are most 
successful in attracting foreign visitors are the ones who began 
their efforts before the dollars big decline said hawaiis 
cotter hawaii for example has representatives spread from 
vancouver british columbia to thailand and brunei 
disney world in florida is famed for its marketing to latin 
america 
in washington dc hogates restaurant expects 60 percent of 
its customers will come from abroad this year the culmination of 
marketing efforts that harriet epstein has pushed for seven years 
the french want window seats the japanese like ice cream and 
the germans would rather have a budweiser than a german beer 
hogates discovered the homework and the sales calls to tour 
operators paid off 
when the tidal wave started to turn in our direction we were 
on the receiving end said ms epstein the sales director our 
name was on the tip of their tongues

newsletter editor michael b woods remembers 
better times for analyzing overthecounter stocks 
last year this time you could see it when we picked a 
stock he said it moved right away now we pick a stock it 
may not budge 
meet another group of the walking wounded from last octobers 
stock market crash entrepreneurs who produce the nations 
investment newsletters 
woods and other small purveyors of stockmarket advice are 
finding their readership has slipped almost as badly as the dow 
jones average over the past year 
this will be the first year my business will not have grown 
said robert j nurock publisher of the astute investor based in 
nearby paoli even given the fact that i missed calling the 
crash the response to my advertising has been especially poor 
nurock said subscriptions to his astute investor have dropped by 
28 percent since peaking in january 1987 
since the crash individual investors wary of the impact of 
program trading on the market and the prospect of another collapse 
largely have abandoned stocks the market for advice good or 
otherwise is off sharply 
even before october dark clouds were gathering for the 
newsletters the emergence of mutual funds as major investment 
vehicles reduced the need to choose individual stocks at the same 
time the fiveyear bull market created a proliferation of 
investment advice in newspapers and magazines and on television 
suddenly we had all this competition said woods 36 a 
former newspaper reporter we were like the race tracks when 
casino gambling came along 
martin zweig a widely known market pundit and editor of two new 
york newsletters agreed 
it used to be when you were right business was good he 
told the philadelphia inquirer now you never know basically 
the business hasnt been healthy for a couple of years now 
newsletter issuers range from standard amp poors corp of new 
york to individuals armed with little more than a home computer and 
their hunches 
some publications have thrived in the postcrash environment 
zweig said the subscription base of his zweig forecast has 
increased by 4000 to 14000 since late november overall revenue 
is running 80 percent ahead of last year he said 
a oneyear subscription to zweigs newsletter published every 
three weeks costs 245 
zweig a former finance professor and a graduate of the 
university of pennsylvanias wharton school attributes his 
circulation surge to performance according to a rating of 
investment newsletters by hulbert financial digest zweig forecast 
was the secondbest performer in the fiveyear period that ended 
march 31 posting an 189 percent annual return on a portfolio of 
selected stocks 
we basically called the crash zweig said on oct 19 we 
were only 8 percent invested in stocks 
similarly james stack publisher of investech market analyst a 
newsletter published out of whitefish mont said he began 
recommending that his clients get out of the market in april 1987 
by early october he was out of the market 
our subscription rate is up 28 percent over the past eight 
months said stack a former ibm engineer who began his 
newsletter six years ago 
stack noted he did not escape the year unscathed clients who 
heeded his advice to abandon the market in april found themselves 
sitting on the sidelines during last summers runup 
we were getting out while the bull market was still going 
strong he said we had a 25 percent cancellation rate in 
august which is phenomenally high for us it was very depressing 
woods a philadelphian who edits the new yorkbased publication 
otc review special situations said circulation peaked at 5000 
subscriptions in the spring of 1987 since then subscriptions to 
the monthly newsletter priced at 150 annually have dropped by 
half despite a relatively robust recovery by overthecounter 
stocks 
the owner of the newsletter robert j flaherty asked woods to 
edit it at home and contracted circulation services to an outside 
firm woods said his april 1 move into a secondfloor bedroom was 
not a response to the crash but he acknowledged that industry 
costcutting is in vogue 
a lot of newsletters are running close to the bone now he 
said so far i havent suffered any real personal damage but 
theres no doubt we are in for some lean times

a former officer of continental illinois national 
bank amp trust co and a former oklahoma banker will seek probation 
after pleading guilty to charges related to continentals historic 
nearcollapse a lawyer says 
but prosecutors plan to seek prison terms for john r lytle who 
admitted misapplying bank funds and william g patterson who 
admitted helping lytle with the scheme 
both entered into a plea agreement thursday before us district 
judge milton i shadur nearly two months after a trial of the pair 
ended in a mistrial 
it definitely closes the chapter on the continental bankpenn 
square relationship said assistant us attorney joseph duffy 
after shadur accepted the defendants guilty pleas and set 
sentencing for aug 30 
each man could get 5 years in prison and a 5000 fine but 
lytles attorney said the defendants would seek probation 
we are looking forward to getting all this behind mr lytle 
after a long long road said attorney james streicker 
penn square failed in 1982 and continental came close to 
collapse two years later after the largest run on deposits in 
banking history following disclosure that it held millions in poor 
energyrelated loans the government kept continentals doors open 
with a record 45 billion bailout 
lytle 53 a former vice president who once headed continentals 
oil and gas lending operation in oklahoma said i feel weve 
come to an agreement thats fair to everyone 
pattersons attorney warren bickford had no comment his 
client who once had assets valued at 2 million left the 
courtroom in tears 
lytle and patterson were indicted on charges of wire fraud and 
misapplication of bank funds and went to trial in march but after 
seven weeks the proceeding ended may 3 when the jury became 
deadlocked and shadur declared a mistrial 
a new trial on eight counts each of wire fraud and three counts 
each of misapplication of bank funds was scheduled to begin in 
september 
lytle was accused of buying millions of dollars in poorquality 
loans from penn square bank in return for kickbacks from patterson 
patterson 38 former head of energy lending at penn square in 
oklahoma city was accused of arranging the kickbacks in the form 
of 585000 worth of unsecured personal loans to lytle between 1980 
and 1982 
the jury in the first trial cleared a third defendant oklahoma 
drilling contractor jere sturgis of wire fraud charges for his 
alleged role in a scheme to defraud continental 
patterson was accused of manipulating lytle and sturgis in 
schemes to save his own failing bank 
the government said lytle was caught in spiraling personal debt 
to finance a luxurious lifestyle and accepted kickbacks from 
patterson in exchange for taking risky energy loans off penn 
squares hands at continentals expense 
the indictment cited lytles involvement in 44 million in loans 
made by continental to 12 penn square customers it did not say how 
much was recovered by the chicago bank 
in thursdays guilty plea lytle and patterson admitted 
arranging for continental to buy a 225 million loan made by penn 
square to one of its customers to cover a bad business deal of his 
partner who was already millions of dollars in debt to penn 
square duffy said

here is summary of recent developments in the drought gripping 
most of the midwest and southeast 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a federal analyst told the national association of wheat growers 
that drought will cut the nations wheat reserves by as much as 
half by next june 1 
bruce weber of the us agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service told the growers meeting at steamboat springs 
colo on wednesday that the drought could drop the current 
inventory of 12 billion bushels down to 600 million or 700 million 
bushels by next june that would be the lowest wheat inventory 
since three years of sales to the soviet union in the early 1970s 
diminished the stockpile to 350 million bushels he said

us supercomputer manufacturers said friday they 
were disappointed with the japanese governments failure to 
purchase usmade supercomputers despite japans commitment last 
year to encourage such procurements 
a bilateral agreement to promote though not guarantee japanese 
publicsector purchases of us supercomputers went into effect 
last august after the united states complained that the japanese 
government was favoring japanese supercomputers over their american 
counterparts 
i think disappointed is the word to describe us computer 
makers feeling toward japanese government procurement of american 
supercomputers john mcphee director of the us commerce 
departments office of computers and business equipment told 
reporters at the foreign correspondents club of japan 
supercomputers are advancedtechnology computers that perform 
complex calculations at rapid speed and are used in such fields as 
science engineering and the military 
mcphee said the first three government procurements in japan 
since the agreement went into effect by the staterun tohoku and 
hokkaido universities and the high energy physics laboratory went 
to nec and hitachi which along with fujitsu are japans leading 
computer makers 
its curious to us as we look at the data to see that us 
firms have 8085 percent of the supercomputer market in the rest 
of the world but a relatively small share of the private sector in 
japan and until recently had no installations in the japanese 
government mcphee said 
mcphee headed a delegation of six us supercomputer 
manufacturers which conducted a trade seminar and exhibition in 
tokyo this week the delegation consisted of cray research inc 
eta systems inc evans amp sutherland computer corp myrias 
computer corp prime computer inc and scientific computer 
systems corp 
the solutions to performance problems that these firms bring 
to the market are an attractive package for japanese users 
mcphee said 
the delegation came to japan to familiarize potential japanese 
clients with their technology and to study possible joint marketing 
of their products with japanese partners said lee adamson prime 
computers senior manager for engineering and scientific sales 
support 
were having tremendous interest with prospects for 
accounts adamson said my experience on this mission with 
prospects weve talked to and the excitement and interest of our 
subsidiary in japan for the minisupercomputer market has been very 
good and we expect some major sales in the japanese market

strong economic growth cut the broadest measure of 
japans trade surplus by 19 percent in may from a year earlier and 
pushed down the jobless rate to a threeyear low of 25 percent 
the government said friday 
the surplus in the current account the broadest measure of a 
nations commerce including trade in goods and services as well as 
capital transfers fell to 579 billion from 712 billion in 
april and 711 billion in may 1987 the ministry said 
may was the second month in a row that the surplus declined from 
both previousmonth and yearearlier levels 
during the first three months of the year japans economy grew 
at an annual rate of 113 percent its highest level in 11 years 
the expansion of the economy fueled heavy demand for imports 
including steel lumber and nonferrous metals the finance 
ministry said exports were led by such products as computers and 
semiconductors 
unemployment in may fell 01 percentage point from the previous 
month to a seasonally adjusted 25 percent the management and 
coordination agency said the may rate represented a sharp 
turnaround from the record high of 32 percent registered in the 
same month a year earlier 
the number of job holders hit a record 61 million up 22 
percent from 598 million a year earlier 
the official said the number of jobs increased in virtually all 
industrial sectors with companies becoming increasingly eager to 
hire new workers to meet growing demand 
the chief exception was agriculture which registered a drop of 
50000 jobs during the month the agency said 
a 25 percent unemployment rate was last registered in april 
1985 
japans unemployment rate would be higher if calculated by us 
and european methods

thousands of companies may still be unaware of 
the need to meet todays deadline for reporting release of any one 
of 328 different toxic chemicals into the environment last year 
says an industry representative 
theres a tremendous amount of misunderstanding out there 
said theresa pugh dealing with the issue for the national 
association of manufacturers 
the confusion arises because many businesses have assumed the 
law applies only to chemical companies and no one has been able to 
mount a loud enough publicity campaign she said 
throughout nam in the past month weve had about 1000 calls 
inquiring whether a business is covered by the law and i can count 
on the fingers of one hand those that werent she said thursday 
a new york public relations firm chimed in today with evidence 
backing up her point interviews with representatives of 81 
companies covered by the new law found only 24 had a program to 
answer questions at installations using the chemicals 
many companies in the food transportation and instruments 
industries appear to be largely unprepared said a statement from 
ketchum public affairs part of ketchum communications inc 
the 1986 law requiring the reports was one response of congress 
to the disastrous leak in bhopal india of methyl isocyanate in 
1984 that killed almost 3000 people 
the law potentially applies to almost all manufacturers the 
standard industrial classification codes 20 through 39 of the 
commerce department the environmental protection agency has 
certain discretion to expand it 
the agency estimates that 30000 installations probably should 
file fivepage forms on an average of 10 different chemicals a 
total of 15 million pages 
not every company must report only those with 10 or more 
employees that manufacture import or process 75000 pounds per 
year of any of the chemicals or use 10000 pounds per year these 
threshold quantities decline in future years 
companies that process a chemical make it an ingredient of a 
product for an example an example of use on the other hand is 
cleaning with a chemical 
affected companies must report all deliberate and accidental 
releases as well as leaks if measurements or calculations are 
unavailable engineering judgment may be used 
reports must be made to epa and to state authorities 
environmentalists are counting on the accessibility of the data 
in computer form to generate political support for a broader and 
tighter program of regulation 
ill tell you what the public reaction is going to be its 
not going to like the fact that the environment is used as a 
dumping ground for all these chemicals said debbie sheiman of 
the natural resources defense council 
chris cathcart of the chemical manufacturers association whose 
trade group has sent emissaries from its own ranks and from members 
into hundreds of newspaper offices to explain whats coming said 
it would not be a good thing if people just drew conclusions 
from the numbers 
the association has encouraged member companies to release forms 
publicly as they file them and cathcart said the group is telling 
people you should talk to people you have confidence in if 
anything about the reports arouses concern 
some of the numbers are going to be huge about 22 billion 
pounds of toluene a common petrochemical are released to the air 
nationwide each year 
no one has a good idea of the total for all the covered 
chemicals or the damage being done 
the 328 chemicals were specified by congress from lists used by 
new jersey and maryland programs epa says slightly more than half 
can cause cancer at least in animals and 44 percent are acutely 
toxic 
several years ago epa estimated that airborne chemicals were 
causing 2000 annual deaths from cancer

more than 10000 submarine builders at the 
electric boat shipyard went on strike today after refusing to 
accept the companys offer of lumpsum bonuses instead of wage 
increases over the next three years 
the metal trades council representing more than half of the 
shipyards 18000 workers negotiated with the company until a half 
hour before the midnight deadline before announcing an impasse 
no new talks were planned union and company officials said 
early today 
about 300 chanting pickets marched outside the gates of the 
giant yard under sunny skies this morning city police reported two 
arrests one of a man setting off fireworks and another of a man 
who allegedly drove his car through police barricades in front of 
the plant nearly hitting some pickets 
company officials didnt know how many people stayed off the job 
today union officials said 5000 bluecollar workers normally 
report for the first shift 
the submarine workers voted 49213140 thursday to reject the 
latest contract offer from electric boat a division of general 
dynamics corp 
electric boat is one of only two shipyards making nuclear 
submarines for the navy and the only manufacturer of giant subs 
capable of carrying the trident ballistic missile 
electric boat general manager fritz tovar said a strike will not 
stop submarine construction the company made arrangements to 
reassign 3000 of its 8000 salaried employees to new jobs within 
the yard he said 
electric boat offered employees bonuses worth 5 percent of a 
workers wages during the first contract year and 4 percent during 
the second and third years of the pact the union demanded wage 
increases of 5 percent 4 percent and 4 percent 
the shipyard said it could not afford to raise base pay if it 
was to remain competitive in its pursuit of navy contracts 
we have maintained steadfastly that not increasing the base 
pay is what is going to close the competitive disadvantage we 
have with newport news shipbuilding said electric boat spokesman 
neil ruenzel 
pickets went up one minute past midnight outside the shipyards 
main gate located along the thames river that flows into eastern 
long island sound 
no one likes to see a strike said metal trades council 
president joseph messier the company doesnt like to see it the 
union doesnt like to see it the community doesnt like to see it 
but it just comes down to youve just got to do what youve got to 
do 
the last strike at the shipyard was in 1975 when the union 
walked out for five months and the regions economy sagged 
electric boats final offer presented monday called for 
bonuses totaling 4250 over three years for a firstclass mechanic 
making 1202 an hour said thomas sotir vice president of human 
resources 
earlier thursday the navy awarded this years third and final 
ssn688 attack submarine contract to electric boat the 3474 
million contract will go to electric boats main shipyard here and 
its other plant in north kingstown ri which is unaffected by 
the strike 
newport news which pays its workers 60 cents an hour less than 
electric boat recently won two contracts for nuclear attack 
submarines after it underbid electric boat

futures prices of grain and soybeans opened 
sharply higher today on the chicago board of trade amid forecasts 
for a long dry independence day weekend in the midwest analysts 
said 
corn prices got an additional boost from indications that the 
soviet union was in the market for us and argentinian corn talk 
of soviet purchases helped drive corn futures up their daily 
trading limit of 10 cents a bushel at the opening bell said dale 
gustafson an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
early advances in the other trading pits were limited by 
profittaking ahead of the long holiday weekend he said 
this is a nervous trading market and it will stay that way 
today unless someone changes their weather forecast at midday 
gustafson said 
thursdays monthly grain stocks report from the agriculture 
department which showed largerthanexpected stocks of corn wheat 
and soybeans also offset some of the bullish enthusiusm he said 
in early trading wheat was 9 cents to 14 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 398 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 15 cents higher with july on which the daily price limit has 
been removed at 342 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 13 cents 
higher with july at 355 a bushel soybeans were 10 cents to 22 
cents higher with july at 1002 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were sharply lower with pork futures 
down their daily limits in early trading on the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
the sharp declines in pork futures were linked to wednesdays 
usda hogs and pigs report which showed an unexpectedly large us 
hog herd analysts said 
live cattle were unchanged to 90 cent lower with august at 
6370 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 87 cent lower 
with august at 7310 cents a pound hogs were 150 cents lower 
across the board with july at 4482 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 2 cents lower across the board with july at 3525 
cents a pound

big jumps in factory and office building boosted construction 
spending 11 percent in may offsetting declines elsewhere the 
government said today in a report that suggested us manufacturers 
are actively investing for the future 
the commerce department said that building activity rose to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4071 billion in may following 
a 02 percent dip in april in march construction shot up 28 
percent 
the departments report put factory construction at 228 percent 
above the same level last year a reflection of strong growth in 
americas manufacturing industries because of increased demand 
primarily higher exports 
but the report also showed a 1 percent decline in residential 
construction in may another indication that higher interest rates 
have hurt the housing industry by making mortgage loans 
unaffordable to many potential homebuyers 
in other economic news early today stocks retreated in 
preweekend profit taking after a broad gain thursday but the bond 
market rose on the strength of the dollar 
the us currencys resilience came despite moves thursday by 
west germany the netherlands switzerland austria and belgium to 
raise their interest rates which would tend to weaken the dollar 
the markets also ignored a 99 billion rise in the us foreign 
debt for 1987 reported tursday by the commerce department the 
increase to 3682 billion underscored fears by many critics that 
the country is living beyond its means and is losing its worldwide 
political and economic might 
as long as the united states has to rely on foreign financing 
of such magnitudes events could at literally any moment trigger a 
sharp turndown in our economy said c fred bergsten director of 
the institute for international economics in washington 
but the reagan administration contends that the leap in the 
nations debt during its tenure largely reflects the investment 
attractions in this country with foreigners pouring in money to 
buy real estate factories and securities 
the other big market news thursday was in chicagos commodity 
pits where soybean and grain speculators drove prices up sharply 
ending a twoday decline caused by rainfall on the waterstarved 
farm belt 
the buying rush came after the national weather service issued 
its latest 30day outlook late wednesday calling for almost no 
rainfall in the critical areas 
elsewhere thursday the commerce department said orders to us 
factories for manufactured goods fell 06 percent in may 
reflecting a sharp drop in demand for aircraft that was offset by 
strength in other areas 
it was the largest onemonth decline since a 14 percent drop in 
august but economists werent concerned because orders had been up 
sharply in march and april they said the may decline actually 
could be good for the economy by giving overworked factories an 
opportunity to catch up with unfilled orders

canadas onedollar coin nicknamed the loonie 
because one side depicts a swimming loon will entirely replace the 
paper dollar bill within two years the government has announced 
the loonie was introduced last year under a plan to save 
taxpayers 175 million canadian dollars or about 145 million over 
20 years because coins have a longer circulation life than paper 
bills 
but public acceptance of the goldcolored 11sided coin has 
been limited and most banks and stores still provide customers with 
dollar bills 
many canadians have hoarded loonies believing the coin will 
share the demise of the susan b anthony dollar coin introduced in 
the united states in 1979 and overwhelmingly rejected 
but the federal government acting upon recommendations of the 
royal canadian mint and house of commons says production of dollar 
bills will cease on june 30 1989 and the bills will cease to be 
legal tender about one year later the normal life span of a paper 
dollar

seven babies are born every second in asia and the 
continent may be only days away from reaching 3 billion 
inhabitants an occasion causing some concern in the worlds most 
crowded corner experts said friday 
china faced with a motherlode of maternity marked the occasion 
with a ceremony and speeches that urged its citizens to keep 
practicing birth control in tokyo a group of experts gathered to 
debate the significance of the approaching milestone its effects 
on the family and the growing problem of feeding all those people 
takashi sato japans minister of agriculture said excessive 
population growth will result in shortages of food resources and 
energy and environmental destruction beyond national boundaries 
without globallevel responses to the issues of population 
food environment and development it would be difficult for the 
world to welcome a peaceful 21st century said sato chairman of 
the asian forum of parliamentarians on population and development 
which sponsored the conference 
in july 1987 the worlds population passed 5 billion double 
the population in 1950 
according to united nations estimates asias population will 
reach 3 billion at 47 minutes after midnight greenwich mean time on 
aug 10 847 pm edt aug 9 asian experts however predict the 
milestone will be reached within days 
professor gayl d ness of the university of michigan estimated 
that asias population would grow to 35 billion by the end of the 
century and to 45 billion by 2025 while the world population 
reaches 82 billion 
rice production will have to increase 50 percent by 2025 to feed 
the continent ness said but great gains already have been 
registered by farmers in china japan and southeast asia 
the 21st century targets are well within the realm of 
possibility if the agricultural transformation continues this of 
course requires sensitive government policies said the 
sociologist and researcher on asian population 
asia has made substantial progress in lowering fertility 
rates and asian countries were the first to adopt policies to 
limit population growth he said 
but ness noted disparities in different regions of asia east 
asian countries such as china and japan which has 122 million 
people have rapidly declining fertility rates 
but in south asia india is still experiencing 208 percent 
annual growth in its population of 818 million pakistan has 345 
percent growth with 115 million people and bangladesh has 267 
percent growth rate from a current base of 110 million according 
to un figures 
the challenge lies ahead in completing the demographic 
transition and bringing birth rates down to match the fall in the 
death rates ness said 
he and other panelists were critical of the united states for 
withdrawing money from the un fund for population activities 
because of the funds support for abortion 
the population growth also has caused some social changes 
professor toshio kuroda director emeritus of tokyos institute 
of population at nihon university noted that china expects the 
family to care for the aged but the family is undergoing 
tremendous change in china with the onechild family 
china the worlds most populous country with 108 billion 
people has since the early 1980s limited most families to one 
child but the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years 
in beijing chinese officials marked the day of 3 billion in 
asia with a ceremony in the great hall of the people 
they handed out cassette players to 18 family planning workers 
doctors and others for outstanding performance in implementing 
our population policy 
speakers warned that rapid population growth poses a threat to 
economic development 
we cannot think that we can have more children because of 
economic development nor can we relax our efforts because of 
progress in family planning said hu keshi forum vice chairman

polluters should be punished for allowing rampant 
industrial waste to push the soviet union to the brink of an 
ecological disaster the head of the countrys new environmental 
protection committee said friday 
fyodor morgun chief of the committee that was created in 
january told a communist party conference that the grave 
ecological situation has emerged because of the illconsidered 
drive to build gigantic plants 
morgun said the natural fertility of soils is declining topsoil 
is decreasing and forests are in an unsatisfactory condition 
the air in all industrial centers is polluted above the 
hygienic standards and the quality of water in the rivers 
worsens nearly everywhere he said 
he said the caspian and baltic seas are polluted and called the 
aral sea a disaster zone 
behind the facts of outrages upon nature and damage done to 
human health are certain people in science design institutions and 
builders members of state commissions with whose blessing 
facilities were put into operation which destroy nature morgun 
said 
those who are responsible for the problems should be mentioned 
by name and be punished according to their deserts he added 
morgun addressed the 5000 delegates at the conference a day 
after a steelworker from the urals city of nizhny tagil criticized 
government leaders for their failure to tackle problems he said had 
reached the proportions of a chernobyllike catastrophe 
steelworker veniamin yarin lent force to his appeal by depicting 
the situation in his city where 10000 people demonstrated earlier 
this year against failure to close two 45yearold cokefired 
furnaces at the citys steel mill 
one soviet media report said 54 children were stillborn in the 
city last year nizhny tagil has a population of 403000 
yarin said the government should devise an emergency program for 
up to 60 soviet cities he said were polluted beyond all norms 
the environment has become an issue of great concern to many 
soviets as mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness has revealed the extent of ecological damage in candid 
media articles 
the ural mountain region is in particularly bad shape the area 
was heavily industrialized during world war ii as the soviets moved 
their factories eastward away from the invading nazis 
the communist party daily newspaper pravda said in december that 
another urals industrial city ufa was unfit for human habitation 
environmental damage is also a sensitive issue in the baltic 
republics whose delegations each mentioned the need to tackle what 
the estonians term an ecological catastrophe in written

after a quarter century on the job the zip 
code like most of us has gained a little weight but it still 
helps smooth the flow of nearly half the worlds mail 
friday marked the 25th anniversary of that string of numbers 
bringing up the rear of every american address a system ordered 
into use by by thenpostmaster general j edward day who says he 
simply got tired of waiting for bureaucrats to finish studying the 
idea 
days original fivedigit system held sway for 20 years and is 
still the most commonly seen 
an expanded version was introduced in 1983 though adding four 
more numbers to bring the total to nine a voluntary addition 
officially called zip plus 4 but referred to in postal circles 
as son of zip 
the basic system says senior assistant postmaster general john 
g mulligan has been a roaring success 
the united states with only about 6 percent of the worlds 
population has 50 percent of the worlds mail volume mulligan 
points out 
by way of comparison the new york metropolitan area handles 
about the same volume of mail as all of great britain and the 
chicago areas mail is about equal to japans said day who now is 
retired from government service and is living in a maryland suburb 
of washington 
in the 25 years since the introduction of zip which stands for 
zone improvement program us mail volume has more than doubled 
but the postal service employs only about 15 percent more people 
mulligan said and the zip system is a big factor in that labor 
saving 
no direct calculation of the exact savings has been made 
mulligan said in an interview its hard to separate the effect 
of the zip code from other things but believe me i think its up 
there in the several billions of dollars 
in 1963 the united states post office carried 679 billion 
pieces of mail sorted by human beings at a maximum rate of 800 
items an hour now reconstituted as the us postal service the 
agency handled 1539 billion pieces last year with zip codes the 
mail can be sorted by machines at a rate of 27000 to 35000 pieces 
an hour 
public acceptance has been amazing said mulligan with zip 
codes on about 97 percent of the items mailed even better he 
added 95 percent of mail comes in with correct zip codes 
a variety of coding systems had been under study when day lost 
patience what he did was simply to announce during a speech in 
december 1962 that a new coding system would take effect the 
following july 1 
it worked years of study ended and within six months the agency 
decided on a fivedigit system divided the nation into regions and 
assigned a code to each of the more than 30000 post offices in the 
country 
the system took effect july 1 1963 accompanied by promotional 
hoopla organized by the post office and grumbling by people afraid 
they would lose their identities to some anonymous numbers 
the zip code divided the nation into 10 slices each starting 
with a different number from 0 in new england to 9 on the 
pacific coast 
the next two numbers designate a major city in the area for 
example 606 is chicago finally the last two numbers localize the 
address to a neighborhood post office and the four newly added 
digits in the code narrow the delivery down to one side of a city 
block or even one floor of a large office building in a major city

eastern airlines and its parent texas air corp 
on friday canceled a contract calling for eastern to sell its 
popular northeast shuttle service to another texas air subsidiary 
eastern gave no explanation for the mutual cancellation in a 
terse news release and said no other details would be forthcoming 
this is one of those releases where we cant make any comment 
beyond the text the release will have to speak for itself said 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak 
spokesmen for easterns machinists union which battled the 
proposed sale in court and for houstonbased texas air did not 
immediately return telephone calls 
the sale of the profitable washingtonnew yorkboston shuttle 
routes to the newly created texas air subsidiary would have brought 
the financially ailing eastern 225 million company officials have 
said 
in march us district judge john h pratt in washington 
ruling on a suit filed by the machinists said eastern by taking 
steps to sell the shuttle had flouted a july 1987 order that 
barred it from transferring 6000 ground crew members to the other 
texas air subsidiary 
but on june 7 the us court of appeals in washington lifted 
that injunction the appeals court said pratt had erred in holding 
eastern in contempt for taking the steps 
the international association of machinists which represents 
about 13000 eastern workers has long contended that texas air 
aims to break up the carrier it bought in 1986 
the machinists union and eastern are holding secret contract 
talks guided by federal mediators the union has rejected deep pay 
and benefit cuts the company calls necessary to return to 
profitability 
eastern has lost a total of nearly 1 billion in the past 10 
years

ford motor co has offered settlements of 
less than 1 million to each of the families of 24 children killed 
in a fiery church bus crash the courierjournal reported friday 
citing unidentified lawyers close to the case the newspaper 
also reported that ford which manufactured the chassis of the bus 
involved in the accident offered payments to the estates of the 
three adults who died and to the 40 survivors of the may 14 crash 
based on the severity of their injuries 
lawyer don skeeters a spokesman for the firm that represents 
many of the families would neither confirm nor deny the report 
michael hance who represents the families of two of the dead 
children said the settlement was being offered by ford and all 
manufacturers responsible for producing the bus including sheller 
globe corp of toledo ohio which assembled it 
hance declined to disclose the size of the offers but described 
them as attractive financially to the families and also a good 
deal for ford 
robert waite a spokesman for the dearborn michbased ford 
said delicate negotiations were under way but declined comment 
on whether a settlement had been offered sheller globes spokesman 
did not return phone calls 
the wreck occurred as the converted school bus owned by the 
radcliff first assembly of god church was returning 67 people to 
the church after a day at an amusement park police say the 
accident was caused by a drunken driver traveling the wrong way on 
interstate 71 
but investigators have said other factors combined to increase 
the loss of life including the bus lone rear exit door and 
crowded conditions inside authorities have also pointed to the 
bus gas tank which ruptured in the crash and burst into flames 
with the smoke from the resulting fire blamed for all 27 deaths 
the bus was apparently one of the last manufactured in 1977 
before a new federal rule required bus fuel tanks be sheathed in 
protective cages 
prominent massdisaster lawyers said it would be highly unusual 
for such a major case to be settled even before lawsuits were filed 
washington dc lawyer john coale who represents one family 
and has been active in several airdisaster cases said it would be 
unconscionable to settle so quickly without exploring whether 
ford might be liable for punitive damages

marie lemoin came to the united states with a 
bag full of dreams and a fist full of dollars 
the french woman is part of the wave of foreigners taking 
advantage of the weak dollar to visit america and splurge on goods 
that have become bargains in terms of their own currencies 
ms lemoin 21 arrived in new york this year carrying a 
suitcase a satchel stuffed with guidebooks and slick tourist 
brochures and a wad of travelers checks and assorted us currency 
she said she never expected her money to go so far 
but yvonne gomez and her husband ramiro of sao paulo brazil 
stopped in new york en route to a european vacation expecting to 
pick up a lot of bargains 
were taking his wallet to my favorite places saks and 
bloomingdales said mrs gomez anticipating her shopping spree 
at two of new yorks most stylish department stores 
nigel and rosy collins of london took their vacation in the 
united states for the same reason they estimated their weeklong 
trip would cost about half what they would have paid two years ago 
they may have been carried away in their enthusiasm since the 
dollar is only 10 percent cheaper against the pound than it was at 
the end of june 1986 
everything is so warm so new so cheap he said 
and you have don johnson his wife added referring to the 
star of popular television detective series miami vice 
foreigners have been lining up to get into the empire state 
building to catch a ride on the staten island ferry past the 
statue of liberty and to buy halfprice tickets for broadway 
shows they have been packing restaurants in chinatown and little 
italy 
elsewhere record crowds are converging on the beaches popular 
tourist attractions in southern florida and california 
and the numbers are expected to swell during the summer 
the rise in foreign tourism is due largely to the weak dollar 
which has doubled the buying power of the japanese yen and west 
german mark since early 1985 most other nations currencies also 
buy more here 
by the end of the year the us travel and tourism 
administration predicts a record 302 million foreigners will have 
visited the united states as tourists on business or on visits to 
friends and relatives 
im hearing french german and japanese everywhere its like 
a language school outside my office said michael finley 
superintendent of floridas 14 millionacre everglades national 
park where attendance is up more than 40 percent over last year 
nearly half of the foreign visitors will come from neighboring 
canada and mexico the tourism administration said but more 
japanese and europeans are expected to visit than ever before 
projections are that british german and french travel to the 
us will hit a new record and japan will hit a new record 
again said ron erdmann of the agencys research office 
the number of visiting brazilians also is expected to increase 
in part due to that governments decision to rescind the 25 percent 
surtax on overseas plane tickets and on us dollars purchased for 
foreign travel 
executives at the resort hotel association of miami beach said 
they thought they were overly optimistic when they sent their 
london tourism office 20000 brochures touting package deals to the 
florida beach resort 
we were gambling but in 10 days we ran out said murray 
gold executive director of the association the requests coming 
in are phenomenal we never expected it 
ms lemoin who left france a year ago to study languages in 
sheffield england said at first she did not think she could 
afford a trip to america her home is in toulouse 
my aunt always told me the first place i should visit was the 
states she said but i thought it would be too expensive 
it only took an outing in new yorks greenwich village and soho 
areas to dispel that notion 
ive been able to buy whatever i want she said looking out 
into new york harbor from the top of the 110story world trade 
center 
i hope to have a lot more of these before i go home she 
said pointing to a huge bag stuffed with a variety of souvenirs 
including tshirts postcards coffee mugs and an appleshaped key 
ring emblazoned with i love new york 
and that was just the beginning she said 
she pulled out a color pamphlet from the arizona tourist ageny 
and said im disappointed the only place i wont get to see is 
the grand canyon

ford motor co is shutting all its us factories 
for a twoweek summer vacation beginning saturday allowing the no 
2 automaker to set up the plants to build 1989 models the company 
said friday 
meanwhile general motors corp the nations largest automaker 
was still organizing its summer vacation and model changeover 
schedules which will be scattered through july and august 
ford has used a nationwide july vacation shutdown for model 
changeovers for the past several years eliminating the need for 
temporary layoffs spokeswoman judith muhlberg said 
its very efficient europe shuts down a month in august 
she said 
in the united states however workers will have to make up the 
lost production time with overtime later in the year because of 
surging car and truck sales which have left ford with low 
inventories 
during the shutdown some skilled workers at every plant will 
have to stay in the factories installing new tooling and equipment 
for next years models ford spokesman pete olsen said 
gm has scheduled a temporary shutdown of its fiero plant in 
pontiac next week and a twoweek model changeover at its lake orion 
assembly plant beginning july 15 
the fiero plant will end production of the sporty 
plasticbodied twoseater later this summer at the end of the 1988 
model run 
gms heavyduty truck assembly line in pontiac also will close 
temporarily starting july 15 and its mediumduty truck assembly 
line closes from aug 58 
but demand for lightduty trucks is so high that gms pontiac 
east assembly plant will continue production through the aug 4 
changeover to 1989 models as will the pontiac west plant during an 
aug 12 changeover 
chrysler corp reports its model changeover shutdowns a week 
ahead of time the only plant closed is newark del which shut 
for 16 weeks beginning june 17 for modernization and retooling the 
plant which built the dodge aries and plymouth reliant kcars

the billionaire hunt brothers who settled a 714 
million debt for penrod drilling co are on the verge of settling 
a sister companys 704 million debt with 18 of the worlds largest 
banks a hunt energy corp vice president said 
the 704 million debt is against placid oil co which is being 
reorganized under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
the proposed penrod settlement filed thursday with us 
bankruptcy judge harold abramson would resolve all issues 
surrounding some 760 million in loans to penrod drilling while 
bringing the hunt family trusts that run penrod out of chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection the proposal must be approved by the 
bankruptcy court 
in addition hunt energy corp vice president tom whitaker said 
the reorganization plan for placid is just around the corner 
penrod the worlds biggest independent offshore oildrilling 
company and placid oil sued 23 of their lenders for fraud and 
misrepresentation in 1986 after defaulting on 15 billion in bank 
loans two of the banks since have been dropped from the case 
the suit sought 14 million in damages alleging that the banks 
one group of which had sued to recover 760 million in past due 
loans to penrod conspired to drive penrod and placid out of 
business by forcing them to agree to an unreasonable payment 
schedule while offering their competitors more favorable terms 
in august 1986 the trust estates of william herbert hunt 
nelson bunker hunt and lamar hunt filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection for the trust partnership that owns penrod drilling 
penrod itself was not under bankruptcy court protection 
under the consensual proposal filed thursday bank creditors 
would receive a 50 million payment and a 500 million secured note 
from penrod drilling plus a 50 percent interest in the company 
which is subject to repurchase by the trust estates 
some trust real estate will be transferred to the banks subject 
to a 200 million purchase option 
the trust estates would be released from prior liability to 
their bank creditors when the reorganization is complete also the 
banks trust estates and individual members of the hunt family 
would drop claims and counterclaims stemming from the bank loans 
the proposed settlement has been approved by the group of banks 
led by first chicago citicorp and manufacturers hanover trust co 
a hunt estates statement said when approved by the court 
this plan by the trust estates and their bank creditors settles all 
issues surrounding the bank loans to penrod drilling corp 
there had been speculation that any settlement might require 
william herbert hunt manager for the penrod partners to 
relinquish his power in penrods daily operations however 
whitaker said the agreement would not affect hunts position or the 
daytoday operations of penrod 
whitaker said there was no timetable to the repayment plan he 
also said there should be no problems gaining bankruptcy court 
approval of the plan because both sides of the dispute have agreed 
to it 
penrod employs about 2300 workers and will have revenue of more 
than 250 million this year whitaker said

coleco industries inc which has 
enough funds to carry on business through next thursday only could 
file for protection from its creditors next week company chairman 
morton e handel said friday 
handel would not confirm that his struggling company would 
indeed file for protection under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy law but he said in a telephone interview that if 
anything is to happen it would be next week 
there really is nothing happening today handel said 
handel recuperating at home from openheart surgery said 12 
foreign and domestic lenders whom coleco owes 103 million agreed 
to provide money to the company through next thursday 
on thursday the west hartford toy company gave up on its plan 
to restructure its debts after having repeatedly extended a 
deadline for a securities swap by its bondholders 
coleco has tried to restructure its finances since march when 
it proposed exchanging 335 million of bonds for a combination of 
new bonds and stock the company said the exchange would save it 
millions of dollars a year in interest payments and supply cash for 
the business 
the original exchange terms were rejected by some of the 
bondholders who contended the swap would have reduced the value of 
their investment without requiring similar sacrifices from colecos 
stockholders and bankers 
unless they can pull a takeover of the company in the next few 
days this sounds like the end said sean mcgowan an analyst 
with the investment firm balis zorn gerard inc in new york 
handel said coleco had not received any offers to buy the 
company and was not approached by any prospective buyers he said 
other banks are willing to lend coleco money if it can work out 
arrangements with existing lenders 
the companys current banks have provided shortterm financing 
to keep coleco afloat since june 1 but the shortage of money 
forced the company to virtually halt production 
if it survives coleco will have few products for store shelves 
at christmas the crucial season for toy manufacturers 
the company produces such wellknown toys as cabbage patch kids 
and scrabble board games 
coleco lost 474 million in the quarter that ended april 2 it 
has lost money in four of the past five years including 215 
million the last two years

bond prices rose modestly friday supported by a 
strong dollar fresh foreign demand and lower oil prices 
the treasurys key 30year issue rose about 150 per 1000 in 
face amount its yield which moves inversely to its price and is a 
possible signal of other interest rate trends declined to 883 
percent from 885 percent late thursday 
analysts noted that there was strong foreign demand for bonds 
despite the upcoming long independence day weekend most traders 
closed up shop at 3 pm edt to get a jump on the threeday weekend 
that demand i would suspect is being spurred by the strength 
of the dollar noted mitchell held chief financial economist at 
smith barney harris upham amp co 
a stronger dollar attracts foreign capital and boosts bond 
prices while a weaker dollar discourages foreigners from investing 
in the united states incites higher inflation and erodes bond 
prices 
lower oil prices also supported bond prices by removing the 
specter of inflation at least for the moment the nearterm 
contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude oil 
settled below 15 a barrel its lowest level in nearly two years 
bond traders may be looking a little more at the oil 
markets said william sullivan director of moneymarket research 
at dean witter reynolds inc 
they have tended to ignore energyrelated developments this 
year because thoughts were dominated by the dollar but oils 
downturn was so dramatic that it takes on a little more importance 
to the interest rate market he said 
a commerce department report that construction spending rose 11 
percent in may had little effect on trading 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues rose 132 point to 116 point intermediate 
maturities rose 532 point to 316 point and longterm issues 
gained 316 point according to figures provided by telerate inc 
a financial information service 
the movement of a point equals a 10 change in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer rose 008 to 11033 the shearson lehman daily 
treasury bond index which makes a similar measurement rose 149 
to 115465 
in corporate trading industrials and utilities also rose 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures price 
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or 
longer rose 092 to 28595 
yields on threemonth treasury bills were unchanged at 655 
percent sixmonth bills were off 2 basis points at 668 percent 
and year bills fell 4 basis points to 699 percent a basis point 
is onehundredth of a percentage point

corn prices soared the limit for daily trading friday but oat 
futures dropped sharply in what analysts said might be a signal of 
the end of a recordbreaking rally 
wheat and soybeans advanced strongly in other action on the 
chicago board of trade 
on other markets pork futures plunged the daily trading limit 
while cattle futures were mixed crude oil prices dropped below 15 
a barrel precious metals were slightly higher and stockindex 
futures retreated 
forecasts for a warm dry july 4 weekend in the droughtstricken 
midwest underpinned gains in most grain and soybean markets 
corn was very strong and rumors of russian buying were 
rampant said victor lespinasse a trader for the investment firm 
dean witter reynolds inc he said the soviets were believed to have 
purchased 500000 to 1 million metric tons of us corn and an 
unknown amount of argentine corn 
most corn contracts advanced the 10centsabushel limit and the 
limitless contract for july delivery rose even higher 
gains in the wheat and soybean pits while substantial were 
slowed by thursdays monthly grain stocks report from the 
agriculture department which showed largerthanexpected stocks of 
corn wheat and soybeans lespinasse said 
but it was another story in the oat pit where prices dropped 
sharply on ideas that the droughtdriven rally in that market was 
over 
lespinasse cited rumors of oat imports from argentina other 
experts said the reality of yield losses had finally caught up with 
the futures market 
the us oat crop grown primarily in the northern great plains 
is basically at maturity or close enough to maturity that very 
little more damage is going to be done to it now than is already 
known said walter spilka grain analyst with smith barney 
harris upham amp co in new york 
oat futures prices which hit a record 394 a bushel thursday 
likely will slip as supplyanddemand factors replace 
droughtdamage fears spilka said 
i think weve seen our highs for the year said independent 
oat trader jay homan 
the full extent of damage to the corn crop probably will become 
apparent next week as stunted plants pass through the critical 
pollination stage and speculation will continue to drive the 
soybean market for another month he said 
youve got reality in the oat market then youre a week 
away from reality for corn and a month away from reality for 
soybeans and thats how the market traded today homan said 
the national weather service issued a 6to10day forecast after 
the close calling for hot dry weather in most major growing areas 
for the period july 711 
wheat settled 10 cents to 15 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in july at 400 a bushel corn was 9 cents to 15 
cents higher with july at 342 a bushel oats were 21 cents lower 
to 3 cents higher with july at 332 a bushel soybeans were 2 
cents to 17 cents higher with july at 988 a bushel 
as expected pork futures plummeted their daily limits at the 
opening on the chicago mercantile exchange and remained locked 
limitdown all day in reaction to thursdays surprising usda report 
showing largerthanexpected increases in both the us hog herd 
and the breeding intentions of hog producers 
live cattle were unchanged to 95 cent higher with august at 
6460 cents a pound feeder cattle were 60 cent lower to 42 cent 
higher with august at 7367 cents a pound hogs were 150 cents 
lower across the board with july at 4482 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 2 cents lower across the board with july at 3525 
cents a pound 
crude oil prices slumped below 15 a barrel to their lowest 
levels in almost two years after fluctuating wildly on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
analysts were divided on the reasons for the drop some cited 
technical factors while others pegged the drop to saudi arabias 
desire to see lower oil prices 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 18 cents to 22 cents 
lower with august at 1494 a barrel heating oil was 03 cent to 
10 cent lower with august at 4102 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 39 cent lower to 29 cent higher with august at 4835 
cents a gallon 
precious metals futures advanced slightly in light choppy 
trading on the commodity exchange in new york 
gold was 190 to 2 higher with august at 43960 a troy ounce 
silver was 40 cent lower to 25 cents higher with july at 6703 a

secondquarter loss of 160 million mainly because of a 778

to 50000 except for locomotive enginemen who are covered under 
an existing program that calls for payments of 75000 
the remaining 186 million of the special charge covers various 
costs and claims pending against csx and certain subsidiaries 
those costs are expected to result from litigation and negotiated 
settlements 
csx president and chief operating officer john w snow said the 
employee reduction program is part of csx transportations effort 
to match the number of rail employees with the operating 
requirements of the rail system csx transportation is a subsidiary 
of csx corp

the physical base of csx transportation from 26748 route miles

crude oil prices have fallen to their lowest levels in almost 
two years a development that helped cool inflation concerns and 
lift bond prices 
the contract for august delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude oil plunged 22 cents per 42gallon barrel 
friday piercing the 15 level to settle at 1494 on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
along with the fall in oil bond prices were boosted modestly by 
a stronger dollar and fresh foreign demand the yield of the 
treasurys key 30year bond which falls when prices rise dipped 
to 883 percent from 885 percent late thursday 
in other economic news construction of offices and factories 
increased strongly in may the government said friday in a report 
that indicated healthy economic growth 
on wall street stock prices fell and the dow jones average of 
30 industrials dropped 1013 points to 213158 closing out the 
week with a net loss of 1138 points 
overall construction spending advanced 11 percent in may the 
commerce department said the increase was led by a 78 percent 
advance in office construction and a 77 percent advance in factory 
construction 
in contrast residential construction fell 1 percent 
the big jump in factory construction reflected the capital 
spending boom occurring as manufacturers rush to expand capacity to 
meet sharply higher demand for us exports 
analysts said the rise in office construction after a sustained 
period of weakness reflected strong activity in certain sections 
of the country such as the northeast and a halt to the giant plunge 
in building which had occurred in the southwest hard hit because 
of troubles in the oil patch 
cities such as chicago new york boston and washington dc 
are enjoying good economic growth and a fair amount of offfice 
construction said richard peach senior economist for the 
mortgage bankers association this is happening while the sharp 
declines in other areas have at least bottomed out

crude oil prices plunged through the 
psychologically important 15abarrel level to their lowest price 
in almost two years during a chaotic trading session 
the contract for august delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude oil plunged 22 cents a barrel on friday to 
settle at 1494 on the new york mercantile exchange 
crude prices have not finished as low since dec 10 1986 when 
the nearterm contract closed at 1492 per 42gallon barrel 
the price on nearterm contracts has dropped from 1683 a 
barrel since the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
agreed on june 14 to extend its previous production quotas which 
have not prevented an oversupply of crude oil 
prices of refined products traded on the exchange were mixed 
friday the july contract for home heating oil edged down 006 cent 
to 4102 cents a gallon the july contract for unleaded gasoline 
settled at 4835 cents up 029 cent from thursdays session 
traders noted that the chaotic activity was unusual for what 
typically is a subdued session ahead of the long independence day 
weekend 
crude prices fluctuated in a wide range trading up to 1544 a 
barrel early in the session before dropping below 15 after noon 
the lower prices were met with strong buying from investors on 
the sidelines theres good buying around here said madison 
galbraith a trader at merrill lynch energy futures the sellers 
are the ones who are hurting 
analysts were divided over the reason for the selloff some said 
that consistently lower oil prices finally convinced investors it 
was time to swallow their losses and sell off contracts that were 
purchased at higher prices 
theyre having to cut their hurt galbraith said those 
who bought above 16 a barrell are trying to get out 
but others suggested some of the selling might have been 
undertaken on behalf of saudi arabia which hoped lower prices 
would choke off oil revenue for iran removing a financing tool in 
irans 7yearold war with iraq 
lower oil prices could cut off the supplies of money to iran 
and bring the war machine to a grinding halt said peter beutel 
an assistant director at elders futures inc 
in addition some speculated the saudis would rather lower 
prices than see us oil companies explore for oil 
the decline came on the heels of a sharp drop in the previous 
session 
on thursday the nearterm contract of west texas intermediate 
fell 27 cents to finish at its lowest level since dec 21 1987 
the drop came amid fears of a possible price war after egypt 
announced it would cut the price on its crude oil exports for the 
first half of july
