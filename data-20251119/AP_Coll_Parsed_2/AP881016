michael dukakis fought to make up ground on george bush 
saturday declaring he has reduced homestate crime through a 
commitment right out of my gut while bush merely postures on 
tv bush leading the presidential race with just over three weeks 
to go said im not going to mess up 
dukakis received endorsements from hispanic lawenforcement 
groups in los angeles and spoke at a rally there before flying to 
texas for more campaigning bush accompanied by hollywood actors 
and two of the beach boys singing group led a bus tour of rallies 
in seven california cities 
dukakis running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen said saturday 
that despite polls showing republican gains the momentum is 
ours but he also brought up a story generally cited only by 
political longshots the 1948 newspaper headline incorrectly 
declaring republican thomas dewey had defeated democratic underdog 
harry truman 
i cant help but remember harry truman out there when the 
press had written him off bentsen told a crowd at a farmers 
market in st louis 
dukakis managers held a daylong meeting in boston and set out 
an 18state strategy focusing largely on economic issues for 
improving the democratic nominees election chances the washington 
post reported in its sunday editions 
the issues at stake are too important for the press and the 
republicans to shut this election down three weeks before it 
happened said dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
under the strategy the dukakis campaign plans an allout 
drive in 18 states where dukakis is favored or competitive the 
post reported those 18 states collectively have 272 electoral 
votes two more than needed to be elected 
bushs running mate indiana sen dan quayle campaigned in 
wisconsin telling cheering supporters in eau claire and appleton 
that the state is going for george bush 
at the university of wisconsin at eau claire he ran into 
demonstrators carrying signs questioning his military record he 
brushed past them saying see you after the election 
bushs staff welcomed quayle back to washington with a rally and 
presented him with a green medical uniform sporting the words dr 
spin in keeping with the indiana senators vow to give his own 
spin or interpretation to campaign developments 
dukakis has been striking back aggressively since thursday 
nights debate an encounter that polls indicate put him farther 
behind bush 
he also has been hurt by tough bush television ads accusing him 
of presiding over a massachusetts prisonerfurlough system that 
gave a weekend pass to a murderer who later attacked a maryland 
couple 
dukakis said little about such charges for weeks but now 
addresses them vigorously and at length 
on saturday he called bush cynical and hypocritical for 
seeking political gain from what dukakis calls a tragic incident 
he spoke of murders in california by inmates on furlough during 
ronald reagans governorship and he said that while bush has been 
vice president there have been thousands of federal prison 
furloughs and an incident last year in which an inmate on furlough 
raped and murdered a mother of two in arizona 
dukakis also speaks of a murder and rape committed by a man who 
escaped from a houston halfway house bush supported 
the governor said that he and reagan took responsibility for 
their programs but that bush has refused to take blame for his 
failures 
talk versus action tv commercials versus results thats what 
were dealing with here dukakis said comparing bush and himself 
he noted his states 14 percent decline in the rate of major 
crime and its lowest homicide rate among industrial states that 
progress he said resulted from his personal involvement in a 
statewide anticrime council 
i didnt learn my lessons about crime from a clint eastwood 
movie he told the lawenforcement officers ive been out 
there with you 
this is an issue that is very close to me he said it 
comes right out of my gut 
in his texas appearance dukakis spoke warmly of the texas 
senator who is his running mate 
lloyd bentsen and i have formed a partnership a partnership 
for the future a partnership that will make america first 
economically and militarily he said at a san antonio rally 
the two go hand in hand you cant have one without the other and 
well have neither if we elect george bush and dan quayle to lead 
our country 
bush who like dukakis has been in california all week 
campaigned saturday with actors telly savalas and chuck norris and 
singers mike love and bruce johnston of the beach boys 
he told reporters aboard his campaign plane that he was going to 
go the extra mile to fight hard in the final 24 days of the 
race and wouldnt mess up 
were going to take the high road and leave the pessimism and 
the tearing down of america to somebody else he said 
here we go entering the home stretch of this national 
presidential election bush declared at a noisy kickoff rally in 
an airport hangar in modesto 
he is pushing for an advantage in california where the election 
is still considered too close to call in particular he is trying 
to energize republicans and to keep the support of democrats who 
may have dropped their allegiance in order to vote for reagan in 
1980 and 1984 
in washington president reagan used his weekly radio address to 
praise bush criticize dukakis and ask voters to support 
republicans in house and senate races if we dont want a 
taxandspend liberal in the white house shouldnt we give the 
president a congress that will work with him he asked 
rep dennis eckart of ohio giving the democrats response said 
dukakis and bentsen would do more than the republicans to answer 
americans most pressing concerns he dismissed bush as a silent 
partner in a reagan administration riddled with corruption 
corruption that has reached into the presidents cabinet to the 
pentagon from defense contractors to wall street

usbacked nicaraguan resistance 
leaders rejected an invitation saturday to join fellow rebels who 
say they are ready to talk about peace with the government and lay 
down their arms 
those who formed the new democratic center coalition are 
pseudoleaders said nicaraguan rebel roberto ferrey in a 
recorded interview members of the nicaraguan resistance in miami 
the umbrella group for the rebels or contras played it for the 
associated press in managua 
the new coalition of some nicaraguan resistance leaders was 
announced friday at a press conference in costa rica alfredo 
cesar said the group will propose a nicaraguan peace plan to the 
leftist sandinista government that will complement a regional plan 
proposed by costa rican president oscar arias 
however ferrey said the democratic center coalition is a new 
effort to trick the rebels which will only help consolidate the 
power of the sandinistas 
cesar a member of the nicaraguan resistance directorate and 
leader of the southern opposition block said the democratic center 
coalition is not breaking away from the nicaraguan resistance he 
said it will try to win over other members to its ideas 
the new group includes four political opposition parties in 
addition to cesars southern opposition block 
however ferrey discounted the groups importance 
it acts as infiltrators to undermine the resistance he said 
one rebel official involved in the coalition said the new group 
was formed in part with an eye to the end of the reagan 
administration which has backed the rebels since 1981 in their bid 
to oust the sandinistas 
the two sides agreed march 21 to begin a truce which has been 
periodically extended despite complaints of violations from both 
sides 
talks have remained at an impasse particularly over the 
sadinista demand that the rebels give up their arms as part of a 
permanent peace

find his own country on a map and more than 40 percent had a big 
problem figuring a simple restaurant check a newspaper reported 
sunday 
one person even thought president reagan leads britains 
socialist labor party although 90 percent correctly identified the 
opposition leader as neil kinnock the survey found 
the survey of 994 people published in the sunday times of 
london was conducted last month by market and opinion research 
international the newspaper commissioned it to test knowledge of 
geography mathematics common foreign language phrases spelling 
history science and current affairs 
the newspaper said the 18question test was simple but 
many of the replies were enough to break traditional teachers 
hearts 
the survey found 83 percent of the sample population could find 
britain on a world map but 7 percent had no idea where to look 
others placed it off the coast of north america off south america 
in the far east or in africa 
asked to spell embarrass satellite and exercise 
one in 10 immediately threw up their hands in defeat the 
newspaper said 
fiftynine percent spelled embarrass and satellite 
incorrectly and 28 percent failed exercise 
mathematics added to the problem the newspaper said asked to 
add menu prices for the total cost of a hamburger french fries 
apple pie and coffee 42 percent got it wrong or were unable to try 
people aged 1524 fared the worst in the survey the newspaper 
said and women generally did worse than men except in spelling

saying the poor results by young people showed britain was in 
danger of producing a generation of ignoramuses

the kgb secret police could learn from the fbi by 
telling soviet citizens when they are being followed or monitored 
by its agents one communist party member says 
the campaign for glasnost or openness on selected topics 
has allowed the publication of some unusual items in soviet media 
recently but a letter in the latest issue of the ogonyok weekly is 
believed to be the first suggestion to soviet secret police 
officers to look to the west for inspiration 
under president mikhail s gorbachev the government reportedly 
is working on a new statute regulating the state security 
committee or kgb from its russianlanguage initials but the 
powerful and secretive agency itself remains virtually above 
criticism in the staterun press 
a rachkov of moscow who identified himself as a communist 
party member wrote to tell the weekly that one of his friends 
yuri n started to wonder why he was never sent abroad on business 
trips by the government agency he works for 
when yuri signed up for a tourist trip to england the vacation 
reservations were canceled two days before departure under a 
clearly invented pretext rachkov said 
yuri came to believe that someone made a slanderous report 
about him to the kgb that ruined his chances of ever traveling 
outside the soviet union 
but he had no way of making anyone in authority tell him whether 
his belief was true rachkov said 
he couldnt penetrate the wall by banging against it with his 
head rachkov said 
by contrast the muscovite wrote a recent soviet press report 
said an american who thought he was being followed by the fbi sent 
the bureau an official request to explain its actions 
after a time he received a reply containing an official 
notice that a file had been opened about his antiamerican 
activities rachkov said 
maybe im mistaken but it seems to me that this is a proof of 
democratization the soviet wrote 
moreover id like to suggest that the kgb legalize in this 
country too the same possibility of sending a formal request to 
the government organs so that a citizen of the ussr could 
protect himself if necessary against false reports and arbitrary 
sanctions

release on sunday of about 500 minors arrested in a week of rioting 
over the worsening economy the government announced 
in addition the president suspended all hearings before the 
special courts set up to try the youths most of whom were arrested 
for looting and acts of vandalism during the unrest that began oct 
4 
the government has said 180 people died in the rioting but 
unofficials reports said at least 500 people died and more than 
1000 were injured 
the government also ordered the release sunday of all those 
imprisoned during the unrest who were not directly involved in the 
revolt and those arrested for crimes of opinion 
more than 3000 people were reported arrested in algiers and 
provincial cities during the riots over shortages high food prices 
and the governments program of austerity and economic reform 
schools reopened saturday and the country was relatively calm 
those still held in prison will benefit fully of the rights of 
defense in accordance with the law the government said no 
judgment will be pronounced other than in the strict respect of 
legality 
miloud brahimi the president of algerias league for human 
rights last week protested the special tribunals which he charged 
with violating the fundamental rights of presumed innocence 
also on sunday interior minister elhadi khediri announced a 
nationwide revision of electoral lists as a first step to the nov 
3 referendum that is to launch bendjedids program to democratize 
his country 
in the referendum the citizens will be asked to approve a 
revision of the constitution that would make the future prime 
minister answerable to parliament other more farreaching reforms 
are to be discussed in december at the national congress of the 
ruling national liberation front 
no one except foreignbased opposition groups has publicly 
proposed the introduction of a multiparty system 
the official algerie presse service said the referendum 
introduces the fundamental problem of the full participation in 
the political life of the country for all citizens 
the news agency said the reforms to be introduced would permit 
the removal of top officials who have impeded the changes by 
inertia or incompetence 
one of the likely victims of these changes is the leader of the 
national liberation front mohamed cherif messaadia who has not 
been heard from publicly for nearly two weeks many other personnel 
changes are expected in the government including the possible 
replacement of prime minister abdelhamid brahimi

its been a downanddirty presidential 
campaign from gleeful democratic denunciations of george bush as a 
wimp to the republicans skewering of michael dukakis over crime 
the aclu and the pledge of allegiance 
while the dismal tenor of this years campaign discourse has 
elicited groans from past presidents richard nixon and jimmy 
carter political analysts credit bush with tapping some of the 
same emotional issues that helped nixon capture the white house in 
1968 and 1972 and laid the groundwork for ronald reagans twin 
landslides of the 1980s 
some experts say it is a serious mistake for the democrats who 
have lost four of the past five presidential elections to 
underestimate the seriousness with which the electorate responds to 
emotional appeals to its patriotism or fear of crime 
the gut issues symbolic or not are real issues for many voters 
politics is a matter of gut responses otherwise known as 
emotions said roger d masters a dartmouth university professor 
of government 
its not just media manipulation said michael robinson a 
georgetown university associate professor of government and expert 
on media and politics if the democrats continue to believe that 
symbolic issues dont matter theyre going to foul up time and 
time again 
stephen hess a senior fellow at the brookings institution said 
symbolic issues loom larger in this election because american 
politics like nature abhors a vacuum the candidates seemed quite 
deliberately to choose not to face up to the pragmatic issues 
robinson said the race unfolded during a time of economic 
prosperity when there were few differences between democrats and 
republicans on dealing with the soviet union 
when you subtract the issues of peace and prosperity you 
leave very little so we are left to fight on those gut isues of 
symbolic issues he said 
conservative analyst kevin phillips publisher of the american 
political report said the republicans have replayed the key 
cultural and patriotic issues with the swing voters that got the 
republican presidential majority started in 1968 and 1972 and 
1980 
the bush campaign flogged the crime spree of willie horton jr 
the massachusetts lifer who escaped while on a weekend furlough 
from prison and pummeled dukakis for being a selfproclaimed 
cardcarrying member of the american civil liberties union 
in doing so phillips said bushs people succeeded in 
rekindling in the minds of wavering reagan democrats the emotions 
that pulled them to vote for republican presidents in earlier 
years while dukakis failed to develop rival issues to appeal to 
the same swing voters 
in their final debate last thursday both candidates sounded 
apologetic about the lowroad campaigning bush recalling the 
almost nonstop attacks the democrats unleashed against him at 
their july convention in atlanta said i dont want to sound 
like a kid in the schoolyard but he started it 
it was both ways said ben wattenberg a senior fellow at 
the american enterprise institute two months ago the best issue 
that dukakis had on bush was wimp and the best issue bush had on 
dukakis was lword liberal 
the republicans went after dukakis on all the lword stuff 
which they had some nice symbols for prison furloughs and pledge 
of allegiance and aclu and stuff like that but it wasnt about 
those issues said wattenberg a democrat 
the reason they played was because they resonated in terms of 
20 years of democratic party history as too liberal he said 
its not a small issue it is haunting this party it is which 
direction the plurality party in america wants to take the 
country 
on the other hand the democrats wimp charge quickly lost its 
punch as bush emerged from the gop convention in new orleans as 
captain marvel said wattenberg 
phillips said by going hardline on the cultural and 
patriotic issues bush drove down the wimp factor bush put on 
a bit of a john wayne outfit 
bushs highest negative rating in polls remains the perception 
that he is too close to the wealthy and too far from the middle 
class but phillips said dukakis failed to come on hard and tough 
and use economic populism and nationalism to get the guys in the 
bar in the ethnic sections of cleveland or your dirt farmer in 
rural alabama angry at the republicans 
robinson said in a time of real prosperity questions of 
economic justice and hostility toward big business do not cut it 
with the american public 
as for such emotional issues as flag and country you cant 
pretend that something that is an issue is not an issue robinson 
said it hurts the democrats when they try to dismiss this in 
some way as bigotry or tasteless or unamerican 
it is an issue to americans whether you wear your flag on your 
sleeve or whether you wear it on the seat of your pants he said 
republicans are not only willing to wear their flag on their 
sleeves theyre willing to wear it on their foreheads the 
democrats are willing to move it off their keester but they still 
want to keep it half covered and americans dont like that

the national rifle association is saturating 
more than a dozen states with radio commercials slamming michael 
dukakis record on crime and guns as upnorth nonsense that 
shouldnt spread beyond his native massachusetts 
dukakis the democratic presidential nominee says the 
advertisements are an outrageous distortion of his positions 
his campaign has asked the gun lobby to pull them and is 
counterattacking with its own radio and tv ads 
daniel a taylor general counsel for the dukakis campaign told 
the nra by letter that it was wrongly attributing statements to 
dukakis and ignoring an issues questionnaire the governor had 
filled out according to campaign spokeswoman lorraine voles 
but wayne la pierre director of the nras lobbying arm said 
the ads were factual he accused the dukakis campaign of a 
heavyhanded attempt to keep us from relaying the truth 
the nra started running the radio spots a week ago in texas 
california north carolina ohio illinois pennsylvania arkansas 
and montana among other states 
were covering those states from one end to the other 
probably thousands of stations said la pierre he declined to 
say how much the nra had spent on the radio ads or on a companion 
directmail campaign 
la pierre said there is tremendous support for gun ownership 
and hunting in the target states dukakis strident position as 
governor could very well cost him those states hes making a 
lastditch desperate attempt to say hes really prosportsmen and 
profirearms ownership he said 
dukakis tried to defuse the nra ads last weekend before they 
began calling them another outrageous distortion of what i 
believe 
his campaign is counterattacking with its own radio ads and in 
texas with two television ads on the crime and gun control records 
of republican nominee george bush 
the nra operating independently of the bush campaign is 
running three 60second radio spots one quotes dukakis as saying 
he was going to do everything i can to disarm this state the 
nra narrator says dont let this upnorth nonsense go 
nationwide 
another nra spot features actor charlton heston who says 
dukakis opposed mandatory jail time for drug pushers vetoed the 
death penalty for cop killers gave murderers weekend vacations 
from prison he also did everything he could to take guns away from 
honest citizens michael dukakis is not just challenging your 
rights hes taking on the constitution 
another ad is aimed at pennsylvanians a sportsman says he 
loves the pennsylvania woods and accuses dukakis of raiding his 
states conservation fund to pay off state debt protect our 
outdoor heritage defeat dukakis an announcer concludes 
in his letter taylor said dukakis has denied ever saying he was 
going to try to disarm his state he also said dukakis had 
completed a questionnaire for the nra in which he said he supported 
firearm ownership for personal protection hunting competitive 
shooting informal sport shooting and collecting 
he did support a ban on saturday night specials taylor 
said 
one of the dukakis tv spots running in texas says only one 
candidate for president has voted for federal gun control george 
bush the ad cites a bush vote as a congressman and adds mike 
dukakis supports gun ownership by hunters and sportsmen dont be 
confused 
dukakis other texas tv ad says george bush sat by while a 
federal furlough program released thousands of prisoners many of 
them drug dealers almost 14000 in 1987 alone and now suddenly 
george bush is attacking michael dukakis for just one case in his 
furlough program but michael dukakis took action and changed that 
program in his state hes reduced crime by 13 percent and the 
murder rate is the lowest of any major industrial state

congress originally aimed to quit sept 30 but bogged down in a 
fight over the antidrug package the senate finally passed its 
26 billion version on friday 
the bill calls for the death penalty for drug traffickers who 
murder funnels more money to treatment programs and creates a new 
cabinetlevel drug czar to coordinate the federal governments 
antidrug effort 
this has taken more time than we expected but it was very 
complicated and a lot of issues had to be considered said sen 
sam nunn dga one of the chief authors of the antidrug package 
the house passed its drug bill sept 22 senators hope house 
members will accept some version of the senate legislation rather 
than appointing a housesenate conference committee 
if we have a conference well be here until thanksgiving 
said sen warren rudman rnh we wrote our bill with an eye 
toward language the house might accept 
electionyear demands from voters to do something about drugs 
have driven the bill rudman said people want us to respond 
they want leadership from the congress 
also unfinished is a compromise tax bill but housesenate 
negotiations broke off in disagreement friday imperiling chances 
of reaching a plan both chambers can accept 
the measure includes a package of corrections to the landmark 
1986 tax law some new tax cuts along with other tax increases to 
offset the reductions and a taxpayer bill of rights for 
persons facing internal revenue service enforcement actions 
the house plan raises taxes between 7 billion and 75 billion 
over the next three years compared to the price tag of just under 
3 billion for the senate package 
senate negotiators proposed a compromise 3 billion package the 
house responded friday with a 45 billion counter the senate side 
turned that plan down and the talks stalled 
we have not selected the pallbearers yet said sen max 
baucus dmont head of the senate negotiating team he said the 
two sides would try to talk again monday 
also pending on the legislative agenda are a variety of other 
bills including one that would elevate the veterans administration 
to cabinetlevel status the house approved that bill oct 6 
supporters of the legislation say upgrading the agencys status 
will give the nations 27 million veterans direct access to the 
white house it would be the governments 14th cabinet department 
when the house meets tuesday one of its first votes will be on 
a bill requiring full disclosure of credit card information to 
consumers the senate which returns to work on monday passed the 
bill last week 
the proposal requires banks department stores and other firms 
which offer credit cards to tell consumers about annual fees 
interest rates late fees and other information only a few states 
now have laws requiring public disclosure of such information 
before consumers receive the cards 
another piece of unfinished business is legislation providing 
the firstever restrictions on lobbying by former members of 
congress a plan that is part of a general tightening of federal 
rules against influence peddling by top government officials 
differing versions of the legislation have passed each chamber 
and the discrepancies must be worked out before it can win final 
approval

state department officials engaged in quiet 
discussions last week about a man who although unseen by the 
outside world for nine years is at the heart of a diplomatic 
debate over one of the worlds most unfortunate countries 
he is pol pot whose 3year rule in cambodia during the late 
1970s led to the slaughter of perhaps 2 million of his countrymen 
before he and his khmer rouge allies were driven out by vietnamese 
invaders 
david hawk an authority on the khmer rouge says pol pot is 
believed to be operating out of a small town in thailand near the 
cambodian border plotting a return to power once the vietnamese 
carry out their stated intention to withdraw from cambodia in 1990 
hawk has written on cambodia for freedom house a new yorkbased 
human rights group and formerly worked for amnesty international 
the reagan administration has been using diplomatic pressure to 
encourage the vietnamese to fulfill their promise to withdraw but 
is trying to find a way to prevent the marxist khmer rouge from 
retaking power once that happens 
this issue is a major concern of prowestern countries in 
southeast asia and was discussed this past week during a visits to 
washington by former cambodian head of state prince norodom 
sihanouk and officials from the chinese foreign ministry 
the dilemma facing the administration is that the khmer rouge 
with help from china is by far the strongest of the three rebel 
groups fighting the vietnamese occupation forces the united states 
is providing nonlethal equipment to the other two groups one led 
by sihanouk the second by former prime minister son sann 
sihanouk told reporters wednesday that his solution is the 
formation of a national reconciliation government after the 
vietnamese forces leave khmer rouge moderates would be allowed 
a role while pol pot and other top leaders would be sent into 
exile possibly china he said 
the khmer rouge meanwhile insist they recognize their past 
excesses and have now become liberal capitalists 
hawk says khmer rouge actions at the refugee camps they run 
along the thaicambodian border suggest little has changed since 
their 197578 period in power 
all evidence points to the fact they are the same as they 
were hawk says 
if you look at treatment of civilians under their control in 
resistance base areas in thailand their basic pattern of rule by 
terror and denial of human rights is still present 
sen mark hatfield rore said in a speech last month that 
china and to a lesser degree the reagan administration bear 
responsibility for the continued existence of the khmer rouge as an 
effective fighting force 
ten years ago the khmer rouge were all but dead hatfield 
said but because of questionable regional strategies and the 
selfimposed silence of the american government the khmer rouge 
beast was nursed back to health by communist china and now the 
resolution strategy for cambodia has to deal with the fact that the 
khmer rouge are poised to return to their old ways of torturing and 
terrorizing the people of cambodia 
china sees cambodia as a strategic issue worried about 
encirclement by prosoviet countries including cambodia chinas 
highest priority is to hasten vietnams withdrawal from that 
country by assisting the khmer rouge 
the degree to which the khmer rouge engaged in terror was 
outlined in a book written by a survivor of the khmer rouge rule 
writing under her adopted name in the stones cry out molyda 
szymusiak recalled the inhumanity of that era 
it has rained over the past few days and the ground is so 
soft that corpses not buried deep enough are rising up out of the 
earth i start praying as i walk along 
in an article in a 1987 issue of commentary magazine arch 
puddington quoted a united nations human rights commission official 
as saying that the khmer rouge atrocities were the most serious 
committed in the world since naziism 
puddington wrote that one of the most important objectives of 
khmer rouge training was to infuse young cadres with a 
callousness toward violence pain and killing 
a key technique was the torture game animals including 
domestic animals like dogs and monkeys were systematically 
dismembered or burned by childrensoldiers 
sihanouk himself who was under house arrest in cambodia during 
the khmer rouge era once recorded his own reaction after 
witnessing these activities 
the screams of the poor beasts were heart rending he wrote 
the sights and sounds of them were unbearable but the khmer 
rouge youths couldnt get enough of it

for forest whitaker playing charlie parker 
didnt just mean looking or sounding like the great jazzman it 
meant making sure everything fit 
i was nervous i was scared admitted whitaker who stars in 
bird clint eastwoods critically acclaimed film biography of 
the late jazz saxophonist 
i was going into areas i hadnt really dealt with it was a 
most challenging role as a person i felt really honored to bring 
the character to life it was so fortunate that it happened 
parker who died in 1955 when he was just 34 moved into musical 
areas that few touched with such musicians as dizzy gillespie he 
revolutionized jazz in the 1940s helping create the style called 
bebop a brilliant and troubled man he was no less overwhelming 
as a person 
i think he embraced life whitaker said he took whatever 
pleasure he could find in it he wasnt afraid to do that it held 
a lot of bad consequences for him but he did that and thats where 
he hurt himself 
where parker primarily hurt himself was by a heroin addiction 
that plagued him for much of his life 
he was trapped and he started very young whitaker said i 
think it has to do with his particular way of life he was very 
sensitive about a lot of things i think he knew it was destroying 
him he didnt want other people using it 
whitaker awarded this years prize for best actor at the cannes 
film festival gives a performance that should get academy notice 
he was born in longview texas and grew up in los angeles he 
attended the university of southern california and originally 
studied opera but he became interested in acting and began 
appearing in local equity productions his involvement with movies 
came later 
i was probably going to go to new york and work on stage and 
that was it whitaker said in an interview it just so happens 
i was working on a play and it turned into an opportunity to do a 
film 
whitaker beat paul newman at pool in the color of money and 
played robin williams protege in good morning vietnam he has 
been directed by martin scorsese oliver stone and eastwood 
they all have a very keen sense of focus although their 
focuses are different some go out in a circle and encompass 
everything some just focus on this little tiny thing 
whitaker had not even met eastwood when he was given the part 
i didnt know he had any interest in jazz whatsoever i didnt 
have any preconceived ideas about him i never expected to see 
dirty harry walk into that meeting he turned out to be a real jazz 
aficionado and really easy to work for 
whitaker is something of a rarity in hollywood a successful 
black actor he had always been aware of the difficulties in 
getting good parts but was not deterred from going into films 
im fortunate because i never wanted to do film im real 
fortunate that i never really thought about it that fear wasnt 
there because there wasnt a great need at first he said a 
lot of the roles ive played have not been written for black 
actors 
as part of his research for bird whitaker talked to those 
who knew parker including the jazzmans wife chan he discovered 
that no one really knew parker 
it seemed they didnt know what was going on with him that 
helped me immensely to understand where he was coming from 
whitaker said 
what did he really say to them what did they really know 
about his fears how he felt about this when they told me what 
they knew it was more important what they didnt know someone 
would say he had no fear and that would tell me how much they 
knew 
parker was true to the spirit of his music spontaneous and 
emotional given to extreme highs and lows understandably 
whitaker was drained by the effort to sustain those feelings 
there are scenes in the latter part of his life when hes 
closer to death when hes lost almost everything hes walking 
around like a lost soul the only thing thats moving him around is 
a little pilot light the actor said 
that was difficult to understand trying to find that place 
where youre still alive but you have nothing left 
but how well could anyone really understand parker bird has 
disentegrated into pure sound a musician once said was parker 
beyond words 
he was pushing towards sound whitaker said the sound was 
totally coming from emotion more than words can express i think 
that was something he felt understood and put in his music 
but whitaker believes he shares an important philosophical goal 
with parker 
i think he had a quest for understanding openness i believe 
i have that trying to figure that stuff out being open to all 
kinds of different things

thieves who stole eight snakes from the dallas zoo 
picked the most valuable snakes and the easiest to handle 
authorities said 
the snakes worth about 8000 were reported missing saturday 
morning workers found no sign of forced entry at the bird and 
reptile building and lids still covered the snakes cages some of 
which were found latched suggesting the snakes did not escape 
the thing is its just these specific snakes that were 
taken said victoria furber zoo spokeswoman we figure that 
somebody knew what they were doing and just went after some of the 
most valuable snakes in that section 
gone were three ringed pythons three carpet pythons and two 
endangered dumerils ground boas 
ardell mitchell animal care manager for the zoos reptile 
department said the snakes probably were taken for resale to 
underground pet traders or collectors 
these little snakes that were taken may bite but it wouldnt 
hurt at all so they took the easy ones to handle mitchell said 
the stolen snakes were between 2 and 3 feet long 
the loss of the boas which were brother and sister especially 
worried zoo officials ms furber said the snakes came from 
madagascar and are listed as an endangered species because their 
forest habitat is being destroyed 
theyre pretty valuable animals mitchell said id hate 
for them to go off and sit in someones garage somewhere

congress disturbed by evidence the energy 
department has mismanaged nuclear weapons reactors has passed a 
law to put them under standards nearly as stringent as those 
applied to reactors used to produce electricity 
some lawmakers however believe even tougher legislation is 
needed in the wake of the energy departments acknowledgement that 
its aging reactors at the savannah river plant near aiken sc 
have experienced problems and that other plants have spewed 
radioactivity into the environment 
the main difficulty is that the department of energy has been 
its own policeman said rep john spratt dsc one of the 
authors of a bill passed in september creating the defense nuclear 
facilities board to monitor the operation of weapons reactors 
the board yet to be appointed by the president has the 
authority to inspect the facilities at which the energy department 
manufactures nuclear weapons for the pentagon 
it will make recommendations to the secretary of energy the 
president and to congress but it will not have the power to close 
down facilities which are operating unsafely 
in the past the need to maintain a nuclear deterrent has 
overridden concern over the environmental hazards posed by weapons 
reactors 
finding a means to balance those concerns will be expensive the 
cost of building a new generation of safer nuclear weapons reactors 
is between 32 billion and 68 billion energy department 
officials say 
and it is expected to cost more than 110 billion to clean up 
contamination from the reactors at the savannah river plant and 
other facilities near cincinnati ohio and golden colo 
we quantified that as best we could the tens of tens and tens 
and tens of million dollars that this government this department 
has to address in the future if it would in fact meet what we 
believe is a moral obligation to rectify past sins deputy energy 
secretary joseph salgado told reporters 
salgado and other department officials say they are delaying 
until early next year the reopening of the first of three reactors 
at the savannah river plant where they manufacture nuclear weapons 
materials for the pentagon 
and they announced the appointment of an extra layer of managers 
at the site to draft safer operating procedures for the startup 
by the end of next year they said all three reactors at the 
savannah river plant should be in operation 
meantime richard e heckert chairman of the ei du pont de 
nemours amp co which operates savannah river said the government 
has exaggerated the problems with the nuclear facility 
the plant is not in disarray heckert said in an interview 
with the new york times these facilities are safe will work and 
will produce and meet the nations requirements the operators are 
well qualified and well trained 
du pont which has been operating the savannah river facility 
since 1950 has opted to let its contract lapse the plant will be 
taken over by westinghouse electric co on april 1 heckert claimed 
the government wants to criticize the plant so that westinghouse 
will look good in comparison when it begins operations next year 
pentagon officials say national security could be endangered by 
a prolonged delay in manufacturing one of the materials tritium a 
radioactive isotope of hydrogen which boosts the power and 
efficiency of nuclear weapons 
members of congress are warning however that they want prior 
assurances about safety procedures before production resumes at 
savannah river and some lawmakers may demand the energy department 
boost expenditures to clean up past contamination 
one idea circulating on capitol hill is to require that energy 
department reactors be monitored by the advisory committee on 
nuclear safety an adjunct to the nuclear regulatory commission 
which licenses civilian atomic plants 
a panel of the national academy of sciences also recommended in 
a report released in march 1987 that the energy department operate 
under standards as strict as those of the nrc 
but even some of the staunchest advocates of nuclear safety say 
that may not be the best immediate solution although the nrc has 
years of experience with reactors used by utilities it has little 
with reactors used in making nuclear weapons materials said john 
ahearne 
ahearne a former nrc chairman who is head of the energy 
departments independent advisory committee for nuclear facilities 
safety said it could take four or five years to draw up a set of 
requirements for weapons reactors that would be as detailed those 
developed for civilian reactors 
however some of the nrc criteria can be applied he said 
the first criteria is that the plant should be constructed and 
operated in such a way as it does not release radioactivity 
production goals should not be the first criteria 
until those standards are worked out in more detail and until 
the defense nuclear facilities board is appointed and hires its 
authorized 100 employees members of congress say they will oversee 
the safety of energy department reactors 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the governmental operations 
committee and rep mickey synar chairman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on environment energy and natural 
resources have vowed to key a close eye on efforts to restart the 
facility

president reagans noholdsbarred campaign on 
behalf of republican nominee george bush was partly inspired by the 
lessons of richard nixons loss in the 1960 election says one of 
reagans closest aides 
white house chief of staff kenneth m duberstein said that 
nixon and i spoke several months ago and i asked him to give his 
historical perspective what president dwight eisenhower did and 
didnt do for him 
it isnt known how much 1988 campaign strategy figured late last 
summer when reagan invited nixon to the white house for dinner but 
history shows that eisenhower did little to help his vice 
president which embittered nixon who narrowly lost the 1960 
election to john f kennedy 
after remaining steadfastly neutral in the republican primaries 
this year reagan has steadily increased his role as vice president 
bushs celebrity surrogate in the campaign against democrat michael 
dukakis 
reagan has left no doubt in anyones mind as eisenhower did 
on his feelings about his vice president 
reagan mentions bushs name in official statements whenever he 
can last friday for instance he sought to give bush some credit 
for the successful flight of the space shuttle discovery and for 
enactment of legislation intended to lessen american reliance on 
gasoline as a motor vehicle fuel 
the president has worked bushs name into ceremonial bill 
signings that otherwise were bipartisan events such as the recent 
signing of a fair housing bill which congressional democratic 
sponsors attended 
reagan has hit the road to campaign for bush among socalled 
reagan democrats conservativeminded democrats in key states who 
helped elect the president in 1980 and 1984 
i think its fair to say that ronald reagan has campaigned for 
his vice president in an unprecedented manner duberstein said in 
a recent interview 
i think the presidents thriving hes enjoying himself he 
thinks hes making a difference 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan is enjoying 
his campaign role at a time when people said he was a lame duck 
and had no authority 
it remains to be seen how much reagans aggressive campaigning 
will benefit bush the president hasnt always demonstrated an 
ability to transfer his personal popularity to others he was 
unable to prevent the democrats from seizing control of the senate 
in 1986 even though he campaigned vigorously for gop candidates 
that year 
if ronald reagan goes out and says this guy is a bad guy and 
this guy is a good guy is that going to move those people who 
knows said republican consultant eddie mahe 
yet campaign aides say reagans speeches amount to a powerful 
reinforcing mechanism for bushs campaign messages this 
happened recently when reagan went into ethnic strongholds of 
chicago to urge bushs election a couple of days after the vice 
president had campaigned there 
in the past three weeks the president has visited illinois 
michigan pennsylvania and new jersey and hell take his 
peaceandprosperity pitch into ohio in the coming week 
reagans standard stump speech argues that bush will safeguard 
conservative gains of the past eight years against a threat from 
liberal democrats to raise taxes and weaken the national defense 
republican strategists initially envisioned using reagan mostly 
in the south and the sun belt and of course in his home state of 
california but as bushs strengthen solidified in those regions 
reagan concentrated instead on other more closely fought swing 
states in the midwest and northeast 
reagans value to the bush campaign has soared as troublesome 
issues such as the irancontra affair and ethics questions 
centering on former attorney general edwin meese iii faded into the 
background as time passed 
they have had a marvelous campaign in which they have 
integrated the message themes very well said democratic 
consultant robert keefe 
mahe said it is just right to redirect reagans appearances 
where they might count the most 
youre sending your biggest guns into the biggest battles 
he said theres no surrogate bigger than ronald reagan

a flood has severely damaged one of 
the worlds greatest ancient cities and the libyan government has 
appealed for help in repairing the ruins of the onceglorious roman 
metropolis 
a torrent of water rushed over leptis magna about 75 miles east 
of tripoli in november after several days of heavy rains sent 
water over a dam three miles from the ancient trading center on the 
mediterranean coast 
for three days the rampaging river carried tons of dirt and 
uprooted vegetation through the ruins leaving mud yards deep in 
such remarkable areas as the roman emperor hadrians baths and one 
of two forums 
most heavily damaged was the colonnaded street a 400yardlong 
road on which visitors strolled from the bath complex to the 
ancient port much of the stone carriageway lined with more than 
200 marble columns with lotus designs broke under the weight of 
the floodwaters 
the port end of the street disappeared and is now covered by a 
small river near the heart of the ancient city the waters reduced 
the path to a jumble of stone blocks and columns fashioned from 
egyptian granite and italian marble 
only the ancient market theater and forum were spared the wrath 
of the flood 
sandro stucchi an italian archaeologist who surveyed the site 
estimated restoration would cost 33 million and take 10 years 
omar s almahgiub superintendent of the archeological district 
that includes leptis magna said the libyan government is hoping to 
restore the site with help from the un educational scientific 
and cultural organization 
we want to make an appeal to all people who love monuments 
said almahgiub looking at the weeds sprouting from several inches 
of sunbaked dirt covering the base of the basilicas pulpit 
almahgiub who was born in leptis and whose father was a 
caretaker of the site said libya would provide the personnel to do 
the manual work but doesnt have the technical expertise 
bekaddour ouldali of unesco in paris said the organization has 
asked italy which colonized libya until world war ii to provide 
funds for a archaeological supervisor preferably stucchi and has 
provided earthremoval equipment and a pump in case a flood strikes 
again 
an italian foreign ministry official manfredo incisa says his 
government is willing to help but is waiting for a more detailed 
report from unesco 
little is known outside libya about the disaster because libyas 
magnificent archaeological inheritance is not easily seen 
tourism per se doesnt exist in the state ruled by col moammar 
gadhafi a recent summer tuesday brought only about a dozen 
visitors to leptis magna almost all of them foreign diplomatic 
construction or oil employees 
in addition lovers of archaeology must step delicately in 
libya whose regime frequently rails against foreign imperialism 
for the more militant gadhafi supporters reminders of ancient 
colonialism like leptis magna are unwanted souvenirs to be 
destroyed 
italians began excavating the sprawling city about 1912 the 
same year the romebased government of dictator benito mussolini 
occupied libya which italy controlled until the arrival of the 
allied forces in 1943 
the flood halted dreams for extensive excavation of the harbor 
considered one of the best preserved in the ancient roman world and 
expected to yield many relics from leptis beginnings as a key 
phoenician port and later a prosperous roman city 
leptis was founded by seafaring phoenicians from carthage as a 
trading post in the first millennium bc as merchants developed a 
brisk business in ivory ebony slaves gold and precious stones 
from africa the site was established as a colony of carthage about 
the 7th or 6th century bc 
in 101 bc leptis became an ally of rome and its residents 
gained full rights of citizenship 
the city prospered during the reign of emperor septimius 
severus who was born here in ad 193 and whose arch of triumph 
greets visitors 
with the decline of the roman empire leptis eventually 
succumbed to the raids of germanic tribes that maintained a kingdom 
in north africa in the 5th century then to byzantine rule in the 
4th century and finally to an arab invasion in 642 
its name may derive from a phoenician combination li and 
bada meaning town at the edge of the desert magna 
meaning great in latin has been added to distinguish the town 
from another leptis in tunisia 
libyas rich collection of archaeological sites include 
prehistoric cave paintings in the south the ruins of a greek site 
called sabratha west of tripoli and various relics from the series 
of conquerors

here hes called mikki maus and the 
60yearold american has surprisingly good rapport with soviet 
youngsters for an international film star making his first live 
appearance in the soviet union 
sunday evening at moscows 2500seat rossiya theater with a 
police cordon worthy of a minor head of state outside the first 
soviet festival of walt disney animated classics opened with a 
showing of fantasia and a visit by mickey mouse himself 
standing about 5 foot 6 inches in his clunky black patent 
leather shoes mickey played by gabriella spieth from walt 
disneys west german office strolled waving down the theater aisle 
to the strains of heigh ho heigh ho its off to work we go 
in a juvenile version of the moscow superpower summit mickey 
was given a big hug and a keg of honey by misha the bear mascot of 
the 1980 moscow olympics 
the lights dimmed and the rossiyas screen filled with the 
image of donald duck in the 1941 short subject donalds crime 
in which he purloins the contents of a piggy bank to finance a 
nightclub outing with daisy then suffers pangs of conscience 
in a russianlanguage voiceover minus the squawking tones in 
which donald usually speaks in english french and other western 
languages the duck concluded crime does not pay 
there was delighted laughter and applause from the audience 
which included foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov and 
many other soviet vips and their families 
as well as fantasia which was first released in 1940 the 
disney animated films snow white and the seven drawfs 
bambi and 101 dalmatians will be shown to children and 
their parents in moscow leningrad and tallinn 
mickey is accompanied by a contingent of executives from the 
walt disney co here to investigate the business possibilities 
created by president mikhail s gorbachevs economic and social 
reforms which have also loosened controls on the media and the 
movies 
fantasia is almost 50 years overdue in coming to the soviet 
union roy e disney vice chairman of the disney company and 
nephew of its founder pioneer animator walt disney told the 
audience 
through the universal language of animation i feel we are 
taking one more step toward bringing our countries together he 
said 
disney and other company executives played down the business end 
of their trip but the tass news agency said they were talking with 
the soviets about cooperation in making and distributing films and 
in jointly building a wonderland a disneylandstyle theme park 
already planned for moscow 
the soviet union is virgin territory for the disney company and 
its enormous stocks of cartoons feature films and television 
shows characters like mickey donald chip and dale and other 
disney creations that are childhood companions of hundreds of 
millions in the west mean nothing to many soviets 
i dont know what mickey mouse is i have never seen him 
said dmitri bogdanov 3 who was brought to the rossiya by his 
mother varya only because she had seen disney cartoons on 
videocassettes and at a moscow movie theater that specializes in 
cartoons 
although mickey donald and their friends may not have instant 
name recognition in the soviet union yet their faces adorn 
tshirts badges childrens clothing and hundreds of other items 
made by cooperatives or sold on the black market 
mickeys creators do not get a single kopeck in royalties for 
such exposure 
according to sovietskaya rossiya the first disney cartoons were 
shown in the soviet union at the first moscow film festival in 
1935 the cartoons which included the three little pigs won an 
award 
sovietskaya rossiya a communist party organ that commonly 
devotes its news columns to weighty matters like the national grain 
harvest said disney is a remarkable master and a genius second 
to none 
who does not know for example his hero a little mouse named 
mickey who really became the first star of the world screen or 
his inseparable friends the shy cow clarabella with the langorous 
eyes a hottempered but handsome little duck donald a 
muddleheaded dog named goofy or a careful doggy named pluto

two men charged in a government 
corruption scheme were described by prosecutors as greedy crooks 
but defense lawyers say they are humanitarians who helped bring 
20th century progress to alaskas north slope 
lewis dischner 70 and carl mathisen 55 are charged with 
bribery extortion and other crimes stemming from their involvement 
with the north slope borough the eskimoled government for the 
vast northern region of alaska 
they are accused of scheming to influence the awarding of 
contracts during the boroughs 12 billion public works 
construction effort during the administration of borough mayor 
eugene brower from 1981 to 1984 the project included schools 
health clinics airports utilities and streets in the boroughs 
seven villages 
dischner worked as a lobbyist for the north slope borough while 
mathisen worked as a public works consultant to brower 
this is a case about fraud bribery kickbacks extortion and 
corruption said us attorney michael spaan as dischners and 
mathisens trial opened friday before a us district court jury 
testimony is expected to begin monday 
dischner and mathisen used their influence to defraud the 
borough of 21 million spann said and they were able to do it 
through brower the young and inexperienced mayor they helped elect 
this influence was based on friendship and trust and was 
cemented by bribery spaan said 
but dischners attorney douglas pope said the case was brought 
because the prosecution misunderstands the situation on the north 
slope 
the government is confused about the law he said and the 
duties that dischner had as lobbyist and adviser to brower and his 
public works program 
this is a case about a man lew dischner with a strong sense 
of values a strong sense of what is right being unfairly 
prosecuted for his strong commitment to his dream 
that dream said pope was that the inupiat eskimos of the north 
slope deserved the same basic standard of living and opportunity to 
work enjoyed by the rest of alaska and america 
life on the north slope was as savage as those of us would 
imagine it would be the weather was cruel there said laurence 
finegold mathisens attorney 
mathisen helped bring dramatic if expensive changes his 
attorney said 
im not saying the permafrost is flowing with milk and honey 
as a result of the work of carl mathisen and eugene brower but it 
is more livable now 
brower and other officials were also indicted as a result of a 
federal investigation into the public works program brower two of 
his administrators and two engineeers have pleaded guilty to 
various charges in a pleabargain arrangement and will testify for 
the prosecution 
dischner and mathisen are accused of bribing brower and other 
borough officials with boats cash clothing and a 45000 diamond 
ring demanding kickbacks totaling 9 million from six contractors 
doing business in the borough taking an additional 9 million 
through companies they themselves controlled and extorting 
additional money from other contractors

fourteen of the 23 members of the 
ruling politburo could be removed at a communist party meeting this 
week a politburo member said sunday 
the partys policysetting central committee gathers on monday 
for what is billed as a historic session that may include the most 
sweeping personnel changes in the communist party since it came to 
power after world war ii 
four members of the politburo have announced their intention to 
resign at mondays meeting 
they include two former heads of the party bosko krunic and 
milanko renovica franc setinc a leading communist from liberal 
northern slovenia and kolj siroka a senior ethnic albanian from 
the troubled province of kosovo 
politburo member vasil tupurkovski told reporters that 10 other 
politburo members also may be replaced 
the other nine members are party chiefs from each of 
yugoslavias six republics and two provinces and a representative 
of the armed forces 
they can be voted out of office only by the republican 
provincial and armed forces party organizations that elected them 
to the ruling body 
they include serbian communist party chief slobodan milosevic 
whose push for greater serbian control of its two provinces of 
vojvodina and kosovo has stirred up the current political crisis 
most political observers expect at least some serbs from the 
slav minority in kosovo to rally in belgrade outside the modern 
conference center where the communist party starts meeting at 9 
am on monday and is expected to last at least two days 
the changes to be made are in response to widespread calls from 
serbia and workers angered by government austerity measures for the 
resignation of top party leaders they see as inefficent and corrupt 
the criticism has touched even national party chief stipe suvar 
who clashed last week with milosevic and touched off a wave of 
requests from serbian party organizations for his resignation 
in the past two years 16 politburo members and 44 members of 
the central committee have come under fire in public tuporkovski 
said 
of the 165 members that comprise the central committee one has 
died and two have resigned since the body was last elected by the 
national communist party congress in 1986 leaving 162 members at 
present

vice president george bush said sunday hes ready 
to hit the ground running as president and to designate a 
cabinet swiftly but that he wont be lulled into regarding an 
election victory as inevitable 
there was speculation that i was dead three months ago the 
republican presidential nominee told reporters trying to discount 
recent polls showing him with a widening lead over democrat michael 
dukakis 
he vowed to wage a spirited battle against the massachusetts 
governor in key states right up to election day on nov 8 
bush scoffed at reports suggesting he had already decided on 
most of his prospective cabinet 
i am not going to do something that dumb and shift gears he 
said 
and yet should i win it would be a matter of urgent 
priority id want to be ready to move early on the priorities that 
ive established 
he said there is not one scintilla of overconfidence that he 
has all but won the election 
at his first news conference in more than two weeks bush said 
his election should drive interest rates down claimed that the 
irancontra affair was behind him and took aim at a familiar 
target harvard university 
theres an elite inside the elite there and everyone knows 
who im talking about bush said 
campaigning saturday in modesto calif bush said i dont 
wnat somebody from harvard telling me what i can do and what i 
cant do 
asked about that statement bush said he did not want to take on 
the institution itself asking how can i a nice guy from yale 
feel that way about harvard now come on 
im talking about a handful of people that have served in 
recent democratic administrations that come out of the same 
liberal philisophy and they know who they are he said 
dukakis is a harvard graduate and bush in the past has accused 
his rival of having a harvard yard boutique mentality 
while spending the day in denver visiting with his son neil 
and his family bush also attended a professional football game 
between the denver broncos and the atlanta falcons he planned to 
spend most of this week campaigning in the middle west on his 
return to washington from last thursdays presidential debate in 
los angeles 
in his meeting with reporters bush once again declined to say 
where he would make spending cuts to bring down the federal deficit 
under his flexible freeze plan to balance the budget by 1992 
although he has spelled out areas where he would spend more 
money including education child care and cleaning up the 
environment bush has said he would list corresponding spending 
cuts only if elected president 
his proposal calls for overall federal spending to be limited to 
the rate of inflation with specific cuts offsetting each new 
spending item 
bush conceded that for his scheme to work interest rates would 
have to decline by several percentage points from current levels 
a lot of the interest rates are psychological he said i 
believe they will come down 
he suggested that a bush presidency would send a calming message 
to world financial markets largely because they would see he had a 
deficitreduction plan that would work and that in turn would ease 
interest rates 
spokeswoman sheila tate was asked why markets would respond 
more favorably to the bush budget plan than they had to the reagan 
administrations past deficitreduction plans 
because he bush means it he means what he says ms tate 
said 
bush said that though he did not want to be premature he 
already has named a team headed by former navy undersecretary chase 
untermeyer to study the transition to a possible bush presidency 
he has drawn up wiring diagrams what we should do if we 
win bush said you have to hit the ground running 
there are no names or lists against these slots on the 
management wiring diagram i just cannot get diverted into thinking 
about that bush said 
he added were going to keep on with our original game plan 
keep working hard keep traveling to key states were going to 
keep moving forward all i know is to just drive right down to 
the wire 
bush also asserted that the irancontra affair was behind me 
as an election issue because most americans believe his insistence 
that he had no advance knowledge of the armsforhostages deals 
the vice president said that if elected he would put running 
mate dan quayle in charge of coordinating drug enforcement and 
other important assignments to show world leaders that bush has 
full confidence in the vice president

two boaters distracted by the colors of 
the fall foliage shot over a 40foot dam into the rushing overflow 
below where they were rescued by two fishermen authorities said 
they should have been killed but were lucky said deputy 
bill chandler of the hennepin county sheriffs department a lot 
of that had to do with two fisherman on the shore below the dam who 
went in with their boat and rescued them theyre heroes in my 
book 
don oestreich 57 of st louis park walked away relatively 
unscathed saturday bernice johnson 58 of minneapolis suffered 
bumps and bruises and received four stitches on her forehead 
don was driving and i was riding backwards because of the 
wind and the colors were gorgeous johnson said and when we 
noticed the warning signs it was just too late 
i think the first thing i thought was this is it my life 
might have flashed before me but i didnt have any time to think 
about it there was too much noise and water 
oestreichs 16foot aluminum fishing boat remained upright in 
the rushing waters of the mississippi river near the ford lock and 
dam and the couple was spotted and rescued by the fishermen 
ill tell you one thing theyre lucky theyre alive and lucky 
the boat landed the way it did because that could have been the 
end of it right there said steven holets one of the fishermen 
its so easy to capsize and drown there said deputy john 
nagan of the ramsey county sheriffs department a 40foot drop 
and the boat remained upright its just amazing 
oestreich said i was only on a quarter throttle but i 
managed to turn the boat to a right angle and sideways to the dam 
that was crucial because it saved me from nosing straight down

occupied west bank on sunday to prevent dozens of jewish settlers 
from choking major roads to protest palestinian violence 
hospital officials said an 18yearold arab died of wounds 
sustained in a clash with troops last week and an arab reporter 
said a 16yearold youth was shot in the abdomen during a clash in 
gaza city 
a spokesman for the hadassah hospital in jerusalem identified 
the dead youth as usama wasfi shalabi of the west bank village of 
atil 
in an arab village in northern israel police arrested a 
palestinian who shot and killed his landlords two sons and 
critically wounded their mother after the family refused to sell 
him an apartment police said 
a relative of the family said the landlord did not want to do 
business with refat odeh because he is a policeman in the occupied 
territories and a village elder accused odeh of collaborating with 
israeli authorities

march after they were accused by fellow arabs of collaborating with 
israeli authorities 
the incident saturday night took place in jaljoulya an israeli 
arab village bordering the west bank 
the army blocked settlers from protesting on two main west bank 
highways against increased palestinian attacks on jewish targets 
israel radio reported the action came a day after an israeli man 
was stabbed and wounded in the west bank city of jenin 
hundreds of soldiers mobilized at dawn and turned back dozens of 
cars driven by the jewish militants on roads linking the nablus and 
hebron to jerusalem military sources said 
near the ariel settlement outside nablus a group of settlers 
fired their guns into the air and smashed the windows of several 
arab vehicles before troops arrived at the scene and turned them 
away arab news reports said 
the army had no reports of shootings and said the troops kept 
roads open throughout the morning permitting palestinian laborers 
to travel to israel

west bank and said he would immediately call for an international 
middle east peace conference if he is named prime minister

against their will he said referring to the population of the 
west bank and gaza we must let them run their own lives

replied we have in mind to evacuate the gaza strip within an 
overall arrangement gaza will be demilitarized 
peres said he favored returning to the yearold us proposal 
for israel to negotiate with a jordanianpalestinian delegation 
through an international conference

into negotiations despite the kings statement this summer that he 
was breaking his ties with the west bank which jordan held from 
1948 until 1967 
peres opponent prime minister yitzhak shamir of the likud bloc 
opposes an international peace conference and wants a settlement in

democrats found inspiration sunday in the los 
angeles dodgers win in the first game of the world series saying 
that michael dukakis can still pull off a comefrombehind victory 
over republican george bush in the remaining three weeks of the 
presidential campaign 
i think were going to be like the dodgers last night said 
dukakis running mate lloyd bentsen it looked like they were down 
and out and all of a sudden they hit a home run and won it i 
think we can do that in the next 24 days 
bush alert to that possibility said that despite polls that 
show him widening his lead over dukakis were going to keep on 
with our original game plan keep working hard keep traveling to 
key states keep moving forward 
all i know is to just drive down to the wire the vice 
president said 
dukakis acknowledged in boston that he is entering the last leg 
of the long campaign as an underdog but advised republicans not to 
pop champagne corks too early because were going to be the ones 
celebrating on election night 
he said he will continue fighting for the values he believes in 
he said bush as vice president sat on the sidelines for eight 
years while america got beaten in world markets while they 
mortgaged our childrens future to a mountain of debt and a piece 
of america was being sold off every day at bargain basement 
prices 
the world series analogy was used by several democrats 
its an extremely close race said sen albert gore 
dtenn on abcs this week with david brinkley 
youre going to see mike dukakis come on like kirk gibson in 
the bottom of the ninth inning last night in that game with two 
outs he could barely walk around the base path but he knocked 
a home run to win the game gore said 
the dodgers beat the oakland athletics 54 in that first game 
of the series 
bush told reporters in denver that he already has a team 
studying the transition to a bush presidency and that he is ready 
to name his cabinet quickly former navy undersecretary chase 
untermeyer heads the bush transition team 
he has drawn up wiring diragrams what we should do if we 
win bush said you have to hit the ground running 
the vice president however scoffed at suggestions that he 
already had decided on most of the cabinet members he would choose 
bentsen appearing on cbstvs face the nation said the 
democratic ticket has been the target of character assassination by 
bush and his running mate dan quayle 
we were subjected to what i think was the most demagogic 
attack that ive ever seen at the presidential level bentsen 
said to talk about question the patriotism of mike dukakis is 
outrageous but thats what they did and thats wrong and we 
must not let them win on that kind of basis 
the dukakis camp was trying to put the best face on what many 
perceived as a clear bush victory in last thursdays debate with 
dukakis 
dukakis adviser robert beckel said on the abc program that 
theres a lot of time left in this race theres a lot of 
volatility in the electorate and i find it amazing that all of 
these people are writing this race off 
but ed rollins a republican strategist said that over the 
last three months george bush has made the sale he has convinced 
the american public that he has the strength and the ability to 
lead this country 
said rollins its just a question now of getting the voters 
to the polls on election day 
according to a published report dukakis plans to concentrate in 
the three weeks left before the nov 8 election on 18 states with 
272 electoral votes two more than needed for election to pound 
home basic economic themes and to make bushs campaign style an 
issue itself 
the dukakis campaign vehemently denied the account by the 
washington post in sundays editions 
we are not writing off whole regions of the country said 
campaign manager susan estrich were very very competitive in a 
large numbers of states 
communications director leslie dach said he thought the use of 
18 states by the post was misleading and said the newspapers 
grouping of states does not represent where the campaign will 
concentrate its resources 
those 18 states according to the post are new york 
pennsylvania ohio michigan illinois and california the new 
england states of massachusetts connecticut vermont and rhode 
island maryland west virginia and the district of columbia in the 
midatlantic region iowa and wisconsin in the midwest and oregon 
washington and hawaii in the west 
in those states the post said dukakis managers believe the 
democratic nominee is either favored or competitive with bush 
their list gives priority attention to montana north and south 
dakota colorado new mexico missouri and kentucky where they 
believe the massachusetts governor is trailing but competitive 
the bush campaign according to the new york times will 
concentrate on california michigan ohio and illinois regarded as 
close 
meanwhile dukakis picked up editorial support sunday from the 
st petersburg fla times which said bush is running on a 
platform which would perpetuate too much injustice and the deeds 
and examples of his campaign have been anything but inspirational 
the newspaper which recommends candidates rather than endorsing 
them also criticized bushs choice of quayle as his running mate 
dukakis chose a man bush chose a boy the newspaper said 
either bush has delusions of immortality or he simply does not 
care into whose incompetent hands his untimely death or disability 
would deliver the nation neither explanation speaks well of his 
own fitness for the presidency 
in vermont a random telephone survey for the sunday rutland 
herald and barremontpelier times argus indicated a 43 percent to 
42 percent lead for bush over dukakis the random telephone survey 
of 502 registered voters had a margin of error of 45 percent

vietnam said sunday that it will 
complete its planned withdrawal of 50000 military personnel from 
cambodia on schedule in december 
that would leave about 50000 vietnamese troops in cambodia 
vietnam has said it will remove all of its military forces from 
the neighboring country by 1990 
the beginning of the formal withdrawal was conducted at a 
ceremony in june when vietnam announced the withdrawal of its 
military command and some 13000 soldiers 
it said other army units left cambodia in july august and 
september 
a joint communique issued sunday by vietnam and the 
vietnameseinstalled cambodian government said 
the remaining units will be withdrawn monthly from now to the 
end of 1988 and the last contingent of the 50000 volunteers to be 
withdrawn in 1988 will be repatriated by land and water during the 
month of december 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 ousted the radical 
communist khmer rouge regime and installed another communist 
government communist forces defeated usbacked governments in 
vietnam and cambodia in the spring of 1975 
the joint communique carried by the official vietnam news 
agency welcomed representatives of foreign countries 
international agencies and news organizations to observe the final 
stage of the first half of the withdrawal plan 
the united nations is expected to pass again this year for the 
10th consecutive year a resoludion demanding the pullout of all 
vientmaese troops from cambodia but a new element in the draft of 
this years resolution calls for effective international 
supervision and control of the withdrawal 
more than 1 million cambodians were killed during the harsh rule 
of the khmer rouge and there is widespread fear that the khmer 
rouge will regain power if vietnam pulls all of its forces out of 
the country 
the khmer rouge began a guerrilla campaign after it was ousted 
in 1978 and has the strongest military force in a coalition of 
groups fighting the vietnamese and cambodian grovernment troops

destroyed police in killini reported 
streets are filled with rubble and plaster and theres lots of 
broken glass from shattered shop windows everywhere said a 
police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
police on zakinthos said the quake caused landslides in the 
islands hills western greece has been hit by several quakes 
during the past month and two days ago one registering 5 on the

killing 400 people and destroying thousands of homes after that 
most buildings on the islands were contructed to resist tremors of 
up to 7 on the richter scale 
the scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake as 
measured by the ground motion recorded on seismographs each 
increase by one number means a tenfold increase in ground motion a 
quake registering 6 can cause severe demage while one recorded at 7 
is consdered a major quake capable of widespread heavy damage

an expected purge of the communist 
party leadership will at best be only a start in trying to ease 
yugoslavias worst crisis since world war ii 
the party central committee meets monday to argue and approve 
what are billed as the most sweeping personnel changes in more than 
four decades in power 
a politburo member said sunday that 14 of the 23 members of the 
ruling politburo may be removed at the meeting of the policymaking 
central committee 
four have announced their intention to resign and politburo 
member vasil tupurkovski told reporters 10 others may be replaced 
however radical the changes are at mondays meeting they will 
be only a stage in what one bestselling writer and dissident 
called the long agony of breaking with founding father josip 
tito 
tito dominated yugoslavia for 35 years ruling supreme until he 
died in may 1980 his portrait still hangs in almost every public 
room in the country and is carried fondly by some of the serbian 
nationalists who have staged mass rallies throughout southern and 
eastern yugoslavia in recent months 
their devotion to tito is in some ways ironic since they hope 
to restructure the ineffective political system tito bequeathed his 
nation their demand for greater serbian control over the serbian 
republics two autonomous provinces of vojvodina and kosovo 
prompted the current political crisis 
serbian communist party leader slobodan milosevic has skillfully 
exploited the mass rallies he has achieved national prominence on 
the wave of indignation serbs feel about the alleged harassment of 
their fellow christian slavs in kosovo the ancient serbian kingdom 
that is now dominated by ethnic albanians who are mainly moslem 
in exploiting the rallies milosevic has broken the order laid 
down by tito who gave broad autonomy to yugoslavias six republics 
and two provinces and annually rotated national offices among them 
to prevent one region from dominating the others 
milosevics drive has alarmed nonserbian communist leaders who 
fear the nations largest ethnic group wants greater control over 
yugoslav affairs 
yet they cannot ignore his popularity in serbia and the broader 
appeal of his calls for changes in the aging and sometimes 
ineffective ruling elite 
on television and in newspaper columns last week leaders 
engaged in an unprecedented public dispute over which leaders from 
which region will stand or fall when the central committee replaces 
up to onethird of its 165 members at mondays meeting 
in these circumstances it is easier to teach a whale to play 
the tambourine than to carry out the personnel changes commented 
the belgrade daily borba 
the ethnic arguments are only part of yugoslavias problem 
unwise borrowing in the 1970s and the lack of a strong federal 
government to manage the economy have led to economic crisis with 
the foreign debt at 21 billion and annual inflation at 217 percent 
living standards have fallen by onehalf since 1980 and 
austerity measures adopted in may have slashed salaries while 
prices continue to rise 
striking workers have taken to the streets in increasing 
numbers prompting the alarmed government to seek permission from 
the international monetary fund to relax the austerity program 
the ethnic and economic arguments sometimes obscure the growing 
calls to abandon oneparty rule and staterun economic management 
the corruption in each yugoslav republic angers the impoverished 
workers and the verbose and tangled communist jargon that 
surrounds most political pronouncements annoys even communists 
themselves 
after watching members of the national party politburo and the 
kosovo leadership debate for seven hours in kosovos capital 
pristina on tuesday the party leadership of the serbian town of 
titovo uzice commented if the debate at mondays meeting is 
dominated by the tenor of the one in pristina then it had 
better be canceled 
this frustration indicates the pressure for change in 
yugoslavia but writer dobrica cosic a wartime hero and former 
communist purged by tito in 1968 predicts that rearranging its 
political system will be a long agony for decades we have 
lived in a false situation cosic said in an interview false 
standards a false economy a false unity a false freedom at 
some moment the potentials of that fiction are exhausted and that 
moment is approaching

a leningrad newspaper printed the photo of a local 
prostitute that it said was the first soviet citizen to die of 
aids the official tass news agency reported sunday 
the news agency reported soviet authorities also wanted the 
picture to be printed in finland newspapers because it claimed the 
womans last customers were finns there was no immediate response 
from finish authorities 
tass identified the victim as olga gayevskaya 29 and said she 
died sept 5 in the leningrad institute of refresher training for 
physicians it said the cause of death was confirmed as aids 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the womans picture was printed saturday by the leningradskaya 
pravda newspaper with a warning to any leningraders who had had sex 
with her that she was carrying aids 
it urged those people to report immediately to the citys aids 
testing center which the report said is open 24 hours a day to 
administer anonymous tests 
tass said the photograph was published on the demands of 
leningradskaya pravda readers and following heated debate among 
medics lawyers and the police that it should be reprinted by 
newspapers in neighboring finland 
it is finnish tourists who have been of late the most frequent 
clients of the prostitute tass said 
the agency said ms gayevskaya sought medical help complaining 
of persistent colds and a weight loss of 26 pounds and she was 
hospitalized in august with pneumonia 
soviet authorities once maintained aids was an exclusively 
western problem linked to the moral decline of capitalist 
countries but in the last two years health officials have said 
the disease is a serious threat although they say the number of 
cases is far lower than in the west 
tass said aza rakhmanova leningrads chief specialist on 
infectious diseases reported tests on tens of thousands of people 
showed 24 leningrad residents including nine soviet citizens were 
carrying the aids virus 
what is particularly deplorable is that one of them is a 
6yearold girl who contracted the disease from her mother the 
agency said 
aids is an incurable disease in which a virus attacks the bodys 
immune system leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of 
infections and cancers 
it is most often transmitted through sexual contact other means 
of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood 
products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or 
syringes by drug abusers aids can also be passed from mother to 
child at or before birth

with a tap of his hand mexican matador manuel 
espinosa symbolically killed an 842pound bull drawing a chorus of 
ole at a bloodless bullfight sunday 
his sword had a velcro tip and the bulls horns had been clipped 
to eliminate any possibility of bloodshed from man or beast but 
the bullfight still prompted efforts by city officials and animal 
rights activists to halt what they claim is an inhumane activity 
outside the international amphitheatre about 30 members of 
transspecies unlimited an animal rights group marched with 
picket signs to protest the bullfight the second in six weeks as 
a mariachi band hired by the organizers entertained arriving 
spectators 
kay sievers director of the groups chicago chapter said 
bloodless bullfighting is banned in 43 states and should be 
prohibited in illinois bloodless bullfights are staged in parts of 
california texas and annually in dodge city kan 
its just another form of animal abuse and exploitation 
and we are trying to prevent it she said we have nothing 
against latino culture this is not a racial or a cultural issue 
but an ethical issue 
homero alvarado the head of meda a hispanic selfhelp 
organization that cosponsored the exhibition defended 
bullfighting as an important part of hispanic culture dating back 
to the middle ages 
why dont they stop the rodeo or the circus or the pigs 
fighting with a man at the state fair in springfield which are 
crueler to animals said alvarado 
alvarado said the organizers spent about 150000 to stage the 
event including legal fees and the cost of bringing in six 
professional matadors from mexico and six californiabred bulls 
any profits will be used to buy food and christmas toys for poor 
mexican families in chicago he said the bulls were to be 
slaughtered to provide meat for medas food bank program 
alvarado said his group would like to sponsor six to eight mock 
bullfights a year in chicago and similar shows in texas new york 
and other states with large hispanic populations 
but peter f poholik executive director of the citys 
commission on animal control and care said he was determined to 
make this the last bullfight in chicago 
in korea they eat dogs in puerto rico they fight cocks do 
we want to do this in chicago asked poholik theres a long 
list of animal exploitation among different cultures and we 
dont want to expand it 
poholik said he was pleased only about 200 people turned up at 
the 9000seat amphitheatre for the first of two bullfight shows 
sunday 
the citys first bloodless bullfights were held on sept 3 at an 
outdoor arena over poholiks objections and drew about 1100 people 
cook county circuit court judge albert green granted permission 
to stage the fights ruling that the confrontations were no more 
cruel than rodeos which the city allows and that the citys 
animal cruelty law is vague 
poholik said city attorneys were drawing up a proposed city 
ordinance banning the bullfights

makeshift key during their transfer in a prison bus oct 8 and fled 
with a loaded pistol seven prisoners have been recaptured or 
surrendered 
saturday night four fugitives armed with the pistol and knives 
raided the home of ko yongsoo a 50yearold office worker in 
northwestern seoul and held kos wife four daughters and a son 
hostage 
ko returned home early sunday but said he escaped and called 
police after the drunken guards fell asleep more than 500 armed 
policemen immediately sealed off the house and antiterror units 
huddled under the walls 
during their confrontation with police the prisoners fired 
several shots threatening the lives of hostages they ignored 
appeals from their relatives to surrender but released kos wife 
and 11yearold son 
shortly after noon sunday there were several minutes of screams 
and gunfire and police rushed into the house one prisoner was 
dragged out and another bleeding from his neck and body was taken

frightened many seoul residents although they did not hurt anyone 
held the escapees each sentenced to seven years or more for 
murder rape or robbery often told hostages they had escaped 
because their sentences were too harsh

the president of the world jewish congress on 
sunday began a threeday visit to east berlin where he is to 
discuss an east german offer to pay reparations to jewish victims 
of the nazi holocaust 
edgar m bronfman arrived in a private jet and was greeted by 
deputy foreign minister kurt nier at east berlins schoenefeld 
airport 
later at his hotel room he told the associated press he 
believed the east german leadership was sincere in offering 
reparations but he could not provide details 
judging from the reception at the airport and the schedule 
that has been put forth im optimistic he said 
of course there has to be some earnest money but i have said 
the money is a token thing what is at stake here is moral 
culpability 
i am the first world jewish congress president to visit east 
germany he added i think this is good for eastwest 
relations 
east germanys communist authorities said in june the government 
was willing to provide humanitarian aid to jewish survivors of 
the holocaust but they gave few details and there have been 
negotiations on the amount and methods of payment 
jewish leaders in west berlin have said east germany is 
considering paying up to 100 million 
west germany signed an agreement in 1952 with the new yorkbased 
world jewish congress to compensate holocaust victims and their 
relatives and since then has provided about 48 billion 
bronfman is to meet monday with east german leader erich 
honecker 
an agreement for east germany to pay reparations would mark a 
major change by the government 
east germany has argued it bears no reponsibility for nazi 
atrocities because the nation was not founded until 1949 when the 
victorious world war ii allies acknowledged the division of germany 
into east and west 
it also has taken the stand that both communists and jews were 
victims of the nazis 
bronfmans arrival was the top item in east germanys staterun 
news media the official adn news agency also carried a lengthy 
article about the opening of an exhibit devoted to the history of 
jews in germany and their persecution by the nazis

voters in half a dozen states face an eclectic mix of tax 
measures nov 8 from a steep hike in cigarette taxes to tax cuts 
reminiscent of californias decadeold proposition 13 
but there are signs the antitax fever that gripped the nation 
after californians enacted proposition 13 in june 1978 has cooled 
as inflation has eased the economy has improved and taxpayers no 
longer feel so squeezed 
only in south dakota utah and colorado will voters decide 
issues this november that would force deep cuts in taxes 
voters are protecting what exists but not going further and 
in some cases it looks like the electorate is willing to approve 
more so than in the 70s or early 80s very specific taxes for 
specific purposes said patrick mcguigan editor of the free 
congress initiative and referendum report a monthly newsletter 
published in washington 
californians for example will consider a measure to raise 
cigarette taxes by 25 cents a pack using proceeds to promote 
health 
the tax revolt peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s when 
voters passed taxlimiting measures in massachusetts missouri and 
washington and 21 state legislatures enacted taxing or spending 
limits according to the national conference on state legislatures 
in denver 
some key tax issues facing voters this november 
south dakota dakota proposition ii would roll back property 
taxes on agricultural property to 1 percent of 1984 values and 25 
percent on nonagricultural property in stages by 1991 it would 
limit increases in property valuations to 2 percent a year local 
governments could impose special taxes if twothirds of the voters 
approve 
supporters argue the state overrelies on property taxes and 
never lived up to promises to reform taxes after a similar ballot 
proposal was rejected in 1980 
opponents including gov george mickelson cite a university of 
south dakota study that warns that local governments stand to lose 
from 18 million to 112 million a year and that schools would be 
hardest hit 
colorado having survived legal challenges amendment 6 the 
socalled taxpayers bill of rights amendment will appear on nov 8 
ballots it would require voters to decide all future tax increases 
except in emergencies would cut the income tax by about 10 percent 
and would limit residential property taxes to 1 percent of market 
value 
gov roy romer said the measure would be like throwing a 
bomb at state government he and other political and business 
leaders who oppose the issue say it would cut state revenues by 65 
million in the first year and 130 million the second 
utah voters face three tax initiatives that together would 
reduce state and local revenues by 329 million one would limit 
property taxes a second would roll back 1987 tax hikes on income 
sales gasoline and cigarettes and a third would give tax credits 
for private education 
a poll this month forecast an uphill battle for the initiatives 
which are opposed by republican gov norm bangerter his democratic 
challenger ted wilson and a wide range of agriculture education 
and wildlife groups 
california a tobacco industryled coalition has spent 10 
million to defeat proposition 99 which would boost cigarette taxes 
for the first time since 1967 from 10 cents to 35 cents a pack 
opponents call it an unfair tax that would trigger a wave of 
cigarette smuggling 
the measure which could raise 600 million a year would 
finance antismoking programs in schools medical care for the 
uninsured and tobaccorelated medical research 
it is backed by a variety of medical and health care groups as 
well as the american cancer society and the american lung 
association 
arkansas the fair tax amendment backed by gov bill 
clinton would make it easier for the legislature to enact personal 
income tax increases income tax increases currently require a 75 
percent majority vote in the legislature the amendment would lower 
that to 60 percent the state has had an income tax since 1929 but 
it has been raised only once in history in 1971 
antitax activists have filed a lawsuit challenging the 
amendment and representatives of some business groups oppose the 
idea of making income tax increases easier 
but clinton said that if the amendment passes the state will 
still be one of the hardest states in the country to raise a tax 
in 
nevada question 9 on the ballot seeks to impose a 
constitutional ban on personal income taxes even though the state 
does not have one the gaming industry is backing the measure on 
the theory that if new taxes ever became necessary the measure 
would force the legislature to look for other ways to spread the 
tax burden through corporate income taxes as well as existing 
property sales and gamingrelated taxes 
they argue existing state taxes place too big a burden on the 
gambling industry while other forms of industry have relatively 
light tax loads

the leader of lebanons main christian 
militia has tightened his grip on power in lebanons beleaguered 
christian enclave with the aid of iraq and reportedly israel as 
well 
but samir geagea faces trouble with syria which blames him for 
a political crisis that threatens to formally partition lebanon and 
scuttle syrias hopes of controlling its unruly neighbor 
syria is also alarmed at political and military support for the 
christians from iraq its archrival in the arab world after the 
aug 20 ceasefire in the iraqiran war 
geagea a 38yearold maronite catholic sabotaged parliamentary 
efforts to elect a successor to president amin gemayel before his 
sixyear term expired sept 23 
he opposed damascusbacked christian candidates who he said 
would turn lebanon into a syrian satellite if elected under an 
unwritten law since lebanon became independent from the french in 
1943 lebanons president has been a christian 
geageas heavily armed lebanese forces militia with about 6000 
hardcore fighters and 30000 reservists this month took over 
gemayels 3500man militia and his news outlets and confined him 
to his east beirut home 
geagea a former medical student was left as the undisputed 
leader of the christian enclave home to about 800000 christians 
moslems make up about 55 percent of lebanons population 
beirut newspapers have reported the israelis who occupy a 
border strip in south lebanon sent geagea a shipload of weapons 
through beiruts militiacontrolled port last month 
there has been no independent confirmation but the israelis 
have aided geagea in the past 
uri lubrani who coordinates israeli policy on lebanon has said 
on israel radio that israel was not involved in lebanon outside the 
border buffer zone but stressed it has an immediate and 
fundamental interest in what happens in lebanon israel is a 
partner in the game 
iraq enraged syria by recognizing the christian government of 
army commander gen michel aoun who gemayel named as caretaker 
prime minister rather than the rival moslem cabinet of acting 
prime minister salim hoss both cabinets now claim they are 
lebanons legitimate government until a new president is elected 
informed arab sources said iraq has shipped the christians 
ammunition rocket launchers and usmade armored personnel 
carriers captured from iran some have been seen in christian east 
beirut 
geagea who has gained supremacy in bloody showdowns with his 
rivals over the last three years has survived a dozen 
assassination attempts as syria sought to impose its will on the 
christians 
lebanese moslem and leftist officials who visited syrian 
president hafez assad in damascus said he raged when geagea usurped 
gemayel 
tishrin the syrian government daily accused the geagea 
group of preventing lebanon from achieving a constitutional 
presidential election and seeking the partition of lebanon 
it warned that syria will not allow any partition situation to 
be imposed 
but after a 13year civil war lebanon is a state in name only 
the syrians the main power broker in lebanon want to impose a 
settlement through the election of a christian ally who would 
reduce the christians traditional privileges and give the majority 
moslems an equal share of political power 
but geagea and other rightwing christians who have seen their 
people driven out of the chouf mountains and the coastal plain 
south of beirut into the shrunken 390squaremile enclave reject 
any surrender of political power 
geagea favors a federal arrangement with the moslems who with 
the syrians control about 70 percent of lebanon 
he has forged an alliance of expediency with aoun another 
maronite but how long that will last is questionable the two men 
long have distrusted each other and their forces have skirmished 
repeatedly over the last three years 
aoun 53 believes that some understanding must be reached with 
the syrians if only to get them out of lebanon 
syria has an estimated 40000 troops in lebanon mostly in 
moslem areas 
like the israelis and the americans syria has learned that 
intervening militarily in lebanon can be costly in 1976 it tried 
to quell the civil war and wound up battling the christians 
but with geageas power swelling and outside powers using the 
christians to thwart syrian ambitions syrias room to maneuver is 
diminishing

the official arbitrator in intraorder disputes

hundreds of rioting students burned 
furniture and clashed with police in a second night of homecoming 
weekend violence that resulted in 50 arrests by officers clad in 
riot gear police said sunday 
at least six people including a police officer and a person 
found in a trash carrier were treated at a hospital for minor 
injuries suffered saturday night and early sunday said hospital 
nursing supervisor patricia anderson 
as many as 1500 people including many st cloud state 
university students were involved in the rioting in a fourblock 
area on friday and saturday nights assistant police chief jim 
moline said 
students set off firecrackers and some played the beatles song 
revolution on a stereo as police swept through the crowd 
estimated at about 700 people saturday night other people tore 
down street signs and jumped on cars or threw beer bottles and 
pieces of lumber 
about 60 officers including some from the state patrol and 
neighboring counties shot tear gas to disperse the crowd and made 
46 arrests most on misdemeanor charges of unlawful conduct or 
criminal damage to property moline said 
after a lull of a few hours 150 officers were sent in early 
sunday to break up crowds of 150 to 200 people some of whom had 
set fire to furniture and a trash carrier that had been dragged 
into the street moline said 
its like a battle between the police and the students said 
karen jacobs the managing editor of the student newspaper the 
university chronicle who watched the disturbance from her 
dormitory room 
the riots broke out in the midst of homecoming celebrations by 
the schools 16400 students witnesses said the problems began 
when officers tried to break up loud parties and fights 
the catalyst for this whole thing was a lot of young people 
with a lot of booze in them moline said theyre not 
experienced enough with alcohol and they just go kind of crazy 
moline said that in his 31 years on the police force the 
weekends violence could be topped only by demonstrations against 
the vietnam war in the 1960s 
student randy ridenour 23 of minneapolis said officers backed 
off several times saturday night to avoid a potentially disastrous 
confrontation 
it was mob mentality he said 
many people had been drinking heavily and were enjoying the 
havoc he said a lot of kids thought they were being cool and 
funny the students were acting stupid 
some of the handful of people arrested friday night probably 
will be charged with felony assault for throwing beer bottles and 
the arrests sunday morning will result in several more misdemeanor 
charges moline said thirtyfour of the 50 people arrested were 
university students 
university president brendan mcdonald said he would appoint a 
task force to investigate the violence and met with school 
officials to discuss the situation further

about 100 demonstrators gathered outside a jail 
sunday to protest what they said was the refusal of the city to let 
a jailed roman catholic priest celebrate mass 
the rev norman weslin of colorado springs colo was one of 
more than 300 people arrested oct 4 at three atlanta abortion 
clinics on the first day of a week of antiabortion protests 
sundays demonstration was in the form of an ecumenical church 
service led by catholic priests and protestant ministers 
the ministers some of whom were jailed during the 
demonstrations or a similar series of sitins and protests last 
summer said the alleged refusal was a serious breach of freedom of 
religion 
weslin is one of the about nine protesters who remain in jail 
mostly because of refusal to sign a bail bond or to give their true 
identities 
weslin said in a statement read to the group that he has been in 
solitary confinement since he tried to celebrate mass for prisoners 
oct 11 he denied a city claim that he was forcing the mass on 
people and blocking passageways 
he also rejected a city argument that he is free to leave jail 
at any time 
i cannot in good conscience pay a bail bond for attempting 
to save a childs life if i am released on my own recognizance i 
will leave here said weslin who said he is on a fast of coffee 
and water 
more than 1200 people have been arrested since the protests 
began july 19 at atlanta abortion clinics the protests have been 
organized by the new yorkbased operation rescue 
in san antonio texas police arrested 45 people who blocked 
entrances to an abortion clinic saturday 
we dont want to telegraph our punches but we want people to 
know this isnt a fleeting fad said jack devault head of life 
support services and one of the coordinators of saturdays 
demonstration 
all those arrested outside the clinic were charged with criminal 
trespass a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and

youth gangs are americas terrorists 
and the greatest challenge facing the nations police chiefs said 
the head of the international association of chiefs of police 
gangs have taken over entire sections of major cities and 
are spreading to the streets in smaller cities said joe casey 
chief of the nashville police department i dont know of any 
terrorist group thats done that 
casey is president of the assocation which officially opened it 
annual convention in portland on sunday 
between 5000 and 7000 top law enforcement officials from the 
united states and 43 countries are expected to attend the 
convention which runs through thursday 
speakers include us attorney general richard thornburgh fbi 
director william sessions and john c lawn head of the federal 
drug enforcement administration 
participants at a convention workshop on saturday said law 
enforcement officials need to cooperate with community leaders and 
educators in the fight against gangs 
its the shortterm efforts like gang sweeps that get a 
lot of attention said bernard c parks deputy police chief in 
los angeles but its the active role of communities that can 
help 
there have to be a good number of changes in the schools and 
in adult education he said the responsibility has to be 
spread to all areas 
parks said los angeles police had on file names of some 26000 
gang members more than double the number in the 1970s 
nevertheless parks said his city is unwilling to shoulder the 
blame for the spread of gang violence 
many communities that experience the gang problem find it all 
too convenient to blame it on los angeles said parks there is 
a lot of mimicking by kids in different places it doesnt 
necessarily mean they come from los angeles

unseasonably heavy rain in the cascade mountains 
flooded rivers throughout western washington state chasing about 
45 people from homes and a campground on sunday 
rain was tapering off late sunday but more was predicted monday 
night and early tuesday with the approach of another storm system 
the national weather service said 
red cross volunteers fed and arranged shelter for 30 people 
evacuated from trailers in the snoqualmie river campground in the 
cascade foothills said spokeswoman hope tuttle 
some of the campground occupants lost everything they had with 
them komotv reported 
about 15 people apparently were staying with relatives after 
being evacuated by boat sunday morning from houses in sultan a 
town of about 1500 residents in forest land 30 miles northeast of 
seattle said judy campbell a dispatch supervisor for the 
snohomish county sheriffs office 
floodwaters from the skykomish river closed five roads in the 
area she said 
the snoqualmie skagit and stillaguamish rivers also reached 
flood stage at upper elevations sunday the weather service 
reported a flood warning for the nooksack river was canceled late 
sunday 
heavy rain washed enough logging debris down the skagit river to 
cause a partial dam to form at a burlington northern railroad 
bridge but no major problems were anticipated said tom sheahan 
management director of the skagit county department of emergency 
services 
several logging roads were temporarily washed out and hanson 
creek flooded but damage was minimal and no evacuations were 
required he added 
several roads were closed in the cascade foothills east of 
seattle because of flooding around snoqualmie falls said rochelle 
ogershok of the king county department of public works some 
sandbagging was done in the north bend area nearly 30 miles east 
of seattle but no evacuations were required there she said 
floods usually follow warm rains on a late fall or winter 
snowpack but heavy rain over the weekend in the cascades was 
enough by itself to send rivers over their banks she said 
during the 48 hours up to 5 pm sunday the weather service 
reported 164 inches of rain in bellingham 139 in olympia and 
104 at seattletacoma international airport more than 6 inches of

department has mismanaged nuclear weapons reactors has passed a 
law to put them under standards nearly as stringent as those 
applied to reactors used to produce electricity 
some lawmakers however believe even tougher legislation is 
needed in the wake of the energy departments acknowledgement that 
its aging reactors at the savannah river plant near aiken sc 
have experienced problems and that other plants have spewed 
radioactivity into the environment 
the main difficulty is that the department of energy has been 
its own policeman said rep john spratt dsc one of the 
authors of a bill passed in september creating the defense nuclear 
facilities board to monitor the operation of weapons reactors 
the board yet to be appointed by the president has the 
authority to inspect the facilities at which the energy department

negotiators for caterpillar inc and the 
united auto workers union remained locked in labor talks past a 
sunday strike deadline as 17500 bluecollar workers in five states 
awaited word from the bargaining table 
no strike was called as both sides tried to find common ground 
and avoid a walkout 
there has been a little bit of movement and that small 
movement is enough to warrant continuing the talks said karl 
mantyla uaw spokesman at the site of the talks in a bridgeton 
mo hotel near st louis 
were going to remain flexible to see if that leads us in the 
direction we want to go negotiations are continuing we cant 
predict how long its going to go he added 
mantyla described the talks as an hourbyhour situation and 
said the labor contract was not extended past the 930 am sunday 
deadline 
caterpillar spokesman mark polzin said he had nothing to add to 
mantylas statement 
the contract between peoriabased caterpillar and the uaw 
originally was scheduled to expire at midnight sept 30 but the 
two sides agreed to extend talks indefinitely pending the outcome 
of talks between the union and deere amp co 
deere and the uaw settled without a work stoppage when the two 
sides agreed to a threeyear contract that included a 3 percent pay 
increase boosts in retirement benefits and greater job security 
it was the first general pay raise for deere workers since 1981 
and the union hoped to use the deere contract as a pattern for its 
caterpillar talks 
caterpillar workers were poised to strike factories and 
warehouses at 12 cities in illinois iowa pennsylvania colorado 
and tennessee 
negotiations started aug 4 between the union and caterpillar 
the worlds largest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment with 
58800 employees in several countries 
union representatives had asked the company for merit pay 100 
percent job security a reduction in overtime and the recall of 
1000 laid off uaw members they also sought an early retirement 
program and an increase in pension benefits for those on early 
retirement 
the union reportedly was seeking a threeyear pact and a 3 
percent wage increase in each year of the contract 
in past talks caterpillar officials have sought more flexibility 
in job assignments and scheduling as well as a simplified 
grievance procedure and new guidelines for overtime 
the average factory worker at caterpillar earns 1461 an hour 
or 30388 annually for a 40hour week with fringe benefits 
caterpillar calculates its current labor costs at 26 an hour per 
employee 
in 1986 negotiations between the two sides were extended four 
times before a settlement was reached

faced more than 17000 personal injury claims in the billions of

challenge to manvilles reorganization plan virtually assuring the 
companys emergence from protection from its creditors under 
chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code the plan calls for establishing 
certain trusts to settle claims of asbestos health victims 
with our strong operating performance and solid balance sheet

refrigerators irons washing machines and a host 
of other electric appliances have vanished from moscow stores 
partly because production has stagnated amid rising demand a 
soviet newspaper reported sunday 
the article in trud the labor daily was the latest in a series 
of recent exposes on what the soviets call deficits the 
disappearance of goods from stores muscovites are now coping with 
deficits on hardtofind products ranging from razor blades to 
detergent 
president mikhail s gorbachev has said improving the array of 
goods and services available to soviet consumers is necessary to 
show that his economic reform plan has taken root but problems 
with both quality and quantity are still rife 
the trud report said that in some cases soviets are now buying 
10 irons at a time when they appear on the market out of fear of 
future shortages 
t korobkov the head of a research institute on consumer 
demand told the paper that rumors of a pending price rise linked 
to gorbachevs reforms had triggered a buying boom 
people have rushed to buy vacuum cleaners and refrigerators in 
reserve before they rise in price korobkov said he also said 
economic cooperatives were buying up to 20 percent of some 
products apparently also contributing to shortages 
production of many electric appliances has also stagnated trud 
said the number of refrigerators produced is in a frozen 
state the paper noted last year about the same number were 
built as in 1980 
trud said that of the 315000 refrigerators needed to satisfy 
the anticipated demand in moscow this year orders had only been 
filled for 186300 
the capital received 258000 vacuum cleaners instead of the 
540000 needed and only 804000 irons instead of the more than 1 
million required trud said

saudi arabian oil minister hisham 
nazer called for solidarity to bring us all good as he opened a 
meeting sunday with five other members of the gulf cooperation 
council 
the ministers statement carried by the official saudi press 
agency said that low oil prices brought on by overproduction 
require joint action to bring prosperity to our nation and 
countries 
the report did not outline what plan nazer might present during 
the meeting called to forge a joint strategy to help opec prop up 
deteriorating oil prices 
four of the six gcc members saudi arabia kuwait qatar and 
the united arab emirates are ranking members of the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries while gcc members 
oman and bahrain are not part of opec their economies depend on 
oil export revenues 
the meeting at gcc headquarters here began early sunday evening 
the ministers did not speak to reporters before the single session 
began 
a worldwide oil glut has sent crude prices tumbling as much as 
8 below the 18abarrel opec benchmark much of the excess crude 
comes from gulf producers including iraq and iran 
opec members collectively are pumping more than 3 million 
barrels in excess of the aggregate ceiling the cartel agreed to in 
late 1986 to try to defend the 18 price 
many producers have openly ignored their quotas the united arab 
emirates for example renounced its 948000barreladay quota and 
is pumping about 15 million barrels daily 
saudi arabia announced it will no longer cut production and 
sacrifice its revenue to defend prices it has exceeded its quota 
of 43 million barrels per day in recent weeks to pressure other 
overproducers into respecting the quota system 
industry executives and western diplomats believe that the gcc 
ministers have to discuss their own quotas and consider means of 
coercing iraq and iran into cooperating 
the two countries are emerging from an 8year war both have 
said they will pump as much oil as they deem necessary to finance 
billions of dollars in reconstruction 
iraq has suggested it will cooperate with opec irans 
parliamentary speaker hashemi rafsanjani said friday that there 
was no reason to quarrel with the countries on the southern coast 
of the gulf over the oil market 
if we quarrel the situation will remain as it is now why 
should oil sell at 10 or 11 
the saudi newspaper arab news noted that iraq and iran want 
really high revenue be it by pumping or through high prices by 
cooperating and cutting prooduction 
the paper said producers are considering raising the opec 
ceiling by raising members quotas but such an arrangement has to 
wait for the upcoming meeting of opecs strategy committee 
if all these efforts fail to stem the overproduction problem 
we are poised for another price crash a senior oil source told 
the paper

eightyfour demonstrators including at 
least two children under 10 were arrested sunday in a protest 
against the longdelayed seabrook nuclear power plant 
those arrested had climbed a fence with handmade ladders or had 
blocked plant gates during the finale of a twoday protest against 
possible lowpower testing of the 56 billion plant later this 
year attendance saturday was more than 300 and the sunday figure 
was about 200 
marie benedum 88 of sanborton who had four generations of her 
family at sundays protest wanted to go over the fence but held 
back because of a bad knee 
if i didnt have the knee problem i would have gone over 
the fence she said 
this is a very decisive time she said there is so much 
at stake they want to start the lowpower testing and i dont 
believe in that 
police said nine juveniles among those arrested were not 
charged they said the other 75 were charged with criminal 
trespassing a violation comparable to a speeding ticket and 
released 
the first arrests sunday occurred when about 39 protesters used 
homemade ladders to scale the 10foot fence and sat inside plant 
grounds some walked with police officers to a waiting school bus 
while others went limp and had to be dragged away 
during the fence scaling more than 100 other demonstrators 
including women with infants in strollers stood outside the fence 
chanting and beating drums to support those who went over 
the protesters also clamped several huge padlocks and chains 
onto a plant gate and police brought out a heavy duty bolt cutter 
to get them off 
seabrook has been a target of protests since before construction 
began in 1976 it was completed in 1986 but has been unable to get 
a federal operating license federal regulators have yet to approve 
evacuation plans for surrounding communities including some in 
massachusetts and sort out the financial problems of owners 
including main owner public service company of new hampshire which 
filed for bankruptcy protection in january 
the protesters marched peacefully from nearby hampton beach on 
saturday then held an allnight candlelight vigil outside the 
gate in terms of arrests the protest was the largest since may 
1987 when 130 people were arrested at the gates the biggest was in 
1977 when 1414 people were arrested 
seabrook is close to winning a lowpower license following 
recent nuclear regulatory commission decisions plant officials 
hope to start the reactor for lowpower tests for the first time 
later this year 
three people were charged with trespassing saturday when they 
joined a tour of the plant being conducted by the pronuclear 
coalition for reliable energy the three sat in at the plants 
reception center and refused to leave at closing 
plant officials had a lowkey reaction to the protest 
we agree with the rights of this small group of demonstrators 
to their protest we disagree with their position that seabrook is 
not safe spokesman ron sher said the fact is seabrook has 
consistently received high marks from federal evaluators

a large drop in energy costs in september outweighed sharply 
higher food prices and kept the overall rise in wholesale prices at 
a moderate 04 percent the government reported 
while the reagan administration lauded fridays report as signs 
that inflation was not heating up some private economists 
expressed worries about what could happen if world oil prices 
suddenly rebound 
the september increase represented a drop from an august 
increase of 06 percent for the first nine months wholesale 
prices have been rising at a rate of 43 percent 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the inflation 
report showed a clear downward trend indicating inflation was 
under control 
the government also reported friday that retail sales fell for 
the second straight month in september declining 04 percent 
because of weakness in auto sales 
in another sign that the economy was slowing the federal 
reserve said the operating rate for americas factories mines and 
utilities was unchanged in september the first month industrial 
production has failed to increase since last february 
the financial markets took the data in stride stock prices rode 
out alternating waves of buying and selling to finish little 
changed with the dow jones average of 30 industrials losing 018 
to close at 213318 an initial rally in the bond market ran out 
of steam as the dollar fell and oil prices rose 
in the view of many economists the sluggish reports on retail 
sales and industrial production were encouraging signs that the 
economy was not in danger of overheating 
those worries earlier in the year had prompted the federal 
reserve in an inflationfighting move to tighten credit 
conditions and push interest rates higher 
the good news is that inflation and interest rates have peaked 
and should decline in coming months said richard rahn chief 
economist of the us chamber of commerce the bad news is not 
all that bad the economy is slowing but only slightly 
other economists agreed although some said they were worried 
that the underlying inflation rate after removing the volatile 
food and energy categories jumped by 06 percent in september 
double the rate of increase in august 
some economists suggested that the central bank is likely to 
wait until after the nov 8 presidential election and then resume 
pushing interest rates higher in a further effort to dampen 
consumer demand 
the big dampening effect on prices last month came from a 33 
percent drop in energy costs the biggest decline since january and 
a reflection of the rrent battle among oilproducing nations over 
production quotas 
offsetting the drop in energy costs food prices jumped by 12 
percent last month three times the rate of increase in august 
another factor pushing prices higher was a 18 percent increase in 
new automobile prices

oil futures prices have leaped again in reaction 
to speculation that opec oil producers would reach an agreement on 
production cuts at meetings this coming week 
the november contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude rose 71 cents friday to settle at 1492 a 
barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
since tuesday the november contract has leaped 137 a barrel 
reflecting a sharp turnaround in the mood of the market 
a proposal on the table would cut production by members of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries to between 185 
million and 195 million barrels a day said peter beutel 
assistant director of the energy group at elders futures inc 
opecs production recently has been about 21 million barrels a 
day even though the official ceiling is about 19 million barrels 
its not a fait accompli said beutel who said he got his 
information from sources these numbers may not come into 
existence 
oil traders pushed prices so high in anticipation of an opec 
accord that if one fails to materialize prices could fall back 
quite rapidly analysts said 
the heaviest buying friday was by traders who had speculated on 
a decline in prices and were forced to bail out when the market 
turned against them said jayne ball a trader and analyst at dean 
witter reynolds inc 
the sixmember gulf cooperation council which includes four 
opec members is scheduled to meet sunday in saudi arabia on 
thursday opecs price monitoring committee and longterm strategy 
committee are scheduled to meet jointly in madrid 
the price of oil skidded in recent weeks trading below 1230 
a barrel at one point last week because of continued 
overproduction by cartel members and opec is trying to construct 
an agreement that will lower output and push prices higher 
in other trading on the exchange friday the november contract 
for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 127 cents to 4542 cents a 
gallon the november contract for home heating oil rose 146 cents 
to settle at 4321 cents a gallon
