opposition leader benazir bhutto 
assailed president mohammad zia ulhaq for his decree making islam 
the law of the land and accusing him of doing it to stay in power 
newspapers reported thursday 
zia put the socalled shariah law into effect wednesday night in 
a televised address to the nation he said his decree makes islam 
the supreme law of pakistan but will not affect the rights of 
nonmoslems or pakistans business contracts with other nations 
the official pakistan times newspaper trumpeted shariat at 
last on page one a report in the englishlanguage daily muslim 
however quoted ms bhutto as telling pakistani journalists at a 
wednesday reception that her archfoe zia had no right to impose 
his will on the people of pakistan 
other newspapers carried similar accounts 
ms bhutto leader of the pakistan peoples party was quoted as 
saying 
it has been the ppps stand that islam like in the past is 
again being used to perpetuate oppressive rule 
gen zia who also is chief of the army surprised the nation on 
may 29 by firing his entire civilian government and dissolving the 
national assembly 
he claimed that in three years in power they failed to enact 
the islamic code and to battle deteriorating law and order 
zia hinted that elections would be announced within 90 days but 
he has yet to set a date 
zia ousted ms bhuttos father prime minister zulfikar ali 
bhutto in a 1977 military coup and had him hanged two years later 
for complicity in a murder plot 
after ruling eight years with martial law zia allowed creation 
of a civilian government in 1985 the opposition press dubbed his 
firing of that government zias second coup detat 
ms bhutto had cautiously welcomed the prospect of new elections 
after having boycotted the 1985 voting but she lashed out at zias 
latest move as an abuse of power 
we believe it is not the business of a caretaker government or 
an individual to impose their views on the nation she was quoted 
as saying as in the past we will resist any such move 
she repeated her call for free elections and denied reports that 
her advancing pregnancy would keep her from preaching the partys 
platform of popular socialism 
she married karachi businessman asif zardari last december and 
at 35 is expecting her first child this december 
we would like constitutional continuity which calls for 
elections within 90 days if you break this continuity it would 
amount to opening a pandoras box ms bhutto was quoted as 
saying

hackers penetrated a nonclassified 
defense department computer network last month rummaging through 
data at a navy base nasas jet propulsion laboratory and at least 
one other center the space agency said thursday 
the breakin occurred the night of may 16 and lasted into the 
early morning hours of may 17 but no damage was done said haskell 
g obrien the laboratorys manager of communications and 
computing network services 
nasa security people are working with the fbi investigating 
the details of this obrien told a news conference 
it was unknown whether more than one person was involved or if 
the breakin was achieved from inside or outside the united states 
obrien said unauthorized computer access is illegal he added 
thousands of computers are linked to the network at hundreds of 
us and foreign universities and research centers including 
military research centers and other national aeronautics and space 
administration offices he said 
obrien described it as a nonclassified network for sharing 
scientific information the network named arpanet is operated by 
the pentagons defense advanced research projects agency 
he said he considered the incident serious because programs used 
to design microcircuits could have been damaged and because if 
someone burglarizes my house im offended if someone accesses my 
computer im equally offended 
the department of defense regards as serious any attempt to 
gain unauthorized access to its computer systems pentagon 
spokeswoman susan hansen said in washington let me assure you 
however that there is no indication that any classified 
information has been obtained by such hacker activity 
the breakin was the third known violation of computer security 
at the jet propulsion laboratory in two years obrien said he 
cited a previously publicized august 1986 breakin by a west german 
hacker or computer buff and another last summer in which the 
perpetrator was caught but not prosecuted 
obrien said the hacker in last months incident first gained 
access to the pentagon network through another computer at an 
undisclosed location once inside the hacker guessed a password 
the name of a jpl employee to enter the labs computer he added 
the hacker then used the jpl computer as a conduit to enter 
another arpanet computer at patuxent naval air station in maryland 
where authorities noticed something was amiss and notified the jet 
propulsion laboratory obrien said he added that he didnt know 
how many other computers also were penetrated 
the labs chief spokesman george alexander initially said 
members of the chaos computer club in hamburg west germany broke 
into the digital equipment corp computer at the laboratory but he 
later retracted the statement 
we dont know for a fact that it was chaos there are 
things that make us suspicious but the bottom line fact is we 
dont know alexander said 
theyre not kids alexander said of the clubs members 
theyre adults they are a worrisome group to american computer 
experts theyre not just hackers doing pranks they are group 
whose motives and aims are not entirely clear 
a spokesman for the club told the associated press in bonn west 
germany that he was unaware of the breakin but would check into 
the matter further 
one thing i can tell you with absolute certainty is they the 
hackers didnt get into any classified data banks nor did they get 
into any sensitive information in the lab alexander said 
alexander said that as soon as the breakin was discovered we 
pulled jpl out of the network 
several days after the breakin digital equipment and jpl 
officials rebuilt the system to make sure that if they hackers 
planted any viruses we were not going to continue using the 
operating system they had been mucking around with he said 
a computer virus is a program surreptitiously inserted into a 
computer to disrupt its normal program 
in april a west german prosecutor revealed that a 24yearold 
west german hacker linked his home computer to about 50 us 
military computers by telephone the electronic breakins were 
detected in august 1986 
targets included computers at jpl the air force systems command 
in el segundo calif and at the lawrence berkeley laboratory in 
berkeley calif 
in september members of chaos computer club announced that 
youths who werent club members used home computers to break into a 
nasa computer information network used by at least nine nations 
and that they obtained secrets about the us space program 
the club said the hackers gained regular access to at least 20 
nasa computers between may and september 1987 through a flaw in the 
security system 
at the time nasa officials in washington denied that secret 
information had been obtained through its computer network

people infected with the aids virus 
show no sign of mental problems until they develop physical 
symptoms associated with the deadly disease a us government 
study shows 
were not seeing any difference whatsoever in terms of a 
number of psychological measures known to be sensitive to virtually 
any form of brain damage said one of the studys authors dr 
ola selnes a psychologist at the johns hopkins medical 
institutions in baltimore 
he presented the findings wednesday at the fourth international 
conference on aids 
also at the meeting dr jonas salk the polio vaccine pioneer 
described his first efforts toward an aids vaccine 
in a separate report dr daniel zagury the daring french 
scientist who in 1986 injected himself with an experimental aids 
vaccine of his own devising said that with booster shots he has 
developed antibodies that might be capable of destroying the aids 
virus 
and in a study of the distribution of clean needles and syringes 
to drug addicts in amsterdam researchers said they found that such 
a program does not encourage drug abuse and may well reduce the 
transmission of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the aids virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers 
aids is most often transmitted through sexual contact other 
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or 
blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles 
or syringes by drug abusers aids can also be passed from mother to 
child at or before birth 
the study by selnes and dr justin mcarthur also of hopkins 
was intended to resolve questions raised by earlier studies that 
had found distinct mental problems such as loss of memory and 
mental slowness in people infected with the aids virus those 
changes sometimes seemed to appear before any other signs of aids 
infection 
as a result concern was expressed that people in sensitive 
jobs such as airline pilots nuclear reactor operators or 
operators of heavy industrial equipment should be removed from 
their positions if they become infected with the aids virus even 
if they are not outwardly sick 
based on our results we do not feel there is any cause for 
alarm or concern selnes said the study was sponsored by the 
national institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
the debate involves whether mental problems appear early in the 
course of infection before other diseases strike there is general 
agreement that about 70 percent of those who die of aids have 
significant mental and neurological problems after other symptoms 
develop according to a report released in march by the world 
health organization 
that report concluded that there was no evidence for mental or 
neurological problems in otherwise healthy people infected with the 
aids virus 
selnes and mcarthur followed 201 people for two years 
eightytwo were uninfected with the aids virus 88 had been 
infected for a long time and 31 had been infected for a relatively 
brief period 
the patients were examined every six months with a variety of 
psychological tests and no differences were seen between the 
infected and uninfected subjects selnes said 
salk said in a report on his vaccine research that he has 
completed the first human trials of an unusual vaccine intended to 
keep infected people from developing aids 
he said he had given the vaccine to nine men with arc or 
aidsrelated complex an aidslike disease that can progress to 
aids 
the vaccine appears safe he said it also appears to raise 
levels of immune system cells and in one of the subjects the virus 
seemed to disappear completely 
that has persuaded salk to continue trials with 54 aidsinfected 
people who have not yet developed aids or arc 
in a separate report zagury a university of paris scientist 
said his administration of an experimental vaccine to himself in 
1986 had enhanced his bodys production of antibodies against the 
aids virus 
the vaccine consisted of a specially modified smallpox virus 
containing a portion of the aids virus he gave himself booster 
shots of his own blood cells which he had extracted and infected 
with the same type of modified virus before reinjecting them 
he said his body has produced high levels of aids antibodies 
some of which may be capable of neutralizing the aids virus 
ernest buning a psychologist with the amsterdam municipal 
health service said that four years of providing clean syringes 
and needles to drug addicts in the dutch city has produced a 
significant drop in needle sharing and may have helped curb aids 
spread 
the needle exchange program gave health workers an opportunity 
to tell addicts how to lower their aids risk and that counselling 
was a critical component of the exchange program said buning 
our conclusion is that the needle and syringe exchange helps 
addicts to use drugs safely he said furthermore he said the 
program did not lead to increased drug use as critics of such 
programs had feared 
the first us needle exchange program will begin soon in 
portland ore under the sponsorship of the american foundation 
for aids research

amid all the hoopla over mick dundee john 
rambo willow ufgood and other heroes of the new film season the 
infamous jason might be overlooked 
not by paramount pictures 
friday the 13th is a gold mine that keeps on rolling 
along declares sidney ganis president of worldwide marketing 
for paramount the studio reports that the first six films in the 
series have grossed over 172 million not to mention the big 
videocassette sales cable tv syndication and a tv series 
in its first 18 days friday the 13th part vii the new 
blood sold almost 16 million worth of tickets in the united 
states and canada since the film cost 35 million about 118th 
the budget of rambo iii it should already be solidly in the 
black 
part vii profited by premiering on friday the 13th of may 
the series always does better business when released on that 
fateful day 
jason has become part of the vernacular ganis said why 
i think because he is genuinely frightening and teenagers 
genuinely love to be frightened my own daughter loved friday the 
13th iii now she has seen vii and then she goes to see the 
more arty the moderns a whole generation has grown up on jason 
and keeps going back 
jason began his rampageous career quite modestly in 1980 in a 
lowbudget thriller created by producerdirector sean cunningham 
ironically cunningham devised the title when he was planning a 
childrens television show he figured it might work for the title 
of a feature film and he was right friday the 13th grossed an 
amazing 40 million 
cunningham who is now filming another horror film deep 
six signed over his rights to paramount and the series has had 
five other directors the formula remains the same as in the 
original which starred kevin bacon later of footloose fame 
harry crosby son of bing and betsy palmer as jasons mother 
the action lots of it always takes place at camp crystal 
lake jason returns from the dead wearing a hockey mask and 
wielding an ax to pay back a grudge many years ago when he was a 
camper he drowned in the lake because his inattentive counselors 
were making love in the bushes jasons vengeance is wreaked upon 
the human race in general with special emphasis on oversexed 
counselors 
john carl buechler a special effects expert who became a 
director troll cellar dweller directed friday the 
13th vii from a script by daryl haney buechler pronounced 
beekler says he saw possibilities of applying two new twists to 
the same saga 
one i thought it would be good to have a main character in 
the story someone the audience could cry and cheer for and follow 
her through the nightmare world he said she is the teenager 
lar park lincoln whose special powers release jason from his 
grave at the bottom of the lake telling the story from one 
persons viewpoint had only been done once before in part v 
two i added a substantial element of the supernatural before 
part vii jason was a mindless man who jumped out of closets and 
killed people since he was resurrected by electricity in part vi 
he was now practically speaking a ghost that made him a 
virtually unstoppable humanoid 
so i thought it would be fun to fill the last two reels with 
false endings i wanted the audience to say oh hes up now hes 
down hes dead no hes up again my aim was more fantasy than 
reality 
even with the innovations buechler was careful not to tamper 
too much with the friday the 13th formula 
i was hired to satisfy the producers if i was hired to do a 
james bond picture i would certainly follow the bond formula he 
said 
friday the 13th vii inevitably found disfavor with the 
ratings board of the motion picture association of america which 
immediately branded the film with an x for extreme gore this would 
have made the movie unsalable since a film rated x prevents anyone 
under age 17 from being admitted to the theater 
like jason though the filmmakers kept coming back again and 
again with new cuts 
they gave us an x six times until we finally got an r 
buechler said i understand robocop holds the record at eight 
stunt man kane hodder is the seventh portrayer of jason which 
might seem a thankless acting job since he doesnt speak and is 
hidden behind a mask hodder doesnt agree 
ive always wanted to play that character ever since the first 
film says hodder who has coordinated stunts for house 
ghost town and other thrillers ive always believed that he 
should be played by a stunt man 
i think jason is more of a challenge because he has no 
dialogue i tried to get across the feeling of menace just by using 
certain head movements and body movements 
if the friday the 13th films are stiumlating to teenagers 
they are an ordeal for reviewers whose vituperation has no 
apparent effect on the audience 
critics hate the movies buechler said but surprisingly 
weve had mixed reviews on vii the common pattern is for the 
reviewer to comment that jason is here to stay then to review the 
previous one in the series and conclude if you liked them youll 
like this one

sitting in his tiny storefront office 
just down the street from the sprawling grounds of heritage usa 
jim bakker predicted he would soon regain control of the ptl 
ministry 
god doesnt take you halfway and dump you said bakker who 
resigned from the television ministry last year in the wake of a 
sex scandal and is under investigation by a federal grand jury 
ive been building this place for 15 years im staying until i 
get it back 
even the everoptimistic bakker admitted it will be an uphill 
climb for him and his wife tammy faye to get back ptl they 
intend to present a reorganization plan for the christian retreat 
in us bankruptcy court in columbia sc before june 29 
we are also placing an advertisement in a local newspaper 
asking all former employees who are interested in being a part of 
the jim and tammy ministry to come to the office and fill out a 
form he said wednesday these are not job applications its 
just a survey to see how many are interested 
bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds has already told ptl officials 
to sell land buildings and other assets to raise enough money to 
settle claims against the ministry that could reach 130 million 
last month ptl officials worked out a deal with businessman 
george shinn calling for shinn to buy all or most of ptls property 
at heritage usa and lease parts of the ministry to a new church 
shinn who owns charlottes new national basketball association 
franchise and a minor league baseball team has declined to say how 
much he will offer for the complex estimates have ranged from 75 
million to 100 million 
mc red benton the courtappointed trustee at ptl has 
said there are several other offers and vowed to treat any proposal 
from bakker fairly 
im more convinced at this moment that we will be back at 
heritage usa than at any time in nearly a year and a half said 
bakker adding that he hopes to buy some television time to promote 
his plan 
bakker returned to south carolina in early june and opened an 
office in a shopping mall next door to the headquarters of the 
bring back bakkers club 
ive yet to meet a negative person bakker said in an 
interview monday in his office decorated with photographs of him 
and tammy we came here psychologically prepared for battle but 
people have been coming up to us in the restaurants and on the 
street to give us their support 
since his return bakker said a car dealer gave him a new car 
and other offers have been made 
they told me they only have one question what can we do to 
get jim and tammy back he said never before have i had such 
an outward expression of support from local business people 
not all business owners share that sentiment 
theres still too much of a bad taste in peoples mouths 
said sharon haney who owns a small leather shop across the street 
from heritage usa 
several blocks away marge wilson who operates a craft shop 
said i dont think jim can make it work so many people are so 
disgusted im the first to forgive but 
at heritage usa the impact of the bakkers departure is 
apparent the water slide is closed shuttle buses that transport 
visitors to the various attractions are nearly empty main street 
a collection of shops and restaurants looks like a ghost town 
the parks nearly 1500 employees of a year ago have been cut by 
nearly twothirds to just over 500 
the mood around here used to be a threering circus now its 
like a cemetery said barbara crisp who has been coming to 
heritage usa from lenoir nc with her husband for six years 
still she doesnt know if she wants the bakkers back 
everyone is deserving of a second chance but they have to 
come back truly repentant she said the thing that disturbs me 
is when tammy said what did we do wrong that boggles my mind 
what about the credit cards and selling heritage three times over 
the bakkers also have their fervent supporters 
no one can run this place like jim said loretta graves of 
charlotte who stopped by during a break from job hunting if god 
can forgive him i can 
bakker declined to give details of his reorganization plan and 
he wont identify any financial backers 
well present a conservative plan without any pieinthesky 
deals he said its built on our track record of the past i 
plan to restore it to where i left it and go beyond 
i think we can help people because of what weve been 
through bakker said they want to know does the bible really 
work weve been through one of the most devastating times of just 
about any public figures in history

the government says its campaign to reduce 
atmospheric pollution is working but some among athens 35 
million people are not so sure 
for years the capital has been plagued by a brown layer of 
noxious smoke exhaust fumes and factory emissions that athenians 
call the nefos greek for cloud 
on a warm windless day the nefos sends an average of 300 
athenians to hospitals complaining of headaches chest pains 
nausea and stinging eyes 
i drive around athens all day and when i get home my nose is 
clogged and my hair is oily from the fumes said michalis 
leontsakos one of the citys 15000 taxi drivers and when 
summer hits its much worse 
last july a 10day heatwave compounded the smog problem and more 
than 1200 mostly poor and elderly athenians died of heatstroke or 
breathing problems 
officials in prime minister andreas papandreous socialist 
government maintain however that a new package of antismog 
measures is producing results and that last summers high 
temperatures are unlikely to recur 
the recent package has been particularly productive 
environment minister evangelos kouloumbis said we have had a 15 
to 25 percent reduction in overall pollution levels 
the smog forms over the mountainringed athens basin on warm 
still days 
the sun heats up a layer of cold night air close to the ground 
and the air then rises into the lower atmosphere where it acts as a 
barrier that traps the warmer pollutants under it 
the problem is aggravated by the lack of parks and green spaces 
in athens concrete sprawl the city has just 23 square feet of 
greenery per resident compared to 107 square feet in rome 215 in 
vienna austria and 290 in amsterdam netherlands 
environmental scientists blame the citys 750000 cars 
dieselpowered taxis buses and trucks for 75 percent of the smog 
if you take away half the cars youd only have half the 
problem said dimitris hadzidakis a chemical engineer with the 
staterun pollution control program traffic would move faster 
and youd have few engines idling 
to cut down on traffic the government abolished greeces 
traditional split working day with its threehour midday break 
stores now stay open from 9 am to 7 pm and the change 
eliminated two of the citys four rush hours 
the new measures also ban half the citys taxis from the 
fivesquare mile city center on alternate days and have closed a 
twosquare mile central commercial district to traffic 
but despite the government claims some people who work in the 
city center say they cant see much improvement 
the nefos seems to be the same and fewer people shop in the 
afternoon hours because of the heat and smog said michalis 
vitos a shoe store clerk the summer looks like its going to be 
worse and will definitely cut business 
half the citys private cars have been banned from the center on 
alternate days since 1984 cars with license plates ending in even 
numbers drive on evennumbered days and vice versa 
we think that updated cars burning unleaded gas must gradually 
replace athens current fleet of private automobiles said 
environment minister kouloumbis 
but greeks complain they cant afford to buy new cars because of 
import taxes that triple the basic price transportation ministry 
statistics indicate the average private car in athens is 10 years 
old 
the governments 1985 target of a 27 percent pollution reduction 
by 1990 is still on track but it may take 20 more years to fully 
solve the problem environment officials say 
the trouble is the citys spreading faster that we can reduce 
the pollution and there are 30000 more cars on the streets 
every year said hadzidakis the chemical engineer 
the government has banned low quality heating fuel and insists 
that filters be installed on athens 120 main industrial plants by 
the end of this year 
but independent environmental researchers say the measures still 
arent radical enough 
to solve the pollution problem youd have to remove all 
industry from athens and find some way to make at least 1 
million athenians move at least 30 kilometers 19 miles out of the 
city said panayiotis christodoulakis president of the 
panhellenic center for ecological studies

mother teresa on wednesday gave her best 
wishes to the un conference on disarmament and gave delegates a 
new issue to ponder by saying abortion has become the greatest 
destroyer of peace 
i think the world has never needed so much tender love as 
today she told reporters after she met secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar for a courtesy call 
mother teresa 77 works with and is the founder of the 
international missionaries of charity a religious order in 
calcutta she received the nobel peace prize in 1979 for her work 
to ease the suffering of dying slum dwellers and is known there as 
the saint of the gutters 
the small fraillooking woman wearing a white cotton shawl and 
bluetrimmed robe spoke fiercely against the evil of abortion 
of destroying children of neglecting children 
were fighting abortion by adoption and we have saved 
thousands of children from being destroyed because as you know 
abortion has become the greatest destroyer of peace because it 
destroys the child the gift of god and it destroys the conscience 
of the mother it is actually a double killing 
when asked if she discussed with perez de cuellar the un 
population control programs she said she had not many 
antiabortion activists have criticized the programs saying them 
promote abortion as a possible option 
i think we talked of other things that we didnt say she 
replied 
another reporter asked her why the concept of nonviolence does 
not seem to work in south africa where mohandas k gandhi lived 
for 21 years and where anglican archbishop desmond tutu the 1984 
nobel peace prize winner carries on the tradition of peaceful 
civil disobedience today 
mother teresa said nonviolence begins at home adding 
our government in india and the government of south africa have 
given us full permission to go to south africa and we have a 
mixture of all nationalities and i am going to take take with me 
different nationalities different colors and bring there with me 
the joy of loving 
she said she was in new york to try to open a center to care for

in the end vice president george bushs 
appearance at the agriculture department for a drought briefing was 
outshone by a career federal meteorologists description of the 
trouble spots and how they could worsen 
reporters who had been herded into a room to look at the vice 
president then herded out ended up only with a written statement 
in which bush declared that rain is needed to end the drought 
plaguing large portions of the country 
bush accompanied by senate minority leader bob dole and a white 
house entourage met wednesday for about half an hour in the office 
of agriculture secretary richard e lyng 
for a while the placid atmosphere of the old usda 
administration building was charged by the swarming of security 
forces assigned to protect the vice president who is expected to 
be the republican presidential nominee 
the main elevators were stopped and employees were routed far 
around the sensitized area where bush was to enter and walk within 
the building the departments flock of public affairs specialists 
scurried and fluttered about 
it was an exciting time for almost everyone except for 
reporters looking for news 
reporters photographers and television technicians were herded 
into a conference room or a holding pen where they were required 
to put all tape recorders and cameras on the floor and then move 
outside to a hallway 
dozens of secret service and usda security people hovered close 
while a large german shepherd was taken into the abandoned holding 
area to sniff the equipment for bombs or weapons none was found 
after more waiting the two dozen or so news people were allowed 
to walk up one flight to lyngs outer office the group was allowed 
to enter for a photo opportunity at which the subjects are 
often asked questions over the clicks and whirrs of cameras 
but norton strommen the usdas chief meteorologist was 
explaining a set of yellowandred charts to his audience 
including bush and dole who were seated on a couch and lyng and 
others in the official party 
no questions were shouted by reporters while strommen talked 
after a few minutes all news people were sternly ordered out of 
lyngs office those who tried to tarry in the area were finally 
herded downstairs again and lodged behind a yellow tape that 
represented a security boundary 
bush and dole then zipped out usdas front door without enduring 
a single question from reporters about drought or anything else 
in his wake bush left a singlepage statement noting that if 
relief doesnt come soon the corn crop could be in jeopardy 
without rain there is the potential for this to be a 
catastrophe he said echoing lyngs congressional testimony of 
the day before 
bush said farmers in 21 states are receiving some form of 
emergency relief but sad to say nothing will take the place of 
rainfall and we have to be concerned about the plight of the 
nations farmers 
strommen filled in the gaps later gathering up his charts and 
leading reporters back into the conference room where he summarized 
his presentation to bush and dole 
strommen said the west is severely lacking in moisture from 
reduced snowpack during the winter which resulted in 
wellbelownormal reservoir levels in much of the region 
including idaho washington oregon and nevada 
another major problem area is in the northern great plains 
notably in montana and the dakotas he said and dry areas still 
persist in the southeast which has not yet fully recovered from 
the 1986 drought 
the best areas in terms of moisture are the southwest up into 
the central great plains in kansas and nebraska strommen 
said 
just in the last two weeks the drought has expanded into the 
eastern corn belt states of the midwest and this is a major 
concern for us he said 
without substantial rains soon strommen said the corn belt 
drought has a potential for deterioration of crops 
however he said it simply is too early in the growing season 
to try to define what that potential is

president reagan will be bidding farewell to 
summitry next week in toronto 
eight years ago reagan went to his first economic summit in 
montebello quebec as an untried figure on the world scene a 
former movie actor reading his remarks from cue cards on the 
defensive about a huge budget deficit and espousing economic 
beliefs that some of his colleagues found dubious if not ridiculous 
on sunday he leaves washington for his last economic summit 
once again it will be in canada reagan will still be reading from 
cue cards he still has the same conservative beliefs the us 
budget deficit has zoomed from 789 billion in 1981 to an 
estimated 1467 billion 
but this time its different 
for one thing reagan has been in office longer than any of the 
other summit leaders except his staunch ally from britain margaret 
thatcher she and frances francois mitterrand will be the only 
leaders there who were on board in 1981 
for another the presidents aides are confident this time of 
the kind of reception reagan will get from his colleagues as he 
makes what will almost surely be his final bow on the global stage 
i think they have learned what the rest of the world learned 
which was not to underestimate ronald reagan the presidents 
chief spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
im told that at the first summit he was regarded as a sort 
of quaint amusing character from the past when he talked about 
markets and private enterprise and entrepreneurship said 
undersecretary of state allen wallis now at the summits thats 
all they do everybody talks in that framework 
i hope and believe that there is going to be a recognition on 
the part of all of the countries there that reliance on free 
markets and reliance on open societies is the best way to foster 
economic growth and sound economic development said secretary of 
the treasury james a baker iii 
this is the message if i may say so that president reagan 
took to the first economic summit in 1981 a message at the time 
that was greeted with a certain skepticism and perhaps even some 
derision baker said and now it is not so greeted and 
everybody is pretty much in sync and on board with that concept and 
i think hope and believe there will be a further endorsement of 
that at this summit 
a european official in washington speaking on condition he not 
be identified said there is still some skepticism abroad however 
about such things as reagans tax reduction programs and the us 
budget and trade deficits 
i am sure president reagan has since 1981 marked 
cornerstones on a number of things but i am also sure we could not 
afford the kind of policies which president reagan affords in the 
united states the official said 
as reagan headed for montebello eight years ago one white house 
aide asking that he not be further identified said there is a 
push that we project him as leader of the free world but the 
aide also indicated a fear that other participants would snipe at 
the presidents economic programs and challenge his influence 
a canadian press writer said then that the new american chief 
executive would have to rely on his good humor and charm to 
cope with the greater international experience and intellect of 
such leaders as canadas pierre trudeau and west germanys helmut 
schmidt 
now as reagan prepares to go to toronto fitzwater said i 
think they will see that the man they see in 1988 is the same man 
they saw in 1980 the difference is what hes done that hes 
changed the face of the world in terms of military strength 
certainly the strength of focus and purpose of nato has been 
strengthened by the presidents commitment to it 
fitzwater added eastwest relations have changed dramatically 
under the presidents leadership the world economy is so much 
stronger now than it was in 1980 and 1981 those three elements of 
achievement have given ronald reagan a whole new stature 
because reagan is leaving office after so many years 
undoubtedly there will be a tribute to him of some kind 
fitzwater said i dont know any specifics planned in terms of 
organization but i am sure the discussions and the statements will 
in some way recognize the leadership that the president has given 
to the economic summits

vice president george bush says he endorses a 
house republican plan to confiscate 25 percent of the adjusted 
gross income and net assets of anyone caught possessing illegal 
substances 
bush took center stage wednesday at a house republican news 
conference as he combined his support for the gop plan with a 
blistering partisan attack that was cheered by dozens of his 
supporters attending the event 
im sick and tired in hearing the democrats do nothing but 
tear down and criticize the reagan administrations attempts to 
halt drug abuse bush said im talking about jesse jackson and 
michael dukakis the last two months 
the republican plan also calls for the death penalty for drug 
kingpins and it would require that states suspend the drivers 
license of anyone convicted of using drugs or face loss of federal 
highway funding 
dukakis in framingham mass hit back on the drug issue 
criticizing the reagan administration for permitting coast guard 
budget cuts that have idled drug interdiction patrols 
how can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugs 
when were cutting coast guard patrols by 55 percent its that 
kind of thing one of the reasons im running for the 
presidency dukakis said 
in addition to the vice president administration officials 
appeared all over the capitol complex wednesday to testify on the 
drug problem the top coast guard officer discussed the cuts in his 
agencys drug patrols the administrations chief budget official 
and the defense secretary testified on the need for drugfree 
workplaces 
defense secretary frank c carlucci told lawmakers that 
americas defense contractors will soon be ordered to provide a 
drugfree workplace environment for their 32 million employees 
the hundreds of defense contractors would be required to develop 
extensive education programs about the dangers of drugs employees 
with security clearances could also be required to undergo 
mandatory drug testing carlucci said 
an estimated 3 million workers on pentagon contracts have 
security clearances of various types carlucci did not say if the 
testing would be required of all employees with clearances or just 
those with the more sensitive access clearances 
carlucci testified before an unusual joint meeting of the house 
and senate armed services committees 
james c miller iii director of the office of management and 
budget also said the reagan administration supports efforts to 
create drugfree workplaces 
but he expressed reservations before a house government 
operations subcommittee about legislation designed to bring about 
that goal 
a bill sponsored by committee chairman jack brooks dtexas 
would require federal contractors and grantees to establish 
drugfree workplace policies employees would have to observe the 
policies and sanctions could be imposed if drug use still occurred 
in the workplace 
the sanctions which would be applied under due process 
requirements include future disbarment of contractors who are 
frequent violators 
miller said the bill which in part calls for employers and 
employees to certify that they are complying with the law would 
require extensive new paperwork burdens 
bush standing with some 50 house republicans at their news 
conference declared the gop package better than anything the 
democrats are going to dream up 
democrats control both houses of congress however and majority 
house and senate task forces are at work developing their own drug 
proposals 
answering reporters questions bush also said he supports the 
administrations zero tolerance policy of seizing property when 
even a small amount of illegal drugs is found he said if some 
yacht owner is inconvenienced its too damn bad 
adm paul a yost jr commandant of the coast guard told a 
house merchant marine subcommittee that his budget shortfall is 
103 million he said the money problem is proving to be a 
serious blow to our operations against drug smugglers 
there is a great hue and cry from members getting on the 
bandwagon for new omnibus drug legislation to win the war against 
drugs and congress is now considering a package of drug 
legislation costing 2 billion said rep earl hutto dfla 
chairman of the panel 
i wonder where some of those same people were earlier this 
year when this subcommittee was trying to get congress to find the 
103 million necessary just to keep the coast guard afloat 
yost said last week that the amount of drugs seized by the coast 
guard has been reduced by about one half since the cutbacks

as michael dukakis begins the process of 
selecting a democratic vice presidential nominee the surest bet in 
politics is that his choice will be a man 
not even the women who worked so hard four years ago to get 
geraldine ferraro on the democratic ticket expect dukakis to follow 
walter f mondales historymaking example 
it certainly isnt the topofline discussion it was in 
1984 said joanne howes a political consultant and director of 
the nonpartisan womens vote project 
is that a priority in his campaign this year or in the 
party said irene natividad director of the national womens 
political caucus it doesnt seem like it 
so when paul brountas the boston lawyer who is heading the 
dukakis search for a running mate came to washington to talk vice 
presidential politics the big names on his calling list were all 
male names like john glenn sam nunn and bill bradley 
he did pay a call on sen barbara mikulski of maryland but now 
in her second year as a senator she is on no ones list of vice 
presidential prospects 
missing from brountas list was rep pat schroeder of colorado 
who came close to running for president and is the most credible 
vice presidential prospect among democratic women 
three women often are mentioned as potential running mates for 
republican george bush former transportation secretary elizabeth 
dole sen nancy kassebaum of kansas and former un ambassador 
jeane kirkpatrick this is the party that turned its back on the 
equal rights amendment and demands that its national candidates 
take strong stands against abortion 
analysts talk of a gender gap that favors democrats the 
fact that a far higher percentage of women than men support 
democratic candidates 
yet this election year the likely women vice presidential 
candidates are republicans not democrats 
i think the major reason is obvious said celinda lake a 
senior associated with the analysis group a democratic polling 
organization there are lots of ways in which the democrats are 
turning away from the 84 experience 
and one of the ways which i think is incorrect is they think 
they would not benefit from nominating a woman as the vice 
president 
the 84 experience of course was the fact the 
mondaleferraro ticket was beaten in 49 of 50 states as president 
reagan received an estimated 55 percent of the womens vote 
i also think said lake there is somewhat of a shortage of 
women who are both ready and willing because the democrats 
have been out of office for eight years we dont have the women in 
the administrative pipeline 
that view was echoed by others including joanne symons a 
political consultant who worked on rep richard gephardts 
presidential campaign 
there are not enough democratic women in the pool she 
said because a republican president has been filling cabinet 
positions the past seven and a half years 
lake also cited an ambition factor 
she listed gov madeleine kunin of vermont along with schroeder 
and mikulski as democratic women who have the stature to be vice 
presidential candidates and said i dont think they want it 
they want to be no 1 not no 2 
howes said the real goal is to be prepared in the 1990s for a 
woman to be ready to be president of the united states and to run 
for president of the united states and to win

the cia has suffered its firstever defeat in 
the supreme court and as a result must explain in federal court its 
1982 firing of a homosexual spy 
morton halperin of the american civil liberties union here 
called wednesdays ruling by the supreme court a major victory 
in limiting what the cia can do in the name of national security 
and a modest step forward for gay rights 
at the very least it gives us the opportunity to contend that 
constitutional rights have been violated halperin said 
steven f reich a washington lawyer who is helping represent 
the fired spy called the ruling a terrific victory 
the cia is subject to the rule of law and not above the us 
constitution reich said 
the courts 62 ruling flatly rejected the reagan 
administrations arguments that the 1947 law creating the cia gave 
the spy agencys director virtually absolute authority to fire 
employees 
a homosexual identified in court documents only by the 
fictitious name john doe was fired by thencia director william 
casey in 1982 the agency claimed does homosexuality was a 
security threat 
doe had joined the cia as a clerktypist in 1973 and worked his 
way up to a covert job as an electronics technician in which he 
was rated an excellent agent 
in january 1982 he voluntarily told an agency security officer 
that he was gay doe was placed on paid leave pending an 
investigation and that may he was told he was being fired in the 
interests of the united states 
doe told agency officials that his family neighbors and friends 
knew he was a homosexual and that he had never revealed classified 
information to any unauthorized person 
does suit demands that he be reinstated 
in other decisions the court 
barred police by a 62 vote in an arizona case from 
questioning criminal suspects who already have invoked their right 
to remain silent or get a lawyers help even if the questions 
center on some other crime 
provided a victory for the reagan administration and freetrade 
advocates by ruling unanimously that the government does not have 
to place restrictions on imported uranium to help protect us 
producers of the nuclear fuel 
ruled 71 in a case from texas that business promoters 
sometimes must share the liability of deals gone sour 
said kansas courts may apply that states laws in a natural gas 
royalties dispute between sun oil co and mineral rights owners 
from texas oklahoma louisiana new mexico and louisiana

a pirate underworld that holds seminars in the 
bahamas and advertises openly in publications is thriving on sales 
of illegal decoders to backyard satellite dish owners according to 
industry officials 
pirates are using modern business techniques including the 
distribution of how to video tapes to establish a sales 
network for the illegal electronics j lawrence dunham a general 
instrument corp executive said in testimony submitted wednesday 
to the house telecommunications subcommittee 
general instrument makes the videocipher ii decoder whose 
electronics have become the de facto industry standard each of the 
three dozen or so cable programming services that have scrambled 
their signals can be decoded by the videocipher 
industry leaders estimate that as many as half of the nearly 1 
million decoders on the market have been illegally modified with 
the illegal decoders backyard dish owners can avoid subscribing to 
scrambled programming services like hbo showtime and other popular 
cable channels instead they can pick up virtually all channels 
free 
dunham said general instrument has responded to the piracy with 
changes in the circuitry of the decoder a public relations 
campaign to let dish owners know the penalties for dealing with the 
illegal electronics and an amnesty program that allowed dish owners 
to trade in modified units at no cost or legal risk 
in spite of these efforts piracy has continued dunham said 
dunham said decoder pirates have held seminars in the bahamas to 
exchange information run technology centers to develop new ways to 
break the system and have tried to buy general instruments 
proprietary chips from suppliers 
bob phillips chief executive officer of the national rural 
telecommunications cooperative said pirates are offering full 
services to the dealers and telling them the risk of getting caught 
is low 
and pirates are even making house calls going door to door 
where they see the satellite dishes and offer their services they 
will sell entire modified descramblers or modify your own unit at 
home he said 
pirates are so competitive they have even developed programs 
and systems to prevent other pirates from pirating from them he 
said 
sid swartz president of west inc a satellite tv retailer 
based in mount vernon wash said illegal decoders are costing him 
business dealers can make a 1000 profit on the sale of an 
illegal decoder and buyers get a sky full of permanent free 
programming

drug trafficking still poses a security threat 
at a topsecret nuclear weapons laboratory in california where a 
1986 undercover drug investigation was abruptly terminated under 
pressure from the energy department house investigators say 
rep john dingell dmich said a drug problem continues to 
exist a security problem continues to exist at the lawrence 
livermore national laboratory near san francisco where highly 
sensitive research on president reagans star wars missile defense 
system is conducted 
according to staff investigators for the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee chaired by dingell 
in april 1987 a livermore electronics technician with a 
highlevel security clearance was caught with several hundred 
dollars worth of illicit drugs the employee who was working on a 
classified computer system admitted trading drugs for sex with a 
female coworker 
in june 1987 a security guard responsible for protecting the 
laboratorys supersensitive plutonium facility was arrested for 
drug possession he was accused of bringing drugs and paraphernalia 
into his security bunker while on duty and being armed with an 
automatic weapon 
also last summer another employee with top security clearance 
who worked in the nuclear chemistry department resigned after he 
was accused of selling thousands of dollars worth of cocaine to 
workers in sensitive areas of the laboratory 
energy department and livermore officials are currently 
investigating allegations of drug use by a professional 
laboratory employee with access to extremely sensitive classified 
information 
dingell said these disclosures following the shutdown of the 
drug investigation codenamed operation snowstorm in september 
1986 raise serious questions about the integrity of security at 
our nations most sensitive nuclear weapons and research 
facilities 
energy undersecretary joseph f salgado said officials decided 
to terminate the investigation because it had run for eight 
months and was apparently not uncovering new productive leads 
salgado said operation snowstorm had served its purpose in 
putting livermore employees on notice that drug use would not be 
tolerated he denied dingells charge that the energy department 
had tried to conceal the aborted investigation from the house panel 
at the end of a daylong hearing wednesday dingell said he was 
ordering an audit by the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress to determine the extent of 
drugrelated thefts of computers and other government property at 
livermore 
if they are stealing government property why wouldnt they 
steal government secrets which are more valuable dingell asked 
energy department officials responded that they were conducting 
their own investigation of the theft problem and were 
aggressively pursuing questions of whether the laboratorys 
security clearances had been compromised by drug trafficking 
the doe was accused wednesday of halting the ninemonth drug 
investigation prematurely leaving undercover agents unable to 
pursue leads on 127 livermore employees who were suspected drug 
dealers or users 
patricia dorsadijamco a special agent of the drug enforcement 
administration testified that pressure from doe and laboratory 
officials to hasten the arrest of an alleged drug trafficking 
ringleader at livermore prevented her agency from identifying the 
drug suppliers in mexico 
rep ron wyden dore a subcommittee member suggested that 
officials who terminated the drug investigation were fearful of 
adverse publicity it seems to me that this operation snowstorm 
should be called operation snow job wyden said 
it appears that doe was less interested in cooperating with 
the dea than in heeding the concerns of one of its contractors 
dingell said he was referring to the university of california at 
los angeles which has a government contract to operate the 
livermore facility 
david a leary who managed the undercover investigation 
testified that many of the drug pushers among livermores 8500 
employees held topsecret q security clearances he said the 
illicit drugs they were selling included cocaine marijuana 
methamphetamine and barbiturates 
dingell quoted john hunt current chief of safeguards and 
security at livermore as telling staff investigators that if 
operation snowstorm had been allowed to continue we would have 
to arrest 20 percent of the lab 
security agent timothy l mitchell testified that the volume of 
illicit drug trafficking at livermore has the potential to 
endanger national security 
undercover agent robert buda told the panel he was very 
flabbergasted that the investigation was halted just three days 
before he received a q clearance to penetrate the most 
sensitive green badge areas of the laboratory 
we felt like the kid in front of the candy store said john 
c barber the university of california police chief who served as 
consultant to operation snowstorm 
we had the money in our hands and we were ready to go inside 
and do business barber said unfortunately that door closed 
before we could get it buda said 
in a jan 7 1987 memorandum obtained by the associated press 
hunt quoted adm sylvester foley assistant energy secretary for 
defense programs as offering the previous july to put pressure 
on dea to get out of our hair the dea was seeking a delay in the 
energy departments plans to halt the drug investigation in late 
summer of 1986

dental science has developed new techniques 
and new materials for the surgical implantation of false teeth but 
there still is no definitive study on the effectiveness of the 
procedure a panel of experts says 
a panel of dental experts meeting at the national institutes of 
health released a statement wednesday in which they said more than 
300000 americans annually will be receiving surgically implanted 
false teeth by 1992 and that the number of dentists performing such 
procedures has increased by 10 times since 1983 
but the panel said scientific and statistically precise studies 
are needed to define the effectiveness of permanently implanted 
false teeth 
the panel said the cost for surgicallyinstalled false teeth is 
about 300 to 1000 per implant and that patients can receive from 
one to eight implants 
d walter cohen president of the medical college of 
pennsylvania in philadelphia and chairman of the nih conference on 
dental implants said the surgical installation of teeth can no 
longer be considered experimental 
cohen said the development of new materials and new techniques 
have led to wider acceptance of implantation by dentists and that 
the demand for permanent false teeth is increasing among americans 
he said as people tend to live longer more and more patients 
are finding that they cannot use removable false teeth and are 
choosing to have permanentlyimplanted artificial teeth 
there are several systems for implanting false teeth in living 
tissue but they all basically involve surgically cutting into the 
bone that normally supports teeth and installing a manmade peg or 
post to support the false teeth or to anchor a bridge of false 
teeth 
the nih panel said that because scientific studies have not been 
made on methods of implanting false teeth it is not possible to 
make judgments on the comparative merits of different implant 
systems 
several studies however show that dental implants are 
effective for five to 10 years the panels report said 
however the report said that little information is available to 
evaluate such factors as patient satisfaction appearance comfort 
and the effect of implants on speech and chewing 
cohen said the panel also determined that the risks of 
surgically implanting false teeth include the inadvertent 
penetration of a sinus cavity by a dentist drilling in bone to 
create a socket for the implant 
he said other problems include damage to facial nerves and 
infections that could threaten existing natural teeth

colossus billed as the largest captive 
lowland gorilla got his first glimpse of another member of his 
species since infancy a female on loan for breedinghe apparently 
liked what he saw 
but the match between the 6foot2 570pound colossus and 48 
274pound muke on loan from the st louis zoo has a long way to 
go before it becomes an affair of the soap opera kind 
colossus encounter with muke on wednesday was only a glimpse 
through a small opening between their bedrooms at the zoo in this 
pensacola suburb 
colossus has been peeking in through that little porthole over 
there and been knocking the dust out of the concrete walls said 
pat quinn director of the zoo hes very excited about this 
whole affair 
both gorillas are about 22 years old prime breeding age and 
each was captured in the wilds of west africa as an infant 
but colossus had been separated from other gorillas at bensons 
animal park in hudson nh before moving to the florida panhandle 
in march muke pronounced mookey has lived with other members 
of their species at st louis the columbus zoo and the bronx zoo 
university of west florida scientists had been preparing 
colossus for mukes arrival by showing him national geographic 
videotapes of gorillas 
muke is worldly and sophisticated compared to colossus quinn 
said she also has an ornery streak picking fights even with some 
male gorillas and is said to have bitten off a keepers finger at 
the new york city zoo he said 
although considered large for a female muke may have met her 
match in colossus she watched him cautiously through the peephole 
in the door dividing their quarters especially when colossus ran 
over and banged on it 
shes concerned i think about his size quinn said hes 
the sylvester stallone of the gorilla world hopefully hell be 
the bing crosby of the gorilla world 
and quinn wasnt referring to crosbys crooning ability 
although colossus has been very vocal since mukes arrival tuesday 
night 
muke was driven to pensacola in a wellvented trailer stopping 
at burger king restaurants en route for fruit and vegetable snacks 
but no hamburgers since gorillas are vegetarians the restaurant 
chain sponsored the 10000 1daylong trip 
dr mabon pugh a pensacola veterinarian who examined muke when 
she was tranquilized before the move said the animal appears 
normal in every respect but for some reason has been unable to 
breed 
the gorilla species survival committee of the american 
association of zoos and aquariums which arranged the match is 
hoping colossus will be the answer to her dreams 
because colossus has no experience with another gorilla the two 
will be kept in separate indoor quarters while timesharing a 
7000foot outdoor enclosure until they show signs of 
compatibility until then they will be able to see smell and 
touch each other through the peephole it isnt big enough 
however to permit them to grab or hold hands 
hes been a peeping gorilla today quinn quipped 
eventually the plan is to open a door enough for muke to visit 
colossus but not enough for him to crawl through leaving her with 
an escape route if necessary 
quinn figures hell be able to tell when they are ready to meet 
when they start knocking the paint off the walls a more subtle 
indication he said would be the sharing of food

farmers almanac 
smith a regular reader of the almanac asked whether the 
196yearold publications forecasters having missed the midwests 
drought could at least predict the dry spells end 
he received a pretty dry answer from judson d hale sr editor 
of the almanac 
we didnt predict that it was coming and we cant predict when 
it will end hale wrote smith who lives in suburban terrace park 
the almanac claims to be 80 percent accurate but hale 
acknowledged that it doesnt predict weather for spring and summer 
too well 
this year it predicted that it would be warmer and wetter than 
normal in the greater ohio valley heavy rain was predicted for 
june 14 to 17 
the almanac usually gathers statistics for its predictions six 
to 18 months in advance the predictions are based on such 
information as changes in sun spots the size of polar ice caps 
and the location of warm water currents 
our 1989 edition will be published in november it is really 
hard to nail down the weather for spring and summer that far in 
advance because so many things happen hale said 
they have been a little off before but never this far 
smith said they said we would be about half an inch off but not

senior labor party legislator abba eban 
a founding father of the jewish state and its leading spokesman for 
years has been ousted from israeli politics after a generation in 
its vanguard 
the 73yearold eban a former deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister failed in his bid wednesday to win a slot on the party 
slate for the november elections to the israeli parliament 
under the israeli system each party makes a list of people to 
fill the seats it wins in the 120member knesset the number of 
seats assigned to a party depends on its total vote 
after the labor party vote eban wrote to party leader and 
foreign minister shimon peres for a generation i carried the 
partys flag and stated its case throughout the country and the 
world and many listened to me 
its clear i cannot keep carrying the flag as i did in the 
past because the party leadership took away my right to do so 
eban said he would now dedicate his time to writing books and 
participating in a television series on israels history 
the tall portly eban is known for his sophisticated oratory 
and israels first prime minister david bengurion once described 
him as the voice of the hebrew nation 
in his 40year political career eban also served as israels 
ambassador to the united states and the united nations 
referring to his appeal abroad eban once said i could have 
been elected prime minister if people abroad could vote in israeli 
elections 
in domestic party politics eban never played a central role 
partially because his upperclass mannerisms and love of academia 
set him apart from many of his colleagues 
since 1984 eban has served as chairman of parliaments defense 
and foreign affairs committee a position of influence but with 
little direct power 
eban was born feb 2 1915 in capetown south africa and his 
family moved to england when he was a child he attended queens 
college cambridge where he received first class honors in 
classics hebrew and arabic and persian 
during world war ii he joined the british army when the war 
ended he joined the jewish agency political department the 
forerunner of israels foreign ministry and was sent to the united 
nations to help fight for a jewish state 
his skill as a speaker was instrumental in persuading the united 
nations to pass the nov 29 1947 palestine partition resolution 
that granted the jews a homeland israel was declared a state a 
year later 
ebans ouster wednesday was in part an apparent payback for his 
criticism of party leaders for the jonathan jay pollard spy case 
pollard a 33yearold american jew was sentenced to life in 
prison in march 1987 for selling classified us military documents 
to israel 
eban made waves in the party last year when a knesset 
investigating committee he headed blamed peres and defense minister 
yitzhak rabin a party member for not supervising those involved 
in the pollard operation 
peres was prime minister when pollard was working for israel

the outlawed communist party departed from its 
previous radical stance and said it will participate in a 
presidential election in which the only candidate will be nominated 
by the military 
the communists were until now the only major opposition group 
refusing to participate they had called for all forms of 
struggle including violence to put an end to the military 
regime of president augusto pinochet 
the partys central committee said wednesday that the new 
position was prompted by a new socialpolitical picture in the 
country resulting from the oppositions social mobilization and 
intense political battle 
but patricio aylwin a christian democratic leader said the 
communists still will remain excluded from a group of 14 moderate 
opposition parties united for the vote 
according to the 1980 militarydrafted constitution the 
election will take place at an unspecified date later this year or 
early 1989 
citizens will only be able to vote yes or no on a 
candidate to be nominated by the commanders of the three armed 
services and the head of the national police 
pinochet 72 who has ruled since a 1973 coup is considered the 
most likely candidate 
four communist leaders said at a news conference that they still 
think the government will try to win the plebiscite fraudulently 
and called for labor unrest and street demonstrations 
jose sanfuentes a party leader said the victory of the no 
in the plebiscite should mean an immediate end to the dictatorship 
and its fascist legislation he said it should lead to a 
transitional democratic government to call an early competitive 
presidential election 
the moderate opposition says a no victory should be followed

chinese police today accused the foreign media of 
sheer fabrications in reporting a student sitin it was the 
second attack in a week on foreign accounts of student unrest 
the official xinhua news agency quoted wang jingrong a 
spokesman for the ministry of public security as saying foreign 
journalists reported students were arrested or beaten by police at 
sitin friday on academic issues 
such stories in some foreign media are sheer fabrications 
xinhua quoted wang as saying 
he confirmed that police broke up the protest outside 
zhongnanhai in beijing a walled compound that houses party 
headquarters and residences for top leaders the students were from 
changchun in northeast chinas jilin province 
but in a telephone interview wang refused to give details of 
how the protest was broken up 
no western reporters saw the brief sitin the french news 
agency agence francepresse quoted a witness as saying police led 
away about 60 protesters and said police later confirmed the 
students were taken away 
but afp said it did not report any police beatings of the 
students and the target of wangs criticism was not immediately 
clear 
last week xinhua accused the us government voice of america 
radio of falsely reporting a student was arrested in a separate 
sitin june 8 voa denied the charge and said it only reported 
that one person was led away by police 
that sitin involved about a dozen beijing university students 
who were trying to hold a prodemocracy protest in central 
beijings tiananmen square hundreds of students had rallied on 
campus and planned a march to the square but police cordoned it 
off and no march was held 
the protest friday involved students who attended an 
unaccredited special training course in changchun and wanted 
government accreditation for their diplomas the official china 
daily said 
it quoted wang as saying police stopped the sitin because the 
students violated the rules for maintaining social order by 
interfering in the work of the government 
the incident prompted a state education commission announcement 
tuesday calling for a crackdown on unauthorized schools and 
training classes that lack official accreditation 
a growing number of such classes have been set up privately and 
by work units in recent years generally to teach english and 
technical subjects because of a shortage of places in accredited 
schools but their certificates or degrees are not recognized by 
wouldbe employers 
officials have made it clear they will not tolerate a repeat of 
the massive student protests of the winter of 198687 when 
thousands of students in beijing and other major cities marched 
through the streets to demand democracy and freedom 
those protests ended with a crackdown on westernstyle 
liberalism and the ouster by conservatives of communist party chief 
hu yaobang for failing to halt the protests quickly enough

portauprince haiti ap president leslie manigat has 
rejected the transfers of several highranking army officers 
publicly challenging for the first time the powerful military 
command that ensured his election 
the apparent power struggle began when lt gen henri namphy 
head of the threeman junta that ran haiti until manigats election 
in january ordered the transfers or retirements 
manigat on wednesday overruled the orders claiming they were 
unconstitutional since he had not been consulted 
on wednesday night the army general staff issued a statement 
pledging loyalty to manigat and delaying the transfer orders 
it has been decided after a meeting with the president and 
the minister of defense to temporarily put off the above mentioned 
steps said the statement broadcast on the private radio haiti 
inter 
the transfer and retirement of certain highranking officers 
and other officers decided tuesday morning by the 
commanderinchief had been rescinded to avoid a major 
crisis said the statement from the national palace read on local 
radio stations 
it was unclear whether manigat had prevailed 
the situation is grave said a western diplomat speaking on 
condition of anonymity either the general submits to manigats 
ultimatum or there will be a standoff between the government and 
the army there is fear of a clash 
one of the officers namphy tried to reassign is col jeanclaude 
paul who heads the widelyfeared dessalines battalion and was 
indicted in the united states on drug trafficking charges in march 
haiti inter quoting an unidentified military source said 
namphy ordered paul relieved of his command of the 700man 
battalion and named assistant chief of staff a largely 
administrative position 
soldiers under pauls command have been blamed for widespread 
violence against voters that forced the cancellation of last 
novembers independently adminstrated general elections and left 
more than 30 people dead 
manigat the armys candidate in the jan 17 juntarun 
elections has always claimed that he could govern independent of 
the army which has controlled haiti during most of its 184year 
history 
a government spokeswoman said wednesday that everyone was 
waiting to see what would happen 
this is certainly a moment of crisis said anaise chavenet 
spokeswoman for the ministry of information 
manigat scheduled a news conference for this morning 
the armys statement signed by general secretary of the general 
staff col gary leon also said the high command reaffirmed its 
unreserved loyalty to the government of the state within the 
framework of constitutional and legal provisions 
namphy was head of the threeman junta that ruled haiti for two 
years after dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled into exile in france 
in february 1986 
manigat a former political science professor was elected in 
armysupervised balloting that was boycotted by the opposition that 
foreign observers said was fraught with fraud 
the united states cut off most of its aid to haiti after the 
aborted november balloting 
paul was indicted in march by a grand jury in miami on charges 
of conspiring to import 220 pounds of cocaine into the united 
states from latin america in december 1986 he has denied the 
charges 
last week foreign minister gerard latortue said in washington 
dc that his government is ready to open an investigation into 
pauls alleged drug connection as soon as it officially receives 
the evidence from the united states 
us embassy spokesman jeffrey lite said details of the charges 
were delivered to haitian authorities last week 
manigat a social democrat considered rightofcenter and 
staunchly anticommunist has done little to alleviate haitis most 
pressing problems 
haiti which a population of 6 million is the poorest country 
in the western hemisphere it shares the island of hispaniola with 
the dominican republic

people lacking commitment to jesus 
will be consigned to hell southern baptists declared while 
moderates marched to the alamo and tore up a resolution they said 
meant a denominational dictatorship 
some believe that hell is not a reality and its corollary 
that all people will eventually be saved said a resolution 
approved wednesday by the nations largest protestant denomination 
at its annual convention 
we affirm our belief in the biblical truth that those without 
a personal commitment to jesus christ will be consigned to a 
literal hell the place of everlasting separation from god 
being saved from it comes only by repentence regeneration 
through faith in jesus christ the resolution said no one is 
saved apart from that transforming experience 
the resolution approved overwhelmingly represents no change in 
doctrine by the 147 millionmember denomination but it was 
unusual since the subject of hell is rarely discussed in most 
mainstream pulpits or by church conventions because so little is 
concluded about it 
it also seemed to reflect the fundamentalist position that 
nonchristians must be brought to christ or be condemned to hell a 
thesis that has not been advanced by mainline churches in modern 
times 
a regional interfaith director for the southern baptist missions 
board in new jersey was ousted earlier this year by fundamentalist 
pressure because he held that gods covenant with jews remains 
permanent and valid 
fundamentalists have held the presidency of the southern baptist 
convention for nine years they maintained their grip with the 
election tuesday of another fundamentalist the rev jerry vines of 
jacksonville fla who narrowly defeated the moderate candidate 
the rev richard jackson of phoenix ariz for the oneyear term 
through presidential appointive powers fundamentalists have 
brought the vast network of denominational operations under their 
control 
the resolution was one of several approved as the annual meeting 
of 32600 messengers as the delegates are known neared its 
close today 
with the fundamentalist wing predominating the convention also 
limited the historic protestant concept of the equality of laity 
and clergy 
that view expressed in the phrase priesthood of the 
believer was a key concept of the 16th century reformation 
which rejected the clerical domination in the roman catholic church 
the convention said the concept in no way contradicts the 
authority of the pastor which is seen in the command to the local 
church in hebrews 1317 obey your leaders and submit to them 
after the resolution was approved by a twothirds vote sharply 
divided between moderates and fundamentalists about 200 moderates 
staged a protest march to the alamo the cradle of texas liberty 
there they ripped up copies of the resolution and denounced it 
as heresy and a betrayal of protestant heritage 
this cuts at the soul of what baptist congregations are all 
about said the rev randall lolley driven from the presidency 
of southeastern baptist theological seminary by 
fundamenalistimposed controls on choosing faculty 
the resolution states that misunderstanding and abuse of the 
egalitarian doctrine has led to a mistaken attitude that a 
christian may believe what he so chooses and still be considered 
a loyal southern baptist 
it also has been used in undermining of pastoral authority 
but does not contravene the responsibility and authority of the 
pastor the resolution said 
moderates shouted from the floor during the tumultuous debate 
that the resolution was akin to a papal system of clerical 
control and violated jesus teaching that ministers were to be 
servants not masters 
what its talking about is denominational dictatorship said 
the rev buckner fanning of san antonio it says the only way to 
lead is by blind obedience

a prominent journalist has proposed radically 
altering soviet politics so the people elect their chief executive 
by secret ballot and power is transferred from the communist party 
to the government 
fyodor burlatsky calls for the changes in this weeks edition of 
the literary newspaper literaturnaya gazeta 
he says the soviet unions parliament the supreme soviet 
should be given broad powers including the right to allocate the 
budget and impeach the president the body now merely ratifies the 
communist leaderships decisions 
the main thesis of burlatsky a former kremlin adviser and 
prominent soviet political thinker is that the government should 
be strengthened to the detriment of the party which now holds a 
monopoly on political power 
russia had some elements of democracy before but never had 
liberal traditions the freedom of an individual from 
interference by the state burlatsky wrote russia never had 
any notion about basic human rights 
the farreaching article in the weekly newspaper of the writers 
union is one of the most radical critiques of the system yet to 
appear under the auspices of mikhail s gorbachevs program of 
liberalization 
burlatsky expands on points included in proposals to be 
discussed at an extraordinariy communist party conference that 
begins june 28 
he says the countrys leader should be elected by direct and 
secret ballot by all the people rather than in a meeting of the 
politburo of the communist party central committee 
burlatsky suggests a candidate should first attain the post of 
party general secretary now the highest soviet office then run 
for president 
he does not say if more than one candidate should be allowed to 
run for each office the writer also calls for the creation of the 
post of vice president 
supporters of the gorbachev reforms say their efforts are 
hampered by conservative officials in the party and government who 
stand to lose power and privilege 
conservatives blocked burlatsky and other outspoken reformers 
from being included among the 5000 delegates to the party 
conference the conference can debate and set party policy but is 
not expected to make leadership changes 
burlatsky is vice presdident of the soviet political science 
association and a regular contributor to literaturnaya gazeta 
he first gained prominence as an adviser to nikita khrushchev 
who was ousted as soviet leader in 1964 by a group which included 
leonid i brezhnev who lead the soviet union until his death in 
1982

despite declining membership and financial 
shortfalls the nations largest presbyterian denomination is 
healthy and ready to become a major force says the man in charge 
of the churchs 98 million mission budget 
s david stoner executive director of the general assembly 
council of the presbyterian church usa said finances have 
been worrisome for some time in the 3millionmember church 
the denomination wednesday concluded its nineday annual meeting 
after approving a 1087 million budget that includes a 51 
million deficit stoner said the churchs 11600 congregations 
would be challenged to make up the shortfall 
budget concerns surfaced frequently during the 200th annual 
meeting stoner said much of the problem stems from continuing 
efforts to merge two presbyterian groups 
the united presbyterian church usa joined with the smaller 
mainly southern presbyterian church us five years ago ending 
a 121yearold split stemming from the civil war 
this was the first real assembly of the new denomination he 
said and decisions in st louis provide a stage for true vigor 
we are going to be able to build together 
stoner said the assemblys actions would help set priorities for 
the general assembly council as it goes about allocating the money 
among competing interests 
the revisions and final adoption tuesday of christian 
obedience in a nuclear age a major policy statement that has 
been blamed for some divisiveness in the church will help heal 
those splits stoner and others said 
the rev harry hassell an associate pastor at the 
denominations largest church highland park in dallas and an 
original opponent of the christian obedience paper said he was 
elated by the final product which was reworded to make it clear 
civil disobedience or tax resistance by those opposed to government 
policies were unusual courses for christians 
for the first time in a long while we have a perspective in 
the broad middle hassell said 
the paper says nuclear war is immoral and the theory of nuclear 
deterrence as an adequate permanent means to national security 
is not morally defensible 
it says civil disobedience is justifiable in certain 
circumstances and the church should at least emotionally support 
its members who make that decision 
in other actions during the assembly the denomination 
voted for a new study of the denominations prochoice stance 
on abortion antiabortion groups narrowly persuaded the assembly 
to review the 3yearold policy 
condemned israels repressive handling of palestinian 
uprisings in the west bank and gaza strip calling for the nation 
to end its occupation of the territories and for the united states 
and israel to participate in a united nationssponsored 
international peace conference 
adopted a wideranging statement on religious liberty saying 
government increasingly is intruding on church affairs

health services and supported the adoption of a national health

sen paul simon says vice president george 
bushs education proposals are cotton candy for schools that 
need meat and potatoes 
simon an illinois who lost his bid for the democratic 
presidential nomination said wednesday that bushs ideas lack 
vision about what has to be done to bring a firstrate education to 
every american child 
bush on tuesday unveiled 600 million in new or expanded 
education programs including a 500 million national merit schools 
plan that would furnish 100000 awards to schools that make 
strides in educating the disadvantaged 
but simon said bushs statement that he wants to be the 
education president sounds like an electionyear conversion 
after eight years of not lifting one finger while the white 
house was seeking deep cuts in education simon said mr bush 
has a great credibility problem with the claim that he intends to 
be the education president

guerrillas loyal to plo chief yasser 
arafat fought syrianbacked mutineers with mortars and 
rocketpropelled grenades in two refugee camps killing seven 
people and wounding 16 police said today 
the overnight battle brought the toll to 26 killed and 117 
wounded since fighting for control of chatilla and bourj 
elbarajneh broke out last week 
the fighting pitted guerrillas of the palestine liberation 
organizations mainstream fatah faction and adversaries of the 
fatahuprising a group that rebelled against arafats leadership 
in may 1983 
the clashes raged all night and faded into sporadic exchanges of 
sniper fire this morning police said 
a security committee comprising guerrilla officers from seven 
other plo factions not been involved in the fighting was trying to 
arrange for observers to enforce a truce in the two shantytowns 
a police spokesman said two libyan observers would be stationed 
at each of the two camps along with fighters from the seven neutral 
factions 
the disengagement force also will supervise the implementation 
of a ceasefire reached in damascus syria on monday 
the fatah rebels are led by col saeed mousa they have been 
based in damascus since the mutiny began 
arafats loyalists dislodged mousas fighters from the two camps 
in previous rounds of fighting but mousas guerrillas regrouped 
and this week mounted new assaults seeking to regain their old 
positions 
syria has about 40000 troops in lebanon they are stationed in 
east and north lebanon moslem west beirut and beirut suburbs next 
to the camps 
a palestinian source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the libyan observers will be drawn from a 300strong contingent 
based in east lebanon since 1982 when it came to lebanon to help 
fight the israeli invasion 
the independent beirut daily newspaper annahar reported tuesday 
that libyan leader col moammar gadhafi has ordered the withdrawal 
of his contingent from lebanon

clear of fans most had boarded outbound trains streets in the 
citys old section were also quiet police said

recurrence of the rampant vandalism and running battles that 
erupted among rowdies in the city tuesday night 
it wasnt as bad as we had feared said police spokesman 
wolfgang rodax adding that most of the violence was initiated by 
west german fans 
the english were not the problem rodax said 
west german television late wednesday showed a pistol 
confiscated from one of the rowdies but did not identify its owner

factfinding mission in duesseldorf for prime minister margaret 
thatcher to look into the clashes also strongly denounced the 
violence 
moynihan also speaking to the press association said of the

the man with the shabby clothes and the faraway 
look ambled down west 46th street behind him strode six guardian 
angels making sure he kept on ambling through restaurant row and 
out of the neighborhood off broadway 
hes not going to sell drugs with us around travis 
ace stephens head of the angels operation said wednesday 
night as he watched the parade 
the angels were recruited last week by a group of 15 
restaurateurs who claimed increased drug dealing on the street had 
cut their business by as much as 20 percent 
the resulting publicity however also may be hurting business 
said frank medlin manager of carolina one of the participating 
restaurants though he thinks the angels are doing a wonderful 
job 
we have alerted everyone that west 46th street is combat 
alley he said we may have a safer block with no one on it 
despite debates over whether the patrols are good or bad 
whether the angels are violating peoples rights and despite 
attacks on two angels on saturday that resulted in the 
hospitalization of a 16yearold angel the angels will continue 
slammin and jammin leader curtis sliwa said 
that means holding suspected drug dealers up against a wall 
under citizens arrest until police arrive those carrying just a 
little crack may get off with crushed vials and a shove 
its not a block watch or a crime watch its physical 
intervention sliwa said its action 
the angels on wednesday expanded their patrols into the broadway 
theater district and neighboring hells kitchen a neighborhood 
plagued by a drug problem he said 
the angels began their watch june 7 in return for a headquarters 
in the closed cafe de france and meals from restaurants on the 
block between eighth and ninth avenues 
sliwa recalled that he laughed when first approached about 
patrolling restaurant row a pleasant block of brownstones lined 
with more than 20 restaurants near the theater district still he 
agreed to stop by 
were walking down the street sliwa said and dudes were 
cracking it up all over the place 
to get there from the theaters and hotels around times square 
patrons must cross eighth avenue a noisy tawdry thoroughfare 
lined with porno palaces 
bringing in the angels while complaining about a lack of police 
protection naturally led to tension between the civilian patrol and 
the police department 
two angels were arrested sunday and charged with menacing and 
harassing a man on the sidewalk even the police have no right to 
tell someone to get off the block said assistant chief thomas 
walsh 
police officials told sliwa on sunday night that the angels must 
refrain from harassing people they suspect of drug dealing they 
could make a citizens arrest only if they witnessed a crime 
wednesday afternoon angels grabbed a man they said had been 
selling crack called police and held him until officers arrived 
and arrested him on a charge of criminal possession of a controlled 
substance it was the first such arrest since sunday 
they do good but they can be a hazard said joseph dirdis 
45 as he sat on the steps outside his 46th street apartment 
building they move as a group and they react very fast they 
have to take it easy they make me a little uncomfortable 
but wednesday night many passersby greeted the angels with 
encouragement keep up the good work and were proud of you 
guys 
these guys arent hurting people who are minding their own 
business said ralph bilby who lives on west 47th street and 
stopped by the angels headquarters to offer support it doesnt 
feel dangerous anymore 
mayor edward i koch asked about the expanding patrols said 
theres nothing wrong with that we can encourage responsible 
citizen involvement 
the angels use methods used by the cop on the beat years 
ago sliwa said before complaints by civil libertarians limited 
their options 
we say just because youve put manacles on your own cops 
dont take away our rights as citizens to make arrests he said 
because of the cops inability to intervene we have picked up 
the slack 
sliwa added we havent changed our tactics its just that 
were in the eye of the storm now

striking scriptwriters have filed unfair 
labor practice charges against 13 production companies but have 
scheduled another meeting with producers in an effort to end their 
4monthold walkout 
the charges were filed with the national labor relations board 
on wednesday said writers guild of america spokeswoman cheryl 
rhoden 
they accuse the companies of bargaining in bad faith by refusing 
to provide information on writers as requested by the guild last 
month ms rhoden said 
the union had requested the names addresses dates of 
employment and rates of pay for persons providing guildcovered 
writing services since march 7 ms rhoden said in a statement 
the companies include walt disney pictures and television for 
its i man production capital citiesabc inc for general 
hospital fox square productions for the late show and 
paramount pictures for the shows mcgyver star trek the 
next generation webster and the naked gun 
the statement was issued late wednesday and the companies could 
not be reached for immediate comment 
representatives of the guild and the alliance of motion picture 
and television producers meanwhile were scheduled to meet again 
this afternoon in a bargaining session that management said could 
conclude negotiations 
although the guild agreed to the meeting ms rhoden said the 
producers are trying to stampede us into a settlement 
sources have said only one issue foreign residual payments 
remains 
top negotiators for the guild and the producers alliance have 
been meeting informally since the parties last formal session 
ended saturday 
on wednesday the producers called for a meeting of the 
bargaining committees to conclude negotiations 
spelled out that means we are going to give them a formal 
proposal based on the intensive meetings we had last week said 
herb steinberg an alliance spokesman 
the latest effort to end the strike comes on the eve of the 
television production season also looming is this weeks scheduled 
start of talks between producers and the international association 
of theatrical stage employees and teamsters unions the stage craft 
workers and drivers contracts expire july 31 
a guild source who spoke on condition of anonymity said major 
issues remain unresolved and we dont anticipate todays 
discussions to result in an imminent end to the strike 
sources have said the guild has accepted a producers formula 
based on sales success for syndicated onehour television shows 
the previous formula had a fixed revenue producers have claimed 
the market for such sales has softened 
but because the guild has accepted a management proposal in 
onehour shows sources said union negotiators want a substantial 
increase for foreign residuals an area that has been booming for 
several years for studios and distributors but has not been 
negotiated for 18 years 
the guild has cited reports from forbes magazine that estimated 
a 49 billion trade surplus for the nationwide entertainment 
industry in 1986 with an estimated surplus of 55 billion for 
1987 second only to the aerospace industry

a chinese official today criticized the european 
parliament for allowing tibets spiritual leader the dalai lama 
to hold a news conference at the parliament building in strasbourg 
france 
the parliament had invited the dalai lama to make a formal 
address but withdrew the invitation after china showed displeasure 
by canceling its invitation to the parliament to send a delegation 
to china 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing refused to comment on the 
dalai lamas offer at his news conference wednesday to accept 
chinese troops in tibet and chinese control over the regions 
external affairs in exchange for greater autonomy in internal 
matters 
li told a weekly news briefing that he could not answer 
questions about tibet because tibet is not a foreign country 
an official who answered the telephone at the nationality 
affairs commission which has responsibility for tibet and other 
minority areas said he could not immediately comment 
li said we are opposed to the provision of a forum to the 
dalai lama for his activities aimed at undermining the unification 
of the motherland by any foreign organizations or individuals 
the dalai lama said wednesday that complete independence for 
tibet is very difficult to achieve 
he suggested a middle way in which china would make tibet a 
selfgoverning democratic political entity while continuing to run 
tibets foreign affairs 
he also agreed to a restricted number of chinese military 
installations in the remote himalayan region 
the proposal was the most conciliatory yet by the dalai lama 
since he fled tibet in 1959 during a failed uprising by his 
followers against chinese rule 
the dalai lama is the spiritual leader of tibetan buddhists 
before the chinese red army entered the remote himalayan region in 
1950 he also was head of its theocratic civil government 
china claims to have had sovereignty over tibet since the 13th 
century but periods of actual control have been sporadic 
the dalai lama has lived since 1959 in india and has repeatedly 
accused the chinese government of systematically violating human 
rights in tibet and oppressing the people by stationing hundreds of 
thousands of soldiers there 
proindependence sentiment remains strong among many tibetans 
especially young buddhist monks monks led antichinese protests in 
october and march in which thousands of tibetatns stoned police and 
attacked official buildings and cars 
at least 38 people were killed in the two protests and hundreds 
were arrested

more than 700 jews who emigrated from the soviet 
union gathered for an emotional reunion that was tinged by a 
concern that many of their compatriots are choosing not to come to 
israel 
the reunion in tel aviv marked the 18th anniversary of an 
unsuccessful attempt by a lenigrad zionist group to hijack a soviet 
plane to israel the attempt was foiled by authorities before the 
passengers even boarded the plane 
in jerusalem soviet film director eldar ryazanov visiting 
israel on a trip that would have been unfathomable several years 
ago told about 1000 soviet jewish immigrants that freedom to 
travel to move is as natural as the freedom to breathe 
ryazanov who is in israel screening his latest film for soviet 
jewish immigrants praised mikhail s gorbachev as the most 
humane leader his country has had in decades 
he also said ties between israel and the soviet union severed 
by the kremlin in 1967 should be renewed his remarks won applause 
from the jerusalem theater audience 
at the tel aviv meeting wednesday night prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said that fervor to emigrate among soviet jews in the 1970s 
left him feeling something close to nostalgia 
no one asked where these people wanted to fly to everyone 
knew they wanted to come to israel shamir said 
more than 90 percent of the jews who left the soviet union last 
month did not come to israel 
hillel butman 55 who was jailed for nine years for his role in 
the hijacking put much of the blame for the high dropout rate on 
the immigrants themselves 
there is still a lot of soviet propoganda and lies about 
israel but the worst is letters from relatives here who write only 
about the bad not the good butman said 
the immigrants prime complaint about israel can be explained in 
one word jobs many of the russian jews are highlyeducated 
professionals with specialized training who have difficulty 
finding appropriate openings here 
its just impossible to find work said moshe liberman an 
engineer with a doctorate who immigrated seven months ago after 
waiting 12 years for an exit visa i could find a job in the 
united states or canada certainly in south africa but we wanted 
to be here 
his wife chana a piano teacher who was fired for her zionist 
activities in 1981 added when we were refuseniks i used to 
tell everyone they must come to israel that this is our state and 
they must be here but now i dont know what i would say 
recent political developments especially the sixmonth 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip have 
discouraged soviet jews from coming to israel said zeev green 
who settled in the northern port town of haifa in 1979 
soviet propoganda is very effective and it is very easy these 
days to take an article from an israeli newspaper condense it and 
make it say that even the israelis admit they kill all arabs and 
have apartheid green said

an army probe that allegedly forced a wedtech 
corp rival out of business included accusations echoing those 
contained in memos sent to attorney general edwin meese iii by a 
friend and wedtech consultant it was reported today 
allegations in memos sent to meese by wedtech consultant robert 
wallach bear a striking similarity to language contained in a 
highly critical army report on the company later issued by the 
army the los angeles times reported in todays editions 
however no link between meese and the investigation of 
houstonbased garcia ordnance corp has been documented the 
newspaper said 
wallach was indicted on charges that he accepted hundreds of 
thousands of dollars from wedtech in an improper attempt to 
influence meese on behalf of the defunct new york defense 
contractor wallach is scheduled to be tried with two associates 
later this year 
garcia ordnance is not mentioned in wallachs indictment 
wedtech received a nobid 32million army engine contract in 
1982 with strong backing from thenmeese aide james e jenkins 
according to testimony in federal court earlier this year and at 
senate hearings last fall 
although many of the allegations made against garcia were never 
proven the newspaper reported its executives were barred from 
doing business with the government 
because the government was the companys only customer garcia 
ordnance was forced out of business when it was barred from 
government work company officers said 
attorneys for meese a presidential counselor during the time he 
received the memos and wallach denied any involvement in 
triggering the garcia probe 
the office of independent counsel james c mckay who is 
investigating meese is aware of the garcia case but refused to 
comment on it according to the times 
army officials refused to disclose what sparked the probe by its 
criminal investigation division that came despite earlier favorable 
reports about the company from military procurement officers 
a dozen garcia officers were indicted for alleged fraud after 
the probe but 11 were acquitted last year by a presiding judge who 
said the case never should have been brought to criminal court 
garcia ordnance president ronald jbolden was convicted of 
submitting five false documents to the army but was cleared of 
charges he conspired to defraud the government by substituting iron 
for steel in an engine crankshaft 
acquitted garcia executive bill parker said army procurement 
officers turned hostile in one month between 1983 and 1984 
the model contractor in december was a bum in january 
parker said why because we were jumping up as a competitor to 
wedtech 
garcia became a serious wedtech competitor in december 1983 
when it was certified as a minorityoperated firm eligible for 
special government contracts wedtech also had the certification 
bolden blamed wedtech and meese for inspiring the case against 
garcia saying army officials told him meese was aligned with 
wedtech and wanted an end to garcias competition 
the 198182 memos from wallach to meese that were obtained by 
the newspaper reportedly denounced garcia as an inexperienced 
company with insufficient resources to handle large government 
contracts 
and in the army criminal investigation division report dated 
june 1 1983 the same arguments were made the newspaper said 
however garcia was highly praised by army engine specialists at 
ft belvoir va in a 1982 report that said the firm was competent 
and professional despite being in business only two years

the state attorney general has begun an 
investigation of a possible hoax by advisers surrounding tawana 
brawley citing a former family aide who called the teenagers 
story of racial assault a pack of lies 
attorney general robert abrams announced wednesday that he had 
subpoenaed perry mckinnon a former aide to the rev al sharpton 
who says sharpton and ms brawleys other advisers are interested 
only in advancing their political goals 
the tawana brawley story may be that there is no tawana 
brawley story mckinnon told reporters 
miss brawley who is black has said she was kidnapped and raped 
by six white men in november she was found behind her apartment 
complex in wappingers falls an upstate new york town partly in a 
plastic bag her hair shorn racial epithets scrawled on her body 
and animal excrement smeared on her 
she and her mother have refused to cooperate in an investigation 
into her claims saying they believe the probe wont be fair 
at a news conference abrams said mckinnons charges if true 
amounted to a damning indictment of the motivation and the 
credibility of sharpton and the two brawley family lawyers alton 
maddox and c vernon mason 
the three advisers in an appearance wednesday on the nationally 
broadcast television talk show donahue denounced mckinnon and 
denied that he had played any role in the brawley case 
as the largely black audience booed and hissed loudly at the 
mention of mckinnons name maddox labeled him a baldfaced liar 
and a desperate man 
mckinnon a 39yearold private investigator who served as an 
aide to sharpton from january until may told the daily news and 
wcbstv that he left the brawley team because the teenagers story 
is all nothing but a pack of lies 
this whole situation is not about tawana brawley its about 
mason and maddox and sharpton taking over the town so to speak 
mckinnon told wcbs he told the news that sharpton said if we 
can win this tawana thing well be the biggest niggers in new 
york 
the real story he told wcbs is the political agenda of 
sharpton mason and maddox 
mckinnon was described by the state attorney general as a 
highlevel intimate of the brawley advisers who was seen in 
close conversation with brawley family members and sharpton 
maddox and mason at demonstrations in poughkeepsie 
the charges deserve immediate and careful attention said 
abrams who was appointed special prosecutor in the case by gov 
mario cuomo he said mckinnon was subpoenaed wednesday to testify 
before the dutchess county grand jury looking into the case 
if mr mckinnon is right then attorneys mason and maddox and 
rev sharpton have been consciously perpetrating a hoax not only 
on the black community but on all the people of the state of new 
york abrams said 
the news and new york post reported that mckinnon would testify 
today 
sharpton however dismissed mckinnon as a guy that drove me 
around if he says the story is a pack of lies why dont you ask 
him what the story is he doesnt know 
i have not confided in him in the least said maddox 
alluding to mckinnons claim that the brawley advisers admitted 
privately that they had no evidence of what happened to their 
client 
miss brawleys mother glenda also appeared on donahue and 
continued to give her unequivocal support to her advisers 
the program was broadcast live from the bethany baptist church 
in brooklyn where mrs brawley has taken religious sanctuary 
to avoid arrest for refusing a subpoena directing her to testify 
before the grand jury investigating her daughters case 
tawana brawleys attorneys asked for a new special prosecutor in 
the case and accused abrams of conducting a racially biased 
investigation

two vials of blood found on the new jersey 
shore earlier this month contained the aids antibody the health 
department said but it stressed that the samples posed virtually 
no risk to swimmers 
there hasnt been any evidence of aids contamination with such 
samples thomas burke acting health commissioner said wednesday 
the samples which have been turned over to the attorney 
generals office for further investigation were discovered june 3 
or 4 burke said at a news conference 
one vial was found on ortley beach and the other on the north 
side of island beach state park both in ocean county burke said 
officials didnt know how long they had been there 
beach patrols discovered five glass tubes each about 5 inches 
long and less than an inch in diameter containing coagulated 
blood said burke only two were found to have evidence of the aids 
antibody he said 
presence of the aids antibody means the blood came from 
individuals who carry the aids virus and will probably develop the 
fatal disease said burke 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys ability 
to defend itself against disease 
we do not have a threat of aids or aids contamination from 
these samples said burke 
the vials were found at about the same time as some syringes 
health officials could not determine where the items came from 
except that they probably originated from a clinic or hospital 
burke is temporarily replacing commissioner dr molly j coye 
who is in stockholm sweden for an international aids conference

indian peacekeeping troops cordoned 
off a tamil town in eastern sri lanka today and began rounding up 
suspected rebels area residents and diplomatic sources said 
in india meanwhile a newspaper reported that the main tamil 
rebel group in sri lanka has agreed in principle to surrender most 
of its arms in exchange for the rehabilitation of its fighters 
residents of batticola 135 miles east of colombo said by 
telephone that indian troops had surrounded the adjacent town of 
kallady at about dawn today and had rounded up hundreds of tamils 
for questioning 
a spokeswoman for the indian high commission or embassy in 
colombo said only that indian troops are continuing their search 
for tamil tiger arms and fighters she spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the staterun daily news today quoted indian sources as saying 
indian troops captured 21 tamil rebels wednesday including four 
guerrilla leaders 
it said the rebels were arrested during white flag protests 
in the northern and eastern provinces where tamils predominate 
hundreds of tamil homes were decked with white flags wednesday 
to underscore a demand that india begin negotiations with the 
rebels 
in july president junius jayewardene of sri lanka signed an 
indiansponsored peace accord aimed at ending the tamils guerrilla 
war 
but the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest of the 
rebel groups rejected the pact and continued fighting for a 
separate homeland 
the englishlanguage indian express today quoted unidentified 
tamil leaders in the southern indian city of madras as saying an 
agreement was in the works between the tigers and the indian 
government 
the express said the two sides still were negotiating the period 
of time over which the rebels would surrender their arms and their 
role in restoring peace after five years of guerrilla warfare 
the story did not specify exactly what is meant by 
rehabilitation but the word is generally used to mean helping the 
combatants shift from soldiering to more socially useful 
occupations 
the paper said the agreement could be announced as early as 
friday when indian prime minister rajiv gandhi visits madras 
an indian official in new delhi speaking on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press that the report was 
speculative but that indian officials had been talking with the 
tamil rebels 
india became involved in the sri lankan war because it is the 
dominant power in the region and because of the sympathies of its 
own 60 million tamils to the separatist rebels cause 
india has sent at least 50000 troops to sri lanka to police the 
ceasefire called for in the july agreement and this force has 
inflicted a series of defeats on the rebels in recent weeks 
tamils who are mostly hindus comprise 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people they claim discrimination by the 
sinhalese buddhists who form 75 percent of the population and 
control the government and military

the irish republican army vowed 
today to wage unceasing war against britain after a guerrilla 
bomb blew up at a festive foot race packed with people killing six 
soldiers and wounding 10 civilians 
the iras belfast brigade claimed responsibility for wednesday 
nights bombing the guerrilla groups deadliest attack in seven 
months in a statement today to news media in belfast 
ira guerrillas slipped into the predominantly protestant town of 
lisburn headquarters of the british army in northern ireland and 
wired a bomb containing seven pounds of explosives to an unmarked 
army van the statement said 
the blue van exploded as six soldiers rode away in it after 
taking part in halfmarathon of 13 miles that had attracted 4250 
competitors to lisburn seven miles southwest of belfast 
all six soldiers were killed bringing this years death toll 
from the provinces sectarian violence to 38 eight this week alone 
mayor billy bleakes said the town was in shock and disbelief 
that any human being could do this to other human beings 
none of the civilians including an 80yearold man and a 
2yearold boy suffered serious injuries police said 
valerie fleming 28 who lives nearby said the town was 
packed with people they were running about screaming there 
were children and families they were terrified 
the death toll was the highest since an ira bombing at a war 
memorial ceremony in enniskillen on nov 8 the ira said that bomb 
was meant to kill soldiers but accidentally massacred 11 protestant 
civilians 
the explosion occurred as the van moved through the town center 
which was thronged with runners and spectators leaving the charity 
run 
nigel sands 19 who was two cars behind the van said he saw 
smoke then heard a loud explosion and i saw two bodies lying in 
the middle of the road one of them had no legs and one of them 
was burning it as badly mutilated it seems they were blown from 
the van there was panic and people were running everywhere 
although police said they received no warning before the blast 
the ira said every care was exercised by our volunteers to 
ensure the minimum risk to the local population 
the statement said the british presence in northern ireland 
oppressed the irish people adding 
until that presence is removed and the irish people as a unit 
can exercise our right to national selfdetermination the irish 
republican army will continue to wage unceasing war against the 
british crown forces and the british colonial presence 
prime minister margaret thatchers representative in the 
province northern ireland secretary tom king toured the bomb 
scene today and told reporters later the attack revealed the 
vileness of terrorism which we have to face 
king said however that the security forces had not taken 
adequate security precautions to prevent the bombing 
british soldiers and police are the main targets of the ira in 
its nearly 20year war to oust the british from northern ireland 
and unite the protestantdominated province with the mainly roman 
catholic irish republic 
police on today cordoned the area where the bomb went off 
townspeople gathered in clusters by ribbon barrier gazing in 
silence at the vans gutted hulk 
belfasts irish news the provinces main catholic newspaper 
said the ira had opened another bloodstained chapter in their 
perverted history the result of their savagery will only be to 
harden hearts and block progress towards an eventual solution 
it was the armys worst blow since a 1982 bombing in a pub near 
londonderry killed 11 soldiers and six civilians an ira offshoot 
the irish national liberation army claimed responsibility for that 
attack

two pairs of red wolves that were released 
into the wilderness have produced pups a milestone in wildlife 
officials efforts to reintroduce the species into its natural 
habitat authorities say 
the sightings of two wolf pups mark the first time that a 
species previously extinct in the wild has successfully produced 
offspring after being returned to its natural environment said 
michael phillips a biologist at the alligator river national 
wildlife refuge near manteo 
the animals have been declared extinct in the wild since 1980 
one pup has been seen six or seven times with its mother 
phillips said then we spotted another of the females with a pup 
this past saturday this is great it shows just how well the 
animals have adapted 
phillips said the first pup appeared to be about six weeks old 
the second about five weeks both appeared to be healthy 
alhough litters usually average five or six pups there have 
been no sightings to indicate that more than one survived from 
either of the two litters phillips said 
but warren parker the coordinator for the us fish and 
wildlife services red wolf project was more hopeful we cant 
confirm it but we think there might be more pups that survived in 
the second litter parker told the news and observer of raleigh 
there are many hazards out there for a young pup to 
confront parker said rattlesnakes diseases parasite 
problems all sorts of things its a pretty hostile environment 
parker said the second female had recently moved her litter 
after her mate was hit by a car and killed may 29 generally the 
males provide the food for the first few weeks he said with 
his death shes had to handle it all so she just found a better 
location 
after the pups are 7 months old theyll get radio transmitters 
similar to the ones worn by the adult wolves to keep track of them 
a vast population of red wolves once roamed the southeast but 
teetered near extinction in the late 1970s in 1978 the last pure 
red wolves were taken from the wild to a tacoma wash zoo where 
breeding in captivity encouraged biologists to try reintroducing 
the animals into the wild 
since september 1987 four pairs of wolves have been released in 
the alligator refuge in coastal north carolina in addition to the 
death of the male wolf two females have apparently died of natural 
causes

carlisle floyds 1956 opera susannah in which an isolated 
young woman is seduced by a hypocritical backwoods tennessee 
preacher 
in the commercial the voice of swaggart is heard to say i do 
not plan in any way to whitewash my sin i have no one but myself 
to blame 
swaggart a louisianabased television preacher made the 
statement during a february speech to his congregation he never 
specified the sin but he was reported to have met several times 
with a prostitute at a new orleans motel to watch her perform 
sexual acts he has not denied those reports 
were looking into this to see if theres a violation of our 
copyrights said william treeby a new orleans attorney who is a 
board member of the jimmy swaggart ministries 
we are not going to comment further just examine it from a 
legal standpoint they dont have the right to use material that 
weve copyrighted 
he said the ministries have copyrighted the swaggart confession

president reagan says it would be 
ridiculous to assume that the nicaraguan sandinistas will 
negotiate democratic reforms without military pressure from the 
contra rebels 
reagan on wednesday reopened the possibility he will ask 
congress to approve new aid for the resistance fighters in the wake 
of the collapse of peace talks with the sandinistas 
both reagan and secretary of state george p shultz hinted 
strongly that theyll move for more aid while contra leaders met 
with lawmakers on capitol hill to press their case 
the administration has suffered a long series of setbacks in 
congress on the contra aid issue officials this week have been 
holding strategy meetings with the rebel leaders and reagan 
discussed the issue wednesday with several procontra congressmen 
in an interview with journalists from countries participating in 
the sevennation economic summit opening sunday in toronto reagan 
was asked if military pressure was needed to get the collapsed 
nicaraguan peace talks back on track 
i think it is so apparent that that is what is necessary it 
would be ridiculous for us for anyone to oppose it he 
replied 
we went along with the peace plan that was agreed to among all 
the central american states and to give it a chance it is 
apparent that the sandinistas are not going to democratize 
he went a step further in the interview excerpts of which were 
released by the white house 
if the united states wants the sandinistas and contras to 
continue seeking a peace plan to go with the ceasefire agreed to 
last march reagan said weve got to restore the threat to the 
sandinistas that they must see that the people of nicaragua do 
have a force there that can be used to bring about an equitable 
settlement 
shultz taking part in a presummit briefing at the white house 
said the peacemaking process needs an extra shove 
administration officials had said previously they were wary of 
advancing a military aid package since similar plans had been dealt 
severe setbacks in recent months 
but shultz when asked if the climate on capitol hill had 
changed replied that is the general perception that the 
reality of the situation is beginning to sink in and we can see it 
in newspaper editorials we can see it in the attitudes expressed 
by members of the congress 
whether it has sunk in to the point where the results of a 
vote would be changed is yet to be seen he said 
the house on feb 3 defeated a proposal by reagan for additional 
military aid us assistance is now limited to a 48 million 
humanitarian aid providing nonlethal supplies to the rebels 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan reassured the 
procontra legislators earlier wednesday that he would not abandon 
his attempt to aid the insurgents but he conceded that we dont 
have options at this point in terms of any specific package 
fitzwater said the administration was consulting with members of 
congress and that veteran diplomat max kampelman had been sent on a 
special mission to discuss the situation with leaders of el 
salvador costa rica and guatemala 
rep mickey edwards rokla said he and others sought the 
meeting with reagan out of a concern that the white house had given 
up on the contra issue after multiple setbacks earlier this year in 
the house 
it was necessary i think for some of us to point out that 
with the moscow summit and now the toronto summit and a lot of 
other things occupying the white house that we thought it was 
important that he keep the attention focused on central america as 
well edwards said 
in the house on wednesday rep leon panetta dcalif and 145 
cosponsors introduced a resolution calling on the president to 
provide congress with information on how the administration is 
spending the humanitarian aid package approved in april 
panetta said he was concerned about cash payments being made 
directly to the rebels without verification that the money was 
being used for the nonlethal purposes congress required when it 
approved the assistance 
joao baeana soares secretary general of the organization of 
american states told an oas meeting that the opportunity is 
there to try to find a peaceful solution between the sandinistas 
and contras 
the brazilian diplomat is an official observer at the peace 
talks

march 20 
an arab witness said the suspects were made to stand on one foot 
while being questioned 
also today dozens of jewish settlers some donning prayer 
shawls blocked a major west bank highway for two hours to demand 
harsh army action against palestinian firebombers 
and president chaim herzog sharply criticized foreign news

publication of halftruths and occasionally even worse than 
blatant lies about israel

by a bullet an army spokesman said he added that it was not 
immmediately known if the soldier was in uniform 
the wounded soldier was taken by helicopter to a tel aviv 
hospital and the circumstances of the injury are being 
investigated the spokesman said refusing to elaborate

live nearby were stopped from entering or leaving nablus a united 
nations vehicle as well as one belonging to the red cross were

outside nablus and an equal number were queued inside the city 
waiting to pass a roadblock manned by three jeeploads of troops a 
helicopter hovered overhead 
arab witnesses said troops rounded up dozens of palestinians and 
fired shots in the air

army set up about 10 roadblocks in the city center rounded up

efrat used their cars to block the major jerusalemhebron highway 
the route to jobs in israel for thousands of arab workers israel 
radio reported 
the army responded to the increase in firebomb attacks with 
orders this week to shoot firebombers 
herzog the former army intelligence chief said world leaders 
made decisions about israel based on television newscasts which he 
said contained a considerable degree of bias 
the 30minute speech during a conference on israel and the media 
at hebrew university in jerusalem was herzogs most critical 
attack but not his first on the media it underscored rising 
israeli criticism of foreign journalists triggered by wide coverage 
of the violence

aides to the chief justice of the 
supreme court said today he would resign and 279 judges called for 
a judicial system that would protect basic rights and be 
independent of the executive branch 
the aides said chief justice kim yongchul would formally offer 
his resignation friday to president roh taewoo 
opposition parties had called for a new chief justice to reform 
the tarnished judiciary 
on wednesday 85 junior judges called for sweeping judicial 
reforms and an overhaul of the nations highest court it was the 
first time in modern korean history that judges staged a collective 
action to support reforms 
the judiciary is facing a crisis because it has done little to 
reform itself despite high popular expectations for democracy 
the judges said in a statement 
today 194 more judges across the country issued statements 
supporting the statement and the number is expected to swell 
south korea has a total of 940 judges 
in a conference today senior government and governing party 
officials decided to accept kims resignation but they expressed 
regret over the judges action which they said would have a 
serious political and social effect 
the judges said the judiciary has failed to guarantee the korean 
people their basic rights forcing them to promote such rights 
through their own sacrifice and effort 
the judges action came as the government debated the makeup of 
the supreme court to be formed according to a new constitution 
written after widespread public protests last year 
kim who took office in 1986 said earlier he had no desire to 
cling to the post

a french woman said today that published 
photographs of a deaf boy found wandering near juarez mexico have 
convinced her the child is her grandson philippe 
but social workers in el paso texas who are handling the case 
say they are skeptical of the womans claim because the boy appears 
to be younger than the womans grandson would be 
camille muller contacted the us embassy in paris on tuesday 
after recognizing the boy from pictures in a french television news 
report she said her daughter in paris also was struck by the 
resemblance 
i pray it is he she said for me it would be marvelous 
the freckled brownhaired boy known to authorities as sabat 
was found in november he suffers from severely impaired hearing 
and was unable to identify himself or say where he was from 
he communicates mostly by drawing pictures and gesturing and his 
pictures seem to indicate he survived the crash of a fourseat 
singleengine plane that killed his parents sister and brother 
mexican authorities noticed that sabat preferred american food 
and cartoon characters they contacted texas authorities for help 
and the fbi was called in 
sabat so named because he was found on a saturday sabado in 
spanish has been staying at a childrens home in juarez across 
the rio grande from el paso 
terry kincaid fbi spokesman in el paso said he has received 
several calls from people saying the boy resembles a missing 
relative but he took the french lead more seriously than most 
mrs muller saw copies of two drawings and seven photographs of 
the child published today in the french magazine vsd 
there is a great resemblance between the photos and 
philippe said mrs muller in a telephone interview from her 
home in the village of le bourg a thibouville in normandy i have 
more and more confidence that he is my grandson 
in addition she said the drawings are all signed with a p 
both those in the magazine and others described by vsd reporters 
who saw them 
one of the drawings reproduced in the magazine shows a 
stickfigure woman standing beside a small girl a smaller boy and 
the plane mrs muller said philippe had a sister and a baby 
brother born march 1986 
mrs mullers son moved to the united states after marrying an 
american woman of mexican descent who had family in both mexico 
city and california her daughterinlaw taught biology at a school 
in el paso although mrs muller did not know where 
she has not heard from her son since january 1987 
kincaid said he tried to ontact mrs mullers son in el paso 
but the man apparently had moved without leaving a forwarding 
address 
mrs muller said her daughterinlaws mother in mexico city had 
been very ill and possibly had died she speculated that the family 
could have been on their way to mexico city at the time of the 
plane crash 
if it is philippe then evidently he is the only one left 
she said so while i hope it is really my grandson i also hope 
it is not him because that would mean that his parents and the 
other two children are dead 
juanita mccray a social worker with the texas department of 
human services said im excited but skeptical the only problem 
i have is the age 
mrs mueller told embassy authorities that her grandson is about 
12 years old us and mexican authorities believe sabat is about 7 
or 8 
ms mccray said officials planned to ask a doctor to xray the 
boys arms and legs as a way of getting a more precise estimate of 
his age

operating rates at american factories mines 
and utilities rose in may to 829 percent the highest level in 
more than eight years the government said today 
the federal reserve board said the 02 percentage point rise 
from the april level put operating rates at their highest levels 
since march 1980 when the rate was 837 percent 
it was the sixth increase in eight months operating rates rose 
by 03 percentage points in april after dropping 01 percent in 
february and remaining unchanged in march 
the may advance was led by gains in the production of autos and 
parts primary metals such as steel and in fabricated metal 
products it was the third consecutive steep monthly rise at motor 
vehicle and parts plants where operating rates were 839 percent 
compared with 768 percent in february 
analysts had expected the modest rise in overall operating rates 
after the federal reserve reported wednesday that production levels 
had increased 04 percent in may 
rising operating rates if unchecked are considered by analysts 
to represent a threat of inflation the concern is that prices will 
rise if manufacturers have difficulty meeting demand 
the may level of 829 percent was 3 percentage points higher 
than the 799 percent rate a year ago but analysts generally do 
not consider the overall operating rate to be inflationary until it 
reaches 85 percent 
rising capacity levels have been attributed to the surge in 
exports caused by the devaluation of the dollar but so far 
consumer demand in the united states appears to have been 
restrained enough to allow manufacturers in most industries to 
comfortably meet both domestic and foreign demand 
in a speech in new york earlier this week federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan said despite strained capacity in steel and 
certain chemicals statistics on industrial delivery times do not 
indicate that inflationary bottlenecks are developing 
delivery times for production materials have moved up only 
moderately since late 1985 and have stabilized at least 
temporarily during the past five months he said 
the operating rate for manufacturing plants jumped to 831 
percent in may up from 829 percent a month earlier production of 
durable goods big ticket items expected to last three or more 
years rose by 06 percentage points to 816 percent while the 
rate for nondurable goods declined by 04 percentage points to 
853 percent 
the mining industry which includes oil and gas drilling 
operated at 813 percent of capacity down from 818 percent in 
april us utilities operated at an 809 percent rate in may up 
from 804 percent

the interior department will delay offering 
oil and gas leases in federal waters off new england and florida to 
try to meet objections of the states involved the department 
announced today 
it was the second time in two weeks that the department 
announced postponements to try to settle controversies over its 
drilling plans last week a controversial sale off northern 
california was delayed from february to at least october 
todays actions preceded scheduled deliberations by the house 
appropriations committee on putting drilling prohibitions into the 
departments appropriations bill for the fiscal year beginning oct 
1 a subcommittee approved the bans last week 
spokesman bob walker said secretary donald hodel had written the 
committee explaining the delays in an attempt to keep it from 
enacting drilling bans in an appropriations bill as it has done 
several times before 
the new england offering had been scheduled for february and now 
will be delayed at least six months walker said 
this delay will enable the department to put together a 
negotiating committee with governors of the coastal new england 
states we think we have made some progress in forming such a 
group to try to reach a compromise walker said 
in an attempt to protect the shallow georges bank fishing 
grounds the subcommittee provision would forbid drilling in waters 
less than 400 meters deep 1312 feet walker said this would 
leave only the marginal areas available for leasing and might 
leave us without a sale as happened once before when no one bid 
on areas left out of a previous prohibition 
the florida postponement involved 14 million acres in the 
eastern gulf of mexico north of the florida keys up to about naples 
the area will be dropped from a scheduled offering of tracts in 
the eastern gulf scheduled for november and will be offered 
separately the department announced no schedule for that second 
offering the governors office in tallahassee said under todays 
agreement it could not occur before next may 
in the meantime two 14member federalstate committees will 
study oil spills and cleanup in the gulf 
the subcommittee measure would forbid drilling in a slightly 
larger area about 16 million acres 
it was the second deletion of substantial acreage off florida in 
an attempt to satisfy the state hodel ruled the areas around the 
keys off limits in march 
the subcommittee proposal also called for delaying the northern 
california offering until october in effect putting hodels delay 
into law

members of a convoy organized to bring 
humanitarian aid to nicaragua have vowed to take their fight to 
washington after us customs officials at the border blocked their 
mission 
what we are going to do is take them the vehicles to 
washington dc and park them across the street from the white 
house and hope to use them as a national rallying point for the 
majority of americans who oppose the war against nicaragua said 
gerry condon a national coordinator for the convoy 
well probably be there for months he said wednesday 
his sentiments were echoed by hal muskat a convoy member from 
san francisco 
were pretty strong in our desire to take it to washington 
muskat said this morning from the alma de mujer campground west of 
austin where most of the group spent the night he said convoy 
leaders would meet today to plan the trip to washington 
customs agents impounded four vehicles wednesday after the 
38vehicle veterans peace convoy attempted to cross into mexico 
without export authorization 
the 106 convoy members had planned to take 30 tons of food 
medical supplies and clothing to nicaragua but treasury department 
officials served notice that leaving the 38 vehicles there would 
violate a 3yearold trade embargo 
james purser chief customs inspector in laredo said he was 
under orders from washington not to allow the groups trucks buses 
and other vehicles out of the country 
charles conroy customs spokesman in houston said the detained 
trucks will either be seized or returned to their owners pending 
the outcome of an investigation 
sen phil gramm supported the custom officials action saying 
that the humanitarian aid could be used against us interests in 
the region 
unfortunately the situation has made it obvious that while 
much of the cargo they are carrying may constitute humanitarian 
assistance the trucks are destined for the sandinista government 
where they could be pressed into service against those who are 
fighting for their freedom in central america the texas 
republican said 
convoy members and supporters from mexico formed a human chain 
to block traffic on the principal export bridge spanning the rio 
grande but a mexican federal official quickly broke up the 
blockade 
asked why the group did not try to take their humanitarian aid 
across the border quietly condon said this is a very public 
thing people around the country have been organizing for months i 
dont think we could have snuck across the border 
raul valdez a convoy coordinator from austin said if the group 
had not been stopped at the border we never would have gotten 
the attention that we have gotten in the media for one thing and 
it has helped to bring people to realize that there is an 
embargo which he said many people oppose 
the convoy left from four different regions of the united states 
on may 21 and arrived in laredo june 7 the vehicles have been 
camped in laredo since then

a decision by federal judges in southern florida to 
discard federal sentencing guidelines as unconstitutional has been 
hailed by defense lawyers as bringing humanity back to the 
courtroom 
the guidelines were barbaric said west palm beach lawyer 
richard lubin an area director of the national association of 
criminal defense lawyers they turned the judges into 
automatons

enough discretion in sentencing

hearing of the southern district of floridas 16 federal judges 
held april 21 
its a very thorough and wellreasoned decision said benson 
weintraub a miami lawyer who spearheaded the arguments against the 
guidelines 
us district judge norman roettger whose courtroom is in fort 
lauderdale said he didnt think the change would result in widely 
different sentences 
well just sentence on the old policy thats all roettger 
said we have been sentencing as we have been for decades all 
were doing is continuing that 
the guidelines were established by the sevenmember us 
sentencing commission set up by the 1984 comprehensive crime 
control act and applied to any offense comitted after nov 1 1987 
written by us district judge stanley marcus the 124 opinion 
finds the guidelines unconstitutional primarily because of the 
composition of the sentencing commission 
because the commission includes three federal judges the 
separation of powers outlined in the us constitution is violated 
the judges said fixing punishments belongs to the legislative 
branch of government and cannot be established by judges the 
opinion said 
this collaborative rulemaking effort between the judicial and 
the executive branches of government cast too long a shadow over 
the independence and impartiality of the entire federal 
judiciary marcus wrote 
we conclude that the act is unconstitutional and until we 
receive contrary guidance from a higher authority the guidelines 
will not be applied in this district 
under the decision those who are awaiting sentencing for 
convictions or guilty pleas will be dealt with under the old 
guidelines 
richard gregorie the chief criminal prosecutor in south 
floridas us attorneys office said the justice department will 
ask that the guidelines remain in force while the decision is 
appealed 
similar hearings have been held around the country with 
conflicting opinions on the generally stricter sentencing 
guidelines included in the 1984 comprehensive crime control act 
on monday the us supreme court agreed to step into the 
dispute and a decision by the high court is expected by early next 
year said john steer general counsel to the sentencing commission 
in washington 
the guidelines allow sentencing judges to take into account the 
nature of the crime the grade of the offense the amount of harm 
caused the communitys view of the crime and the sentences 
deterrent value

a heat wave baking much of the northeast and midwest persisted 
into its fourth day today aggravating a severe drought and causing 
at least two deaths in boston 
five tornadoes meanwhile spun through colorado hurling 
vehicles through the air and injuring seven people 
temperatures reached the 80s in many areas of the east and 
midwest by late morning at louisville ky the mercury rose from 
83 degrees at 11 am to 85 some 40 minutes later outside 
baltimore it was 85 degrees at 11 am with 67 percent relative 
humidity boston was even hotter recording 88 degrees 
have you seen the movie good morning vietnam robin williams 
has a line in there that sums it up hot damn hot hot and 
wet said frank ackerman spokesman for the cape cod national 
seashore in wellfleet mass 
an estimated 196000 people jammed beaches wednesday in the new 
york city area as the temperature hit 96 degrees tying a 
97yearold record it reached 98 in boston exceeding by 2 degrees 
the record set in 1956 
the bodies of an elderly woman and her daughter were found today 
in their boston apartment a preliminary investigation indicated 
the women died because of the heat said police spokeswoman jill 
reilly 
in massachusetts and rhode island the miserable weather became 
an official heat wave meaning at least three straight days of 
temperatures at 90 or higher the national weather service said 
kent county memorial hospital in warwick ri reported an 
increase of people coming in with chest pains 
weve had a lot of chest pains which im sure are 
precipitated by the heat nursing supervisor gertrude bollengier 
said today she said no cases of heat exhaustion had shown up yet 
rhode island hospital in providence and newport hospital officials 
reported no increase in heatrelated illnesses 
the unrelenting heat prompted rhode island public transit 
authority bus drivers to threaten a walkout over broken air 
conditioners as highs in providence on wednesday reached 97 
degrees one degree below the 1945 record 
its more than uncomfortable said edward rodgers president 
of the drivers union its a safety issue what if a driver 
passed out it could be a catastrophe

miles long from north to south tossing vehicles and storage sheds 
through the air and tearing off several roofs seven people were 
injured none seriously 
one twister hit near denvers stapleton international airport 
where the air traffic control tower was evacuated for about 25 
minutes stapleton spokesman richard bouleware said 
much of the property damage involved uprooted trees lost 
shingles and broken windows rather than destruction of homes 
officials said 
to the east the severe heat is being caused by a highpressure 
system off the midatlantic coast pumping in hot air from the south 
central part of the country national weather service meteorologist 
mike wyllie said 
over hundreds and hundreds of miles the ground is very very 
dry said peter lamb of the illinois state water survey so 
what the sun is doing is heating the ground and the ground is 
heating the air 
the heat coming in the wake of a dry winter and spring in the 
nations midsection aggravated widespread drought conditions that 
have threatened farm yields sending prices rocketing on commodity 
exchanges 
efforts to cool off put extraordinary pressure on municipal 
water and utility systems and some communities began ordering 
conservation the heat however has not hurt the air conditioning 
business 
sales have been going berserk said jack van horne owner of 
arundel cooling and heating co inc in linthicum md near 
baltimore when a heat wave moves in and units break down people 
want service and all hell breaks

june 13 
the seattle postintelligencer on climateenvironment 
a distinguished group of international scientists worried about 
the greenhouse effect that is changing the earths climate has 
bounced the ball appropriately enough into the court of the 
worlds politicians 
as gases from fossil fuel burning trap energy from the sun near 
the earths surface the globe gradually heats up over the next 50 
years the melting polar ice caps will raise the sea levels from 8 
to 60 inches the scientists predict 
in the next century the experts believe people will endure 
devastating floods and severe storms deserts will get even hotter 
agriculture will suffer in some areas but be made possible in 
others where now little can be grown causing population shifts 
canada and siberia will disappear as will some species of life 
with proper planning mankind ought not be among them 
the scientists suggest minimizing the damage by rapid 
development of alternative energy sources and use of nuclear 
energy ending deforestation and planning where to build dikes or 
take other measures to protect coastal cities

the commercial appeal memphis on house ethics 
house speaker jim wrights problems on the ethics front have 
taken a serious turn by using a staff employee to help him write a 
book he may have violated the law as well as house rules 
according to the washington post wright assigned a member of 
his congressional staff in 1984 to work on the book reflections 
of a public man which so far has brought the speaker about 
55000 in royalties 
the employee who is no longer on wrights staff was quoted as 
saying that he spent about 200 hours on the book during office 
hours 
the book had a peculiar smell even before this revelation it 
was published by a friend who reportedly was paid more than 
250000 by wrights campaign committee for reelection services 
performed during 198586 wright received a 55 percent royalty on 
book sales four to five times the normal payment to authors 
the latest disclosure indicates that more than a house committee 
inquiry is needed the justice department ought to empanel a grand 
jury to investigate whether wright has broken the law by using a 
staff member to work on the book

hobbs nm daily newssun on drugs 
what makes illegal drugs a 120 billion industry in the united 
states the profit motive of course 
thus the government in its battle to close down the nefarious 
industry is about to embark on a program that may undermine that 
motive by making it too costly for the consumer to be caught with 
drugs in his or her possession 
a group in the congress has promised that after the independence 
day recess legislation will be introduced to confiscate the 
property of both drug users and drug dealers presumably this 
legislation will extend to local law enforcement agencies the power 
to confiscate any property involved in drug dealings of any kind 
it all adds up to waging the equivalent of war to stop forces 
that are undermining the very foundations of the nation and if 
confiscation is the only effective way to win the war then that is 
what must be done

the hutchinson kan news on math scores 
a federal inquiry into the extent of ignorance about math among 
young students shouldnt surprise anyone in kansas older 
students are ignorant of math despite years of concern 
the schools have failed to help the unprepared older students 
remedial training courses clearly have not been provided 
in a few years the statistics about math ignorance among 
students ought to look better 
one reason for this statistical improvement will be the fact 
that todays ignorant older students wont be there anymore the 
older ones of today then will be trying to function outside the 
classrooms 
but theyll still be ignorant because school systems failed to 
fix the problem and then lied to the student about his graduation

the kansas city mo times on drinking and driving 
one of the best reasons to periodically pause to take stock of 
accomplishments in the crusade against drunken driving is that 
things may be going better than they seem 
for all the tragedy continuing as a result of alcoholrelated 
crashes and the 20000 deaths annually theres been progress 
just to start the death toll is no longer rising substantially 
every year public awareness has been stirred by victim advocate 
groups 
many states have passed tougher laws the past decade theyre 
raised the legal age for consumption of alcohol 
possibly as a result of these persistent methods of chipping 
away at casual public attitudes arrests are way up

the los angeles herald examiner on jesse jackson 
alsorans in the presidential primary marathon often are as 
quickly forgotten as super bowl losers jesse jackon as in so many 
other ways is different 
michael dukakis victories including his triumph in california 
made it certain that jackson wont get the democratic prsidential 
nomination in 1988 but a loser not a chance 
no when the political history of this era is written jackson 
will have a lead role even if he accomplishes nothing more than he 
did on the campaign trail in 1988 
no one has brought more people into the process people who had 
long since given up believing that their voices would be heard 
than jackson 
with charisma and hard work jackson has paved the way for a 
black president not this year but in the near future 
although hes had little luck attracting many democratic leaders 
who will be attending the atlanta convention as superdelegates 
jackson is liable to be more successful in helping mold the 1988 
democratic platform 
but after all which has come before that will be a minor 
triumph 
platforms are filed and forgotten jacksons already left a more 
lasting mark on the history books

the duluth minn newstribune on the death penalty 
it has a nice sound to it drug dealers who kill people must die 
themselves 
who among us can condone the actions of drug dealers especially 
those whove been convicted of killing someone after all the 
drugs they deal often kill users even if the peddlers dont 
actually do the killing 
but voting to impose the death penalty on drugmurders offers 
more sound and fury than enlightened law enforcement thus 
were unimpressed with the us senate vote june 10 and hope more 
rational minds in the house will block the action 
under the bill the death penalty could be invoked if someone is 
convicted of violating federal drug laws and separately convicted 
of killing a police officer or private citizen 
arguments on the merits of a death penalty aside were 
persuaded by sen lowell weicker rconn who said if senators are 
serious about fighting drugs they should vote to spend more money 
on educating potential users and arresting those who deal in drugs

earthquakes tornadoes and flood 
as we look around the midwest we see unfolding yet another of

spell in may has met or surpassed the pessimism of those who early 
on predicted the worst drought since the dust bowl days 
as we wait and pray for rain lets not focus only on the bad 
that the drought produces but the good as well 
there is the breaking down of barriers between segments of the 
community there is the inward reflection on an individual basis 
that promotes personal growth 
while we all await the miracle of rain lets remain in tune

portland maine press herald on acid rain cleanup 
the details of an acid rain plan worked out by the governors of 
new york and ohio are less imnportant than the fact that an 
agreement has been worked out at all 
for ohio to agree to any significant cleanup proposal at all is 
a significant breakthrough since coalfired plants and other 
industries there emit more sulfur dioxide than any other state in 
the nation 
under the new yorkohio plan the federal government would put 
up 900 million a year in cleanup funds most of it to come from an 
oil import fee and 900 million would come from the polluters 
maines sen george j mitchell who has been leading the fight 
for comprehensive acid rain legislation for years calls the new 
yorkohio agreement encouraging 
mitchell predicts it will pave the way for enactment of an acid 
rain bill this year if so thats progress indeed

immigrants and their descendants have done for the indian 
reservations covering millions of acres a bureau of indian 
affairs education a chance for some to get very rich pumping oil 
the presidents history lesson left out the broken treaties the 
forced expulsions the outright theft of property the loss of a 
whole continent and the lingering legacy of disease poverty and 
joblessness 
nor could reagans myth of america as a shining city on a hill 
acknowledge the trail of tears in which 70000 indians died as 
they were thrown off their lands and pushed across the mississippi 
river 
the soviet occupation of the nations of eastern europe the 
baltic and eurasia has had ghastly consequences but there has been 
little benign about the european occupation of land that belongs to 
native americans

union carbides lawyers on may 6 asked deo to remove himself 
from hearing indias 3 billion suit against the usbased 
multinational company they said that deos order on dec 17 for 
union carbide to pay interim relief to the gas victims showed 
bias because he had not ruled on the merits of the case

seriously injured when toxic methylisocyanate leaked from a 
pesticideproducing subsidiary of union carbide in bhopal on dec 
3 1984

worlds worst industrial accident 
india has accused union carbide of negligence union carbide

suit 
deos december order was upheld in april by the madhya pradesh 
high court which set the amount of payment at 192 million

for relief payments was made without any finding of liability and 
without there being any material at all to indicate how the figure 
was arrived at 
he added that there was nothing in the order to allow refund of 
the relief payments should the government lose the suit or final

call it conservation chic the latest trend 
in california cusine is the waterless meal 
theres more than civic spirit at work however in los angeles 
an ordinance that took effect at the end of april requires 
restaurants to serve water on request only but even outside city 
limits many restaurateurs are voluntarily turning off the tap 
you think about it because of the fires said donna averna 
manager of splash a bistro in the seaside celebrity community of 
malibu where drought also brings the threat of devastating brush 
fires 
posh celebrity hangout spago in west hollywood is voluntarily 
dry as are the brown derby in pasadena and chasens in west 
hollywood an old favorite of ronald and nancy reagan 
the conservation effort gets a boost this week as the regions 
biggest water supplier mails out 200000 cards to more than 2000 
restaurants to post on tables outlining the waterondemand policy 
the cards bear a picture of a water glass onequarter full and 
the caption what no water on the back is an explanation that 
for each serving of water it takes three to four times that amount 
to wash the glass 
thats a small but important bit of conservation with rain and 
snow runoff in the sierra nevada source of much of the states 
water at onehalf or less of normal levels said metropolitan 
water district spokesman tim skrove 
the mwd wholesale supplier to water districts serving 14 
million people throughout southern california paid the 13000 for 
printing and mailing the restaurant cards skrove said 
the california restaurant association supplied the mailing list 
and is urging members to comply said stan kyker executive vice 
president 
the benefits of pulling water glasses off the tables kyker 
tells members are twofold not only do they save water and set an 
example they also save money by washing fewer dishes 
its your obligation to do your role kyker tells 
restaurateurs and besides that itll save you money 
the initial response has been good 
diners dont usually complain once they find they can get water 
by asking said ms averna and harry mccague general manager at 
the brown derby 
but conservation chic isnt for everyone 
stylish le dome in west hollywood wouldnt dream of asking its 
patrons to sacrifice 
manager michelle ritz puts it simply but firmly we always 
serve water sir

an exwedtech president testified that company 
officials met with george bush in an effort to cut out competitors 
for government contracts but a bush spokesman said the vice 
president doesnt remember meeting them 
anthony guariglia the former president of the nowdefunct 
defense contractor also testified in rep mario biaggis 
racketeering trial that wedtech officials gave 200000 to 
president reagans 1984 campaign 
meanwhile the los angeles times reported today that allegations 
against a wedtech competitor contained in memos to attorney general 
edwin meese iii by a friend wedtech consultant robert wallach 
bear a striking similarity to language contained in a highly 
critical report on the company later issued by the army 
however no link between meese and the investigation of 
houstonbased garcia ordnance corp has been documented the 
newspaper said 
wallach was indicted on charges that he accepted hundreds of 
thousands of dollars from wedtech in an improper attempt to 
influence meese on behalf of the defunct new york defense 
contractor wallach is scheduled to be tried with two associates 
later this year 
garcia ordnance is not mentioned in wallachs indictment 
in his testimony in federal court guariglia said that 
competitors from texas and puerto rico disappeared after the 
company officials were introduced to bush 
was the purpose of being introduced to vice president bush to 
get him to eliminate wedtechs competition in texas and puerto 
rico defense attorney alan r kaufman asked during cross 
examination 
yes said guariglia 
was that done was that competition eliminated kaufman 
asked 
yes responded guariglia ending the exchange without 
specifically connecting bush to the diminished competition 
bush spokesman stephen hart said the vice president doesnt 
recall meeting guariglia on any occasion and if he spoke to him

in a city where power is spelled with a 
capital p the doles bob and elizabeth are the 
quintessential power couple a status confirmed by the likelihood 
that both are on george bushs list of vice presidential prospects 
a bushdole ticket sounds good to a lot of people the question 
is which dole 
the husband is the senate republican leader who finished second 
to bush in the race for the gop presidential nomination 
the wife is a former transportation secretary and federal trade 
commissioner who won favorable reviews as a campaigner for her 
husband when he was the gop vice presidential nominee in 1976 and 
during his two later bids for the presidential nomination 
dole the senator is strongest where bush is weakest in the 
farm belt where he thrashed bush in iowa kansas south dakota 
and minnesota polls also show dole running better among 
independents and democrats than does bush 
dole the former transportation secretary also helps bush in an 
area where he needs it among women recent polls show a gender 
gap for bush that looks more like a chasm with the vice 
presidents rating among women running almost 20 points below his 
standing among men 
i think it would clearly help bush among women said 
patricia ireland a vice president of the national organization for 
women when asked the impact of having elizabeth dole on the ticket 
when bob dole was the gop vice presidential nominee in 1976 the 
secret service code names for the couple were ramrod for the 
candidate and rainbow for his wife 
those names seem particularly wellchosen in the light of events 
during and since that campaign 
the kansas senator has earned a reputation as a tough acerbic 
campaigner whose most memorable moment in the 1988 contest was the 
night of his new hampshire primary loss when he was asked if he had 
anything to say to bush 
tell him to stop lying about my record snarled the senator 
a native of salisbury nc elizabeth hanford dole is a 
harvardeducated lawyer who came to washington in the 1960s as a 
staff assistant in the old department of health education and 
welfare she worked in the white house office of consumer affairs 
under president lyndon b johnson and was named to the federal 
trade commission by president richard m nixon 
she worked as a special assistant for public liaison in the 
reagan white house and in february 1983 she was named secretary 
of transportation 
she resigned in september 1987 to do everything i can to 
help her husband get elected president 
im from russell kansas and proud of it bob dole told 
campaign audiences it was an especially effective appeal to 
midwestern republicans as were the terrible wounds he suffered in 
world war ii which left him without the use of his right arm 
he was elected to house in 1960 and to the senate in 1968 in 
addition to serving in the senate he was chairman of the 
republican national committee from 1971 through 1973 and the early 
days of the watergate scandal dole was succeeded in the party post 
by bush 
when president gerald ford picked the wisecracking dole as his 
running mate in 1976 the choice surprised many people his 
slashing campaign style surprised even more he later said he was 
sent into the briar patch while he ford stayed in the rose 
garden 
the low point came during a vice presidential debate with walter 
f mondale when dole referred to american lives lost in democrat 
wars 
the kansas senator bid for the top spot on the ticket in 1980 
and vowed to run a positive campaign he did but he got few votes 
and was an early casualty 
his fortunes took a positive turn in 1980 when the republicans 
captured control of the senate in the reagan landslide dole soon 
was getting rave reviews as chairman of the senate finance 
committee and in 1985 he succeeded howard h baker as senate gop 
leader 
he still had his eye on the white house and after a big victory 
in iowa in february 1988 appeared on his way to the nomination but 
bush turned it around in new hampshire helped by television 
commercials that portrayed dole as waffling on arms control and as 
a supporter of tax increases 
beaten everywhere by bush on super tuesday dole never recovered 
and dropped out of the gop race on march 29 
elizabeth dole often was credited with moving her husband away 
from the slashing style he displayed in the 1976 campaign but the 
old bob dole often reappeared this year 
during the illinois primary campaign dole said bush had sort 
of had a charmed life in politics hes gotten quite a ways without 
ever doing much 
that kind of talk might make it likely that the dole on a 
bushdole ticket would be named elizabeth

house speaker jim wright said today he would 
welcome the hiring of an outside investigator by the house ethics 
committee if that would speed up the panels probe of his financial 
dealings 
wright dtexas reacting to president reagans call for an 
independent counsel in the case said i have frequently said it 
is all right with me for the committee to do whatever it will 
if the committee feels its work can be expedited by hiring of 
an outside counsel then by all means he told reporters he 
declined to comment directly on reagans remarks including the 
presidents incorrect assertion that democrats controlled the 
ethics committee saying im going to be kinder to the president 
than he was to me 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash the next ranking 
democrat after wright said reagan apparently was confused and 
had aligned the white house with politically motivated 
republicans 
foley said that continued republican pressure against wright is 
a politically motivated attack on the speaker designed to 
theoretically balance the problems the administration has had with 
ethics and even criminal problems 
foley speaking on cbstvs this morning said the criticism 
of wright is linked to such things as sort of crass fundraising 
efforts for the republican party 
reagan becoming the latest gop officeholder to join the verbal 
fray over allegations wright has violated house ethics rules said 
wednesday that everyone would feel that it was more proper if 
an investigation were done by someone outside congress 
the bipartisan house ethics committee voted last week to 
investigate allegations the speaker misused his office for personal 
gain 
reagan speaking to reporters said i have to wonder if it 
should not be an independent counsel from the standpoint of the 
relationship of the speaker to the majority of the committee and i 
think everyone would feel that it was more proper if it was done by 
an investigator outside an appointed investigator 
said foley theres a confusion over the presidents 
terminology and his comments about the committee 
the president said he thought it was especially important 
because of the majority this is an even committee six democrats 
six republicans said foley none of the democrats were 
appointed originally by this speaker theyre people of high 
integrity thats why theyre put on the committee 
the committee is looking into allegations that wright dtexas 
has violated house ethics rules by misusing his office for personal 
gain and improperly intervening with federal regulators 
rep newt gingrich rga who first raised the allegations 
vice president george bush and several other gop officeholders have 
suggested that it would be better to have the investigation 
conducted by an independent counsel 
reagan made the remarks during an interview with seven reporters 
from the seven countries that will participate in the economic 
summit june 1921 in toronto 
wright is accused of six possible violations of house rules but 
has denied any wrongdoing 
the accusations include improper lobbying on behalf of oil 
companies with which wright may have had financial relationships 
circumstances surrounding publication of a book for which he 
received a higherthanusual royalty and which was produced with 
the help of a congressionally paid staffer contacts with federal 
officials on behalf of texas savings and loans and the use of a 
condominium in fort worth for which he paid no monthly rent

democrat michael dukakis today picked up 
the endorsement of former rival albert gore jr who predicted that 
the likely presidential nominee will capture the backing of the 
souths conservative electorate 
on occasion mike and i had differences but out friendship 
always grew and our debates helped strengthen the democratic party 
and increase the democrats chance of victory in the fall the 
tennessee senator said in a statement he was to deliver later today 
gore one of four recent opponents to endorse dukakis said the 
massachusetts governor is going to carry our party to victory in 
november he is going to win in the east in the north in the 
west and he is going to win right here in the south 
our part of the country spoke for change on super tuesday and 
mike dukakis stands for change said gore who planned to call on 
his 289 delegates to back the massachusetts governor at the 
democratic national convention in july 
dukakis was using the gore endorsement to kick off a trip 
through seven southern states many of them once considered secure 
for bush 
dukakis can win florida said charles whitehead the states 
democratic party chairman i think florida is the hardest state 
for any democrat to win of any southern state 
but said whitehead dukakis is not being perceived as a 
liberal hes a progressive a middleoftheroader 
at the same time the democratic chairman said bush is 
perceived as a follower not as a leader 
in the final round of primaries last week dukakis surpassed the 
2081 delegates he needed for a majority but jesse jackson has 
vowed to remain in the race for the nomination until the votes are 
counted at the convention 
gore dropped out of the race after the new york primary in which 
he finished a disappointing third in a field of three the 
tennessee senator had pursued a southern strategy for the 
nomination downplaying the traditional early tests in iowa and new 
hampshire and hoping to benefit from a flood of dixie votes on 
march 8 
gore did well on march 8 but then failed to attract much 
support in such northern states as illinois wisconsin and new york 
for dukakis as with all democratic presidential candidates the 
south is a critical part of the coalition needed to attain the 270 
electoral votes needed to win the presidency 
in the last five presidential elections the only democratic 
winner was jimmy carter of georgia who carried 10 of 11 southern 
states 
bush took command of the race for the republican presidential 
nomination by winning 16 primaries on march 8 most of them in the 
south 
strategists for the vice president a new englander who now 
claims texas as his home consider the region his base a claim 
disputed by dukakis 
mike dukakis knows he can win states in the south and hes 
going to campaign actively there said leslie dach a dukakis 
campaign spokesman while george bush has a lot of homes he has 
no secure political base and hes going to have to campaign 
everywhere 
dukakis threeday foray into the region was to include stops in 
tennessee south carolina florida mississippi louisiana texas 
and alabama 
he won the florida and texas primaries on march 8 gore carried 
tennessee while jackson was the winner in alabama and south 
carolina 
most southern democrats were openly urging dukakis to choose 
someone like sen sam nunn of georgia sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
or sen robert graham of florida from the region as his running 
mate 
the decision on the vice presidency will be fundamental 
said wayne bailey a professor of political science at stetson 
university in deland fla and a democratic party activist 
the seven states where dukakis was campaigning have a total of 
95 electoral votes the biggest prizes being texas with 29 and 
florida with 21 
the massachusetts governor is given little chance of beating 
bush in the most conservative of the southern states 
i honestly dont expect him to take alabama said natalie 
davis a pollster based in birmingham bush is going to have to 
lose it 
one theme dukakis was sounding that is welcomed by southern 
voters was a tough stand against crime and drugs 
during appearances in his home state on wednesday dukakis 
touted the declining massachusetts crime rate and lambasted the 
reagan administration for obstructing the war on drugs by cutting 
coast guard funds 
how can we possibly be serious about fighting a war on drugs 
when were cutting coast guard patrols by 55 percent he told 
reporters outside the state police academy its that kind of 
thing one of the reasons im running for the presidency

vice president george bush said today drugs 
are the ultimate fatal attraction and he renewed his call on 
companies to institute antidrug programs in order to receive 
federal contracts 
the point is that stopping drugs in the workplace is not just 
a profit and loss issue its a matter of protecting the health and 
safety of workers its no less important than osha regulations on 
the conditions of machinery the certain republican presidential 
nominee told the us jaycees annual meeting 
the federal government should not dictate what kind of 
drugfree program a company should have but it should require any 
federal contractor to have one in place he said 
as in the past bush left open the question of whether these 
programs must include some form of mandatory drug testing 
in an interview with the associated press on wednesday bush 
suggested that many americans still dont know who i am despite 
7 years as vice president he said he would rely heavily on 
advertising and surrogate speakers to help get his message out 
bush also said he may select a woman as a running mate 
and he blamed some of his high negatives in recent public 
opinion polls on democrats shooting at you every day during the 
justended primary season 
i think we have time to be sure that a positive image is out 
on who i am and what i feel and where ill take the country and 
ill readily concede that some of thats not clear yet he said 
i think the answer on the polls if there are negatives there 
is to turn them into positives bush said 
on the subject of a running mate bush said that the 
votedrawing ability of an individual to help him in the polls 
would be a factor man or woman in the selection however he 
says his primary consideration remains a capability to take over in 
the event something happened to the president 
look the gender question was crossed when geraldine ferraro 
went on the 1984 democratic ticket he said and that was a 
good thing a very good thing 
among those women mentioned prominently in speculation about the 
spot are former transporation secretary elizabeth dole sen nancy 
kassebaum rkan supreme court justice sandra day oconnor and 
nebraska gov kay orr 
literally i havent started thinking about names of 
potential running mates although its thoroughly understandable 
theres increased speculation bush said 
the vice president declined to say whether he thought recent 
polls showing him trailing democrat michael dukakis were partly a 
reflection of president reagans lagging popularity i dont want 
to lay off any problems i may have on somebody else he said 
bush said he hoped to narrow the gap especially the gender 
gap indicating he has far less support among women than among men 
people are interested in the family ive got a good one 
bush said i dont think we get credit for how we manage family 
values yet and what really motivates me and caring and 
compassion and all that stuff 
he said that dukakis will come out of that democratic 
convention with a traditional liberal democratic platform well 
come out with a sound forwardlooking republican platform that 
will put the differences in focus 
in a wideranging interview on wednesday bush also 
indicated he would pursue the reagan administrations fight for 
continued military aid for antigovernment contra forces in 
nicaragua if elected but with more of an effort to reach an 
accommodation with congress id want to do it practically to 
see lets be sure what we do will pass he said 
the adminstration has repeatedly run into broad opposition in 
congress for its efforts to provide military assistance to the 
contras id love to find a way to take a package to the hill and 
get it passed bush said 
said if elected he would redouble whatever efforts we 
have to press for the release of jailed south african black 
leader nelson mandela and to get the pretoria governent to 
negotiate with opposition factions 
however he said he opposes the depiction by democratic platform 
writers of that white minorityruled country as a terrorist 
state and said he opposes dukakis call for tougher economic 
sanctions the ones now in place he said arent working and are 
hurting the people were trying to help 
conceded that his efforts to paint dukakis as an elitist 
harvard liberal could backfire saying i wouldnt want to do 
too much of that however he said he plans to mix campaign 
rhetoric against dukakis with facts and said ive got to get 
peoples attention 
bush was to address a national convention of the junior chambers 
of commerce today in richmond 
on wednesday he went to the capitol to endorse a house 
republican plan to severely punish narcotics users including a 
proposal for the death penalty for major drug dealers which he had 
previously supported and used the opportunity to accuse democrats 
of making a shrill political issue of antidrug programs 
he also joined former rival senate republican leader bob dole at 
the agriculture department for a briefing from agriculture 
secretary richard e lyng on this years drought throughout much of 
the nation

the democrats chance of victory in the fall 
mike dukakis is going to carry our party to victory in 
november he is going to win in the east in the north in the 
west and he is going to win right here in the south 
bush in a speech to the united states jaycees in richmond va 
called illegal drugs the ultimate fatal attraction and 
reiterated his call for requiring companies with government 
contracts to have drugfree programs 
the point is that stopping drugs in the workplace is not just 
a profit and loss issue its a matter of protecting the health and 
safety of workers he said 
jackson testifying before a senate committee said 
strengthening the coast guard and customs border patrol should be 
the first steps in stopping drugs coming into the united states 
there have been calls for greater use of military forces but 
jackson said we must be careful however to avoid involving the 
military in any police actions against citizens or arrests 
meanwhile atlanta pollster claibourne darden jr said at a news 
conference that his new survey found bush supported by 451 percent 
of prospective southern voters compared to 423 percent for dukakis 
a difference falling within the 36 percent margin of potential 
sampling error 
darden said the survey conducted among 750 people in nine 
states june 813 also showed dukakis could help himself in the 
south by choosing sen sam nunn of georgia or former sen john 
glenn of ohio as a running mate but that selecting jackson would 
be disastrous in the south 
bush said in an interview with the associated press he was 
sticking close to washington due both to a shortage of campaign 
travel funds and the lull that comes with the end of the primary 
season bush has spent most of the money allowed under federal 
limits for the preconvention phase of the campaign 
you can get more attention for something you say in washington 
so you have a different ability to get your message out and 
still live within your budget the vice president said 
the south is critical to dukakis if he is to rack up the 270 
electoral votes needed to win the presidency dukakis was making 
stops in tennessee south carolina florida mississippi 
louisiana texas and alabama 
the massachusetts governor won the florida and texas primaries 
on march 8 gore carried tennessee while jackson was the winner in 
alabama and south carolina 
jacksons appearance today before the senate labor committee on 
drug education and abuse an issue he has highlighted in this 
years campaign was to be followed by a meeting with sen ernest 
hollings of jacksons home state of south carolina 
jackson won the south carolina caucuses and hollings said last 
week he would vote for jackson at the convention on the basis of 
that thats a view jackson wants other super delegates to 
take too 
jackson has said he will seek the support of the unpledged 
public and party officeholders who will attend the democratic 
national convention as super delegates 
with attention increasingly focusing on the convention jackson 
said he is ready for a floor fight if he doesnt get his way on 
taxing the wealthy and freezing military spending 
jackson also said he met wednesday with dukakis campaign 
chairman paul brountas who has been interviewing potential running 
mates to join the massachusetts governor on the democratic 
presidential ticket 
but jackson said at a news conference he has not yet decided 
whether he would want the post only that he has earned serious 
consideration 
bush on wednesday went to the capitol to endorse a house

former gov evan mecham said he had a 
clear conscience as he awaited a jurys verdict on criminal 
charges that he concealed a 350000 campaign loan 
the jury deliberated for 3 hours and 45 minutes after receiving 
the case wednesday then resumed work today 
ill feel better when its here the verdict mecham 64 
told reporters as the jury was dismissed for the night but he 
added he expected to sleep well because i have a clear 
conscience 
the former governor again insisted that he and his codefendant 
his brother willard were innocent of any crime 
but prosecutor barnett lotstein told the jury in wednesdays 
final portion of the closing arguments that the mechams cloak of 
innocence has been stripped away thread by thread by thread 
willard mecham and evan mecham stand naked before you now 
because the evidence is overwhelming of their guilt 
mecham a republican took office in january 1987 and was 
removed april 4 when the state senate convicted him of two 
unrelated impeachment charges he also was impeached in connection 
with the loan but the senate decided not to hear that charge for 
fear of prejudicing his criminal trial 
the mechams face felony charges of concealing the 350000 loan 
on financial disclosure reports required by the state the loan 
from developer barry wolfson did not appear on mechams personal or 
campaign finance statements 
mechams lawyer michael scott told reporters there was 
absolutely no evidence of intent to conceal the loan 
the defense said the loan was properly reported as part of a 
465000 lump sum that was listed as a campaign contribution from 
evan mecham and that the failure to itemize the loan was an 
innocent mistake by his brother willard mecham who was his 
campaign treasurer 
lotstein disputed a defense claim that the loan was common 
knowledge because one former top mecham aide said she knew about it 
to claim that the loan was not a secret from the public 
because some insiders knew about it would be like claiming that the 
secret plan for the normandy invasion in world war ii was public 
knowledge because the general that planned it knew about it the 
prosecutor said 
lotstein contended that mecham lied when he told reporters oct 
30 that he did not owe any loan to wolfson but that his campaign 
did and that he did not intend to repay it wolfson testified that 
mecham called him shortly afterward assured wolfson he would be 
repaid and said his attorney had told him to make the public 
statement 
the defense said mecham had no motive to hide the loan because 
the report on which it appeared was not filed until a month after 
the nov 4 1986 election 
but lotstein said a disclosure of the loan early in mechams new 
administration would have destroyed his image of being antispecial 
interest 
mecham was charged with six felony counts of perjury willful 
concealment and filing false documents and faced from almost nine 
to 22 years in prison if convicted of all charges 
willard mecham faced three similar counts and up to 9 years in 
prison if convicted of all charges

diet high in vitamindeficient white rice a researcher suggested 
thursday 
ronald munger a postdoctoral fellow at the university of 
minnesotas division of epidemiology said his studies show that 
stress is not the leading cause of sudden unexpected death

munger 34 presented his findings thursday to a conference of 
the society for epidemiologic research in vancouver br humans and monkeys 
both 
received the virus from a common ancestor monkeys and humans are 
descendants of primates who lived 20 million to 30 million years 
ago 
the report on african green monkeys by hayamis team was 
published in nature a british scientific journal earlier this 
month carel mulder a university of massachusetts biologist in a 
separate commentary in nature said the findings mean the human 
viruses cannot have originated from african monkeys in recent 
times as had been predicted by many people 
hayami says many diseases that afflict humans came from animals 
so it was not unreasonable to theorize that aids did as well 
his complete genetic sequencing of the green monkey virus 
determined that the simian and human viruses were different the 
sequencing involved checking by hand 9000 base pairs of nucleic 
acids the building blocks of genes 
his laboratory has not completed sequencing of the mandrill 
virus yet but hybridization another test shows it is different 
from human viruses and the african green monkey virus hayami said 
siv simian immunodeficiency virus mandrill is really we 
think an authentic mandrill virus not from another species 
hayami said 
the most intriguing aspect of the two simian viruses is that 
neither produces illness in the animals that host them examining 
why the simian virus does not produce illness could lead to a 
strategy for producing a vaccine to prevent aids in humans 
hayami said 
because the african green monkey virus has been fully 
genetically analyzed it can be compared with the human virus 
hayamis laboratory has found that the human virus has an r 
gene which is missing in the simian virus 
he said his laboratory staff has already begun constructing a 
recombinant clone of the african green monkey cirus with an r 
gene we are going to test it to try to induce aids 
hayami said at this moment nobody knows the function of this 
gene if we prove the r gene is responsible for pathogenicity 
that is very important we can have the weapon to attack the human 
virus but that is only my dream 
meanwhile work is continuing on the full genetic sequencing of 
the mandrill virus 
the virus was found in two mandrills living in the primate 
centers forested enclosure both were born in the wild and 
captured and brought to the franceville center a 30 million 
facility built with gabons oil earnings to study infertility in 
recent years in it has focused on aids research 
in april other scientists at the center claimed to have found 
two chimpanzees with an aids virus if confirmed it will be the 
first time chimpanzees have been found with the disease 
as chimpanzees are a closer relative of humans than monkeys 
this could be another important step for aids research

wilting crops and worried farmers are giving 
this summer a place in the history books along with most of 1980s 
as a dry era in america 
drought has plagued one part of the nation or another in every 
summer this decade except 1982 and the cumulative effect may well 
pose the most serious danger 
for even if the weather breaks and rain reaches farmers areas 
like the tennessee valley and pacific northwest have dry subsoils 
that wont recharge instantly 
indeed the tennessee valley has missed what amounts to a years 
rainfall in the last four and the southeast in general is short a 
years rain in this decade according to government weather records 
even so things arent yet as bad as the dreary dust bowl years 
of the 1930s 
that was a time when five or six dry years threatened to 
depopulate some areas where the soil blew away with the winds 
now the tennessee valley could move into that class after four 
dry years that included a 100year record for drought in 1986 
warns a james wagner of the federal climate analysis center 
that region is down about 40 inches of rain over four years 
wagner said they have had only 75 percent of normal rain in the 
last four years 
montana and north dakota also have suffered for several years 
he added and this summer other areas are being affected too 
this years drought doesnt really fit exactly into a pattern 
like weve seen before the dust bowl was worse in the plains 
while the driest areas are east of the plains this year wagner 
said 
but this sere summer comes late in a dry decade 
in 1980 dryness records were set in states from texas to 
virginia in 1984 montana and the dakotas received less than half 
their normal precipitation in 1986 and 1987 the southeast was hit 
hard 
and hot weather has accompanied the parching 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has reported 
that 1986 and 1987 were the warmest years on average in more than 
three decades and among the warmest on record 
that has raised alarm among environmentalists worrying about the 
greenhouse effect the trapping of heat from the sun by carbon 
dioxide and other gases experts fear this ultimately will raise 
the worlds temperature 
much of the southeast is 12 percent below normal in rainfall in 
this decade the equivalent of a year without rain some parts of 
georgia are 70 inches or more below normal 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng said this week that a wet 
july could save the situation but without that the drought could 
well be a catastrophe 
wheat fields in montana and the dakotas already have been 
damaged lyng said and additional weeks of scorching temperatures 
and no rain could cause severe damage in the corn belt and across 
the south 
the immediate cause of the drought wagner said is an 
abnormally strong ridge of high pressure which tends to suppress 
the mechanisms in the atmosphere which cause precipitation and 
tends to steer the storm systems elsewhere 
in general weather patterns change more slowly in summer than 
at other times of year meteorologists note so once a high 
pressure area is moved into an area by the upperair weather 
patterns it may be difficult to dislodge 
the midwest drought has been caused by a strong high pressure 
area in the northern united states and southern canada over the 
last two months so storms go west or north of the high or move 
south to the gulf coast wagner said 
that same pattern has directed the storms away from the 
southeast and tennessee valley he said 
texas and the southern plains were dry this spring but the 
forecast calls for relief for both during the next 30 days wagner 
said in the western part of the rio grande area at least and in 
the southern plains and rockies it looks wet for the summer as a 
whole he said 
in the southeast he said we are not predicting particularly 
dry weather for the next 30 days but we did have an indication the 
area could have a dry summer so the next couple weeks may have a 
few showers but it could dry out later 
that same pattern he said is causing us to predict a 
relative chance of above normal rainfall for the great lakes for 
the summer 
a ridge of high pressure is predicted to move somewhat farther 
south as summer goes on and the southeast will dry out and the 
upper midwest or great lakes could end up with normal or above 
normal rain by summers end 
but that may not be in time to help the crops he said 
in the northwest there was severe drought last fall and its 
been wet in the last month wagner noted but he added thats 
deceptive because they get most the rain in fall and winter so 
they are down several inches too the subsoil is dry although 
the top may be moist 
in california for the most part the indication is for a near 
normal summer although it looks dry during the next 30 days in the 
areas around los angeles bakersfield and fresno wagner said

a pygmy killer whale beached itself 
and died at the isle of palms of wounds it apparently suffered from 
sharks authorities say 
the 7footlong whale a type rarely seen was spotted 
wednesday it beached itself twice but was helped back into the 
water by swimmers then pulled back ashore because police feared it 
would attract sharks to the crowded beach said police cpl les 
griffin 
the whale died before a veterinarian arrived officials said 
the dead whale was examined by al sanders curator of natural 
science at the charleston museum and andrew mount a research 
analyst with the south carolina sea grant consortium 
it was the only second stranding of a pygmy killer whale on 
record in the state with the first two years ago sanders said 
the wounds on the whales back were probably caused by sharks

this has been a dry decade except for 1982 
in much of america heres the rundown 
1980 
hot and dry summer weather developed in a pattern similar to the 
unpleasant summers of 195254 rainfall was between 25 percent and 
50 percent of normal across much of the nation the heat wave was 
blamed for as many as 1200 deaths and crop and livestock damage 
estimated at 20 billion 
record dryness in various months were reported in parts of 
texas kansas wyoming arkansas and virginia as the hot dry 
weather extended from the missouri valley throughout the 
southeastern states 
1981 
much of the nation remained in the grip of the drought which 
began in 1980 light winter snowfall meant that groundwater was not 
recharged and municipal water supplies in the northeast slipped to 
dangerously low levels 
rains starting in may brought relief to some farm areas 
although abnormally dry weather remained the rule in the northern 
great plains southeast and middle atlantic states 
1982 
things were better this year with no extensive areas of drought 
in the nation as cool canadian air helped produce active rain 
fronts during most of the summer 
1983 
searing heat struck in july and august producing severe drought 
east of the rockies 
the drought was similar to that of 1980 but centered slightly 
farther north in the western corn belt states corn and soybean 
crops were severely damaged and the dryness extended to the 
midatlantic region rain was less than onequarter of normal in 
parts of texas kansas oklahoma nebraska missouri iowa and 
illinois 
1984 
wheat crops were damaged to the tune of more than 1 billion in 
montana and north dakota when rainfall totaled only onethird of 
normal in the first half of the year many brush fires were 
reported persistent dryness also damaged crops and gassslands in 
central texas 
1985 
dry conditions led to serious brush and forest fires in 
california and in the northern rockies and northern plains states 
1986 
the southeast sweltered under dry conditions that had begun the 
previous autumn virginia the carolinas georgia alabama and 
tennessee were affected by a drought that has been described as the 
worst in more than a century less than onequarter the normal rain 
falling in some areas 
some relief came in august when rains helped soybean crops but 
it was too late for hay and corn regional damage estimates topped 
1 billion 
1987 
forest fires scorched more than two million acres when a dry 
winter was followed by a sweltering summer in parts of idaho 
washington oregon and california water shortages occurred in 
spokane and some other communities 
hot dry conditions in july and august also contributed to 
drought conditions in the southeast reducing crop yields sharply 
heavy rains came along in september but excessively dry conditions 
returned to the southeast in october and november particularly 
affecting west virginia kentucky and tennessee

more than a decade after india succeeded 
in growing enough food to feed itself drought has forced the 
worlds second most populous nation back to the international food 
markets 
the purchases have been small a million metric tons of wheat 
from the united states and 500000 metric tons of rice from 
thailand and are solely to replenish buffer stocks but they 
underscore the limits of indias green revolution of the early 
1970s and how reliant on the weather it remains 
indias ability to feed itself also is linked to curbing a 
population that has reached 800 million and is growing at a rate of 
22 percent a year 
the food problems began last summer when the monsoon failed and 
a drought moved north into prime farming regions leading to a 
winter rice harvest about 10 million tons less than that of the 
previous year 
when the rains did come another wheat crop was in the fields 
that harvest was slightly larger than that of the year before 
but they needed a fantastic crop to make up for the kharif 
winter rice failure said a western diplomat speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the government has used its food reserves to make up for the 
shortfall reserves have shrunk from 25 million metric tons in july 
1987 to about 943 million tons news and other reports said a 
metric ton weighs 2205 pounds and is equivalent to about 11 short 
tons 
india handled the drought well said the diplomat an 
agricultural specialist weve had no reports of deaths 
the governments problem is getting enough of the wheat now 
being harvested 
farmers private traders and flour millers have been working to 
keep the wheat crop off the market to take advantage of the 
shrinking national reserves and drive up prices the united news of 
india recently quoted sukh ram minister of state for food and 
supply as warning middlemen about hoarding 
hope is focused on the lifebestowing monsoon due to hit new 
delhi in late june western officials expect india to buy more 
wheat and rice this year and the strength of the monsoon will 
determine how much must be purchased 
problems remain even if the weather cooperates and indias grain 
production continues its modest increase 
the green revolution extended only to wheat and rice and 
production lags in other areas according to agriculture secretary 
c asrinivasa sastry 
india bought 100000 metric tons of corn from argentina this 
year and was given 100000 tons by the united states corn imports 
could total 500000 tons by the end of the year the western 
diplomat said 
india also remains the worlds largest importer of edible oils 
120000 tons this year and also imports soybeans lentils butter 
oil nonfat dry milk and small amounts of sugar and cotton 
western officials have criticized indias agriculture extension 
service saying it is not getting necessary information to the 
farmers 
but sastry said it takes time to disseminate information 
about 85 percent of indias wheatgrowing land is now irrigated 
but the diplomat believes more must be done 
sastry said his ministry is working to increase irrigation 
improve dry land farming and increase production in states where 
water is no problem 
indias initial green revolution allowed it to grow as much food 
as the people could buy but 200 million people 25 percent of the 
population dont have the money to buy enough food and are 
malnourished 
sastry said increases in rice and wheat production have leveled 
off in recent years but said he was not worried about population 
growth outstripping the countrys ability to feed itself 
but if you want to make a significant step up in production 
there will have to be another green revolution he said

democrat jesse jackson today urged the 
government to use caution in involving the military in its war on 
drugs and said that option should be used primarily as a backup 
jackson testified before the senate committee on labor and human 
resources about prevention and treatment of drug abuse and in the 
session senators lavished him with praise for his outspoken 
leadership on the subject 
in answer to a question from sen orrin hatch rutah about 
current sentiment in some quarters for legalization of drugs 
jackson replied that would be a mistake it would be surrender 
to the no 1 threat to our national security we would not think of 
legalization of smog because theres a lot of it its dangerous 
jackson commenting on the current effort to use the military in 
drug interdiction said we must be careful however to avoid 
involving the military in any police actions against citizens or 
arrests 
he said strengthening the coast guard and customs border patrol 
should be the first priority in interdiction 
we should not lead with our military forces in drugs or any 
other aspect of foreign policy but the military can play a greater 
and useful role in backing up these efforts and providing 
intelligence assistance he said 
before the hearing jackson jokingly pinned a large jackson 
88 badge on hatchs lapel hatch one of the conservative 
movements guiding lights wore the button through the hearing but 
joked that i thought you were worried sick about the effect it 
would have on you to have such a conservative wearing the badge 
jackson later met with sen ernest hollings dsc the only 
senator who has said he will give jackson his delegate vote at the 
convention 
hollings said he supports jackson because he won south carolina 
and he said more democrats should follow his example for the good 
of the party hollings also said jackson had changed since 1984 
when both of them ran for president 
i would think jesse frightened the bejesus out of them four 
years ago i remember him standing up and saying his time has come 
i want it all hollings said 
this time hes run a winning campaign he hasnt frightened 
anyone hes charmed them in all of those different debates and in 
his own right has leveled off 
on wednesday jackson said he met with dukakis campaign chairman 
paul brountas who has been interviewing potential running mates to 
join the massachusetts governor on the democratic presidential 
ticket 
but jackson told a news conference he has not yet decided 
whether he would want the post only that he has earned serious 
consideration 
he made the comments after a meeting with the congressional 
black caucus whose members urged him to seek the post and said 
they will try to meet with dukakis and lobby him to choose jackson 
jackson would not discuss his meeting with brountas but said it 
was a very meaningful preliminary discussion 
in a wednesday evening interview on cable news network jackson 
elaborated we simply discussed today the process discussed the 
guidelines we talked about the requirements after all we need to 
know what the rules are what the standards will be 
he said he is talking to dukakis not only about the vice 
presidency but about his budget concerns and his proposal to pay 
for social spending by freezing military spending and hiking taxes 
on the rich and corporations 
he said earlier in the day that his budget priorities are his 
most critical concern now that dukakis and he agree on south 
africa policy 
the most critical becomes this budget a commitment to invest 
in people a commitment to reinvest in america jackson said 
following a meeting with leaders of civil rights groups 
he said he is prepared to go to the convention floor if dukakis 
balks 
of course thats the proper mechanism and its the thing to 
do he told cnn when asked if he might wage a floor fight 
asked what would happen if he loses the fight jackson took a 
philosophical approach sometimes you win sometimes you lose 
if you lose you will at least have left your imprint 
on the vice presidency issue dukakis has said previously that 
jackson will be considered but not that he will get any special 
consideration by being runner up 
jackson made clear he would like the offer to be made to him 
although he has declined to say that in so many words publicly 
instead stating that it is dukakis option

prostitutes in africa who use birth 
control pills are two to three times as likely as other prostitutes 
to become infected with aids researchers said thursday 
they said it is not known why birth control pills should 
increase a womans risk of getting aids but the pills can prouce a 
condition that might serve as an entry point for the virus into the 
bloodstream 
the risk of getting aids through heterosexual contact also 
increases in people with such diseases as herpes syphilis and 
chancroid all of which produce genital ulcers or lesions said dr 
king holmes of harborview medical center in seattle wash 
control of these and other genital ulcer diseases should be 
the highest priority for controlling heterosexual aids 
transmission holmes said at the fourth international conference 
on aids 
in separate reports researchers said they found no evidence of 
mental problems in people who are infected with aids but have not 
developed other signs of the disease 
earlier studies had suggested mental faculties might decline 
soon after infection with the aids virus and the suggestion was 
made that infected people who were otherwise healthy should be 
removed from sensitive jobs the new research suggests no basis for 
such action researchers said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome a fatal disease for which 
no cure has been found is caused by a virus that damages the 
bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to infections and 
cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
holmes a specialist in sexually transmitted diseases cited 
figures from the us centers for disease control showing the 
number of reported aids cases acquired through heterosexual contact 
had increased from about 1 percent of the total cases in 1983 to 
almost 4 percent now 
among men the percentage has increased seven to nine times 
from onetenth of one percent to between seventenths and 
ninetenths of one percent he said 
in women the percentage of heterosexually acquired cases is 
much higher about 20 percent to 30 percent of aids cases in women 
in the united states were probably acquired through heterosexual 
contact he said 
the problem is especially severe among minorities in the inner 
cities the areas where prostitution and intravenous drug abuse are 
concentrated holmes said programs for prevention of 
heterosexual transmission of hiv via sex with prostitutes are 
urgently needed in all countries he said 
holmes recommended starting the programs in early adolescence 
because if you wait until 18 to give the lecture on aids its 
too late 
the association of genital ulcer disease and birth control pills 
with aids comes from studies by francis plummer and others in 
nairobi kenya holmes told the conference 
he said the pills can produce a condition called cervical ectopy 
in which part of the cervical lining is exposed to the vagina and 
the explosed lining might be an entry point for the aids virus into 
the bloodstream 
genital ulcer disease presumably increases the aids risk by 
allowing the virus to enter the body through the ulcers he said 
in the united states the leading causes of genital ulcer 
disease are herpes syphilis and chancroid in that order but in 
africa the bacterial infection chancroid is first 
holmes also noted that the sexually transmitted disease called 
chlamydia also may increase the risk of contracting aids as a 
consequence he said controlling sexually transmitted disease is 
crucial in the fight against aids 
aids prevention without sexually transmitteddisease control 
in a meaningful way is a blueprint for disaster he said 
the study of the effects of aids infection on the brain involved 
observation and examination of 201 people for two years slightly 
more than half of whom were infected with the aids virus they were 
examined every six months 
were not seeing any difference whatsoever in terms of a 
number of psychological measures known to be sensitive to virtually 
any form of brain damage said one of the authors dr ola 
selnes a psychologist at the johns hopkins medical institutions in 
baltimore 
the study by selnes and dr justin mcarthur also of johns 
hopkins found no basis for the concern that had been expressed 
about people in sensitive jobs selnes said 
based on our results we do not feel there is any cause for 
alarm or concern selnes said the study was sponsored by the 
national institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
researchers generally agree that mental problems do appear late 
in the progression of aids autopsies have shown about 70 percent 
of those who die of aids have significant mental and neurological 
problems after other symptoms develop said a report released in 
march by the world health organization

the georgia board of pardons and paroles today 
blocked the execution of freddie davis six hours before he was to 
die in the electric chair for raping and stabbing to death a woman 
in 1977 
the fivemember board suspended the execution for up to 90 days 
to decide whether davis life should be spared 
although the board could lift the suspension at any time board 
chairman wayne snow said he expected it would take at least that 
long to make a decision 
davis 30 would have been the second murderer put to death in 
the nation in two days and the 101st since resumption of capital 
punishment in 1977 
the board which conducted a hearing wednesday is the only 
nonjudicial state entity with the authority to commute a death 
sentence 
davis execution order expires at noon tuesday if the 
suspension remains in effect beyond then the state will have to 
seek a new execution order 
snow said the decision was prompted by questions over davis 
role in the killing a new trial granted an alleged accomplice and 
the accomplices recantation of incriminating testimony 
earlier today the 11th us circuit court of appeals denied 
without comment a request for a stay and attorneys appealed to the 
us supreme court 
the execution was scheduled for 7 pm at the georgia diagnostic 
and classification center near jackson 
davis was sentenced to death for the 1977 rape and stabbing of 
frances rice coe whose neighbor eddie spraggins also was convicted 
and sentenced to death in the case davis was 19 at the time of the 
slaying 
spraggins who was the prime witness against davis won a new 
trial after his lawyers argued that the judge failed to properly 
inform the jury that his iq was 65 
spraggins has recanted his 1977 testimony against davis in an 
affidavit filed with the georgia supreme court he said when i 
testified at freddie davis trial that freddie davis was in the 
room with mrs coe when mrs coe was killed this was false and 
untrue 
on tuesday edward r byrne jr 28 was executed in louisiana 
for killing a service station cashier he had romanced as part of a

several senators thursday attacked a proposed 
19 billion us weapons sale to kuwait that includes advanced 
fighter planes and an array of bombs and airtoground missiles 
it is inconceivable that the administration would 
contemplate such a large sale to a country which is so small and 
has been on less than friendly terms with the united states until 
recently sen dennis deconcini dariz told secretary of state 
george p shultz at a senate hearing 
deconcini also said he feared that the sale would make some of 
the most advanced weapons in the us arsenal accessible to the 
soviet union 
sen frank lautenberg dnj said he was concerned that the 
fa18 fighterbomber the most sophisticated plane of its type in 
the us arsenal could be outfitted with larger fuel tanks that 
could render it capable of attacking israel 
concern also was expressed by sens bob kasten rwis and 
arlen specter rpa at the hearing of the approprations 
subcommittee on foreign operations 
shultz defended the proposed sale saying it represented a 
political breakthrough for the kuwaitis to tie themselves to 
american technology and to take responsibility for their own 
defense he said kuwait is vulnerable to attack from iran and that 
the weapons would not have the range to reach israel 
and he said the sale agreement would have adequate controls to 
prevent access to the weapons by the soviets 
in our judgment this is a positive development shultz 
said the mission is if there is an attack by ground or sea from 
iran they can do something to counter that 
he said some of the alternative aircraft that had been 
considered by kuwait to replace its aging fleet would have had a 
longer range sufficient to reach israel 
the administration has notified congress informally that it 
intends to make the sale including 40 fa18 fighters 40 harpoon 
missiles 120 heatseeking sidewinder and 200 radarguided sparrow 
airtoair missiles 300 airtoground mavericks 200 cluster bombs 
and 400 laserguided bombs 
following a 20day informal notification period the 
administration will submit a formal notification to congress of the 
sale and lawmakers will have 30 days to pass a joint resolution 
disapproving the transaction 
if the sale goes through it would be the first time fa18s are 
sold to a country outside a formal us alliance so far only 
australia canada and spain all formal us allies have been 
permitted to buy the plane 
the administration was forced to drop mavericks from a weapons 
sale to saudi arabia last october and deconcini asked shultz if 
the same might be done in the kuwaiti sale 
shultz responded that the maverick is especially effective 
and was included in the sale to make the aircraft functional he 
said the kuwaiti sale was not comparable to the saudi sale because 
the saudis already had mavericks and were seeking additional ones 
kuwait currently has none he said

klaus juenschke a former leftwing 
terrorist sentenced to life in prison for robbing a bank and 
killing a police officer was pardoned thursday after serving 16 
years in prison 
juenschke 40 a former member of the red army faction has 
renounced terrorism in several interviews with the west german news 
media 
he was pardoned by rheinland pfalz governor bernhard vogel 
vogel said he pardoned juenschke because he had changed in 
views behaved well in prison and had already spent many years 
behind bars

president reagan told a group of honored high 
school seniors thursday that they and their soviet counterparts 
must bring peoples of other cultures together in a comman bond 
of humanity 
reagan addressing the winners of the presidential scholars 
medallion advised the students to stand forthrightly for the 
values of our whole way of life and what it is based upon 
the president who noted that he had spoken to students from 
moscow university during the recent ussoviet summit said it was 
vital that americans learn the importance of the values implicit 
in civilization and the need to teach and transmit from generation 
to generation a moral education 
loyalty faithfulness commitment courage patriotism the 
ability to distinguish between right and wrong i hope that these 
values are as much a part of your life as any calculus course or 
social science study reagan told the students 
the president said he found few differences between the young 
people in he had addressed in moscow and the youngsters before him 
in the rose garden and that its just our governments that are 
based on different principles 
and thats the job before you and those students in moscow for 
the remainder of this century and into the next one reagan said 
to bring peoples of other cultures together in that common bond 
of humanity 
he added that american students must also learn to speak for 
freedom to argue for democracy and always to bear in mind those 
fundamental moral distinctions between systems of government that 
believe in the dignity of the individual and others systems that 
simply see the individual as a cog in the great machine of the 
state 
the presidential scholars program was established in 1964 this 
year some 139 students were chosen 121 on the basis of academic 
achievements leadership qualities and community involvement the 
other 18 were recognized for superior accomplishments in the arts 
as well as academic performance the white house said

the son of former vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro was sentenced today to four months in 
jail for selling 25 worth of cocaine to an undercover police 
officer two years ago 
john zaccaro jr 24 and his parents stood stoically as judge 
francis mccaffrey handed down the sentence in vermont district 
court in rutland 
i cant in good conscience sentence you without any time to 
serve mccaffrey said the sentence also includes 300 hours of 
community service and a 1500 fine 
we are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the 
sentence ferraro said noting that other defendants in vermont 
drug cases have received lighter penalties 
well continue on our way with an appeal we love our son 
she said 
a tearful ferraro had asked mccaffrey not to treat her son 
differently than any other person convicted of selling a quarter of 
a gram of cocaine 
ferraro who ran on the democratic ticket in 1984 said her 
sons arrest and conviction has taken a heavy toll on her family 
and her son 
he doesnt go to church with us she said in vermont 
district court he doesnt want to be seen with us its not 
because hes ashamed of us its because hes ashamed of what hes 
done 
zaccaro told mccaffrey in a quivering voice that he has sworn 
off drugs 
id like to make a personal pledge to you and my family that i 
will never again be involved in drugs or any illegality he told 
mccaffrey 
mccaffrey suggested that the jail time be served through the 
chittenden community correctional center in burlington so that 
zaccaro could participate in a special corrections program that 
allows him to be kept under house arrest 
however addison county states attorney john quinn said later 
that zaccaro would have to be accepted into the program 
zaccaro is free during the 30 days he has to appeal the sentence 
zaccaro faced up to five years in prison and a 10000 fine 
his attorney charles tetzlaff had asked mccaffrey to accept a 
probation officers recommendation of a suspended sentence 
probation and community service of unspecified length 
quinn recommended a jail term citing the deterrent effect on 
drug cases in society he did not specify the length but said 
afterward he was pleased with the sentence 
he denied that he had treated the case differently 
this was a case in which we caught someone redhanded and i 
mean redhanded quinn said i felt that it was important for 
the court to say it doesnt matter who you are if you commit a 
drug offense in the state of vermont youll be treated with great 
severity 
also at the sentencing hearing the founder of covenant house a 
new york city shelter for runaways said he believes that zaccaro 
has learned from his mistakes and should not be imprisoned 
zaccaro has worked as a volunteer for the shelter in a program 
that brings runaways child prostitutes and other children from the 
streets to the center 
you cant try and reach these kids without coming into a 
far better and deeper understanding of your own value system 
said the rev bruce ritter probably the most important things we 
learn are from our mistakes john has learned them 
quinn said earlier that he wants the sentence to be noticed to 
deter other drug sellers and users 
if you want to get a message out to people you certainly want 
to send that in a highprofile case the prosecutor said we 
need to educate people about the horrors of drugs and if that 
doesnt work at least scare them away because of the possibility 
of legal sanction 
at the hearing quinn asked ritter what message the sentence 
should send regarding drug use 
i doubt that incarceration of john would be much of a 
deterrent to anyone ritter replied incarceration for john 
right now would be more in line of society seeking retribution 
rather than deterrence 
also testifying this morning was former middlebury police sgt 
david wemette who said that while investigating the case he found 
highly sophisticated scales on zaccaros desk 
he needs no more punishment ferraro said of her son in a 
letter written to mccaffrey he has been publicly flogged on 
national and international tv 
he will never touch drugs again and maybe someday ill even 
say it was a blessing in disguise ferraro wrote right now it 
still hurts too much to do so 
zaccaro has grown into a mature much quieter much more 
selfconscious adult since his arrest ferraro wrote 
the letter is among 30 that mccaffrey has received before 
sentencing zaccaro the contents of the letters are a part of the 
court record ferraros 1984 running mate walter mondale also put 
in a good word for zaccaro said court clerk ann dingler 
i saw him as a very fine young man who quickly became good 
friends with our children and who campaigned in a spirited and 
strong way around our nation said mondale 
zaccaro was convicted by a jury in april in vermont district 
court in rutland he was arrested in february 1986 after selling 
25 worth of cocaine to undercover agent laura manning while he was 
attending middlebury college 
manning testified that she went to zaccaros offcampus home and 
inquired about buying cocaine she said zaccaro produced a tray of 
cocaine packets from underneath the living room sofa zaccaro was 
arrested that night outside the restaurant where he worked 
tetzlaff claimed zaccaro had been entrapped saying police had 
used manning as bait to snare him during a college party weekend 
the prosecution denied the charge 
quinn had filed a motion asking that he be allowed to introduce 
at the hearing photographs of evidence seized from zaccaros car 
police said the evidence included 1600 in cash 8 grams of 
cocaine and records of drug transactions 
the evidence was excluded two years ago when mccaffrey ruled 
police had insufficient evidence when they obtained the warrant to 
search zaccaros car 
on wednesday a judge denied quinns motion setting the stage 
for todays sentencing 
zaccaro wrote about his work at covenant house in the march 
issue of womens day magazine describing at length the experiences 
of children on the streets and his decision to volunteer 
when i told my parents they were pleased when i told my 
lawyers they were not they knew it meant my dealing with drug 
users it would not be good for my image i laughed he wrote 
there were kids who needed help ive been lucky these kids 
never had a fair chance

elder statesman abba eban said thursday the 
labor party made a mistake when it pushed him off its slate for the 
november elections to make room for political newcomers deemed more 
attractive to voters 
eban 73 fell victim a new selection system in which for the 
first time the rankandfile not party bosses chose the slate for 
the elections to israels parliament the knesset 
half the candidates elected wednesday were political newcomers 
and labors general secretary uzi baram called the outcome a 
revolution and feast for israels democracy 
its clearly a disappointment eban told israel army radio 
during the years i have accumulated valuable knowledge and 
experience i told party members im ready to offer this but if 
you dont want it i wont 
during his 40year political career eban served as deputy prime 
minister foreign minister and israels ambassador to the united 
states and the united nations 
samuel lewis a former us ambassador to israel said ebans 
ouster was a real tragedy not for him but for the country 
ive never known anyone else who i thought had made a greater 
contribution to his country lewis told israel radio from 
washington 
political analyst yitzhak galnoor said eban might have retained 
his position had the party bosses formed the slate but the new 
selection process showed he doesnt have a following in israel 
eban is not connected to any influential groups hes just a 
bright guy with a terrific sense of humor unfortunately these 
things are not very admired in israeli politics said galnoor a 
political scientist at jerusalems hebrew university 
party members did not choose eban in the labor partys ranked 
list of candidates for israels 120member knesset the number of 
parliament seats assigned to a party depends on its total vote in 
the elections 
based on previous election results labor candidates in the top 
40 to 45 slots are expected to be reelected 
eleven slots including the top seven reserved for party 
leaders were filled by appointment not popular vote twentyone 
of the remaining 34 slots considered safe were given to 
newcomers 
four of the newcomers were sephardic jews from north african 
nations a group that has traditionally voted for labors political 
rival the rightwing likud bloc 
galnoor said the selection might improve labors chances in the 
election but also said such gains could be offset if labor doesnt 
deliver a clear message on how it will solve the arabisraeli 
conflict 
polls have indicated that the labor party might lose the 
election to likud because many voters have moved to the right in 
response to the 6monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
likud leaders say israel will never withdraw from the occupied 
territories labor advocates the return of some land in exchange 
for peace but opposes formation of a palestinian state or the 
dismantling of jewish settlements

south africa via swaziland to stage massive acts of terrorism 
in each case it said police stopped vehicles at roadblocks and 
riddled them with bullets after someone inside opened fire 
many factories shut down and the largest daily newspaper for 
blacks the sowetan did not publish workers at three diamond 
mines went on strike to demand that june 16 be designated a paid 
holiday 
the unrest came on the 12th anniversary of a police attack on 
marching schoolchildren in the black township of soweto ten 
people including two children died that june 16 the 
confrontation prompted a nationwide rampage in which hundreds were 
killed 
commemorative church services were held in many black townships

stonethrowing that occurred as blacks left a church service in 
lamontville outside durban 
at langa a black township outside cape town a commuter rail 
line was bombed at midday police headquarters said two officers on

sen ernest f hollings the only senator who 
has endorsed jesse jackson said thursday the democratic 
presidential candidate has run a winning campaign in 1988 that 
hasnt frightened voters as it did four years ago 
hollings who joined fellow south carolinian jackson at a 
capitol hill news conference said the jackson candidacy of 1988 is 
markedly different from his 1984 campaign 
i would think jesse frightened the bejesus out of them four 
years ago i remember him standing up and saying his time has come 
i want it all said hollings who made an unsuccessful bid for 
the presidency in 1984 
this time hes run a winning campaign he hasnt frightened 
anyone hes charmed them in all of those different debates and in 
his own right has leveled off he said 
people are looking at jesse jackson not as a black but really 
for his own philosophy with respect to hunger and nutrition and 
jobs and drugs and everything else hollings said 
thats why i think hes won support black and white and from 
vermont down to texas and the state of washington over to south 
carolina its a substantially different campaign than four years 
ago 
hollings who announced last week that he will vote for jackson 
at the democratic national convention said that although michael 
dukakis is the obvious winner of the partys presidential race 
jackson has earned his support 
hollings also urged other super delegates whose states and 
districts were won by jackson to join him in voting for the 
candidate super delegates are the unpledged public and party 
officeholders who will attend the convention in atlanta july 1821 
the obvious winner is governor dukakis for the good of the 
party we also ought to be supporting reverand jackson thats why 
coming from my home state he won my home state he certainly has 
earned my vote at the convention hollings said 
other democratic senators met with jackson but no endorsement 
was forthcoming 
jackson ignoring rival michael dukakis mathematical lock on 
the democratic nomination has said he will seek out the support of 
the super delegates and he has repeatedly pointed to hollings as 
an example for other super delegates 
the senator in announcing his decision last week said he 
wanted to honor a native south carolinian and join the delegates 
supporting jackson 
jackson has said he is not willing to concede the nomination to 
dukakis my priority at this point is to seek the nomination 
jackson insisted 
dukakis holds a commanding 2to1 lead over jackson in the 
latest associated press delegate count and leads by a wide margin 
in the number of super delegates 348 to 54 
jacksons super delegates include 20 members of the house and 
just one member of the senate hollings only three of his super 
delegates are white 
dukakiss 348 super delegates include 62 nonwhites

pope john paul ii has urged archbishop 
marcel lefebvre to abandon a consecration of bishops that would 
split the church and probably get the rebel traditionalist 
excommunicated the vatican said thursday 
creating bishops without papal permission is against canon it 
seems a certain path to expulsion from the roman catholic church 
for the french archbishop who has rebelled for two decades against 
what he calls selfdestructive changes in the church 
without being specific the pope reminded lefebvre by letter of 
the inevitable theological and canonical consequences that are 
known to you 
leaders of the church in france switzerland and west germany 
issued a joint statement thursday urging lefebvre to to change 
his decision and we pray that he does not commit the unrepairable 
the last schism in the church occurred in 1870 over the dogma of 
papal infallibity 
lefebvre 82yearold founder of the traditionalist st pius x 
fraternity based in switzerland said wednesday he would consecrate 
four followers as bishops june 30 the fraternity was named after 
piux x who was pope in 190314 and who condemned religious 
modernism 
the vatican said in a statement thursday that in a may 5 
protocol worked out by lefebvre and the vatican the pontiff gave 
the archbishop permission to consecrate one bishop aug 15 
pope paul vi barred lefebvre in 1976 from saying mass and giving 
the sacraments but the archbishop has ordained more than 200 
priests who continue to use the 16th century tridentine mass a 
latin rite for which special permission is required his movement 
claims millions of followers worldwide 
according to the statement thursday the vatican issued a 
pressing appeal to members of lefebvres fraternity and their 
followers to rethink their position and remain united with 
the pope assuring them that all measures will be taken to 
guarantee their identity in full communion with the catholic 
church 
noting lefebvres announcement with profound pain the 
vatican issued a chronology thursday of its efforts in the past 
seven months to resolve the dispute it also published the texts of 
the protocol and letters between the the archbishop and john paul 
under the protocol lefebvre would have promised tobe faithful 
to the church and pope and to accept the teachings of the second 
vatican council of 196265 the council simplified and modernized 
the liturgy instituting such reforms as celebration of the mass in 
the local language 
the protocol required lefebvres recognition of the validity 
of the mass and the sacraments according to the rites 
promulgated by paul vi and by john paul ii but would allow the 
archbishop to use liturgy antedating the council 
lefebvre wrote to cardinal joseph ratzinger head of the 
congregation for the doctrine of the faith the day after the 
protocol insisting that consecration of the bishop take place june 
30 the vatican said 
when his request was refused it said lefebvre wrote to the 
cardinal and john paul renewing both his demand for june 30 and a 
previous proposal that four bishops be consecrated 
at one point in the exchange of correspondence with the pope 
lefebvre said the false ecumenism which lies at the origin of 
all the innovations in liturgy in new relations between the 
church and the world in the conception of the church itself leads 
the church to its ruin and catholics to apostasy 
john paul responded from a paternal heart but with all the 
gravity required by the present circumstances i exhort you 
venerable brother to renounce your plan which if realized could 
only appear as a schismatic act whose inevitable theological and 
canonical consequences are known to you

a leading soviet film director visiting israel 
praised books banned in his country said the kremlin should renew 
ties with the jewish state and showed soviet immigrants his latest 
movie 
eldar ryazanov secretary of the soviet cinematographers union 
also told about 1000 soviet jews at wednesday nights screening 
that some political emigrants should be pardoned and allowed to 
visit the land of their birth 
ryazanov hailed mikhail s gorbachev as the most humane 
leader in the soviet union in decades he cited reforms that 
allowed him and his wife to visit israel 
ryazonov is the highestranking soviet artist to come to israel 
since such visits became possible about a year ago travel from the 
soviet union to israel was barred after the kremlin severed ties in 
1967 and soviet artists who did visit the west usually traveled 
without their families 
but its very tragic to spend a lifetime before starting to 
enjoy freedom said ryazanov 
the 60yearold filmmaker who is known for satirical comedies 
greeted former compatriots in halting hebrew and won applause as he 
said ties between israel and the soviet union should be restored 
ryazanov then switched to native russian to praise gorbachevs 
reforms but almost in the same breath said he just resigned from a 
job at the soviet television in protest over state censorship 
answering written questions he praised books by exiled nobel 
prize winner alexander solzhenitsyn who now lives in the united 
states and called the gulag archipelago a work of vast 
social importance solzhenitsyns books are banned in the soviet 
union 
but ryazanov omitted the writers name when he said some 
political emigrants such as theater director yuri lyubimov who 
took israeli citizenship and writers vasily aksyonov of the united 
states and naum korzavin of france should get back their soviet 
citizenship 
they should be able to choose where to live while being able 
to travel freely to their homeland ryazanov said freedom to 
travel is as natural as freedom to breathe 
he noted that the airplane that brought him to israel was packed 
with soviet jews visiting emigrant relatives in israel they 
could not see their relatives for years there were embraces 
tears and one couldnt watch it calmly 
in recent months hundreds of soviet jews have been allowed to 
visit relatives in israel and some immigrants are permitted to 
travel to the soviet union 
the soviet union also allowed 4695 jews to emigrate this year 
israel officially estimates as many as 380000 want to leave but 
an israeli delegation leader who recently visited the soviet union 
put the figure at 25000 
ryazanov said that he tried to use freedom as much as 
possible in his 1987 romantic comedy forgotten melody for a 
flute which was screened for the israeli audience 
the movie is about a soviet bureaucrat who is married to a woman 
he doesnt love but whose influential father promises to help his 
career the hero must decide whether to remain married or run off 
with a poor nurse he loves 
at last soviet lovers have sex said one immigrant viewer 
referring to a scene in which the adulterous couple is shown naked 
in bed others praised the film for making fun of soviet censorship 
and influence peddling

the head of the national aeronautics and space 
administration warned thursday that the united states is losing its 
position as leader of the worlds industrial nations because it is 
spending less now on technical research and development 
james fletcher in a speech prepared for the national conference 
on strategic management of research and development said the 
nation is just now beginning to recognize a longterm drought in 
the national technical capability 
for instance he said the american machine tool industry has 
been swamped by japan west germany and italy and the us market 
share of civil aircraft has dropped to 65 percent and promises to 
continue its decline 
we have focused on marketing old products in newer packages at 
the expense of investments in innovation and evolutionary 
improvements the nasa administrator said 
fletcher said the federal investment in aeronautics and space 
research and development has declined causing nasa to be less bold 
in its technological innovation and exploration of the unknown 
this is the wrong direction for leadership he said this 
is living off the advances of the past in nasas case of the 
apollo era 
fletcher said that if the us trends continue in technology 
nasa and the nation will become net consumers not producers of 
science and the technology it makes possible if that occurs the 
climb back to any position of parity in world affairs will be 
arduous indeed and certainly not certain of success

society does not know if there are soviet pows prisoners of war

come venediktov told tass 
gennady i gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman told 
reporters monday that previous appeals to pakistan had led to the 
release of some soviet prisoners but he did say when or how many

visiting the mujahedeen in afghanistan have told of the killing of 
soviet pows how prior to their execution the young mens eyes were 
torn out their noses ears and genitals cut off 
sometimes the doomed prisoners are skinned alive the 
statement asserted american eyewitnesses also inform us that 
those pows who have survived so far are chained hand and foot and 
held underground in constant darkness 
the soviets have said they had 100300 soldiers in afghanistan 
before they began pulling them out may 15 under the terms of the 
unsponsored agreement on afghanistan signed in geneva in april

included women and children and that several houses were destroyed

mortars and rockets whizzed through two 
refugee camps in beirut on thursday leaving 12 people dead and 29 
injured as rival palestinian groups fought for control of the areas 
in southeast lebanon israeli soldiers killed two lebanese 
guerrillas in an ambush on the western slopes of mount hermon 
police said 
police said the new casualties in beirut brought the toll to 31 
people killed and 130 wounded since the latest clashes over the 
chatilla and bourj elbarajneh refugee camps broke out last week 
the thuds of exploding shells resounded as ambulances evacuated 
casualties from the two shantytowns on the southern outskirts of 
the lebanese capital 
the fatah guerrilla group of yasser arafats mainstream 
palestine liberation organization accused the breakaway faction 
called fatahuprising of indiscriminate shelling the group 
rebelled against arafats leadership with syrian backing in may 
1983 
a spokesman for arafats group speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the rival group was shelling both refugee camps 
from the outside he said his group repulsed several attacks 
a police spokesman said fatahuprising rebels shelled the camps 
from syriancontrolled territory in west beirut and the seaside 
suburb of ouzai 
the police spokesman confirmed fatahuprising tried but failed 
to enter the camps the fighting raged despite efforts by a 
committee of representatives from seven neutral palestinian groups 
to supervise a ceasefire 
in southeast lebanon israeli gunners and helicopter gunships 
attacked the terrain north of israels selfproclaimed security 
zone while pursuing a guerrilla group another police spokesman

party were killed in an ambush north of the security zone

more than 1000 coal miners hooted and 
cheered as union leaders and miners denounced proposed federal 
safety rule changes at a public hearing thursday 
the hearing was punctuated by catcalls shouts and standing 
ovations from the miners who union officials said were on a 
contractsanctioned day off from 87 mines in illinois and indiana 
the united mine workers is staging rallies at public hearings on 
the proposed changes being conducted around the country by the mine 
safety and health administration thursdays hearing was the fourth 
of six planned 
excuse me said moderator patricia silvey trying to quiet 
the crowd this will be an orderly proceeding 
jerry jones president of umw district 12 in illinois also 
appealed for order then accused the reagan administration of 
putting the interests of mine owners before safety 
their position is that they want to get government out of 
industry jones said now surely a coal operator for example 
should know how to operate his mine but deregulation has not been 
effective 
some miners carried signs reading we give our sweat but not 
our blood and laws to live by not die by 
the proposals on underground mine ventilation include 
elimination of required 20minute checks for methane gas an 
increase in the allowable limits of methane and a lifting of the 
requirement that miners be evacuated whenever ventilation fans 
break down 
representatives from the federal agency maintained that the 
proposed changes partly reflect improvements in mine monitoring 
systems 
we included several new provisions in the proposals that we 
think would be definite safety improvements said ms silvey 
director of the agencys office of standards regulations and 
variances 
she said the changes include a provision for electronic systems 
that continuously monitor mine air for methane and oxygen 
deficiencies 
miner robert m danner from nearby newburgh said methane fire 
is one of the miners greatest fears he recalled an accident at 
the madisonville ky mine where he worked 15 years ago 
we had an ignition and a roll of fire came across the man from 
a pocket of gas danner said it didnt kill him but it 
charred him black its a horrible site if youve ever seen a man 
whos just been burned to a crisp 
the union contends the rule changes were designed primarily to 
save mining companies money 
however testimony from companies at previous hearings indicates 
that use of the electronic air monitoring system does not guarantee 
higher profits said richard zuetenhorst a deputy director in the 
federal mining regulations office

democrat michael dukakis endorsed the 
idea of a special counsel to investigate house speaker jim wright 
on thursday and said wright was willing to go along in contrast 
to the kind of stonewalling weve had from the administration 
asked about wright as he opened a southern campaign swing 
dukakis said he understood the texas democrat had welcomed the 
independent counsel 
wright said thursday in washington that he would welcome the 
hiring of an outside investigator by the house ethics committee if 
that would speed up the panels probe of his financial dealings 
dukakis was in nashville to receive the endorsement of sen 
albert gore jr of tennessee one of his former rivals for the 
democratic presidential nomination 
during the primary campaign gore had compared dukakis to the 
democratic presidential candidates who had lost four of the past 
five national elections 
but gore who dropped out of the race after losing badly in the 
new york primary said i think that mike dukakis image in the 
south and all over the country is very different than many people 
thought it was going to be when this campaign began 
gore differed strongly with dukakis on defense and foreign 
policy issues during the campaign but he said thursday i was 
pleased to see not only mike dukakis but all of us learning from 
each other 
dukakis when asked if he hoped to get a similar endorsement 
from jesse jackson before the democratic convention next month 
said i would hope jesse jackson will be a part of this campaign 
and as early as possible 
jackson has vowed to continue his campaign until the convention 
roll call that decides the nomination 
dukakis already has far more than the delegates he needs for a 
majority on that roll call 
asked if he was concerned at the prospect of wright presiding 
over the convention at the same time he was under investigation 
dukakis said i thought there was a presumption of innocence in 
this country certainly one i believe in 
at the same time he said he has called for attorney general 
edwin meese iii to resign i certainly have said the 
massachusetts governor thats after repeated evidence of 
insensitivity a lack of awareness of what we mean when we talk 
about high standards 
if youre attorney general of this country and youve stumbled 
as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he has and provided 
as weak leadership as he has you ought to leave office dukakis 
said 
he said that wrights attitude toward the idea of an independent 
counsel contrasts rather sharply with the kind of stonewalling 
weve had from the administration on case after case after case 
he said wrights approach was the way that we ought to respond 
to these kind of things 
gore said he was confident dukakis would carry five or six 
states in the south against republican george bush

radical mobs shouting about government 
corruption attacked riot squads thursday and police said they 
arrested six students who tried to throw firebombs at the home of 
former president chun doohwan 
fighting began at the university of foreign studies in eastern 
seoul when police fired volleys of tear gas to keep 1000 radicals 
from five nearby schools from marching off the campus 
students hurled firebombs and rocks for two hours screaming 
punish criminals yankee go home and other demands for 
withdrawal of the 42000 us troops stationed in south korea under 
a mutual defense pact 
antiamericanism has become a strong element in recent protests 
by the radical students who contend the united states enforces 
partition of the korean peninsula and treats the south as a colony 
twenty students throwing firebombs dashed toward chuns home 
wednesday night but tear gas stopped them 150 yards short of the 
target and six were arrested police reported 
they said the students flung six firebombs at riot officers and 
a nearby police post afterward shouting investigate corruption 
under the former government no damage or injuries were reported 
police seized 48 firebombs and leaflets accusing chun of 
corruption and abuse of power during his seven years in office 
which ended in february they demanded a full investigation and 
punishment 
accusations of corruption and embezzlement of funds have been 
made against chun and members of his family since he left office 
the political opposition also claims chun a former general put in 
power by the army was responsible for numerous cases of torture 
and brutality 
radical students accuse chun president roh taewoo a fellow 
general who succeeded him and the united states of responsibility 
for military repression of a 1980 civil uprising in the southern 
city of kwangju nearly 200 people were killed according to 
government figures 
minor clashes were reported thursday in taejon another southern 
city between police and students denouncing the blockade of a 
march to the border with communist north korea 
much larger battles occurred jun 10 when police stopped 
thousands of radicals from marching to the border for meetings with 
north korean students on reunifying the peninsula which was 
divided in 1945 
in another development chief justice kim yongchun of the 
supreme court said thursday he would resign in response to calls by 
junior magistrates for judicial reform 
on wednesday 85 judges issued a statement saying the judiciary 
is seen as subservient to the government and has not benefited from 
recent democratic changes it was the first such collective action 
by judges in the nations history 
another 194 judges joined in a supporting statement thursday and 
support for the demand is expected to continue growing among the 
940 magistrates in south korea

democrat michael dukakis and republican george 
bush are running neckandneck in the south but the tide could turn 
quickly against dukakis if he selects jesse jackson as his running 
mate a poll released thursday showed 
democratic pollster claibourne darden jr said the survey of 750 
voters in nine southern states found that the massachusetts 
governor and the vice president are in a statistical tie among 
traditionally conservative southern voters dukakis was the choice 
of 451 percent bush 423 percent and 127 percent were undecided 
the telephone poll was conducted june 813 among voters in what 
darden described as the hardcore southern states of virginia 
north carolina south carolina georgia florida alabama 
mississippi louisiana and tennessee the margin of error was 36 
percent 
its a horse race but dukakis is on shaky ground darden 
said 
of the people surveyed who said they would vote for dukakis 
four of 10 are for dukakis not because of dukakis but because 
they dislike bush an anti vote early in a campaign is based 
on personality and can leave you very quickly he said 
bush among other things must learn to speak english by 
bringing his vocabulary down to earth darden said 
with the two likely nominees running neckandneck the vice 
presidential choice becomes critical darden said for dukakis to 
choose jackson would be disastrous in the south the pollster 
said 
only 258 percent said the selection of jackson for the no 2 
spot would make them more inclined to vote for dukakis while 531 
percent said they would be less inclined to vote democratic some 
212 percent were undecided 
i think everyone has to be surprised at how well dukakis is 
doing in the south darden said but he added that because it is 
based largely on an antibush sentiment george bush himself is 
doing more to break the republican lock on the south than michael 
dukakis is doing

the navy and the state department are 
investigating allegations that marine security guards stationed in 
havana improperly fraternized with cuban women officials said 
thursday 
the investigation focuses on four marines and their offduty 
social activities and does not involve any allegations of 
espionage the officials said 
two years ago a similiar fraternization scandal erupted 
involving marine guards at the us embassy in moscow one marine 
was convicted of espionage 
right now there is no indication of the four of them being 
involved in anything except fraternization lt col john 
shotwell a marine corps spokesman said of the latest case and 
the investigation is still continuing 
the pentagon in a brief statement said the four guards have 
been returned to their parent unit the marine security guard 
battalion located at quantico va pending completion of the 
investigation 
four marine security guards assigned to the us diplomatic 
post in cuba the us interest section colocated with the swiss 
embassy are suspected of fraternization with local civilians in 
violation of state department policy the statement added 
the naval security and investigative command in coordination 
with the state department is conducting a routine investigation of 
the matter because the matter is under investigation and no 
individuals have been charged with any wrongdoing it would be 
premature to release any details at this time 
the state department and marine corps forbid fraternization 
between security guards and local women at posts in the soviet 
union the warsaw pact countries and several other nations 
including communist cuba 
according to pentagon sources the alleged fraternization among 
guards in cuba included sexual intercourse during several contacts 
that occurred late last year and early this year 
the sources who agreed to discuss the matter only if not 
identified said the allegations came to light in february when two 
cuban women sought asylum at the canadian embassy claiming they 
feared arrest for consorting with foreigners the women had with 
them the names of some marine guards the officials said 
assuming no evidence of espionage is developed the sources said 
the four marines would probably face only administrative 
disciplinary action and not courtsmartial 
according to the marine corps the guard force in cuba for the 
interests section includes one detachment commander and seven 
watchstanders

the house approved a 441 billion money bill 
for farm programs and food aid thursday with fewer complaints this 
year from urban lawmakers that payment programs have gotten out of 
hand 
everyones pointing to agriculture like were the ones who are 
causing the deficit like were all causing all this international 
debt agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza said 
he said agriculture represented only a small part of the 
estimated 176 billion budget deficit for the fiscal year that 
starts oct 1 
they stumble over that much at the pentagon the texas 
democrat said 
farm payment programs which include price supports income 
supports and conservation payments peaked at 26 billion in 1986 
those programs now are down to an estimated 17 billion in fiscal 
1988 
the drop in overall farm payments has muted somewhat the chorus 
of complaints that met 1985 legislation designed to alleviate 
painful problems in the farm economy 
but while farm payments have gone down as the farm economy has 
recovered a number of critics of excesses in the farm programs 
say there still is much to complain about 
the house voted 34354 to approve the money bill amid calls from 
farmbloc lawmakers for aid to growers and livestock producers 
squeezed financially by a drought across broad areas of the country 
the bill earmarked no drought aid however and most lawmakers 
said they were inclined to go along with administration suggestions 
that it would be best to wait until the full extent of the problem 
becomes clear 
the agriculture department has been saying an inch or so of rain 
once a week for the rest of the growing season would rescue midwest 
corn and soybeans although wheat in montana and the dakotas is in 
far worse condition 
the bill calls for outlays of 441 billion for the fiscal 1989 
for programs ranging from farm payments to food stamps that is 
25 billion less than requested by president reagan and 12 
billion below last years amount 
it also is 3 billion below an agricultural appropriations bill 
currently being drawn up in the senate 
it contains 163 billion for food and nutrition programs 124 
billion for rural development and 68 billion to replace losses of 
the governmentowned commodity credit corp which operates federal 
payment programs for farmers 
farm program spending has dropped sharply over the last year as 
exports expanded and the farm economy shook off the doldrums of the 
early 1980s 
thus a 143 billion decrease in funds to cover losses of the 
commodity credit corp represents the bills major savings 
critics however said it is optimistic to expect a sale of 
governmentheld stocks will yield 3 billion to help cover 
additional losses and hold down costs 
it appears to me there are lots of mirrors on the ceiling and 
lots of smoke coming from the cloakroom rep robert s walker 
rpa said 
rep steve gunderson rwis said it most likely would be 
necessary to come back for a supplemental appropriation later 
the house debated for two hours a plan by rep joseph j 
dioguardi rny to bar further farmers home administration loans 
to farmers already in default but farm forces defeated 31088 a 
parliamentary maneuver designed to bring up his proposal for a vote 
everybody knows that you dont lend money to people who never 
paid you back on youre previous loans dioguardi said 
everybody but the united states of america 
farm state lawmakers were quick to take up dioguardis challenge 
this gentleman who comes here from new york and suggests that 
the farmers are trying to pull the wool over the farmers home 
administration just hasnt been there to share the problems said 
rep dick durbin dill 
the targeted export assistance program established in 1985 as a 
subsidy for overseas advertising and promotion of food exports 
exports came under renewed criticism from rep charles schumer 
dny 
even if the program were extremely well run maybe we ought 
not to be funding it he said he pointed to millions of dollars 
paid out to private companies for advertising campaigns abroad 
schumer cited a report from the general accounting office that 
found program mismanagement

the peace corps is sending volunteers to 
pakistan for the first time in 21 years and will begin a new 
program in the comoros islands off africa agency director loret 
miller ruppe said thursday 
a peace corps assessment team will also go to china this summer 
to plan for the first set of volunteers for that country mrs 
ruppe told a luncheon audience at the national press club 
the three new programs will bring to nearly 70 the number of 
countries welcoming the peace corps and mrs ruppe said the 
grassroots agency hopes to grow even bigger 
those cynics who wonder if the peace corps is still around 
should know that the congress and the president have not only 
endorsed but mandated a fiveyear growth plan for the peace corps 
to double in size to 10000 volunteers by 1992 she said 
the agency whose last program in pakistan ended in 1967 is 
sending eight volunteers to islamabad and lahore this fall to train 
high school teachers the emphasis will be on training english 
teachers but education courses for biology chemistry and physics 
instructors also will be given 
nine volunteers will be assigned to the comoros islands an 
islamic nation 250 miles off the coast of mozambique they will 
arrive in july for language and cultural training and begin working 
in september mrs ruppe said 
the china program is scheduled to begin sometime next year 
since chinese foreign minister wu xueqians announcement in 
march that china would welcome the peace corps the agency has 
received 300 public queries from americans declaring their 
eagerness to participate in the chinese program said agency 
spokesman james c flanigan 
thats a fairly good number of people expressing an interest 
in going to a particular country flanigan said the peace corps 
never guarantees a volunteers choice of country but flanigan said 
the agency was bouyed by the interest shown in china 
at the time of wus announcement officials said an 
englishteaching program would be the most likely plan and that the 
initial complement would be about 50 volunteers the assessment 
team will discuss the location of the first group 
its very much their call mrs ruppe said of the chinese 
the peace corps was created during the kennedy administration to 
spread skills to the grass roots of developing countries and 
broaden the horizons of young americans despite conservative 
hostility to the agency at the outset of the reagan administration 
it has grown in the past seven years 
the peace corps gets 200000 queries a year from potential 
volunteers of whom 17000 fill out applications and 2600 are 
accepted currently the agency is particularly interested in 
people with skills as teacher trainers and agriculture experts 
mrs ruppe said 
in its expansion plans the agency will try to increase the size 
of some of its contingents and try to get more nations to accept 
volunteers during its heyday the agencys biggest program was in 
india where up to 1600 volunteers served the biggest one is now 
in honduras where there are 300 peace corps people 
south america would be a fertile ground for new programs mrs 
ruppe said on that continent only paraguay and ecuador accept 
volunteers she said

business inventories rose moderately as sales 
slackened in april the government said thursday in a report 
signaling slower economic growth for the second quarter 
the commerce department said inventories climbed 05 percent to 
a seasonally adjusted 7237 billion in april the gain came as 
total business sales fell 02 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
4788 billion 
the rise in goods stockpiled on shelves and backlots followed a 
03 percent climb in march and a 04 percent increase in february 
the slight drop in business sales came after a 19 percent jump in 
march the largest in more than a year and a 11 percent gain in 
february 
economists generally take rising inventories as a sign that 
buying demand is slowing and as an indication that manufacturers 
may have to cut back production 
lawrence chimerine chairman of the wefa group an economic 
forecasting service in bala cynwyd pa said april inventory 
growth was slightly disturbing and would be a real source of 
concern if it continued 
but he said he expected smaller growth in the months ahead and 
did not foresee a return to the high rate of inventory expansion 
from october to january when monthly increases ranged from 07 
percent to 12 percent 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
goverment securities dealer in new york said slower growth in the 
economy as a whole as measured by the gross national product may 
be a blessing in disguise 
the inventory numbers certainly signal the likelihood well 
grow at a slower pace maybe gnp will hit 25 percent in the second 
quarter compared with 39 percent in the first quarter jones 
said 
but that may be desireable because it could well make it 
possible to maintain more sustained growth without a sharp 
acceleration of inflationary pressure he said 
inventories in april were 79 percent higher than a year ago 
while sales were 76 percent greater 
the rise in april inventories included a 09 percent increase at 
the wholesale level a 04 percent rise in goods held by 
manufacturers and a 03 percent growth at the retail level 
the 02 percent decline in business sales was paced by 04 
percent drops in both wholesale and retail sales sales by 
manufacturers were unchanged 
in an advance report on wednesday the government said retail 
sales edged up only 01 percent in may 
the combination of falling sales and moderately rising 
inventories pushed the inventorytosales ratio up from 150 in 
march to 151 in april that means it would take 151 months to 
exhaust inventories at the april sales pace a ratio not considered 
abnormally high

the pentagon recovering from an accident in 
january has successfully resumed its testing of a chemical laser 
that one day could become a key part of any star wars antimissile 
defense system officials said thursday 
the latest test of the socalled alpha laser was conducted 
wednesday night behind closed doors at a contractors laboratory in 
san juan capistrano calif 
it marked the final checkout of all the laser components and 
support equipment and was considered a complete success said 
richard garcia a spokesman for the air force weapons laboratory at 
kirtland air force base nm 
the test replicated all the heat and pressure effects that will 
exist when a laser beam is produced in the new system but by 
design no lasing was attempted on wednesday said garcia 
the next and final stage of the testing program producing a 
highpowered laser beam through a chemical reaction will probably 
begin this fall the spokesman added 
the test conducted wednesday evening had been scheduled several 
months ago but was put off indefinitely while engineers repaired 
damage caused during a brief accidental fire on jan 7 
the fire at the trw inc laboratory resulted from an operating 
mistake by a worker little direct damage was done but the fire 
left contaminated the main vacuum chamber needed to simulate firing 
the laser in outer space and thus halted all testing 
the air force weapons laboratory completed a milestone test of 
its alpha laser on wednesday garcia said in a statement 
the laser successfully completed a hot flow test with heat 
released from the cavity this test verified that all supporting 
assemblies were operating properly and that alpha was ready to 
begin receiving the optical components necessary for full lasing 
tests 
the experiment was as close as we can get to lasing without 
actually doing it the spokesman added 
the alpha laser described by the pentagon as the most mature 
of the star wars directedenergy technologies has been under 
study for almost a decade 
the device is constructed primarily of aluminum making it 
relatively light and compact and draws its energy from the 
combustion of the gases hydrogen and fluorine it is thought to 
generate roughly 2 million watts of power 
last october the pentagon awarded a contract to martin marietta 
corp asking it to assess the possibility of conducting 
experiments in space with alpha in the meantime however trw 
which built the device began preparing for the first ground tests 
in the laboratory

eight inmates three of them convicted 
murderers escaped thursday from the only maximumsecurity 
penitentiary in kentucky and authorities say they likely split up 
after they fled 
at least nine other inmates also tried but failed to flee the 
kentucky state penitentiary after several small fires were started 
in another section of the building to divert guards said prison 
spokesman bobby waller 
the escapees apparently sawed their sliding cell doors from 
their tracks and then cut through a prison window early thursday 
morning officials said 
one prisoner was found hanging from the window he said and 
eight other singleman cells had cut marks on them indicating 
those prisoners also tried to get out said waller 
barry banister another spokesman said the search was 
concentrated in the area around the penitentiary which is five 
miles east of eddyville 
authorities said dogs had tracked the scent of at least one 
escapee to a spot about a halfmile away where a pickup was stolen 
we have reason to believe that based on various reports they 
may have split up waller said 
the prison near lake barkley and kentucky lake is surrounded 
on three sides by water and on the fourth by woods waller said 
its very easy for an individual to elude us he said 
waller said officials believed the escape was the states 
largest 
the fires broke out in the administrative control unit which 
houses the worst of the worst said waller the escapees were 
in another area he said 
state police dispatched two light airplanes to help in the 
search along with troopers the dog team local authorities and 60 
prison officers 
meanwhile in north carolina a 5000 reward was offered 
thursday by authorities for information leading to the arrest of 
any of the four prisoners who escaped sunday night from the 
cumberland county jail in fayetteville 
the search for the missing four men is still at an intense 
level said sheriff morris bedsole we are not going to let up 
until they are back in the jail

taking a rare active role in an ongoing 
federal investigation president reagan told top law enforcement 
officials thursday to move as rapidly as possible to get the 
facts in a burgeoning pentagon fraud investigation 
reagan who told congress two years ago that he did not want 
lawmakers scrutinizing every paper clip bolt and bullet in the 
defense budget was described by spokesman marlim fitzwater as 
very concerned about allegations of bribepaying and kickbacks 
i think were all aware of the wide scope of this 
investigation fitzwater said and it certainly poses an 
internal security problem and an abuse problem of dimensions that 
have to be dealt with forthrightly 
im just not at liberty to expand on any of the details he 
said when asked to elaborate 
federal investigators armed with evidence from two years worth 
of wiretaps and this weeks coasttocoast raids are preparing to 
approach witnesses who now may be forced to cooperate in the probe 
the investigation has turned up rampant bribery in the 
government and includes allegations of cash payments purchase of 
cars and payments of bills for government employees sen john 
warner of virginia the ranking republican member of the armed 
services committee said wednesday 
fitzwater said reagan believes this is a matter that deserves 
his attention and that everyone involved should know of his 
feelings the intensity which he feels about dealing with any kinds 
of crimes that have been committed here 
government sources familiar with the probe said searches of 
offices of 15 defense contractors on tuesday stemmed from wiretaps 
on the offices of two top pentagon officials the bugs have been in 
place for much of the twoyear investigation 
reagan in 1985 created a commission to study ways to streamline 
pentagon operations the panel headed by industrialist and former 
deputy defense secretary david packard recommended a stronger hand 
for the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and a new civilian 
office to oversee defense department purchasing 
the commission also recommended that there be less 
micromanagement of the pentagon by congress and reagan said 
he agreed with that 
instead of scrutinizing every paper clip bolt and bullet 
congress should give more thought to our overall defense needs and 
strategy he said 
on thursday reagan met with attorney general edwin meese iii 
fbi director william sessions and top justice department 
prosecutors he had met wednesday with defense secretary frank c 
carlucci 
reagan seldom has involved himself directly in investigations of 
alleged wrongdoing although he was interviewed by a commission 
that probed the irancontra affair 
fitzwater said the president had not been told about the 
pentagon investigation at its outset but was not disturbed by that 
the fbi starts hundreds of investigations that are carried out 
over a long period of time the white house is not aware of most 
if not all of those investigations he said 
fitzwater said there always comes a time when any 
investigation when its presented to the justice department for 
criminal action or whether its presented to a grand jury for 
possible indictment it becomes known to the civilian authority 
whether its the president or the head of the agency or the bureau 
or whatever 
im sure that in this case it was simply their judgment that 
this was the right time to make it known to the defense department 
and the white house he said 
fitzwater said the president was satisfied that the bureau has 
acted with the naval investigative service quickly and effectively 
and pursued this investigation

lawmakers who say the occupational safety and 
health adminstration has taken little action to prevent 
construction accidents such as last years collapse of a 
connecticut apartment complex that killed 28 workers on thursday 
proposed tightening federal laws regulating construction 
the legislation would stiffen osha fines tighten accident 
reporting requirements mandate a professional engineer to oversee 
construction projects make negligent employers liable to stiff 
prison terms and give the agency authority to shut down a work site 
to investigate an accident 
connecticut lawmakers drafted the measure following house and 
senate hearings examining the april 23 1987 collapse of 
lambiance plaza a halfbuilt apartment complex in bridgeport 
conn lambiance plaza was the worst construction accident in new 
england history 
it has been more than a year since lambiance collapsed 
said rep christopher shays rconn the chief house spnosor 
tragically we have seen little movement to change any of the 
factors that contributed to the accident 
shays said he hoped the bill would arm osha with the proper 
tools to help fulfill its mandate to protect worker health and 
safety 
sen lowell p weicker jr rconn the chief sponsor in the 
senate said the country must not tolerate any more willow 
islands or lambiance plazas or any of the thousands of other 
accidents that claim lives and futures and could be avoided if 
industry and government act swiftly and responsibly 
lambiance plaza was the nations worst construction accident 
since a cooling tower under construction in willow island w va 
collapsed in 1978 killing 51 
the shaysweicker bill 
requires an onsite engineer or architect to oversee 
construction projects 
increases maximum osha construction fines from 10000 per 
violation to 25000 
increases maximum criminal penalties for firsttime willful 
violations from six months in prison and 10000 in fines to 10 
years in prison and 250000 in fines repeat offenders would be 
subject to 20 years in prison and 500000 in fines 
gives osha officials the authority to close down a work site 
to investigate an accident 
mandates employers to report accidents and for osha officials 
to inspect within 24 hours when there are at least three workers 
hospitalized one lifethreatening injury or fatality or a 
collapse partial collapse or near collapse of a building 
under current osha regulations contractors are required to 
report an accident only if a worker is killed or at least five are 
seriously injured and there is no mandate for osha inspections

presidential candidates should thoroughly 
evaluate their running mates and not make hasty decisions for the 
occupant of the office a heartbeak away from the white house 
political experts said thursday 
the speed with which vice presidential candidates are selected 
can still create serious problems according to a report prepared 
by a task force that included former top aides to presidents 
kennedy johnson nixon ford and carter 
the report commissioned by the 20th century fund a nonprofit 
research organization said the position of vice president long 
the butt of jokes is critical because it is so close to the oval 
office 
to ensure the best person gets the nod presidential candidates 
could use a mix of tools questionnaires interviews polls and 
informal inquiries in the end however politics plays a big role 
in the selection 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis and vice president george 
bush respectively the expected 1988 democratic and republican 
presidential nominees have not revealed their choice of running 
mate but the issue is attracting widespread attention 
james cannon a former aide to ford recalled that sen bob 
dole rkan was a compromise vice presidential candidate in 1976 
although ford maintains dole was an asset others viewed dole as 
not a good candidate ford lost the election to jimmy carter 
all too often you end up making the decision at 2 am 
cannon said 
hugh heclo a professor at george mason university in fairfax 
va criticized the selection process 
he said vice presidential candidates william miller in 1964 
thomas eagleton in 1972 spiro agnew in 1968 and geraldine ferraro 
in 1984 were not shining successes of finding what the founding 
fathers used to call the continental character 
agnew the only one of those candidates elected was forced out 
of office in a corruption scandal 
on balance the experts said the vice presidency is a healthy if 
imperfect institution in which the incumbent can play a role 
advising the president on a range of issues and representing the 
united states abroad 
but helco and two other panel members arthur m schlesinger 
jr kennedys former aide and henry f reuss former chairman of 
the joint economic committee suggested the vice presidency does 
more harm than good and should be abolished 
all you are trying to do is create some standby equipment 
said heclo who argued that a special election could be held to 
choose a successor to a disabled president 
reuss criticized the imperial nature of the vice presidency 
which comes with a mansion a seal and its own aircraft air force 
two the vice president also has a large staff 
the modern vice presidency that has developed with little 
forethought over the past 30 years is proving a more disruptive 
than constructive feature of our political system the dissenters 
said

an assailant shot and wounded 
an israeli soldier here thursday and troops rounded up dozens of 
arabs for questioning one witness said suspects were forced to 
stand on one foot under the hot sun 
the army clamped a curfew on nablus the west banks largest 
city it was the second shooting of an israeli soldier since the 
arab uprising against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip began dec 8 
in a crackdown on the recent wave of firebomb attacks on israeli 
targets troops demolished seven houses of arab suspects and sealed 
five other homes in the west bank soldiers have been ordered to 
shoot at firebomb throwers with the intent to injure and to 
demolish the homes of suspects 
elsewhere in the west bank dozens of jewish settlers some 
wearing prayer shawls blocked a major highway for two hours to 
demand harsh army action against palestinian firebombers 
the army said the reserve soldier was traveling in his own car 
when he was hit by a bullet a spokesman declined to say if the 
soldier was in uniform 
the wounded soldier was taken by helicopter to a tel aviv 
hospital and the shooting was being investigated the spokesman 
said he said the soldier was slightly injured but refused to 
elaborate or identify him 
the other israeli soldier shot during the uprising sgt moshe 
katz 28 died of a head wound received in the west bank town of 
bethlehem on march 20 
troops conducted a search for suspects and the weapon sealing 
off nablus and prohibiting all drivers except jewish settlers who 
live nearby from entering or leaving the city nablus is 40 miles 
north of jerusalem 
four hours after the shooting about 60 cars were lined up 
outside nablus and an equal number were lined up inside the city 
waiting to pass a roadblock manned by three jeeploads of troops 
a united nations vehicle a car belonging to the red cross and 
an arab ambulance were turned back 
arab witnesses said troops rounded up dozens of palestinians 
confiscated their identity cards and fired shots in the air 
it seems the army is very angry because this is the first time 
ive seen them this strict they are shooting in the air like 
crazy said nablus businessman said kenaan 
abu islam deedi an arab reporter who lives in nablus said 
troops detained about 50 suspects and lined them up against walls 
during questioning under the hot summer sun the arabs were made 
to stand on one leg with their arms outstretched said deedi who 
said he watched the roundup from a window in his home 
deedi said troops also wired off streets where the shooting 
occurred and erected about 10 roadblocks in the city center where 
they stopped and searched palestinian cars he said several 
busloads of troops patrolled the streets 
according to army figures 346 soldiers have been injured since 
the uprising began most of them by stones the united nations puts 
the palestinian death toll at 208 two israelis also have been 
killed 
underground leaders of the uprising ordered palestinians to 
observe thursday as a day for stockpiling food first aid supplies 
and gasoline to prolong their resistance to israels 21year 
occupation 
arabs from a bus stalled at the roadblock descended and began 
throwing rocks at the settlers who responded by hurling them back 
israel radio and a jewish settler said the army fired in the air 
to disperse the stonethrowers then dismantled the roadblock 
about 60 jewish settlers from the west bank settlement of efrat 
meanwhile used their cars to block the major jerusalemhebron 
highway used by thousands of arab workers to get to their jobs in 
israel 
the settlers said in a statement the action was to protest an 
increase in palestinian firebomb attacks the army responded to the 
stepped up attacks by orders this week to shoot firebombers 
also thursday a 17yearold palestinian prostitute was charged 
in a jerusalem district court with the shooting death of a jewish 
seminary student earlier this month the charge sheet alleges 
nationalistic motives

the son of former vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro was sentenced thursday to four months 
in jail for selling 25 worth of cocaine to an undercover police 
officer 
john zaccaro jr 24 also was ordered to pay a 1500 fine and 
perform 300 hours of community service 
we are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the 
sentence ferraro said noting that other defendants in vermont 
drug cases have received lighter penalties she said the conviction 
would be appealled 
during his sentencing hearing zaccaro told vermont district 
judge francis mccaffrey in a shaky voice that he has sworn off 
drugs 
id like to make a personal pledge to you and my family that i 
will never again be involved in drugs or any illegality he said 
zaccaros attorney charles tetzlaff asked mccaffrey to accept 
a probation officers recommendation of a suspended sentence 
probation and community service 
but mccaffrey told zaccaro i cant in good conscience 
sentence you without any time to serve zaccaro faced a maximum 
of five years in prison and a 10000 fine 
addison county states attorney john quinn said he was pleased 
with the sentence he denied treating the case differently 
this was a case in which we caught someone redhanded and i 
mean redhanded quinn said i felt that it was important for 
the court to say it doesnt matter who you are if you commit a 
drug offense in the state of vermont youll be treated with great 
severity 
mccaffrey suggested the jail time be served through the 
chittenden community correctional center in burlington so that 
zaccaro could participate in a special corrections program that 
allows him to be kept under house arrest 
quinn said zaccaro would have to be accepted into the program 
during the sentencing zaccaro stood stoically beside his 
father john zaccaro and his mother who was walter mondales 
running mate on the democratic ticket in 1984 
zaccaro was arrested in february 1986 and convicted by a 
district court jury last april he was arrested after selling 
onequarter gram of cocaine to undercover agent laura manning while 
he was attending middlebury college about 30 miles north of 
rutland 
manning testified that she went to zaccaros offcampus home 
where zaccaro produced a tray of cocaine packets from underneath 
the living room sofa zaccaro was arrested that night outside the 
restaurant where he worked 
tetzlaff argued that police used manning as bait to snare him 
during a college party weekend the prosecution denied the charge 
at the sentencing hearing a tearful ferraro had asked mccaffrey 
not to treat her son differently than any other person convicted of 
selling 25 worth of cocaine she also said zaccaros arrest and 
conviction have taken a heavy toll on her family and son 
he doesnt go to church with us she said he doesnt want 
to be seen with us its not because hes ashamed of us its 
because hes ashamed of what hes done 
also testifying at the sentencing hearing was the rev bruce 
ritter the founder of a new york city shelter for runaways called 
covenant house where zaccaro works as a volunteer 
ritter said zaccaro has learned his lesson 
you cant try and reach these kids without coming into a 
far better and deeper understanding of your own value system he 
said probably the most important things we learn are from our 
mistakes john has learned them 
mccaffrey also received 30 letters written on behalf of zaccaro 
including one from his mother and one from mondale 
i saw him as a very fine young man who quickly became good 
friends with our children and who campaigned in a spirited and 
strong way around our nation mondale wrote

a coalition of consumer groups on thursday 
gave a producer of frozen yogurt the manufacturer of audi 
automobiles and eight other advertisers backhanded awards for 
presenting the most misleading commercials 
the fourth annual harlan page hubbard memorial awards named for 
a 19th century advertising pioneer who promoted patent medicines as 
cures for virtually all ills were announced at a ceremony that 
drew none of the winners 
one prize went to dannon frozen yogurt on a stick for an ad 
showing a 6yearold girl in a swimming suit critics charged that 
the image imposed a sexual message on little girls 
we never imagined that consumers would take that message 
away said dannon spokeswoman barbara beck who said the ad is no 
longer running it has been replaced by commercials stressing that 
the product is of interest to the whole family she said 
ms beck said the frozen yogurt ads ran for only a few weeks 
before being withdrawn they were reevaluated after consumers 
wrote in she said 
the dannon commercials were chosen for a hubbard by the national 
womens health network which said the ads encouraged the idea that 
females are mainly concerned with being attractive and sexually 
available 
the awards consist of a statuette with a lemon on top with the 
consumer group that nominated the ad actually collecting the trophy 
joe bennett of audi of america however said hes have been 
glad to send someone to get the award if he had been informed in 
advance 
when you get an award like this you just have to laugh 
said bennett it tells us our advertising is right on target 
and we will continue to pursue it with great vigor 
audi was selected for the hubbard because of ads touting the 
safety of its cars 
these were misleading according to the center for auto safety 
because they were run at a time audi was being investigated for 
problems with the sudden acceleration of its vehicles 
an ohio court jury recently ruled that audi was not at fault in 
at least one case of sudden acceleration 
continental airlines was cited for ads boasting that it supplies 
maintenance services to other airlines the aviation consumer 
action project said this was misleading because other carriers do 
maintenance for continental as well 
continental spokesman bruce hicks respoded that the ad doesnt 
make any claims that are not well founded 
the coalition on smoking or health cited the tobacco industry 
for ads that it said mislead consumers by suggesting that lowtar 
and lownicotine cigarettes may reduce health risks 
walker merryman of the tobacco institute replied that the 
consumer advocates overlooked the surgeon generals warnings 
printed on every cigarette ad 
those warnings make several billion impressions annually and 
along with other antismoking information programs have certainly 
given consumers adequate information i cant think of a single 
issue that people are more well informaed about than smoking and 
health said merryman 
the beef industry council was mentioned for its real food for 
real people ads promoting the consumption of red meat which some 
nutritionists contend can raise cholesterol levels 
the leading health organizations have issued dietary 
guidelines that include red meat as one of the essential 
ingredients responded spokesman craig mitchell he charged that 
the center for science in the public interest had distorted those 
findings in order to get more publicity 
contour chair of philadelphia was picked for a hubbard by the 
american association of retired persons it contended that ads for 
the special recliner chairs do not detail health claims and it is 
hard for consumers to learn prices 
the prices are not printed because they vary since the chairs 
are custom made said company sales representative robert olin and 
as for health claims he said all the statements that we made 
are verifiable 
ed aduss of the us council for energy awareness said his 
organization would have no response to its selection although he 
did observe that it has been included in the list for several years 
the council runs ads promoting nuclear energy and stressing that 
it is a viable alternative to dependence on oil and other sources 
hasbro co was cited for ads showing children playing with the 
gi joe cobra momba toy helicopter the toy is fragile hard to 
handle and disappointing to children the consumer affairs 
committee of americans for democratic action contended 
we respectfully disagree with their opinion said hasbro 
spokesman wayne charness 
other advertising chosen for the awards included 
western union for its ads showing people with car trouble or 
other problems saved by having someone send them money in reality 
the national consumers league asserted the money wont come to 
you you have to go to a western union office or pay a delivery 
charge even then the payment is usually a check not cash it 
added 
western union spokesman warren bechtel retorted that weve 
never suggested in ads that someone is going to deliver money to 
your house or office of something the service is provided 
through 11000 outlets nationally and almost always paid in cash 
he said 
cutty sark scotch whisky for a television ad which the center 
for science in the public interest said should not have been run 
because of a policy by the television networks and the spirits 
industry not to advertise on tv the spanishlanguage ad ran on a 
local tv station the group said 
we just dismiss this action as being typical of that group 
who have a history of trying to discredit the wine and spirits 
industry responded barbara jo howard of buckingham wile co in 
new york which markets cutty sark in the united states

call them big call them hefty hey call em 
huge but dont say the fat boys those highcalorie rappers 
drink miller lite beer 
the three beefy bandmates charged in a federal lawsuit this week 
that the miller brewing co intimated just that in one of its lite 
commercials the one where an immense joe rapping fats piscopo 
raps that the lessfilling brew tastes great 
the suit says piscopos obese appearance and rapping have left a 
bad taste in the fat boys mouths one that the comic the beer 
company and its ad agency should pay 5 million to remove 
in their efforts to promote the sale of alcohol miller 
intentionally selected and exploited the likenesses and performing 
musical styles of the fat boys the suit filed monday charged 
the portly plaintiffs are mark morales better known as prince 
markie dee damon wimbley aka kool rock ski and darren 
robinson the human beat box along with the groups record 
company and music publisher theyre asking for 5 million in 
damages and withdrawal of the commercial 
they allege the ad which features piscopo rolling around on a 
huge bogus belly while rapping with three heavyweight partners 
takes advantage of their platinumselling record success and 
infringes on the fat boys trademark 
thats right the fat boys received registration no 1351054 
from the us patent and trademark office for their name on july 
23 1985 
the weight of the members their actual physical size 
combined with other elements of music costume and performance 
style constitutes an identifiable and unique characteristic of the 
group the lawsuit said 
it also alleges the commercials music particularly the vocal 
percussion of one rotund performer behind piscopo contains a 
melody copied from and derived from the fat boys music 
a spokesman for the comedian glen schwartz had no immediate 
comment on the suit the ad agency backer amp spielvogel inc of 
manhattan declined comment a miller spokesman was not in the 
companys wisconsin headquarters to react to the suit

a drought parching much of the country dropped water levels in 
the mississippi and ohio rivers making the waterways unnavigable 
thursday and meaning majorleague losses for the inland 
shipping industry 
a sevenmile stretch of the ohio river near mound city ill 
remained closed to all traffic while a dredge deepened a shallow 
channel dozens of towboats and barges were stranded 
meanwhile nearly 700 barges in the mississippi river were tied 
up north and south of the greenville miss bridge because the 
river had dropped to the lowest levels since authorities began 
keeping records in 1872 
everybody is concerned said chris brinkop of the ohio river 
ice committee the group comprises industry us coast guard and 
army corps of engineers officials who monitor river conditions 
weve experienced tough river conditions and closures before 
but nothing this bad said brinkop he said the industry is 
losing majorleague dollars because of the traffic stoppage 
towboat crews stranded on the mississippi and ohio rivers spent 
their time painting watching television doing light maintenance 
and even fishing while each towboat owner loses about 10000 daily 
chuck shumann of the army corps of engineers in louisville ky 
said a 300foot stretch of the ohio river north of cairo had water 
levels of about eight feet the lowest mark there since january 
1969 
for safe passage he said barges need at least 811 feet of 
water 
the coast guard in paducah ky closed the river it was to 
reopen thursday night but underground cables and debris forced a 
delay until friday afternoon 
in the past two weeks more than a dozen barges have gone 
aground near the mound city area said guard spokesman jack buri 
the dredge elco was summoned to dig a 2100foot channel 11 feet 
deep by 250 feet wide he said 
low water in the mississippi has created bottlenecks in places 
like vaucluse landing ark about three miles north of the 
greenville miss bridge 
an army corps of engineers patrol boat has been escorting barges 
with light loads onebyone and prospects for ending the 
bottleneck north of greenville brightened thursday 
spokesman michael logue in vicksburg miss said the corps 
marked a previously unknown secondary channel at greenville he 
said it appeared smaller towboats would be able to use it 
since we found the secondary channel it looks like the small 
tows will be able to go ahead and pass logue said the larger 
tows will have to wait 
authorities said it would take at least a day and possibly two 
to dredge a channel 16feet to 20feet deep that could handle 
larger barges 
on board the stranded towboats crews made the best of it 
theres plenty of work theres always something to do said 
steve southern of paducah ky a first mate on the john m 
donnelly on the mississippi some people are even trying to 
fish 
idle barges also worried shippers like james crafton executive 
vice president of home oil co of henderson ky he depends on 
barges to deliver his petroleum products 
our last shipment was delayed about a day he said the 
river conditions concern me like everyone else im hoping for 
some rainfall

approve full funding of science space and technology programs

in a letter to key lawmakers reagan said the bipartisan budget 
agreement reached by the administration and congress in november 
was designed to put the federal government firmly on the path 
toward elimination of the budget deficit 
achievement of that critically important objective requires 
those in office to make difficult choices among competing 
priorities he said 
we have considered the full range of federal programs and 
their competing demands on scarce taxpayers dollars and have 
concluded that full funding of science space and technology 
programs must remain a top priority 
i urge the congress to provide full funding and support for 
these programsthe president said 
reagans letter was addressed to sens william proxmire dwis 
and jake garn rutah and reps edward p boland dmass and

borough of brooklyn convicted last year of giving an illegal 
gratuity to us rep mario biaggi was indicted thursday on tax 
fraud conspiracy and other charges 
meade esposito 81 harry dickran president of beaumont offset 
corp of farmingdale and phyllis zito espositos daughter and 
secretarytreasurer of the company were charged in the indictment 
esposito was described as a silent partner in the company 
according to the indictment the defendants paid more than 
200000 in bribes and kickbacks to insure that beaumont received 
profitable printing contracts 
the defendants laundered more than 250000 in cash through a 
phony invoice scam to attain cash for the bribes and personal use 
us attorney andrew maloney said at a news conference 
the charges cover seven years from 1971 through february 
they are an offshoot of the investigation that led to espositos 
conviction last september for giving an illegal gratuity to biaggi 
and interstate travel charges 
while i am sympathetic to his age and frailties there is no 
way to leave him out of these charges while he is still in this 
life maloney said 
assistant us attorney david hattem said esposito attended 
meetings where money laundering was discussed mediated disputes 
and divided up the booty 
in the previous case esposito a powerful party boss from 1969 
until his retirement in 1984 was found guilty of paying for two 
vacations taken by biaggi a 10term democratic congressman from 
the bronx and biaggis girlfriend 
in return biaggi used his influence to lobby city and federal 
officials on behalf of financially ailing coastal dry dock and 
repair inc the secondlargest client of espositos insurance 
company serres visone amp rice 
wiretaps played in open court showed the trips were actually 
paid by beaumont 
biaggi 69 was convicted of illegally accepting gratuities but 
was cleared of more serious bribery and conspiracy charges 
judge jack b weinstein sentenced esposito to a suspended 
twoyear prison term and fined him 500000 citing espositos 
frail health 
he and biaggi who is currently on trial in federal court in 
manhattan in the wedtech corp racketeering and bribery case are 
appealing the convictions 
in the beaumont case each defendant is charged with six counts 
of violating interstate travel laws to commit bribery five counts 
of making false statements on beaumonts tax returns and one count 
of conspiracy to make false statements on tax returns 
dickran and mrs zito were additionally charged with three 
counts of making false statements on their personal income tax 
returns 
if convicted the defendants face up to five years in prison on 
the interstate travel and conspiracy charges and three years on the 
tax charges

the us government employed convicted nazi 
war criminal robert jan verbelen as an intelligence agent for 10 
years after world war ii to help fight communism in austria the 
justice department acknowledged thursday 
a report released by attorney general edwin meese iii said 
verbelen worked with the us armys counterintelligence corps or 
cic and that officials accepted two different versions he gave of 
his background 
the 92page report said verbelen now 77 and living in austria 
manipulated the cic into protecting him from being brought to 
justice for his crimes 
verbelen was convicted in absentia and sentenced to death in his 
native belgium in 1947 for being primarily responsible for killing 
101 people in an operation in which belgians identified with the 
resistance were arbitrarily selected to be arrested beaten 
tortured imprisoned deported or murdered 
an austrian jury in 1965 found him guilty of two wartime murders 
but acquitted him on the basis that he was following order the 
decision was overturned by the austrian supreme court but the case 
has not been retried verbelen also was accused of torturing us 
airmen 
neal sher director of the justice departments office of 
special investigations which conducted a twoyear study at the 
request of the antidefamation league of bnai brith said 
verbelen accomplished his deception because of the cics practice 
of utilizing nazi criminals and their collaborators in its postwar 
cold war european intelligence operations 
verbelen served with the cic from 1946 until december 1956 and 
later worked for the austrian state police he became an austrian 
citizen in 1959 
sher said at a news conference that the report has been given to 
the belgian and austrian governments 
the report said the army intelligence group discovered 
verbelens true identity when the cia asked information about him 
sher declined to say how long the cia had known who he was or to 
give any other information about the agencys involvement with 
verbelen 
sher said there were obvious dangers in using nazi war criminals 
because they might be blackmailed in verbelens case the cia 
didnt even know who they had hired he said 
sher said the investigation was not related to any modern 
intelligencegathering efforts and was not meant to be judgmental 
but he said some conclusions cry out 
the report said the cic followed a policy that the end 
justifies the means 
the report described 13 other past us agents and informants 
with nazi connections but did not name them sher said the army in 
cooperating with the investigation had demanded that they not be 
identified 
he said justice department investigators interviewed verbelen 
himself in the summer of 1985 and found him unrepentent he 
thinks he has nothing to be ashamed of sher said 
edward dennis head of the justice departments criminal 
division said the investigation was done as thoroughly as 
possible regardless of who that will embarrass or make 
uncomfortable 
the report said no us government agency made any effort to 
apprise belgian authorities of verbelens whereabouts when his true 
identity was uncovered 
it said that even when the us agency dismissed verbelen after 
it discovered his nazi war record in 1956 it did so without 
prejudice and classified him as suitable for intelligence 
reemployment 
the report said the cic apparently relied entirely on the 
information verbelen gave about himself including the name he 
gave peter mayer in 1950 he informed the agency his name was 
really herbert schwab describing himself as a devoted nazi party 
member since the mid1930s and a member of a nazi security unit 
that was declared a criminal organization after the war the report 
said 
despite this change in identity and life history the cic 
made no attempt to verify the information verbelen supplied about 
himself and it continued to employ him the report said

democrat jesse jackson made a pitch to a 
roomful of senators thursday to be fair in delegate selection 
but afterward his total remained at one senator supporting him for 
president 
sen ernest hollings from jacksons home state of south 
carolina said that as a super delegate he will vote for 
jackson at the democratic convention this summer because jackson 
won his state jackson deserves his vote he said even thouigh 
michael dukakis is the obvious winner of the presidential 
contest 
hollings who made an unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 
1984 said jacksons campaign this year is far different from four 
years ago 
this time hes run a winning campaign he hasnt frightened 
anyone hes charmed them in all of those different debates and in 
his own right has leveled off and really youre looking at jesse 
jackson not as a black but really for his own philosophy with 
respect to hunger and nutrition and jobs and drugs and everything 
else hollings said 
although dukakis is certain to get the nomination said 
hollings for the good of the party we also ought to be 
supporting rev jackson 
none of the others among 33 democrats who met at jacksons 
request in the capitol jumped to join hollings in backing jackson 
although they listened with interest to the candidates appeal for 
support said jackson press secretary delmarie cobb 
jackson made a case according to those present that he should 
get the convention votes of super delegates in whose states and 
districts he won the popular vote super delegates are democrats 
who will have votes at the convention by virtue of their elected or 
party leadership positions 
later jackson told reporters that the democratic leadership 
while accepting my investment in the party to make it strong has 
not been as reciprocal as it ought to be 
the people have spoken and now leadership should catch up with 
the people he said 
if in fact i have injected nothing in the party i should 
expect no return if i invest i should reasonably expect return 
he told reporters so i appreciate the accolades that i am the 
voter registration champion for the party that i have led the 
drive to return the senate back to the democrats that i have won 
states that no one said i could win 
however he added if i have done all of that i simply say 
lets be fair 
he was praised earlier thursday by members of the senate labor 
and human resources committee before whom he testified on drug 
abuse prevention and treatment 
jackson who has made the drug issue a centerpiece of his 
presidential campaign told the committee that us military forces 
should not be used as the primary interdiction force but rather 
should be used for backing up other agencies and providing 
intelligence 
we must be careful however to avoid involving the military 
in any police actions agianst citizens or arrests he said we 
should not lead with our military forces in drugs or any other 
aspect of foreign policy 
committee chairman edward kennedy dmass and the other 
senators thanked jackson for his years as an outspoken leader 
against drugs and for his work with young people 
later kennedy joined jackson at a rally outside the capitol 
denouncing south africa as a terrorist state jackson urged support 
for antiapartheid legislation

texas farmers burned the thorns off cactus to provide emergency 
cattle feed in a drought called the worst in a halfcentury while 
growers in the midwest bemoaned thursdays scattered showers as 
little more than tantalizing 
its going to help a few farmers but for most farmers its 
too little too late said dan bowman a meteorologist for 
weatherdata in wichita after some kansas communities got more than 
2 inches of rain and joplin mo got 1 inches thursday morning 
drought has plagued the nations midsection where its as dry 
as its been since the dust bowl and the southeast forcing 
farmers to sell off cattle they cant afford to feed and to plow 
under shriveled crops the june shortfall of rainfollows a dry 
winter and a parched spring 
thursdays showers said herb kinnear of the indiana farm 
bureau were just enough to settle the dust but its keeping the 
sun from shining and baking things thats one consolation 
another consolation was an additional 10 million in emergency 
state loans for up to 45000 hoosier farmers 
elsewhere barges along the mississippi were stranded at 
lowwater bottlenecks fires were on the rise in missouri and 
georgia and ginseng growers in wisconsin were discovering that 
even they were suffering although the exotic root thrives on arid 
soil 
in washington president reagan appointed an interagency 
committee to deal with the widespread drought 
texas ranchers in the lower rio grande valley are using propane 
burners to remove thorns from prickly pear cactus to allow cattle 
to graze on the waterretaining plants said kraig gallimore of the 
texas department of agricultures farmer assistance program 
however the drought has struck so deep in some areas that 
ranchers have stopped the practice because even cactus is 
shriveling he said 
in north dakota which the us agriculture department said was 
hit hardest an agricultural economist predicted losses from three 
major crops could total 27 billion this year 
the estimate accounts for losses in federal deficiency payments 
and turnover of the money in the economy but not for the losses 
well likely have on crops other than wheat barley and oats 
said arlen leholm an economist with north dakota state university 
bill lytle a south dakota climatologist said the state 
normally gets 34 inches of rain in june and this year has only 
received 03 inches so far for the month 
its worse than 76 i think it goes back to 34 said 
lytle who blamed the drought on a large highpressure ridge that 
is diverting lowpressure storm systems north into canada because 
the system covers most of the nations midsection its likely to 
persist for some time he said 
firmin rettinghauf 72 whose three sons farm his land near 
gilbertville in northeast iowa walked through his parched fields 
and proclaimed there aint gonna be no crops its the worst 
ive seen since 36 
in southwest iowa cattle farmers continued selling off herds as 
pastures baked in the sun and feed prices skyrocketed 
the man in the cow business is having to sell his factory is 
what it amounts to said gary schwab whose lamoni livestock 
sales barn is reporting cattle sales 50 percent higher than a year 
ago id rather take a beating than talk to a man about selling 
his herd 
two convenience store owners in walford iowa decided that if 
farmers were going to take a loss they would too 
the owners said their sign advertising ice cream cones 25 
cents until it rains will stay up until the area gets a 
drenching cones normally sell for 40 cents 
dropping water levels in the mississippi and ohio rivers made 
the waterways unnavigable thursday hurting the inland shipping 
industry 
a sevenmile stretch of the ohio river near mound city ill 
remained closed to all traffic while a dredge deepened a shallow 
channel dozens of towboats and barges were stranded 
meanwhile nearly 700 barges in the mississippi river were tied 
up north and south of the greenville miss bridge because the 
river had dropped to the lowest levels since authorities began 
keeping records in 1872 
georgia and missouri reported an increase in forest fires due to 
abnormally dry conditions 
hundreds of fires have broken out in the parched ozark hills in 
recent months and missouri officials say it is the worst fire year 
since the 1940s for the mark twain national forest 
the forest has seen 260 fires blacken 13600 acres so far this 
year said bob willis of the us forest service office in rolla 
in an average year 5000 to 6000 acres are burned he said 
more than 3200 acres of georgia forest land have been damaged 
so far in june exceeding a fiveyear average for the entire month 
said bob burns a member of the fire control staff at forestry 
commission headquarters in macon 
wisconsin ginseng growers normally plagued by excess moisture 
said even they were thinking about irrigation 
its good news to be dry but its no good to be a desert 
said lyn heise 51 who grows about 10 acres of the medicinal root 
near wausau we like it much drier than the regular farmers who 
grow corn or soybeans but even for us its going too long

southern baptists charged modern 
society with an erosion of moral sanity thursday and condemned 
homosexuality as an abomination in the eyes of god 
this deviant behavior has wrought havoc in the lives of 
millions said assembled messengers of the 147 
millionmember denomination 
on the last day of the convention it adopted one of the most 
unqualified denunciations of homosexuality in recent major church 
annals 
the bible is very clear in its teaching that homosexuality is 
a manifestation of a depraved nature the convention said adding 
homosexuality is a perversion of divine standards and a 
violation of nature and of natural affections 
the resolution said homosexuals are justified and even 
glorified in our secular media 
with fundamentalists prevailing over moderates in this 
factionally divided gathering of 35600 people the meeting also 
whipped through a score of other resolutions among them the 
convention 
voiced outrage over the firing of a competent highly 
professional christian dennis shere as publisher of the dayton 
ohio daily news by cox newspapers for refusing to carry gay and 
lesbian advertising 
rejected an amendment that would have pledged the 
denominations institutions not to fire or replace anyone for 
disagreeing with its policies such as those recently demanding 
biblical literalism 
condemned provision of birth control information and devices 
at public school clinics saying it undermined parental authority 
fomented promiscuity and abdicated moral responsibility of schools 
declared family and biblical values under constant attack 
from materialism secular humanism substance abuse and rebellion 
against authority 
questioned aspects of the civil rights restoration act saying 
it should be modified to protect religious liberty assuring 
exemption of institutions indirectly controlled by religion as 
well as those directly religious 
brad corrigan a dallas layman urged the resolution criticizing 
the cox newspaper publishers firing and for consistency also 
pushed for adoption of a policy allowing dissent by the 
denominations employees 
instead he said he had been outvoted outhustled and 
outfoxed by fundamentalists and likened to a polecat with 
other moderates at a convention which declared laymen couldnt 
disagree with elected leaders 
i for one do not believe it he said 
in the resolution on homosexuality gay people were termed the 
primary cause for the spread of aids saying it not only has 
affected them but also innocent victims 
homosexuals like all sinners can receive forgiveness and 
victory through personal faith in jesus christ the resolution 
said adding 
while god loves the homosexual and offers salvation 
homosexuality is not a normal life style and is an abomination in 
the eyes of god

the communist party chief in strongly 
nationalistic estonia was relieved of his job thursday and replaced 
by the current soviet ambassador to nicaragua vajno i vaelaes 
the tass news agency said 
it was not clear from the brief tass dispatch whether karl g 
vaynos departure came because of a fall from political favor 
vaynos leaving marked the third change in republiclevel party 
leaders in less than a month on may 21 the party chiefs in 
armenia and azerbaijan were replaced as the simmering territorial 
dispute over the nagornokarabakh region continued 
vayno 65 had been party boss in the soviet republic on the 
baltic sea since july 1978 tass said his departure was approved at 
a meeting thursday of the estonian partys central committee 
under vaynos guidance estonia became a testing ground for many 
of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs economic reform policies 
however vaynos leadership came under strong criticism at an 
april meeting of estonian writers filmmakers and other cultural 
workers who complained of ecological problems corruption and the 
functionings of estonias government 
estonian nationalism has been strong since the formerly 
independent baltic land was forcibly incorporated into the soviet 
union in 1940 this nationalism continued during vaynos tenure in 
the switzerlandsized jurisdiction 
tass said vanjo was relieved in connection with a transfer 
under the jurisdiction of the moscowbased central committee the 
partys policymaking body the committee could assign him to a job 
in moscow or elsewhere in the soviet union 
his replacement vaelaes 57 served earlier as a secretary of 
the estonian party 
in a separate biographical note tass indicated the choice of 
vaelaes was not unanimous saying he received the majority of the 
votes from estonias central committee such decisions are 
usually unanimous 
vaelaes began his political career in tartu estonia where he 
was elected head of the citys komsomol young communist league 
after graduating from tartu university tass said 
he went on to lead the party organization in tallinn estonias 
capital for 10 years and then was elected a party secretary for 
the republicwide party apparatus 
he joined the diplomatic corps in 1980 and served as soviet 
ambassador to venezuela trinidad and tobago and nicaragua

laws protecting confidentiality for aids patients 
are less effective than those aimed at preventing discrimination in 
areas such as jobs and housing a law professor writes in a leading 
medical publication 
when it comes to aids infection legal protection of medical 
confidence is often an illusion said professor bernard m dickens 
of the university of toronto in ontario 
while some laws appear to require and provide secrecy of 
medical data others compel disclosures he wrote in fridays 
journal of the american medical association 
he cited examples in nonaids cases in which courts have ruled 
that public policies favoring confidentiality must yield when it is 
necessary to prevent danger to others 
the protection privilege ends where the public peril begins 
he said quoting a california supreme court decision concerning the 
appropriateness of warning a person believed to be in danger of 
attack from a mental health patient 
in general high legal principles exist to justify the breaking 
of some medical confidences regardless of laws to preserve those 
confidences dickens wrote 
an example he said would be a spouses right to know if her 
mate is infected with the aids virus because the information 
pertains to a risk to her life he wrote 
if potential victims cant be identified disclosing the names 
of people with aidsrelated conditions to health authorities might 
be legally justifiable even if it isnt specifically required by 
law according to the article 
currently all 50 states require that diagnoses of aids be 
reported to health authorities he said some states require the 
names of people diagnosed with the disease be reported a number of 
states mandate reporting of every laboratory test that indicates 
infection is present dickens said 
aids a fatal and incurable viral illness is believed to be 
passed mainly through sexual intercourse shared hypodermic needles 
and from infected mothers to their infants before or during birth 
the disease has struck more than 64000 people in this country 
since 1979 and killed more than 36000 of them according to the 
national centers for disease control 
laboratory tests for aids infection do not indicate whether a 
person has the disease but only if the virus that causes it has 
entered his system it can be years between infection and the 
appearance of symptoms 
dickens said that rather than beefing up laws protecting 
confidentiality it makes more sense to reinforce laws prohibiting 
discrimination against people with aids with related conditions or 
people suspected of being infected 
he praised a proposal in congress aimed mainly at curbing 
discrimination in areas such as housing employment education 
insurance and access to medical care 
the measure an amendment to the federal public health service 
act does not omit guidelines to protect confidentiality but 
couples them with antidiscrimination provisions he wrote 
leonard graff legal director for national gay rights advocates 
in san francisco agreed 
our position has been is that it is important to have 
confidentiality and antidiscrimination laws working in tandem to 
protect individuals he said by telephone thursday and we know 
that this works

firstdegree murder trials are on hold 
until the florida supreme court can decide if the duval county 
grand jury is legal 
defense attorneys claim the jury has too many members making it 
easier for prosecutors to win an indictment 
the high court granted a stay in a murder trial scheduled to 
begin next week causing the postponement of all trials in which 
the defendants were indicted 
chief assistant state attorney john delaney said wednesday the 
ruling means none of the 17 firstdegree murder cases in duval 
county will be able to go to trial 
but delaney said the current grand jury will keep indicting 
people for firstdegree murder which carries a penalty of life in 
prison or death in the electric chair 
the high court ruling came tuesday in the case of john d 
freeman a jacksonville man already convicted and sentenced to 
death in one slaying and to go on trial monday on a second 
firstdegree murder charge 
his attorneys assistant public defenders jim miller and patrick 
mcguinness argued the case should be postponed until the grand 
jury issue is resolved 
they claim florida laws require a maximum of 18 grand jurors be 
impaneled at one time duval countys grand jury has 23 members 
they claim because it only takes 12 members to vote for an 
indictment it is easier to get 12 of 23 jurors than 12 of 18 
prosecutors however claim the legislature gives larger 
counties the right to impanel up to 23 jurors and their position 
was upheld by chief circuit judge john santora jr 
the public defenders appealed to the state supreme court 
delaney said it could be three months before the justices rule 
if the high court rules that duval county was incorrect delaney 
said a new grand jury can be impaneled and the defendants 
reindicted 
the only possibility of serious problems he said would be if 
the high court voided past convictions the county has been using 
23 grand jurors since 1970

a senior house democrat on thursday proposed a 
new congressional salary system that would prohibit lawmakers from 
keeping honoraria earned from making speeches and writing articles 
under the legislation members would select their own salaries 
in a range from the current level of 89500 up to as much as 
135000 the amount recommended by a presidential pay commission 
the proposal by rep dan rostenkowski of illinois chairman of 
the house ways and means committee came two days after the house 
voted to reject a 4 percent costofliving increase for next year 
in being shy about declaring our worth in an honest way all 
we do is demean our office and reinforce the public misimpression 
about public service rostenkowski said in a statement 
he said that while he defends the current system which lets 
house members accept up to 2000 per speech up to an annual limit 
of 30 percent of their congressional salaries we are well 
advised to guard against even the appearance of a conflict of 
interest 
rostenkowski is consistently one of the top honorariaearners in 
congress 
his proposal would permit lawmakers to choose a salary up to the 
last amount recommended by the presidential commission 
those members with more responsibility or longer tenure would 
be free to make a statement of their worth to their constituents 
openly and honestly by signing in at the high end of the scale 
he said 
the current limit of 3000 in businessrelated living expense 
tax deductions also would be lifted under rostenkowskis proposal 
allowing members of congress to deduct as much as they could 
justify to the internal revenue service

some little leaguers who just wanted 
to play ball are quitting after watching their parents brawl and 
their coaches threaten to sue each other 
a smoldering dispute flared into a 20minute brawl last week 
after a championship game and police were called to break it up 
its just a bunch of mad parents acting like fools said 
ginger metcalf who has three sons on one of the teams 
lucille king called the situation unbelievable and said her 
12yearold son marty has decided to quit the league 
it got to a point where he couldnt even play anymore because 
the parents were fighting mrs king said they were fighting 
with the coaches the board members were fighting every game we 
had theyd always come up with a different rule 
no matter which side the parents take in the controversy they 
agree the infighting is hurting the kids and tarnishing the 
leagues reputation 
fighting erupted thursday when the as beat the mets by a run to 
claim the championship 
as coach reed mcmillan said mets coach steve isaacs attacked 
his son after the game grabbing him by the neck and shaking him 
mcmillan said he got so angry he tackled isaacs and other 
parents jumped in 
isaacs indicated he was only trying to head off a fight between 
the kids he said his son jason and mcmillans son dwane were 
arguing so he grabbed dwane by the shirt then mcmillan pounced on 
him from behind he said 
both coaches retained lawyers and are considering suits 
mcmillan and some other parents claim the league is not being 
run by little league rules and was dominated by president karl 
cummings who made his own rules and changed them frequently 
but isaacs says the problem is mcmillan 
cummings and parents supporting isaacs maintain the problems 
began when mcmillan started coaching this year 
things were more touchy things were more on edge said 
cummings he called mcmillan a very competitive type person i 
believed we lost the joy toward the children and i believe a lot 
of parents picked up on that

officials of us territories told a 
congressional panel thursday that they have increasing drug 
problems and need the additional federal aid included in pending 
legislation 
the bill introduced by rep don de lugo dvirgin islands 
would provide training equipment and money for american samoa 
guam the northern mariana islands puerto rico the us virgin 
islands and palau 
de lugo who presided at the hearing as chairman of the house 
interior subcommittee on insular and international affairs said he 
expected the legislation to become part of a planned comprehensive 
drug bill this year 
the legislation would provide 115 million in assistance in the 
first year and 55 million annually in subsequent years 
gov alexander a farrelly of the virgin islands said his 
territory has become a major transit point for drugs moving from 
south america to the us mainland 
but the governor and iver stridiron president of the virgin 
islands legislature said significant amounts of the drugs remain 
in the territory and are causing a large increase in violent crimes 
it really has our community under siege stridiron said but 
he added that with additional resources the island territory could 
become a model of combatting the drug problem in us territories 
farrelly said his major problem is resources commenting that 
the assignment of a single drug enforcement administration agent in 
the islands indicates either nonrecognition of a serious 
problem or lack of interest in solving it 
gov joseph f ada of guam said his territory is experiencing a 
resurgence of heroin abuse after cleaning up the problem following 
the vietnam war 
in 1985 there was not one single case of heroin possession in 
the territory of guam he testified in 1986 12 heroin arrests 
were made by our police department 
in 1987 there were 108 cases of heroin possession with 56 
still pending laboratory analysis and confirmation by any 
definition this is an alarming rise ada said 
the governor said 91 percent pure heroin from southeast asia has 
been entering guam through palau but after law enforcement 
officers discovered the route the drugs began coming to guam via 
the northern marianas he said 
asked by de lugo if he could put a cost on guams drug problem 
ada said the law enforcement price tag could be 2 million to 3 
million but added the real cost could only be measured in trauma 
and shattered lives not dollars 
responding to a question by rep fofo if sunia damerican 
samoa ada said he would fire anyone in his administration abusing 
drugs with no questions asked 
a written statement submitted by american samoa gov ap lutali 
said the most pervasive and growing illegal substance abuse 
problem in his territory is marijuana followed by cocaine 
referring to the marijuana problem lutalis statement said 
what 10 years ago was a situation involving a relatively small 
number of individuals importing the drug through the us mail has 
now become a cultivation enterprises market by extended families 
producing in excess of seven tons per year

secretary of state george p shultz said 
thursday the united states would not get dragged into bidding 
wars for the right to locate american military bases in the 
philippines or anywhere else in the world 
asked by sen daniel inouye dhawaii whether the united states 
should get into bidding wars for such bases shultz told the 
senate appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations that the 
concept of rent for bases we have to reject when we have a base 
it must because it is in the interests of both countries 
specifically in the negotiations for extending the leases on 
the clark air base and subic naval base there are those in the 
philippines who think it is a great asset and they would rent it 
out at a staggering sum of money shultz said 
weve told them we reject that and will go elsewhere we will 
stick to our position and if we have to find other places for our 
ships and planes well do it he added 
negotiations are under way between the two countries to renew 
the fiveyear base leases that expire in 1991 some filipino 
officials have suggested the united states pay more than 1 billion 
a year over the current 180 million attached to annual aid for the 
two bases 
regarding a law under consideration by the philippine congress 
that would ban us nuclear weapons shultz said nuclear 
deterrence is an esential ingredient in keeping the peace 
if a host country says us ships are not welcome because they 
may be carrying nuclear weapons then we have to part company 
he said 
nuclear weapons make some people nervous shultz said but 
theyd be even more nervous if the other side had them and we 
didnt 
the law has passed the philippine senate but is expected to face 
opposition in the philippine house 
on another issue inouye said his committee had received letters 
from the philippines charging that human rights violations there 
had increased and that vigilante groups are getting official 
government support 
shultz replied that he was aware of the proliferaiton of 
vigilantes and said the development has pluses but also minuses 
president corazon aquino has increasingly recognized that 
the communist insurgency has to be dealt with with great severity 
and firmness so the tendency is to reach out and find 
additional strength outside the military he said 
but shultz cautioned that this is a development everyone must 
be weary of

congress should block reagan administration 
plans to sell a sophisticated ship defense system to japan because 
the sale would jeopardize both us security and the future of the 
american shipbuilding industry the author of the proposed ban said 
thursday 
the administration is unable to guarantee that the aegis 
system would be protected from compromise through espionage once it 
has left the direct control of the us navy rep charles e 
bennett dfla told the house foreign affairs arms control and 
asiapacific subcommittees 
congress was formally notified june 6 the administration had 
approved the sale of one aegis system costing 526 million during 
the current fiscal year with promise of a second system next year 
and more purchases in the 1990s 
aegis is the us navys latest integrated shipboard air defense 
system designed to track select and fire on multiple incoming 
targets 
senior defense and state department officials staunchly defended 
the proposed sale at the hearing arguing that blocking it would 
damage us credibility and cooperation with japan on vital defense 
strategy in the western pacific 
i can think of no single action on our part which would do 
more to call into question the basic aims or our security policy in 
the pacific region than to say that we have decided not to proceed 
weith the aegis sale to japan said assistant secretary of state 
gaston sigur 
sigur termed the sale critical in enabling japan to fully 
assume the role of defending its home region in the joint 
usjapanese plan for security in the western pacific to deny 
this sale would undercut our policy of encouraging enhanced 
japanese military spending he said 
bennett said aegisequipped us warships remaining under 
american command should perform the missions planned by the 
japanese 
assistant defense secretary richard armitage said japan has 
repeatedly rejected as recently as last week demands of some 
members of congress that its future aegisequipped destroyers be 
americanmade 
had the administration insisted on this he said we would 
have succeeded only in killing aegis as a japanese option it 
would not be politically feasible in japan for approval of 
procurement of an aegis ship if the hull were built in the united 
states 
but rep helen bentley rmd said she has inside information 
that japan wants the aegis system so badly that she will take it 
any way she can get it even to the point of buying the whole 
package from the us 
ms bentley a former chairwoman of the us maritime 
commission charged that the japanese and other foreign 
shipbuilders want to destroy the american shipbuilding industry 
now suffering from dwindling orders 
accusing the state department of ignoring the roughandtumble 
world of profit and loss ms bentley said proposals such as the 
aegis sale could lead to a situation where within 10 years we 
will have to buy our warships from them japan because we will not 
have the capability of building them ourselves any more 
she and bennett also suggested that through a process of 
reverse engineering japanese purchasers could learn the aegis 
technology once the system was transferred 
sigur and armitage said the japanese government as opposed to 
private companies had an impeccable record of safeguarding 
sensitive us technology

the national republican senatorial committee 
said thursday it will ask the internal revenue service and the 
federal election commission to investigate a chicagobased group 
for allegedly illegal campaign contributions 
nearly all the contributions from citizen action went to senate 
or house candidates but at the top of the committees list was the 
dukakis for president committee 
steve akey spokesman for michael dukakis said however that 
the campaigns financial records showed no contribution from 
citizen action 
the allegations were denied by a top official of citizen action 
who claimed the allegations are filled with outright falsehoods 
and clever distortions 
the gop committee alleged at a news conference that citizen 
action and its affiliates in 24 states formed corporations with 
taxexempt status that went beyond their legal bounds of promoting 
issues solely among members instead the committee said citizen 
action and its affiliates used donations to make a pitch for 
particular political candidates to members and the general public 
in addition the committee charged citizen action did not 
report its activities on behalf of candidates as independent 
expenditures or direct contributions to the candidates 
sen robert kasten rwis who spoke at the news conference 
said the senatorial committee is charging that while citizen action 
enjoys preferential taxexempt status from the irs it is heavily 
involved in political activities that are completely inconsistent 
with its taxexempt status 
kasten who said affiliates of citizen action worked against him 
in his 1986 reelection bid also contended that it is improper to 
call the group a citizens group because it is not volunteer with 
ordinary citizens participating in democracy these are paid 
organized workers 
kasten described citizen actions efforts as a national 
conspiracy of radical political groups and said the groups are 
guilty of massive federal election and tax law violations 
in a statement robert brandon vice president of citizen 
action said the allegations by the republican committee are 
filled with outright falsehoods and clever distortions and in 
comments immediately after the committees news conference brandon 
said that the financial records of citizen action and its 
affiliates are audited regularly by the irs 
what we do is no different from what thousands of other groups 
legitimately do trying to win meaningful changes on issues of 
concern to their members he said citing as examples the 
national rifle association and the sierra club 
specifically the committee charges that affiliates of the 175 
millionmember citizen action are incorporated as either social 
welfare or charitable organizations under the internal revenue 
code both types of organizations are tax exempt however the code 
stipulates that charitable organizations cannot be involved in 
politics while social welfare organizations are allowed to engage 
in partisan politics but only among members the committee said 
jann l olsten executive director of the gop committee alleged 
that members of citizen action go door to door speaking about 
issues and in the process deliver partisan messages on behalf of 
or against a candidate at the same time olsten said canvassers 
will ask for a financial contribution 
money is being given to taxexempt organizations and it is 
being used for partisan political campaigns olsten said 
kasten added these people are not supposed to be primarily 
involved in the elections process but this is a significant 
election effort 
olsten said that the committee is asking the irs to withdraw 
citizen actions taxexempt status

the nuclear regulatory commission was 
criticized thursday for failing to rid nuclear power plants of 
substandard nuts bolts and other fasteners since the problem was 
discovered in 1982 
the nrc has dragged its feet and boggled the whole question 
said rep ron wyden dore you have had since 1982 to think 
about this problem and it is now 1988 and you are still thinking 
about it 
wydens comments came at a hearing of the house energy and 
commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee during which nrc 
officials estimated that up to 20 percent of the fasteners in the 
nations nuclear plants may fail to meet specifications 
we expect standards we require for nuclear plants will be 
met said victor stello the nrcs executive director for 
operations they have not been met we are not happy 
stello said the nrc was not satisfied that nuclear power 
plant operators had done enough to eliminate substandard bolts and 
that the commission was studying ways to ensure compliance 
including barring the use of bolts supplied by manufacturers with a 
history of problems 
the nrc plans to move agressively against manufacturers who 
supply counterfeit fasteners or fraudulently claim their products 
meet specifications stello said 
he said the extent of the problem was just now becoming clear 
in addition stello said he would attempt to convene a meeting 
involving other federal agencies that also have faced problems 
eliminating the use of substandard fasteners in facilities they 
oversee

the government admitted 
thursday that a security lapse allowed irish guerrillas to kill six 
british soldiers by planting a bomb on their van while they were 
running in a charity race 
the irish republican army claimed responsibility and vowed to 
wage unceasing war against british forces in northern ireland 
townspeople in lisburn seven miles outside belfast gathered 
behind police barriers in small silent groups to gaze at the 
burnedout hulk of the bombed van 
others later approached the site and left bouquets 
were just expressing sympathy with the soldiers that are in 
this country trying to protect us and this is what theyre 
getting one unidentified young woman told british broadcasting 
corp tv as she put down a bunch of flowers 
we just hope that their families understand that its not 
everyone here thats like that she said 
sean mcmanus chairman of the iras legal political wing sinn 
fein appealed to families of british soldiers serving in the 
province to press their government to withdraw from ireland and 
bring an end to the tragic deaths resulting from britains 
partition of our country 
we regret all deaths and earnestly desire peace but the 
deaths of the six british soldiers on wednesday night are part of 
the price of the british governments intransigence mcmanus said 
in statement issued thursday in dublin capital of the irish 
republic 
a halfmarathon for charity had just ended wednesday evening at 
the close of a warm sunny day in this garrison town headquarters 
for the british army in northern ireland the exploding bomb turned 
the van into a fireball and scattered torn burning bodies onto the 
street 
i saw two bodies lying in the middle of the road said nigel 
sands 19 one of them had no legs and one of them was burning 
it was badly mutilated it seems they were blown from the van 
there was panic and people were running everywhere 
ten civilians were wounded including a 2yearold boy and a man 
of 80 but authorities said none was hurt seriously 
political leaders in britain and ireland joined prominent 
protestants and roman catholics of northern ireland on thursday in 
denouncing the attack 
prime minister margaret thatcher said in the house of commons 
the bombing was a terrible atrocity and reiterated the 
governments determination to defeat the terrorism of the ira 
which shoot and bomb to kill 
northern ireland secretary tom king the governments top 
official in the province conferred with army commanders in lisburn 
before flying to london to report to parliament 
there is a vital need for everybody to pay the closest 
attention to personal security he told reporters its 
absoluely standard practice i think tragically it does seem 
clear that this was not followed in this case 
the soldiers had traveled to lisburn from their barracks in 
londonderry in the north of the province in a blue van not marked 
as an army vehicle the bomb was believed to contain czechmade 
explosives and experts were trying to determine how it was 
detonated 
an editorial in the independent belfast telegraph the 
provinces largest newspaper said the professionalism in fixing 
the bomb without detection in an open car park is chilling 
it noted that soldiers were barred from participating in 
civilian events after two were killed when they blundered into an 
ira funeral cortege in march the soldiers had been permitted to 
join the lisburn event however and the paper asked how the ira 
found out 
somehow the word must have leaked out it said the bomb 
was ready and the van was identified the level of intelligence 
needed was considerable in a garrison town 
an ira statement delivered to newspapers and other media in 
belfast said it planted a sevenpound bomb for what it described as 
an execution 
it was the highest death toll since an ira bomb in enniskillen 
last november killed 11 protestant civilians and the highest army 
toll since 11 soldiers and six civilians were killed in a 1982 pub 
bombing near londonderry 
until that british presence is removed and the irish people 
as a unit can exercise our right to national selfdetermination 
the ira will continue to wage unceasing war against the british 
crown forces and the british colonial apparatus the ira 
statement said 
britain says it will stay as long as the majority wishes most 
protestants who outnumber catholics 32 are loyal to britain and 
oppose union with the overwhelmingly catholic republic 
the army identified the dead soldiers as cpl ian metcalfe 36 
lance cpl graham patrick lambie who would have been 23 on june 
29 lance cpl william john paterson 22 sgt michael james 
winkler 31 signaller mark robert clavey 24 and lance cpl derek

amid the empty gatorade bottles flattened 
tubes of sun block and stacks of fetid sweat socks 14 hanover high 
school students leapfrogged their way into the record books 
thursday 
actually the pace was more like a few steps of jogging then a 
leap and the 14 who were at it on the soccer field in twohour 
shifts roundtheclock since friday afternoon werent exactly 
bounding with energy 
but according to the guinness book of world records that 
qualifies as leapfrogging and at 1130 am the students 
frogged past 662 miles breaking the record set by a fraternity 
at the university of seattle 
thomas lambert and steve bonz both seniors made the record 
leap 
people ask which hurts more the bending or the leaping 
said doug north 17 between swigs of gatorade its the jogging 
in between 
the students who planned to continue leaping until they reach 
888 miles estimated to happen sometime saturday morning are 
raising money for the norris cotton cancer center at the 
dartmouthhitchcock medical center 
so far passersby have donated 2000 and the students arent 
sure how much they will raise in pledges 
the students formed fourperson teams to frog in shifts of two 
hours on four off in between they cheer each other on eat 
sleep spray each other down with hoses soak aching ankles in 
coolers of ice and take final exams 
i studied this morning at seven oclock with flash cards 
while leaping said brendan creagh 18 creagh said the students 
are averaging 19 leaping miles a day most of it in temperatures in 
the 90s during the first heat wave of the summer 
a cluster of tents in one corner of the field called 
frogville is home to the leapers and candles in paper bags 
mark the path around the field at night in one tent are some 
instruments and a stereo upon which the students played the theme 
from the film chariots of fire as they broke the record 
despite the excitement most of the leapers are looking forward 
to the end 
i have not done it before and i will not do it again north

the pentagon has decided to stop forming 
pools of reporters to cover navy operations in the persian gulf 
and instead will try to accommodate requests from news 
organizations on an individual basis to board us warships 
the change in policy announced thursday in a brief statement 
does not change the defense departments commitment to keeping 
the american people informed about the activities of military 
personnel serving in the gulf the pentagon said 
rather the department is now going to try to accommodate the 
many requests received from news organizations asking for the 
opportunity to send representatives to ships in the persian gulf 
the statement added 
were ending the pool said dan howard assistant defense 
secretary for public affairs we will come up with a procedure 
that works for everyone this is as much a result of requests from 
various news organizations as it is at our inception 
the pentagon has operated a regional press pool in the 
persian gulf for almost a year now helping the news media to cover 
the efforts of the united states to protect reflagged kuwaiti oil 
tankers plying the waterway 
kuwait is a key ally of iraq in the iraniraq war and won 
permission from the reagan administration last year to reregister 
its ships under the us flag after they became special targets of 
iranian forces 
under the press pool procedure a small group of reporters 
representing the major wire services broadcast networks news 
magazines and daily newspapers was formed periodically and sent to 
sea with navy warships escorting tankers 
the dispatches filed by the pool reporters were then sent 
through military channels and released to all news outlets in the 
united states 
the pool system is commonly used by the press when there are 
more reporters asking to cover an event than there are spaces 
available a pool reporter is expected to share with all other 
reporters the information he gathers on the medias behalf 
according to thursdays statement the pentagon has now decided 
that absent an emergency or the outbreak of fighting there is no 
need to keep dispatching press pools to ensure coverage 
rather efforts will now be made to accommodate individual 
reporters from organizations that have not been part of the pool 
the persian gulf regional media pool will be discontinued on 
july 1 and in its place unilateral embarkations will begin with 
plans for a contingency pool as necessary the pentagon said 
the success of the regional pool was due to the cooperative 
efforts of news organizations and the department of defense to 
solve the problems faced in working in a difficult environment but 
the time has come to make this change 
the procedures for setting up regional and national press pools 
were devised in the wake of the 1983 us invasion of grenada 
during which the pentagon prohibited news coverage

bill brown looked across a 30acre wheat 
field thursday at shafts of grain barely a foot tall and 
shriveling from the prolonged drought that has hit north dakota 
harder than any other state 
the best purpose for this right now is the cows he said 
digging into dirt that was bone dry three inches below the surface 
what we are trying to do now is get enough grazing to get the 
cattle through the summer 
browns farm which has received less than an inch of 
precipitation since january normally would be lush and green this 
time of year instead his pastures are parched and his grain crops 
are wilted 
brown figures the 1000 acres of wheat oats and barley that he 
planted this spring already have been wiped out we are not even 
going to start the combine this year from what i can see 
north dakota farmers are selling off cattle plowing under crops 
and filing crop insurance claims while the drought gov george 
sinner characterizes as the worst since dust bowl days grips the 
state from border to border 
the drought is expected to cost the state 40 percent of its farm 
income and seal the fate of many farmers who already were 
struggling financially 
we didnt need this said economist arlen leholm of north 
dakota state university 
the economy in north dakota was starting to rebound we had 
crop prices that were starting to rise not wildly but mildly 
livestock prices were pretty decent leholm said 
the drought could cost the states economy at least 27 
billion a loss that could throw it into another tailspin leholm 
said 
direct crop losses on wheat barley and oats will total about 
500 million because market prices are higher producers will also 
receive about 400 million less in federal deficiency payments he 
said 
we have got large sections of north dakota where they are 
estimating that 70 percent of the crop is already gone leholm 
said 
the drought is more widespread than the last one in 1980 leholm 
said the last real wipeout was in 1961 he said 
if adequate rain doesnt fall by midjuly the threshhold for 
planting later forage crops another 10 percent of the states 
farmers could be put out of business he said 
one crop insurer rain and hail insurance services already has 
received about 500 crop damage claims from its 4500 policy 
holders said eldon wollmann a field supervisor 
they are coming in at about 100 a day lately now and thats 
only going to get worse wollmann said i would guess that 
there would be very few insured we have policies with that would 
not be filing some kind of claim 
an estimated 40 percent of north dakotas farmers carry crop 
insurance which basically covers a farmers cost of production 
officials said 
the way they are looking right now if we get by paying 7 
million to 8 million in losses we will be lucky it could be 
double that easily wollmann said 
for brown his major struggle right now is trying to find feed 
for his 160 head of cattle a herd his family has been building for 
20 years 
already hes sold off 32 cows and some calves for lack of feed 
i am sure if things dont change there will be some more 
going 
his alfalfa fields are brown except for low spots that might 
yield some bales of hay if it rains he said brown intends to 
maintain at least 100 cows which could force him to ship the cows 
elsewhere perhaps nebraska for feeding this winter he said 
weather forecasts are so depressing brown has quit listening to 
them 
what he would have heard thursday was a prediction of 
temperatures in the 90s and high winds 
you watch the sky and hope thats about it brown said

blacks took a selfproclaimed 
national holiday thursday boycotting jobs and praying at churches 
to commemorate the 1976 soweto riots that set off months of 
violence 
two bombings were reported in cape town and police said a 
guerrilla blew himself up accidentally 
the first bomb wrecked part of a commuter rail line in the 
citys black township of langa and the second went off in the lobby 
of a civic center during a meeting of the farright conservative 
party causing damage but no injuries 
reports said some trains from soweto to johannesburg were stoned 
and passengers had to lie on the floor firebombs were thrown at 
buses and delivery vans in other townships causing serious 
injuries to three blacks 
police said the african national congress the main guerrilla 
movement fighting white domination had planned a major offensive 
to coincide with the anniversary but was at least partially 
thwarted 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said 11 suspected guerrillas 
had been killed in the past week 
one was killed thursday near cape town by explosives he was 
carrying another blew himself up tuesday and nine including three 
women were killed by police in two shootouts near the swaziland 
border vlok said 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp said police were 
tipped off that guerrillas based in mozambique would try to enter 
south africa through swaziland for massive acts of terrorism 
thursday in each of the two shootouts it said police stopped 
vehicles at roadblocks and riddled them with bullets after someone 
inside opened fire 
the african national congress issued a statement from its 
headquarters in zambia paying homage to blacks killed in soweto 12 
years ago and pledging to escalate our political and military 
offensive 
many blacks have regarded june 16 as a holiday since 1976 when 
nationwide rioting broke out after police fired on a student march 
in soweto johannesburgs main black township 
at least 575 blacks were killed in the ensuing months when the 
antiapartheid movement acquired a new militancy 
no official holidays mark events of specific significance to the 
26million black majority but several black unions have negotiated 
with employers to have june 16 as a day off 
many factories closed thursday and the largest daily newspaper 
for blacks the sowetan did not publish workers at three diamond 
mines struck to demand that their employer de beers join other 
companies in making the day a paid holiday 
commemorative church services were held in several black 
townships reports said security forces fired tear gas and bird 
shot because of stonethrowing that occurred as blacks left a 
church service in lamontville outside durban 
about 15 people gathered at sowetos avalon cemetery at the 
grave of hector pieterson a 13yearold shot by police during the 
march in 1976 
pietersons sister margot 17 and his nephew hector tabane 
6 put flowers on the grave which bears a marker saying deeply 
mourned by his parents sisters and a nation that remembers 
popi buthelezi 29 wounded in the 1976 shootings came to the 
service in a wheelchair 
later 1500 people attended a service at sowetos largest roman 
catholic church at one point two white men in civilian clothes 
were chased by members of the crowd who thought they were policemen 
and grabbed cameras they were carrying the crowd dispersed hastily 
after the service with many policemen looking on 
the soweto students 12 years ago had been protesting a range of 
grievances particularly the use of afrikaans in their schools 
in july 1976 the government announced that black schools could 
choose their language of instruction but activists say most other 
demands generally related to giving black communities more control 
over their schools have not been met 
mining executives said 24500 of 540000 black employees at 
major mines were absent thursday 
the biggest stayaway was at general mining union corps kinross 
gold mine where 86 percent of black workers were absent kinross 
was the site of the nations worst gold mine disaster when 177 men 
all but five of them black died in a fire in 1986 
public utility transport co which carries hundreds of 
thousands of black commuters from their townships reported a 9095 
percent stayaway in the johannesburg area 5080 percent in 
pretoria and about 30 percent in durban many stores in downtown 
johannesburg because black employees were absent

evan mechams tumultuous ride as governor 
of arizona ruined his business and landed him in two courts but it 
left him the same man as when he started a political outsider 
railing at the system that refused to work in his favor 
eighteen months ago the outspoken republican was at the top a 
prosperous automobile dealer who had finally won the chance to 
govern his state after five tries for the office 
now the governorship and the auto business are gone one lost 
when he was convicted by the arizona senate in an impeachment 
trial the other sold because business was lagging under the weight 
of bad publicity 
now another critical chapter has been closed mecham and his 
brother willard were acquitted thursday of criminal charges 
related to the alleged concealment of a campaign loan 
the 64yearold exgovernor had faced six felony counts and up 
to 22 years in prison on charges of hiding a 350000 campaign loan 
on personal and campaign financial reports required by the state 
willard mecham his brothers 1986 campaign treasurer faced three 
similar counts and up to 9 years in prison 
evan mecham insisted throughout his trial that the charges were 
based on smoke and mirrors but he had stopped short of 
predicting that the maricopa county superior court jury would find 
him innocent 
although he said for months he wanted nothing more than to get 
the facts out regarding the loan from attorney barry wolfson 
neither mecham nor his brother took the stand during seven days of 
testimony 
it was an uncommon spell of official silence for the combative 
mecham who testified in the senate impeachment court and who never 
shrunk from speaking his mind as governor 
as arizonas chief executive he angered many constituents by 
canceling a martin luther king holiday on grounds it was illegally 
created and by saying he didnt believe the slain civil rights 
leader deserved a holiday 
he was criticized for defending a books use of the word 
pickaninny for blacks other statements deeply offended jews 
homosexuals women and japaneseamericans 
but mecham never backed away from his comments and he remained 
defiant even after the senate convicted him april 4 on impeachment 
charges of misusing money from a state protocol fund and trying to 
thwart an investigation of a death threat 
a son of mormon farmers a fighter pilot in world war ii mecham 
put himself through college by selling cars in the rural town of 
ajo in 1950 he moved his pontiac dealership to glendale a phoenix 
suburb 
he published his own newspaper in the 1960s as an alternative to 
the phoenix press he also developed a virtual hobby of running for 
public office he won his first race in 1960 gaining a twoyear 
term in the state senate 
but he lost a 1962 bid for the us senate and ran 
unsuccessfully for governor four times including a nearmiss in 
the 1978 election against democrat bruce babbitt 
fortune finally turned in mechams favor in 1986 when he 
shocked the political establishment by winning the gop primary and 
the threeway general election race 
even after taking over as governor mecham saw himself as an 
outsider attacked by an establishment of legislative leaders the 
news media and attorney general bob corbin a fellow republican 
in mechams eyes those forces conspired to force him out of 
office and into criminal court 
but even before the jury returned its verdict mecham declared 
he had been vindicated by the testimony 
it has been totally revealed to the world that there was no 
conspiracy to hide the loan the former governor said when the 
defense had rested its case 
although mecham often appeared haggard during his legal ordeal 
at other times he seemed anything but a broken man as he joked with 
the reporters he has blamed for helping bring him down 
in any case he insisted all along that nothing would destroy 
his peace of mind he often quoted abraham lincoln saying he would 
be happy if he eventually won out but if he didnt 10 angels 
swearing i was right wont make any difference

a senior official in the soviet 
republic of azerbaijan blamed nationalists influenced by the 
armenian orthodox church for protests in a territorial dispute a 
hungarian newspaper said thursday 
in what it called an exclusive interview with azerbaijan state 
prosecutor ilias ismailov the magyar hirlap quoted him as saying 
the disputed nagornokarabakh region has never belonged to 
armenia and any return is out of the question 
the parliaments or supreme soviets of the two southern 
republics held separate votes this week azerbaijans decided not 
to give up nagornokarabakh and the armenian parliament backed 
demands by protesters that the mountainous region to be 
incorporated into armenia 
about 80 percent of ngornokarabakhs 160000 people are ethnic 
armenians it was assigned to azerbaijan in 1923 but armenians 
consider it part of their ancestral homeland 
you can only return what has been taken from you legally or 
illegally ismailov was quoted as saying karabakh has never 
been part of armenian territory 
magyar hirlap did not say when it obtained the interview with 
ismailov which it said was conducted in baku capital of 
azerbaijan 
unrest over the fate of nagornokarabakh began in february with 
mass street protests in the armenian capital yerevan and strikes 
and protests in nagornokarabakh 
violence folowed in azerbaijan where 32 people were killed in 
ethnic rioting in the port city of sumgait most of them ethnic 
armenians soviet authorities said a policeman was killed in 
further unrest in baku last week 
the soviet communist party daily pravda reported last friday 
that a general strike had virtually shut down industry and 
agriculture in nagornokarabakh for three weeks 
according to the magyar hirlap report ismailov said what is 
happening in karabakh was well organized in advance by armenian 
nationalists and under the influence of echmiadzin center of 
the armenian orthodox church 
the whole ideology originated in echmiadzin ismailov said 
referring to the religious center outside yerevan 
despite his accusations associating armenias church with the 
unrest ismailov said the conflict should not be seen as a 
religious clash between armenian christians and the predominantly 
moslem people of azerbaijan 
there is an attempt to give a religious color to the conflict 
saying christians do not want to live under moslem sovereignty 
ismailov said to put it mildly this is a malicious approach to 
the question there is no religious basis to this conflict

george bush challenged democrat michael 
dukakis on thursday to come up with a price tag for his proposal to 
junk the reagan administrations strategic defense inititative and 
replace it with a buildup in conventional forces 
where do you go when you get into the most expensive side of 
this of all which is conventional forces the vice president 
asked speaking with reporters on air force ii 
jim steinberg deputy issues director for the dukakis campaign 
said substantial funds would be freed up by halting work on the 
socalled star wars missile defense system 
the administration is now proposing to spend 4 billion on 
sdi steinberg said the governor feels those funds can 
bedevoted to areas of greatest needs 
bush who has accused the allbutcertain democratic 
presidential nominee of lacking experience on foreign policy and 
defense issues said the massachusetts governors proposals could 
jeopardize efforts to reach a strategic arms treaty with the 
soviets 
my question to him would be are you talking about the 
winnability of a conventional war without any reliance whatsoever 
on a nuclear deterrence i dont know how hed answer that 
question but if he answers yes then i think hes wrong bush 
said 
and wheres the price tag he asked 
dukakis earlier this week in a major foreignpolicy speech in 
washington voiced opposition to the mx missile and for sdi 
calling instead for a conventional defense initiative 
i dont think thats a good concept said bush 
bush also told reporters he sees no problem with the fact that 
his newly named communications adviser james h lake and his law 
and consulting firm are registered lobbyists for japanese business 
companies 
noting that lake who was named to the campaign post on monday 
is a volunteer and not a salaried campaign worker bush said i 
dont think theres a conflict at all are we going go now and look 
at every client for every law firm for every volunteer 
lakes firm robinson lake lerer amp montgomery of which lake 
is chairman represents mitsubishi electric corp suzuki of 
america automotive corop and japan auto parts industries 
association according to reports in the detroit news and the 
washington times 
bush also said he had no recollection of ever having met a 
former wedtech corp president anthony guariglia who testified 
that he was introduced to bush as part of an effort to obtain help 
on a navy pontoon contract 
guariglia made the claim on wednesday in testimony in new york 
in the wedtech corrpution trial he said wedtech had raised 
200000 for president reagans 1984 reelection campaign as part 
of its effort to win the navy contract 
was the guy ever at a fundraiser or something maybe but i 
dont remember anything the name or anything about him bush 
said 
asked whether he had any advice for syndicated columnist carl 
rowan who shot and wounded a teenage intruder in his back yard 
earlier this week bush said no i dont have any advice for 
him im not having much fun out of it i think its a matter where 
i cant make much of a contribution to it by saying anything 
noting rowans own strong views in favor of gun control laws 
bush added i suspect its causing him some difficulties sorting 
out in his own mind given his strong position on gun control with 
which i very much disagree 
i kind of emphathize with him on what he was going through 
when somebody was coming up at him its all easy to second guess 
now 
in a speech to an annual meeting of the us jaycees here bush 
reiterated his views on strong penalties for those convicted of 
drug offenses and said the policy of zero tolerance for drugs 
should be applied to the workplace as well as to cars planes and 
boats 
the vice president has proposed mandatory drug testing for 
prison guards airline pilots and for others responsible for the 
public safety and has suggested that all companies with government 
contracts have drug free programs for their employes that might 
include some form of drug testing 
there are those who say that drug testing is an invasion of 
individual rights but the use of drugsis a matter that affects 
the lives of others he said 
bush told his audience that while the government could not 
require drugtesting or drugeducation programs of private 
businesses each of you pesonally can stand up against drug 
use 
bush said he fully supports the zerotolerance policy under 
which yachts and other vehicles on which drugs have been found have 
been seized i dont mind inconveniencing a yacht owner or a car 
driver if it results somehow in saving the life of one kid bush 
said 
in his talk with reporters on air force two on the way home to 
washington from richmond bush said i just cant get too excited 
about the yacht owner even though some would like you to believe i 
am one 
mine is 28 feet long i want that in there too he said 
referring to the 40000 racing powerboat that he keeps at his 
vacation retreat in kennebunkport maine

a search warrant obtained by the justice 
department and made public thursday reveals the background and the 
theory of the governments investigation into possible corruption 
involving the defense department and private contractors 
the following are excerpts from that search warrant which was 
issued by a federal judge in st louis in response to the justioce 
department request to search an office at mcdonnell douglas the 
nations largest defense contractor 
melvin paisley resigned from his position as assistant 
secretary of the navy for research engineering and systems in 
april 1987 in april 1987 paisley opened his own private 
consulting business in the washington dc area as a consultant 
to defense contractors paisley provided advise sic to 
corporations and contractors who do business with varous agencies 
within the department of defense one of his consulting contracts 
is with mcdonnell douglas a large portion of his dealings with 
mcdonnell douglas are with or go through thomas gunn a 
vicepresident in marketing 
dod awards approximately 150 billion dollars worth of 
contracts every year dod through its constituent agencies makes 
decisions in areas for the acquisition and award of contracts to 
further the national defense at various stages decisions are made 
in dod and the military departments concerning the development of 
defense materials equipment and services and the allocation of 
funds appropriated to dod for the national defense 
information and data used to develop and implement the 
acquisition strategies are often closely held by dod and its 
military departments and are of value and interest to companies 
seeking contracts from dod a company with such advance information 
can prepare more advantageously for procurements which are likely 
to be upcoming moreover if a company learns of the governments 
plans the company can evaluate the plans and try to influence the 
decision makers to make modifications which would favor the 
particular company as such a company may want to influence a 
decision about the size of a particular procurement the 
specifications for the items being procured the prerequisites 
which a company must meet in order to be eligible for the award of 
the procurement or the weighing which the government will use in 
evaluating different aspects of all competitors proposals 
once dod decides to seek a particular procurement a majority 
of the contracts are awarded following a competitive bidding 
process dod has contracting officers who oversee the bidding 
process and are assigned within the various military services 
army navy marine corps and air force the process begins with 
an advertisement for a new contract which is followed by companies 
receiving a document called a request for proposal rfp which 
details contract specifications and other contractual requirements 
a time limit is set for the recipients to respond with their 
offers generally the price submitted by a company is critical to 
the companys winning a contract because the government usually 
awards the contracts to the lowest bidder which is technically 
qualified to complete the contract once the initial offers have 
been submitted the government analyzes the offers for both 
technical expertise and price the government determines a 
competitive range based upon the technical and pricing factors if 
it is determined that at least two of the companies offers are 
within the competitive range the competitive process is continued 
for those companies 
the government holds discussions with each company and tells 
it where its offer is weak technically the companies are then 
asked to submit their best and final offers bafo the bafo 
provides them with the opportunity to adjust their offers with 
respect to the price and the portions that were technically weak 
however if the government determines that only one companys offer 
is within the competitive range the government can award the 
contract without a bafo stage 
information about a companys competitors offers and the 
governments evaluation of those offers is never disclosed to a 
company prior to the award of the contract therefore a company 
which has access to that information prior to the time when bafos 
must be submitted can benefit greatly the information can assist 
the company in deciding how to modify its own offer 
the information can also help a company learn that it has no 
chance of winning a contract then the company can decide to either 
drop out of the bidding or to seek to influence the government to 
withdraw the rfp and change it in a way to be more favorable to the 
company 
in addition companies can obtain an edge if they obtain 
information about the governments intentions which have not been 
disclosed prior to or during the bidding process for instance the 
government may not have disclosed the amount of funds it has 
budgeted for a procurement or its estimates of how many options it 
will exercise under a contract containing options such information 
can help a company in drafting its proposal 
the scheme involves the illegal disclosure of information and 
the exertion of influence with respect to department of defense 
contracts the information disclosed is often provided by 
government employees receiving bribes or gratuities the disclosed 
information has been of the type that can provide a company with an 
unfair advantage over its competitors andor the government a 
substantial portion of the disclosed information is classified or 
confidential 
as a defense contractor consultant paisley relies upon 
government officials to provide department of defense contract 
information which is not available to the contracting public 
paisley then provides this information for a fee or as part of his 
consulting contract to mcdonnell douglas who is a department 
of defense contractor paisley has provided mcdonnell douglas and 
thomas gunn substantial information obtained from government 
officials which has been classified andor confidential or not 
available to the contracting public this information has included 
the following 
1 information regarding mcdonnell douglas proposed sale of 
its f18 fighter airplane to the swiss government including 
internal information of the navy regarding the super hornet 
configuration a proposed letter to mcdonnell douglas regarding the

michael dukakis and george bush laid the foundation thursday for 
their general election battle in the south with bush trumpeting a 
tough antidrug stand in virginia and dukakis in tennessee seeking 
to unify his party in a region that was once its stronghold 
a new poll said the two men are locked in a tight contest there 
and another survey out thursday gave dukakis a doubledigit lead 
nationwide 
dukakis started a regional campaign swing with a stop in 
nashville to pick up the endorsement of former democratic 
presidential rival albert gore jr 
mike dukakis is going to carry our party to victory in 
november he is going to win in the east in the north in the 
west and he is going to win right here in the south gore said 
of the massachusetts governor he criticized during the primary 
season 
dukakis image in the south and all over the country is very 
different than many people thought it was going to be when this 
campaign began i think he moves beyond the old labels gore said 
jesse jackson dukakis remaining rival testified before a 
senate committee on drug abuse and basked in the praise of a 
senator he competed against in the 1984 presidential campaign 
i would think jesse frightened the bejesus out of them four 
years ago said sen ernest f hollings of south carolina i 
remember him standing up and saying his time has come this 
time hes run a winning campaign he hasnt frightened anyone hes 
charmed them in all of those different debates 
hollings the only senator to back jackson said dukakis has 
locked up the nomination but he said his vote at the atlanta 
convention would be based on south carolina democrats support of 
jackson 
he won my home state he certainly has earned my vote 
hollings said 
jackson met with 33 democratic senators as he pressed for more 
unpledged super delegates to the july democratic convention to 
support him he said the party leadership while accepting my 
investment in the party to make it strong has not been as 
reciprocal as it ought to be 
if i invest i should reasonably expect return jackson told 
reporters so i appreciate the accolades that i am the voter 
registration champion for the party that i have led the drive to 
return the senate back to the democratsif i have done all of 
that i simply say lets be fair 
dukakis welcomed gores support and said he looked to jackson to 
join the bandwagon 
i would hope jesse jackson will be a part of this campaign and 
as early as possible the massachusetts governor said 
dukakis added his backing to the idea of a special outside 
counsel to probe charges against house speaker jim wright who will 
preside over the democratic convention next month 
he said wright had welcomed the idea and he called that a 
stance that contrasts rather sharply with the kind of 
stonewalling weve had from the administration on case after case 
after case 
dukakis distinguished his support for wright from his call for 
the resignation of attorney general edwin meese iii 
thats after repeated evidence of insensitivity a lack of 
awareness of what we mean when we talk about high standards 
dukakis said if youre attorney general of this country and 
youve stumbled as often as he has and made as many mistakes as he 
has and provided as weak leadership as he has you ought to leave 
office 
bush with his budget cramped by federal spending limits went 
only as far south as richmond va where the republican vice 
president declared drugs the ultimate fatal attraction he also 
renewed his call for companies to put antidrug programs in place 
before they can receive federal contracts 
the point is that stopping drugs in the workplace is not just 
a profit and loss issue its a matter of protecting the health and 
safety of workers the allbutcertain republican presidential 
nominee told the us jaycees annual meeting its no less 
important than osha regulations on the conditions of machinery 
the federal government should not dictate what kind of 
drugfree program a company should have but it should require any 
federal contractor to have one in place he said 
bush also demanded wheres the price tag for dukakiss 
advocacy of increased spending on nonnuclear forces which the 
massachusetts governor called a conventional defense initiative to 
replace president reagans strategic defense initiative 
dukakis deputy issues director jim steinberg replied that the 
administration has earmarked 4 billion for sdi and that freeing 
up those funds would help finance other military spending 
drugs were jacksons topic in testimony before the senate 
committee on labor and human resources where he denounced calls 
for legalization 
that would be a mistake it would be surrender to the no 1 
threat to our national security we would not think of legalization 
of smog because theres a lot of it its dangerous jackson said 
dukakis got some good news as he started his threeday southern 
swing 
a new poll in nine southern states said dukakis and bush are 
neckandneck in the region once called solid for the democrats in 
recent years gop presidential candidates have counted a strong 
showing in the region but pollster claibourne darden said bush 
cant make that assumption 
i think everyone has to be surprised at how well dukakis is 
doing in the south darden said george bush himself is doing 
more to break the republican lock on the south than michael 
dukakis is doing 
the telephone poll of 750 voters gave dukakis the support of 45 
percent and bush the backing of 42 percent thirteen percent were 
undecided 
given the polls sampling error margin of 4 percentage points 
that finding is a dead heat for the states involved virginia 
north carolina south carolina georgia florida alabama 
mississippi louisiana and tennessee 
and in another poll this one nationwide dukakis held a 
15point lead over bush the nbc newswall street journal survey 
conducted june 912 said dukakis had the support of 49 percent of 
the registered voters polled compared to 34 percent for bush 
the survey suggested dukakis lead was based largely on 
overwhelming support among women where he held a 24point lead 
5228 
the national survey of 2014 adults had a margin of sampling 
error of 3 percentage points nbc said

candies made from enough heroin to kill a child 
are the latest way smugglers are trying to bring the drug into 
britain customs officials said thursday 
twenty pounds of the fake candies each containing the 
equivalent of nearly 550 worth of heroin have been discovered in 
the luggage of smugglers arriving from pakistan in the past three 
weeks the officials said the total value was put at 134 million 
the officials said they were alerting customs officials in other 
countries of the danger 
somewhere in pakistan there is a factory compressing glazing 
and wrapping heroin to look exactly like sweets said mike curr 
assistant chief investigations officer 
if they are stolen by kids or otherwise get into their hands 
just one sweet will kill a child he said even touching it by 
unwrapping the cellophane will leave a rash as the heroin is 
absorbed into the skin 
howard sutton chief press officer at national customs 
headquarters in london said heroin disguised as candy was seized 
before at a british border but called it a relatively new trend 
in smuggling techniques 
he said smugglers usually baked the drug until it was black and 
looked like licorice then wrapped it in real candy wrappers 
the fake candy was found in two confiscations involving five 
passengers coming in from pakistan which is known as a drug

with actor jimmy stewart looking on a house 
committee approved a measure thursday that would create a 
commission to act against colorized blackandwhite movies 
among other things those movies could not be shown under their 
original titles if the measure becomes law which even backers 
concede is doubtful 
disregarding objections that the action was an infringement on 
the rights of other congressional committees the appropriations 
committee refused 2520 to delete the anticoloring provision 
from the 97 billion appropriations bill it later passed for the 
interior department and related agencies 
several committee members including the chairman rep jamie 
whitten dmiss argued that the committee should not proceed 
because the decision belongs to the judiciary committee and its 
copyright subcommittee 
rep claude pepper dfla chairman of the rules committee 
wrote whitten to object to the procedure 
obviously this is not going to survive the rules committee 
said rep robert j mrazek dny a supporter of the measure 
but if it survives this appropriations committee it will send a 
signal 
the measure is similar to a proposal pending before the 
judiciary committee it would set up a ninemember commission to 
judge which films are significant enough to deserve protection 
those films if significantly altered could not be shown or 
distributed without disclosure of the alterations and the desire of 
the director or principal writer to disassociate themselves from 
the changes 
blackandwhite films to which color had been added could not be 
shown or distributed under their original titles 
the issue arose last year after atlanta businessman ted turner 
owner of a gigantic film library began releasing blackandwhite 
classics such as the maltese falcon in computercolored 
versions 
many film buffs and directors have objected that the process 
perverts the vision of the makers of the original film 
i find it offensive for a government body to designate what is 
art said rep vic fazio dcalif leader of the opponents of 
the provision in the committee in addition we are saying that 
property rights of the owners should be limited or terminated 
mrazek argued that the issue was one of vandalizing art that 
ought to be protected he read a telegram from director frank capra 
that complained the current owners of his 1940s film with stewart 
its a wonderful life had splashed it all over with easter 
egg colors and ruined it 
referring to stewarts role as the reforming senator in mr 
smith goes to washington rep mickey edwards rokla argued 
mr smith would have been standing up in this committee arguing 
against the bypassing of committee procedures 
the 80yearold stewart expressed elight after the vote saying 
nobody was quite sure who was going to win right up to the end 
adding color to blackandwhite movies he said is really a 
terrible practice and something that should be outlawed 
jack valenti president of the motion picture association of 
america the principal studioproducer trade association said 
mrazeks opponents had only about five votes when the issue moved 
into the committee a few days ago there was a big change in my 
direction he said 
whittens opposition is bound to be influential from here on he 
added

authorities on thursday detained vietnamese 
boat people as illegal immigrants instead of granting them asylum 
as refugees from their communist country as has been hong kongs 
policy for 13 years 
officials arrested 78 vietnamese who came ashore under a tough 
new policy to stop the influx of boat people to this tiny british 
colony the detainees will be returned to vietnam unless they can 
prove they face political or religious persecution back home 
britains ambassador to vietnam emrys davies told reporters in 
hong kong that hanoi saw enormous difficulties in taking back 
large numbers of boat people and had given no indication it would 
accept them by the early 1990s 
davies said hanoi is punishing people who organize the exodus 
from vietnam but added that it was difficult to patrol vietnams 
long coastline 
since the vietnam war ended in 1975 with the communists taking 
over the goverment hong kong has considered all boat people to be 
refugees fleeing persecution the policy was reviewed as the number 
of vietnamese arrivals rose to nearly 8000 this year of which 
only 1200 have been resettled 
government officials say prospects are dim for finding homes for 
more than 16000 refugees now in hong kong camps 
under the policy boat people who fled for economic reasons will 
be detained until they can be sent back to vietnam those who can 
prove they faced persecution in vietnam will be granted refugee 
status and become eligible for resettlement 
one of the vietnamese who was detained told reporters that his 
boat carried more than 30 relatives nguyen dai quy said he did not 
know of the new policy when he left his home in central vietnam two 
weeks ago but would have fled anyway 
the 32yearold man said he was a political refugee noting that 
the communist government did not allow him to pursue deep sea 
fishing and that his children could not attend school he claimed 
his mother was killed by viet cong and he was a volunteer soldier 
for the proamerican south vietnam army during the war 
i hope the hong kong government will change its policy and let 
me get out he said

the food and drug administration on thursday 
authorized expanded use of an experimental drug for parkinsons 
disease a development that could benefit 30000 americans with 
severe forms of the ailment 
the drug selegilene can be distributed under the fdas 
relatively new category called treatment ind in which promising 
experimental therapies can be prescribed for desperately ill 
patients before completion of the more extensive review required 
for fullfledged new drug approval 
selegilene is the fifth drug to win such a designation under the 
new regulations adopted last year the ind in the definition 
stands for investigational new drug 
distribution is to be administered by the drug sponsor somerset 
pharmaceuticals inc of danville nj which has an application 
pending for full approval to market the drug under the trade name 
eldepryl 
physicians treating patients with severe parkinsons who have 
had difficulty with standard treatment can contact the company for 
detailed information about the drugs distribution the fda said 
the most widely used treatment for parkinsons involves use of 
the drug levodopa however that drugs effectiveness often 
gradually decreases with longterm use and it needs to be given in 
larger amounts that can produce increasingly severe side effects 
such as nausea involuntary bodily movements flushing and 
palpitations said an fda announcement 
parkinsons disease is a serious degenerative disorder of the 
central nervous system that can affect people 40 and over it is 
believed to be caused by reduced levels of a naturally produced 
substance in the brain called dopamine 
selegilene surpresses some of the enzymes in the body that 
inactivate dopamine

parliament has passed reforms that 
give state enterprises more say in production make them 
selffinancing and could reduce the economic bureaucracy by 30 
percent the government said thursday 
the limited package passed in a special threeday session is 
patterned after soviet reforms that prescribe selfmanagement and 
selffinancing for state enterprises and cooperatives while taking 
away some or all state subsidies 
ctk the official news agency said state companies will be 
directly subordinate to ministries and that eliminating 
middlelevel bureaus could bring a reduction of up to 30 percent in 
the economic bureaucracy 
the reforms which take effect next jan 1 were passed after a 
yearlong debate during the rest of this year companies that 
account for 30 percent of industrial production will be involved in 
an experiment that gives them greater control of production 
decisions 
czechoslovak officials gave few details on plans for economic 
reform which they approach with caution decentralization of 
management will not go as far as in the soviet union and will not 
take full effect until 1991 
premier lubomir strougal acknowledged in may that the economy 
had not improved under his government he said the number of 
committees and bureaus between enterprises and ministries will be 
reduced and the direct responsibilities of ministers increased 
the onceefficient economy is plagued by low productivity a 
poor industrial structure unbalanced supply and demand and growth 
of unsold inventory 
jaroslav matejka an architect of the reforms told a news 
conference last month only 48 percent of companies had applied for 
the new status that brings more independence he said some feared 
being put out of business 
managers will be elected by secret ballot in the plant 
according to the new law but the government retains the right to 
nominate candidates for the jobs 
new trade legislation will allow companies to make contracts of 
cooperation with others inside the sovietled comecon trading group 
without first seeking government permission ctk said 
some enterprises will be allowed to deal directly with western 
companies bypassing foreign trade offices that now act as 
middlemen 
a new law on cooperative enterprises which employ 15 million 
people affects those in both agricultural and housing and could 
increase their efficiency the agency reported 
housing cooperatives alleviate the chronic housing shortage in a 
country where thousands of people have waited years years for new 
apartments 
agriculture subsidies now cost 3 billion a year 
miroslav toman the agriculture minister raised the possibility 
of people being allowed to buy land 
there is a situation when the new law allows transfer of 
land not suitable for socialist largescale production to other 
socialist and social organizations and individuals toman 
told the daily lidova demokracie he gave no details

soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir f 
petrovsky on thursday called for an expanded un role including a 
naval force a space agency under united nations auspices and a 
body to monitor disarmament pacts 
this is a revolutionary change in our attitude toward the 
united nations petrovsky deputy head of the soviet delegation 
to the current disarmament session told a news conference 
for years the soviet government has been wary of the 159member 
world body but recently it has sought to strengthen it and develop 
a comprehensive un security system a vague concept opposed by 
the united states as unrealistic 
the soviet union has been playing a major role in the current 
general assembly session on disarmament it has also paid its un 
budget debts and increased the number of soviet citizens on 
permanent assignment as civil servants at the united nations 
the united states owes more than 240 million in un dues it 
is cool toward most soviet proposals regarding the united nations 
and does not wish to see an expanded un role that could infringe 
on national prerogative 
petrovsky said the soviet union was delivering our un policy 
from dogmas and subjective approaches but we have every right 
to expect similar selfcriticism responsibility and reason from 
other states too 
the united nations he said should become a unique center for 
harmonizing actions of states in our interdependent world 
petrovsky said all nations should disclose to the united nations 
information on their troops abroad and their foreign military 
bases but asked if the soviet union would make the first step and 
disclose its military information petrovsky said 
this is not a oneactor theater but the world stage we are 
ready to participate in the exchange of data if other countries 
the united states and nato do the same 
in its monthlong session on disarmament the general assembly 
is expected to adopt resolutions and a final document setting out a 
realistic agenda for disarmament and arms control western 
diplomats have indicated that if the documents are unacceptable 
there will be no consensus and there could be divisive votes 
the soviet proposals include 
creation of a un naval force aimed at maintaning freedom of 
navigation and holding a joint trial exercise with fleets of the 
permanent members of the security council the united states 
britain china france and the soviet union 
un supervision of troop withdrawal from foreign territories 
and the expansion of un peacekeeping forces the soviet union has 
proposed elimination of foreign military presence and military 
bases in foreign territories by the year 2000 
creation of an international monitoring and verification 
agency covering both disarmament and political settlement of 
conflicts and crises 
creation of a world space organization under un auspices to 
ensure safeguards in making outer space strictly for peaceful 
purposes 
the united states regards many of the proposals as infringements 
upon its ability to behave unilaterally in its own interests and 
pursue for example its spacebased antimissile defense 
initiative known as star wars

a house committee approved prohibitions 
thursday on oil and gas drilling for another year in federal waters 
off florida california and new england 
the bans were contained in the 97 billion appropriations bill 
for the interior department and related agencies that the 
appropriations committee sent to the house floor 
earlier in the day interior secretary donald p hodel announced 
a delay of at least six months in the planned lease offering for 
new england waters to try negotiations with affected new england 
governors the sale originally had been scheduled for next february 
hodel also split the offering for florida gulf coast waters into 
two parts with the 44millionacre noncontroversial section to be 
offered in november as scheduled an offering on other gulf waters 
will be delayed at least six months while two federalstate task 
forces conduct additional studies on oil spill trajectories and the 
effects of any spills on the southwest florida coast 
last week hodel similarly delayed the offering of leases off 
northern california until next october 
the committees provisions if upheld by congress will apply 
until sept 30 1989 
there have been several previous bars to drilling enacted 
similarly as riders to appropriations bills and most of the 
argument thursday covered ground familiar to the members 
hodels california provision was enacted without discussion 
the florida question is complicated by the presence of 73 
previously awarded leases that were suspended for three years for 
special environmental studies recently completed 
an amendment by rep ralph regula rohio to delete the 73 
tracts from the 16 million acres of prohibited area south of about 
naples down to the keys was defeated 
the very modest amendment offered by mr regula here today is 
simply to say the united states will live by its commitments 
said rep bob livingston rla regula himself argued that the 
issue was can we take back the rights that people have paid for 
namely 220 million 
more generally though regula argued that to year after year 
place a moratorium on drilling doesnt address the problem the 
issue really belongs before the energy and commerce committee he 
said 
the new england provisions expand the prohibited area 
substantially from what it has been in past years by barring 
drilling in waters less than 400 meters deep 1312 feet compared 
to 60 meters 197 feet previously 
regula offered an amendment to make the new england area conform 
to what was prohibited in previous years but was defeated on a 
voice vote 
new england opponents of offshore drilling say the prohibition 
is needed to protect the rich shallow georges bank fishing grounds 
off cape cod and the 400meter provision was chosen to conform to 
provisions of a 12year canadian moratorium in adjacent waters 
adopted earlier this year 
the action closes about 35 million acres to drilling and leaves 
about 2 million acres available for offering in a february auction 
opposing the committee proposals hodel said there might be no 
bids if promising shallowwater areas were ruled off limits off new 
england 
lisa speer staff attorney for the natural resources defense 
council and longtime opponent of offshore drilling said after the 
vote this is a major victory this takes the pressure off and 
will allow the next administration to take a look at the offshore 
program 
the american petroleum institute said the action if upheld 
would mean the abandonment of any meaningful effort to find new 
supplies of oil and natural gas offshore and is a severe blow to 
the nations future energy security the record of oil company 
offshore operations clearly shows that oil and gas is being 
extracted without harm to the environment to economic activity

the federal aviation administration flooded 
with tens of thousands of complaints from private pilots on 
thursday curtailed its proposed requirements for altitude tracking 
devices on small planes 
the faa announced a final regulation which calls for private 
pilots to have the altitude equipment when flying within 30 miles 
of 27 of the countrys busiest airports and in restricted airspace 
around 109 additional airports 
three months ago the faa said it was considering a much broader 
regulation that would have banned private pilots from airspace 
within 40 miles of 254 airports unless they had the equipment that 
tells air traffic controllers a planes altitude 
under the new rule small planes also will be prohibited from 
flying at or above 10000 feet without the altitude encoding 
equipment originally the faa had suggested requiring the equipment 
on small planes flying as low as 6000 feet 
the final regulation falls short of what the airlines had wanted 
and closer to what the private pilots of small planes had sought 
faa administrator allen mcartor said the regulation should 
reduce the danger of an aerial collision involving a small 
aircraft he called it a major positive impact on safety 
currently the altitude encoding transponders are required on 
small planes only if they fly inside controlled airspace around the 
27 busiest airports the new requirements will be phased in 
beginning in july 1989 
the move to broaden requirements for altitudereporting 
equipment stemmed from the 1986 aerial collision over cerritos 
calif in which a small plane without such equipment collided with 
a mexican airliner killing all aboard the two aircraft 
the airlines and commercial pilots have argued that small 
private planes should have the altitude encoding equipment whenever 
they fly in airspace used by commercial jetliners 
congress had called on the faa to broaden its requirement for 
the socalled modec radar signal transponders on private planes 
but when the faa suggested in february that it might require the 
equipment at 254 airports it unleashed a flurry of protests 
according to estimates by the aircraft owners and pilots 
association more than 80000 letters were sent to the faa and to 
members of congress complaining about the proposal 
the private pilot group argued that the additional signals from 
the increased number of transponders would overwhelm the air 
traffic controllers a claim disputed by the faa and that the 
additional requirements were being proposed for airspace near 
airports that are not heavily used by commercial jetliners 
pilots also complained about the estimated 600 to 2000 cost 
for the altitude encoding transponder 
commercial jets as well as most sophisticated private planes 
that fly in and out of the busiest airports already have the 
equipment 
the faa long has required any aircraft flying within socalled 
terminal control areas rings of airspace of varying size around 
the 27 busiest airports to have the altitude encoding equipment 
the rule announced thursday would require the equipment for flights 
within 30 miles of the 27 airports beginning in july 1989 
at 109 additional airports which have less restrictive 
airspace private planes must have the equipment when flying within 
that restricted area or up to 10000 feet beginning dec 30 1990 
other airports may be designated as requiring small planes to 
have the modec equipment within 10 miles but the faa said only 
two airports so far have been singled out small planes flying 
within 10 miles of billings mont and fargo nd must have the 
equipment beginning in 1991

an ira bombing in northern ireland killing six 
soldiers and the recent arrest of two suspected japanese 
terrorists in the united states magnify security concerns for the 
sevennation economic summit in toronto next week 
police helicopters are already whirling over downtown 
skyscrapers at night and border immigration checks have been 
tightened metropolitan police staff superintendent bernard nadeau 
said thursday 
the biggest threat is terrorism historically theyve always 
been active at summit conferences they have a way of getting into 
a country illegally nadeau said in an interview 
nadeau said police were investigating a news report from manila 
thursday that a japanese red army suspect arrested in the 
philippines last week was planning to establish a base there for 
attacks on the toronto summit and the summer olympics in seoul 
south korea 
police are also focusing on the safety of british prime minister 
margaret thatcher who narrowly escaped injury when the irish 
republican army bombed her hotel in brighton england on oct 12 
1984 
the ira claimed responsibility for a boobytrap bomb in lisburn 
northern ireland on wednesday which killed six british soldiers 
taking part in a charity race 
were uncomfortable any time british royalty visits or anyone 
connected with the british government said nadeau were 
always concerned that the ira could be active 
protecting mrs thatcher president reagan and the leaders of 
five other summit nations and the european community has been made 
more difficult by canadas decision to hold the summit in the 
countrys biggest city previous north american locations for the 
annual event have been puerto rico montebello quebec and 
williamsburg va 
the last major city to host the summit was tokyo in may 1986 
when japans radical middle core faction fired five homemade 
rockets into the downtown area no one was injured 
the possibility of an attack on japanese prime minister noboru 
takeshita arose in april when a suspected japanese red army 
terrorist yu kikumura 35 was arrested on the new jersey 
turnpike police found three pipe bombs and false papers in his car 
an 18yearold japanese college student yoshio kosugi was 
detained june 12 in philadelphia after police found a rifle 
grenades and ammunition in his luggage 
police are equipped with computerenhanced photographs of all 
known red army members and a helicopterborne rapid deployment 
assault squad staged a demonstration at an ontario military base 
this month to send a message to wouldbe terrorists the public 
will never see them unless something happens said nadeau 
canadian solicitor general james kelleher said the government is 
spending 49 million on summit security and deploying 3000 
officers and agents 
kelleher told parliament thursday while we have no specific 
threats at this time in any respect there is a high level of risk 
and we must be very careful and make sure nothing untoward 
happens 
nadeau said eight security forces are involved not counting 
secret service agents brought by the world leaders they are the 
canadian secret intelligence service royal canadian mounted 
police canadian armed forces ontario provincial police 
metropolitan toronto police and the durham peel and york regional 
police forces 
sharpshooters with highpowered rifles will be posted in office 
towers up to 15 city blocks will be sealed off as motorcades ferry 
the leaders to and from their hotels and city expressways will be 
closed for 15 minutes at a time as delegates are escorted to dinner 
engagements in the suburbs 
weve had people in and out of here for four or five months 
said patrick boutette of the old mill restaurant west of the city 
where finance ministers dine sunday night 
the first arrests occurred wednesday when police broke up an 
antisummit protest at the university of toronto and charged 15 
people with trespassing 
police denied permission for an antiwar group alliance for 
nonviolent action to march down university avenue to the 
metropolitan toronto convention center where the leaders will meet 
demonstrators could occupy the attention of police and allow 
terrorists to act nadeau said 
he said police also worry about random attacks by unstable 
persons like john hinckley jr who shot and wounded reagan in 
1981 
despite its setting in a city of 34 million people the summit 
will take place in a security cocoon at no time will the 
delegates be on public view said toronto police chief jack marks 
local resident alex mackenzie called it ironic that reagan 
walked the streets of moscow a place he once dubbed an evil 
empire but toronto is not considered safe enough for him to 
emerge from his armored limousine

former gov evan mecham was found innocent 
thursday of concealing a 350000 campaign loan a partial 
vindication for the first us governor impeached and removed from 
office in 59 years 
minutes after the clerk had read the jurys last not guilty 
finding on the six counts against mecham and his brother willard 
the judge declared the trial over and mechams supporters cheered 
justice can occur in arizona when you get to the people and 
outside the politicians the 64yearold former governor told 
reporters outside the court were happy were happy youre 
always apprehensive but not really surprised 
he said he would hold a news conference friday morning 
as the final verdict was read mecham smiled broadly and hugged 
his attorney michael scott then turned and embraced his wife 
florence then he crossed to the jurors and began shaking their 
hands 
scott asked judge michael ryan whether mecham could make a 
statement but the judge refused saying this is a court of law 
mr scott 
mecham had acknowledged he did not itemize the 350000 loan 
from developer and attorney barry wolfson on either his personal or 
campaign financial statements the defense said the failure was an 
innocent mistake partly due to willards inexperience as a 
bookkeeper 
however the prosecution insisted that the conservative 
republican badly needed the wolfson loan to keep his campaign 
afloat then hid it to avoid spoiling his theme of being beholden 
to no one 
the jury had deliberated 6 hours after receiving the case 
wednesday following seven days of testimony 
mecham could have been sentenced to 22 years in prison if 
convicted on all six felony counts of perjury willful concealment 
and filing false documents his 67yearold brother faced a maximum 
9 years on three counts 
attorney general bob corbin said after the verdict that he had 
offered to let mecham plead guilty to a misdemeanor before the 
trial began but mecham turned him down 
mecham was impeached by the arizona house and removed from 
office on april 4 when the state senate convicted him of misusing 
money from a state protocol fund and trying to thwart an 
investigation of a death threat he had also faced an impeachment 
trial on the loan concealment charge but the senate decided not to 
consider the matter to avoid prejudicing the criminal trial 
the former auto dealer had run for governor four times 
unsuccessfully before he won a threeway race in november 1986 
gov rose mofford the democratic secretary of state who took 
over mechams post after he was removed by the legislature said in 
a prepared statement that she hoped her predecessor and his 
entire family can resume their lives as private citizens 
the end of this trial signals a hastening of a healing process 
which has begun and that the citizens of this great state so richly 
deserve she said 
outside the courtroom prosecutor barnett lotstein said that he 
had we had an obligation to present this case and that he had 
no quarrel with the decision 
we believe we presented a responsible case that had to be 
presented we obviously felt we had a good case lotstein added 
a lot of the people in this community feel that he has suffered 
enough and perhaps that was a factor 
lotstein said he felt the key issue was whether either evan or 
willard mecham had the intent to break the law when they filled 
out the disclosure forms and that the jury obviously didnt feel 
they had such intent 
judge ryan addressing the jurors before dismissing them told 
them that this case was zealously litigated by both sides very 
well done job by both sides 
i think that your verdict has shown that there can be a fair 
verdict a fair trial for all parties in this system ryan added 
i think youre a credit to this system and i think that this 
system can do the job even under intense and high publicity 
situations 
when testimony ended friday mecham told reporters the 
prosecution had not proven its case which he said was based on 
smoke and mirrors 
neither defendant took the stand 
former top mecham aide edith richardson testified for the 
defense that the loan was common knowledge among mechams inner 
circle 
however former mecham insiders donna carlson and mac matheson 
testified that they didnt learn about the loan until october 1987 
when it was revealed by the media 
bur the prosecution said it was immaterial whether mechams 
closest aides knew about the wolfson loan the main point 
prosecutor michael cudahy said was that the loan was not listed on 
the public disclosure forms required by the state 
a state accountant leroy johnson insisted that the failure to 
list the loan could not have been simply a bookkeeping mistake by 
willard mecham 
this one transaction stands out above all other 
transactions johnson said its the largest single transaction 
by far the receipt is recorded a month after the fact the name on 
the receipt is evan mecham not barry wolfson 
the jurys makeup was an issue before selection began when 
mecham acknowledged in april that he asked a group of backers to 
remain quiet about their support of him if asked to serve on 
the jury the former governor contended he was only joking however 
mecham became engulfed in controversy just one week after taking 
office in january 1987 when he canceled a martin luther king 
holiday for some state workers on grounds it was created illegally 
he said king didnt deserve a state holiday and later caused 
another storm of criticism by defending the use of the word 
pickaninny in a book mecham also made remarks that angered 
women jews homosexuals and japaneseamericans 
the former governor also was accused of making a series of 
substandard appointments to top state positions 
before mecham the last governor impeached and removed from 
office was henry johnson of oklahoma in 1929

the senate on thursday passed a farreaching 
welfare bill designed to help people break out of poverty through 
jobs backing it almost unanimously after acceding to white house 
demands for more stringent work requirements 
the vote on the family security act was 933 
the fiveyear 28 billion measure requires steppedup child 
support collections and creation of a comprehensive education 
training and jobs program longterm welfare recipients or those 
likely to become longterm such as teenage mothers would receive 
particular attention 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny who wrote the bill and 
fashioned a broad coalition of senate supporters said it would 
make fundamental improvements in a system that has not changed in 
53 years 
for moynihan who was a presidential advisor and a professor 
before joining the senate the lopsided vote capped decades of 
studying and seeking welfare reform 
this is the most important legislation of its kind and the 
first legislation of its kind since the welfare system was 
established in the 1930s he exulted moynihan said that under 
the current system one child in four in this country will be on 
welfare by age 18 thats where we were headed yesterday 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas called 
the moynihan bill an opportunity to set an entirely new 
direction for the outdated and ineffective system we have today 
and senate minority leader bob dole rkan described it as 
the best hope for lifting people out of poverty and restoring 
their dignity 
voting no on the bill were sens jesse helms rnc gordon 
humphrey rnh and william proxmire dwis not voting were 
sens joseph r biden jr ddel dave durenberger rminn chic 
hecht rnev and james a mcclure ridaho 
a bipartisan group of senators negotiated with white house 
officials throughout the week following word last friday that 
reagan would veto the moynihan bill as it stood 
the main obstacle as the bill neared passage late thursday was a 
white house demand that some welfare recipients be required to 
participate for 16 hours a week in workfare or community work 
projects to work off their grants 
governors of both parties opposed the provision to phase in 
mandatory workfare participation by one adult in each twoparent 
welfare household but dole offered it as a floor amendment and the 
senate passed it by voice vote after refusing 5441 to kill it 
moynihan said the provision would affect only 6 percent to 7 
percent of the welfare caseload 
only nine states have statewide mandatory workfare programs 
some governors said it would be expensive cumbersome and 
unnecessary in their states moynihan said workfare is pointless 
for people who need retraining rather than work experience and in 
areas where the labor market is strong 
senators agreed to other white house requests as well including 
a requirement that state job and training programs include 22 
percent of eligible participants by 1994 
the agreement added about 200 million to the fiveyear cost of 
the bill bringing it up to 28 billion the house already has 
passed a more generous 7 billion welfare plan 
negotiators for each chamber will reconcile differences in the 
two bills before a plan is sent to the white house whether reagan 
supports the final measure depends largely on the extent to which 
house members are willing to go along with the senate product 
aid to families with dependent children established in 1935 as 
part of the social security system currently supports 37 million 
families which include some 7 million children 
originally conceived as a widows benefit when women 
especially mothers did not work outside the home the program now 
is dominated by divorced and unwed mothers at a time when the 
majority of new mothers are at work within a year of having a child 
the centerpiece of the house and senate bills is a new jobs 
program under which states would have to offer a wide range of 
activities including job training and basic education as well as 
actual work they would have to include as many people as they 
could afford and half the money would have to be spent on people 
needing the most help 
a 1987 study of current welfaretowork programs found that they 
did not have nearly enough money that they offered limited and 
superficial services they lacked essential support services such 
as child care put too much emphasis on job placement rates 
funneled people into lowpaying jobs that didnt get them entirely 
off welfare excluded mothers of children under 6 and tended to 
help people who really didnt need it while ignoring tough cases 
the house and senate bills attempt to correct most of these 
deficiencies each envisions a substantial federal financial 
commitment to the jobs program and describes or mandates activities 
to be offered they improve child care benefits and guarantee child 
care for people in the program mothers with children under 3 would 
be exempt from the worktraining requirement and states could 
lower that to age 1 
both bills also require states to extend welfare benefits to 
poor twoparent families the senate bill only would require the 
benefits for six months in any 12month period 26 states already 
provide yearround coverage 
a major difference in the two bills is that the house offers 
extra federal money to states that raise benefits to needy 
families which in many cases have incomes well below half the 
federal poverty line 
money to cover additional spending under the moynihan bill would 
come from making permanent a tax refund withholding program to 
recover federal debts and eliminating the business food and 
entertainment tax deduction for people with incomes over 440000 
the senate approved the meals and entertainment provision 
thursday in place of a provision phasing out the dependent care tax 
credit for higherincome families 
sen bill bradley dnj sponsor of the substitute said the 
original plan would have constituted a tax on child care and added 
im against punishing women for their professional success 
the moynihan bill attracted opposition not only from 
conservatives seeking tighter work requirements but from mothers 
who said they should not be forced to work at all a group called 
wages for housework complained that the measure was designed to 
get women off the welfare rolls not out of poverty and denigrates 
the work of all mothers

philadelphia the leading presidential candidates must address 
black americans concerns or face losing the support of a sizable 
number of people the head of the national conference of black 
mayors said thursday 
those folks who want to go into office gov michael 
dukakis and george bush and dont take those populations that we 
represent seriously then we will not take them seriously said 
john h smith mayor of prichard ala 
whatever it takes for us to send that signal to them by not 
voting for them or voting for folks who share our views well do 
that smith said 
republican bush democrat dukakis and democrat jesse jackson 
were invited to attend the conference but only jackson has 
confirmed that he will speak saturday smith said 
we want to caution those folks who tend to ignore these 
meetings and who are running for various offices who dont spend 
time discussing our agenda said smith a republican 
if they dont show up here we have decided at this conference 
to organize our populations and say to those folks who are 
running for office what we want to do said smith joined at a 
news conference by philadelphia mayor w wilson goode and about 20 
of the 200 mayors attending the fourday conference 
smith said he doubts jackson will be selected as dukakis 
running mate because of the further continuation of the attitude 
of the democratic party in its liberal traditions of looking at 
black folks simply as appendages as followers rather than 
leaders 
goode a jackson supporter said dukakis and jackson should sit 
down and resolve the issue 
hes earned the right to be considered goode said hes 
earned the right to be respected as one of the leading leaders of 
our party 
if hes not granted that respect then i think theres going 
to some very difficult times in front of us as a party 
goode vice chairman of pennsylvanias delegation to the 
democratic convention in atlanta criticized party rules that force 
him to go as a dukakis delegate 
goode said he plans to vote for jackson on the first ballot 
even though rules require him to vote for dukakis 
as far as i know slavery ended a long time ago he said 
i will do it 
economic racial and health problems have emerged as other major 
concerns of those attending the 14th annual convention which runs 
through saturday

a french woman said she was mistaken when 
she thought her grandson was the unidentified hearingimpaired boy 
found last year wandering the streets of juarez mexico 
camille muller thought photos of the boy strongly resembled her 
grandson philippe muller but the 13yearold boy was located 
thursday in el paso an fbi spokeswoman said 
mrs muller said thursday night in paris that she had just 
spoken by telephone with her son who told her that he her 
daughterinlaw and her four grandchildren were in good health 
since january 1987 she had not heard from her son who runs a 
restaurant called jj de paris in el paso

son mrs muller said for all that the mystery of this child 
is not solved i am delighted for me and i am very upset for this 
child

been very ill and possibly had died she speculated that the family 
could have been on their way to mexico city at the time of the 
plane crash 
mrs mullers daughterinlaw marguerite muller said 
i saw the news last night and they were talking about it and 
my daughter pearl and i were laughing and saying it sounds like

believe it could be her she showed a picture and it didnt look 
much like filipito 
knowing her it sounds like something she would do i cant 
get over it but being so far away from her son and not knowing 
his whereabouts i can see where she would jump on this

iraqi valley it is just over four miles from the iraqiran border 
and about 25 miles northeast of sulimaniyah iraqs largest 
northern city and the provincial capital of the kurdish region 
the iranians captured the peak and the adjacent town of mawet in 
fierce fighting last summer

agency monitored in nicosia said the air force flew 221 combat 
missions on thursday with all aircraft returning safely ina said 
helicopter gunships completed 115 of the missions 
heavy use of helicopter gunships is usually an indication that 
iraq is trying to counter ground assaults by iran the iraqi

the family farm in europe must remain viable and 
subsidies cannot be rolled back overnight chancellor helmut kohl 
of west germany told the canadian parliament on thursday 
kohl the first west german head of government to address 
canadas legislature acknowledged criticism of europes common 
agricultural policy and the 300 billion global farmsubsidy war 
he said he opposed permanent subsidies in principle but added 
when developments have taken a long course over 20 years you 
cannot remedy the situation overnight the family farm must 
remain viable in europes future 
the united states has proposed phasing out agricultural 
subsidies by the year 2000 and canadian officials had hoped for a 
compromise at the sevennation economic summit which starts sunday 
in toronto 
prime minister brian mulroney said in welcoming kohl that summit 
nations must come to grips with the acute problem 
but the 12nation european community has been reluctant to 
dismantle subsidies to small farmers because of the political 
outcry that would follow 
in a wideranging 55minute address kohl likened the new 
uscanada free trade agreement to european community plans to 
create a unified market for goods by 1992 
that uniform market of 320 million consumers will remain 
accessible to other countries kohl said and he counted on canada 
to ensure the same will be true of north america under free trade 
we trust the assurances of our canadian friends that european 
companies too will be able to use the new opportunities to 
increase trade 
the uscanada treaty due to take effect jan 1 if ratified 
would eliminate all tariffs over a 10year period and dismantle 
other barriers 
kohl arrived wednesday night for his first official visit to 
canada prior to the economic summit japanese prime minister 
noboru takeshita arrived in vancouver on thursday to tour the west 
coast province 
kohl said his governments central goal is to overcome the 
division of germany and the rest of europe to make the frontiers 
more permeable to reunite separated families facilitate human 
contact and develop a lasting and equitable peaceful border 
he thanked canada for stationing 7000 troops among nato forces 
in his country and said allied solidarity had contributed to recent 
arms control breakthroughs by the superpowers 
he said the warsaw pacts superiority in conventional weapons 
and capacity for surprise attack are now the basic problem in 
european security 
eliminating these capabilities must be the objective of future 
negotiations which he hoped would begin this year kohl said 
the chancellor concluded by recalling the aid his country 
received after world war ii we were halfstarved i felt at that 
time what it means for a country to receive help and we havent 
forgotten that 
he said it was a moral duty to extend similar aid now to the 
third world declaring im one of those who believe that in the 
first quarter of the 21st century the hazards and challenges of 
the northsouth conflict industrialized nations and developing 
nations will overshadow eastwest problems

a billboard advertising campaign for 
porcelana fade cream that features lightskinned black women as 
faded beauties shows a lack of sensitivity toward minorities 
blacks said thursday 
i saw the billboards and i couldnt believe this thing was 
coming back again said sharmain turner chief of staff for state 
sen roxanne jones of philadelphia i was definitely offended by 
it 
the porcelana billboards show the product name a closeup 
photograph of two lightskinned black women and the words faded 
beauties of philadelphia one billboard before it was covered by 
a new advertisement was embellished with graffiti that changed 
faded beauties to read faded pride and the words stop 
racist advertising were written across it 
fade creams are frequently advertised in blackoriented 
magazines for correcting uneven skin tones or diminishing scars and 
blemishes but critics say the billboards imply lighter is better 
officials for the los angelesbased dep corp which makes and 
distributes porcelana declined to comment on thursday 
porcelana might not have meant to promote the cream as an 
overall skin lightener but the possibility is the crux of the 
problem said paul bennett executive editor of the philadelphia 
tribune a triweekly that is one of the oldest blackowned papers 
in the united states 
i dont know if its out and out blatant racism that makes for 
these kind of decisions but there seems to be a certain lack of 
sensitivity that is born of out of some form of racist attitude 
bennett said 
the issue is not so much that particular billboard bennett 
said the issue is the treatment of black folks in advertising 
across the board 
a penn state researcher who has studied the effects of 
minoritytargeted advertising said 
the controversy might be an example of a company misjudging the 
message it sends to consumers said jerome williams a marketing 
professor at penn state who has studied the effects of 
minoritytargeted advertising 
even if they didnt mean to offend what you have to be 
concerned with is the decoded message what did it mean to the 
consumer williams said 
if that decoded message is leading to a negative perception 
regardless of the intent of the advertiser they should change the 
advertisement 
in an atmosphere of increased minority pride and activism 
advertisers can find themselves in trouble if they fail to consider 
the sensitivity of their target group he said 
black consumers wield well more than 200 billion of purchasing 
power while hispanic consumers have more than 100 billion 
williams said 
i think youre going to find more and more consumers who are 
going to use that purchasing power to reward those advertisers who 
are sensitive to their issues williams said 
advertisers who aggravate minority consumers may find that 
consumers not only avoid a product but may actively campaign 
against it williams said

the us ambassador condemned as vile and 
horrendous thursday the rebel killings of an us agricultural 
adviser and his peruvian colleague and another us official said 
such workers may be withdrawn from danger areas 
constantine gregory and gustavo rojas were men who dedicated 
their lives to helping peruvian campesinos peasants ambassador 
alexander watson said in referring to the attack monday on an 
isolated road near huancayo 125 miles east of lima 
officials said gregory 25 of los angeles and rojas 27 were 
shot by leftist shining path guerrillas in a highland insurgency 
zone near aramachay a mountain hamlet 15 miles north of huancayo 
the words this is the way the lackeys of yankee imperialism 
die and a hammer and sickle were scrawled in red ink in gregorys 
notebook according to reporters at the scene 
the shining path an 8yearold maoist insurgency has 
frequently assassinated development workers in perus impoverished 
highlands in an effort to spawn economic chaos 
the victims were working on a project funded by the us agency 
for international development which spends more than 50 million 
yearly in peru on farm health and food relief programs agency

high noise levels from bagpipes can knock a 
scotsmans hearing out of kilter and even cause permanent hearing 
loss a neurologist and amateur bagpiper said thursday 
dr stephen m brittain of rutland vt and audiologist robert 
w hartenstein measured noise levels produced by the bagpipes and 
reported their findings in a letter in the june issue of the 
archives of otolaryngologyhead and neck surgery 
indoor and outdoor levels at the players left ear reached up to 
105 decibels they wrote 
noting that federal noise exposure maximums are 105 decibels for 
one hour and 115 decibels for 15 minutes they said it would be 
fairly easy for pipers to meet or exceed these limits with 
steady dedicated practice 
good quality foam ear plugs can sharply cut noise levels they 
said 
brittain who said he had been playing the pipes about three 
years became concerned when he found playing the pipes was almost 
a painful experience at first 
he said he started wearing earplugs but believes few pipers are 
aware of the risks of permanent hearing loss and few probably wear 
ear protection 
he said the ear protection he wears reduces the sound level 
about 25 decibels and does not interfere with hearing and 
evaluating his own playing

a senate panel voted thursday to slash 
spending for the space station to 200 million a move officials 
said will strangle the program unless the appropriation is 
increased dramatically 
the reagan administration had requested 967 million for the 
space station in the next fiscal year which begins oct 1 
officials say at least 900 million is needed to keep the space 
station on schedule for a completion in the late 1990s 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said 200 million provides only 
enough for the slow strangulation of the space station and that 
president reagans personal intervention will be needed to rescue 
the program 
sen phil gramm rtexas said he would ask reagan to veto the 
spending bill that includes funds for the national aeronautics and 
space administration if not enough money is set aside to sustain 
the space station 
the nasa money is part of a spending bill that also includes 
funds for the veterans administration the department of housing 
and urban development and other agencies 
i am hopeful that we may yet in the senate do something to 
correct this situation but it is an uphill battle gramm said 
gramm called the senate action as well as the house version of 
the space station bill earlier this week totally irresponsible 
in this election year congress is clearly looking at the next 
election and not the next generation gramm said 
the senate committees space station bill calls on the next 
administration to review the project in january and if the new 
president wants it to continue he would have to ask congress for 
additional funds nasa has estimated the project could cost more 
than 20 billion to complete 
in the house version the appropriations committee voted this 
week to spend 387 million on research and development on the space 
station another 654 million would be held in an account and 
should the next president decide not to continue with the program 
those funds would be used to shut down the program 
additionally 450 million would be held through april 15 if 
the president decides to continue with the program the money would 
go to the space station if not 150 million would be transferred 
to space flight control and data communications at nasa and the 
remaining 300 million would be rescinded 
the house approach to fence part of money and wait to see if 
new president wants to have a viable space program is passing the 
buck to say the least gramm said 
our problem clearly is that there are other programs with 
large numbers of constitutents more appealing politically than 
programs such as space and science and weve been seeing this over 
and over for the last three years gramm said 
rep tom delay rtexas said construction of the space station 
could begin next year if it stays on schedule the space station is 
planned to be in orbit around earth and occupied by astronauts by 
the end of 1996

the defense ministry said thursday 
that rebels attacked a military unit in violation of a ceasefire 
and kidnapped six civilians 
a ministry statement said two soldiers were killed and three 
wounded when rebels ambushed three sandinista army trucks in 
northern jinotega province wednesday 
it said six civilians were kidnapped in various parts of the 
country 
the ussupported rebels known as contras and the leftist 
sandinista government agreed to suspend offensive military 
operations on march 21 when talks began which led to an agreement 
to seek a definitive ceasefire in the civil war the two sides 
have made little progress since then 
the contras have accused the sandinistas of violating the truce 
defense minister humberto ortega accused the rebels of 
flagrant violations of the ceasefire in a letter sent thursday 
to joao baena soares secretarygeneral of the organization of 
american states and roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo 
the archbishop of managua 
soares and obando y bravo served as witnesses to the 
sandinistacontra peace talks and are responsible for verifying the 
ceasefire accords 
ortega brother of president daniel ortega and head of the 
government negotiating team also noted that contra leaders were 
seeking renewed military aid from the united states in violation of 
the agreements 
in washington alfredo cesar a member of the contra 
directorate told reporters thursday the reagan administration 
agreed to seek a new aid package for the rebels who have been 
fighting the sandinistas for six years 
ortega asked soares and obando y bravo to investigate the 
civilian kidnappings the government claims the contras have 
kidnapped more than 1000 nicaraguans the rebels have acknowledged 
holding 66 
ortega also criticized a rebel proposal to include president 
oscar arias of costa rica in future peace talks 
arias received the nobel peace prize last year for being the 
author of a regional peace plan signed by five central american

police detained five hungarian 
dissidents thursday on charges they chanted antigovernment slogans 
and incited a crowd in rallies marking the execution of leaders of 
the 1956 antisoviet revolt 
witnesses said the five all known as leading dissidents in 
budapest gathered in a downtown square and chanted democracy 
and nagy after a peaceful morning vigil at the unmarked graves 
where imre nagy a leader of the 1956 revolt and associates are 
believed buried 
the ceremonies marked 30 years since the official media 
published a ministry of justice decree on june 17 1958 announcing 
the four were sentenced to death for having played a leading role 
in the preparation and starting of the counterrevolutionary 
uprising in october 1956 
calls for nagys rehabilitation and that of some of his 
associates have become increasingly frequent 
the 1956 revolt began oct 23 with mass demonstrations for a new 
government and demands that soviet troops leave hungary but 
200000 soviet troops and 2500 tanks struck budapest nov 4 to 
quell the uprising 
the official mti news agency said in a terse report that a 
group of persons who had been active in the 1956 events gathered 
in budapest despite a police warning 
the report said the men then tried to bring under their 
influence a crowd of about 350 to 400 persons whom they had 
mobilized 
police took the necessary steps to ensure public order in the 
course of this sandor racz gabor demszky roza hodosan jenoe 
nagy and peter egetoe were taken to the police station the 
report said 
witnesses said a group of about 20 or 30 people laid flowers in 
midafternoon at the eternal flame to a hungarian premier executed 
in the abortive 1848 revolution against austria and stepped back 
into a crowd of about 400 people who had gathered 
about 150 police guarded the square and conducted frequent 
identity checks the witnesses said one witness said police 
charged onlookers who tried to approach the flame 
after a halfhour the crowd moved towards the danube river and 
then on to the nearby hungarian television station the witnesses 
said there dissident janos kiss addressed the crowd but a witness 
said the speech was drowned out by crowd chants of avo to the 
waiting police 
the avo was the dreaded secret police in the 1950s 
the witness said riot police then moved in to break the crowd 
it was not immediately clear if anybody was injured 
a reporter for austrian radio said thursdays vigil at what is 
believed to be nagys unmarked grave drew at least 250 people 
the area was scattered with crosses candles flowers and small 
hungarian flags a list of names of those executed after the 1956 
uprising was read and an unidentified speaker called for their 
rehabilitation and proper graves for them a witness said 
rehabilitation would likely require approval not only from the 
hunagrian communist party but also from moscow which is thought to 
have played a key role in ordering nagys execution 
there was no official hungarian report on either of thursdays 
events which were announced last week by a 37member committee 
calling itself let justice prevail and including nagys 
daughter erzsebet

federal officials said thursday they are 
denying parole to about 970 imprisoned cubans each of whom will be 
notified individually of the decision by the immigration and 
naturalization service 
ins spokesman duke austin said that while more than 1500 
detainees have been released since cubans rioted at two federal 
prisons last november these are the first notices of denied parole 
to be issued 
detainees may appeal the denial of parole to a review panel at 
the justice department he said 
detainees being denied parole are being notified by 
administrators at the federal institutions where they are 
incarcerated and each prison is using its own judgment on whether 
to take special security precautions austin said 
the detainees were among 125000 cubans sent to florida in the 
1980 freedom flotilla boatlift from the cuban port of mariel 
most committed crimes following their arrival in the united states 
served their sentences and were held by the ins for deportation to 
cuba which refused to accept them 
federal prisons in oakdale la and atlanta erupted in riots 
last november after the state department announced that cuba had 
agreed to take back about 2500 refugees considered undesirable by 
this country 
the rioting involved the taking of 138 prison employee hostages 
and the death of one detainee the government estimated the 1394 
inmates at atlanta and 987 at oakdale destroyed 644 million in 
prison property and that it cost 489 million to quiet the 
disturbances and relocate the cubans 
a justice department report on the riots concluded that the 
state department gave too little notice of the deportation 
agreement and prison employees failed to report early signs of 
trouble

the day reports came out that an british multinational bank not 
identified had made a 5million bid for the cafe that first 
opened its doors in 1888 
although it was before noon the gijon was already thick with 
cigar and cigarette smoke and most of its marbletop tables were 
filled 
the gijon stands just off madrids trafficclogged main 
thoroughfare the paseo de la castellana as a reminder of quieter 
days when cafes stretched across the city and coffee time was a 
ritual 
although its glory days are past and madrid is much busier in an 
economic boom the gijon still attracts dozens of tertulias 
groups of intellectuals artists or retirees who meet once or twice 
a week for relaxed conversation with a cigar over coffee and brandy 
lopez de brito said accepting the unidentified british banks 
offer would have broken a pledge made to his grandmother 
encarnation fernandez who bought the cafe from its original owners 
in 1913 
before my grandmother died she made my father and my aunt 
promise not to sell as long as my aunt is alive we wouldnt even 
consider it said lopez de brito who owns the cafe with his four 
cousins 
after that who knows he said the younger generation all 
have professional careers they want their free time the cafe 
doesnt allow that 
grandmother encarnacion and her daughter lopezs aunt maria 
presided over the gijon in the years after the 193639 spanish 
civil war when struggling actors and writers were drawn to cafes 
because of their central heating and cheap admission the price of 
a tiny cup of coffee 
by the time grateful artists showered encarnacion with drawings 
and verse on her 100th birthday in 1968 most of them were eating 
better and the gijon was a grand old survivor its fame cemented 
by the gradual demise of most competitors 
the majority of the cafes were converted into bank branches 
and the literary people took refuge here because there werent many 
places left said marias son jose garcia lopez who began 
working at the gijon in 1950 
the coffee hour was a bit sacred he said people would 
talk about their projects about bullfights they generally avoided 
politics during francos 36year rule 
pilar g nombrela who has lived above the cafe for 20 years 
said the gijon in the late 1960s was a classic cafe 
people would spend three hours over a cup of coffee and talk 
about art and literature there were tables and tables of famous 
people it was incredible 
today the tertulias are fewer at nights the cafe is 
filled with young spaniards who prefer gintonics to brandy an 
armed guard stands inside the door to keep out heroin addicts who 
have occasionally robbed patrons at knife point 
gentifrication has set in the neighborhood around the cafe and 
real estate values have shot up like the skyscrapers along the 
castellana as the spanish economy marks an annual 52 percent 
growth rate 
the cafe has changed a lot just like the country has 
changed the 63yearold garcia lopez said in those days 
there were 20 cars circulating in madrid horsedrawn carriages 
were used a lot people worked less and had more time 
madrid was a city of cafes he said one writer called it 
an archipelago of tertulias 
luis martin an octogenarian who has met at the gijon to chat 
with fellow standard electric retirees for the last two decades 
does not miss those times 
the bureacrats used to spend all day in the cafes martin 
said a few minutes before initiating a debate on the merits of 
legalizing hard drugs 
when they finally got to the office all they did was talk 
about what they had done in the cafe

the synthesizer sounds just like an 
accordion as the band swings into a traditional polka rhythm young 
women on stage swirl and stomp in step to the music singing along 
in polish 
but the women are in miniskirts the lead singer wears a leather 
jacket and the song they sing is not exactly standard polka 
i went out friday night with you know who that babcid with 
the size 12 bowling shoe she feeds me kielbasa and makes me drink 
that wine and then she likes to dance that love polka number 
nine 
irreverent you bet 
offensive not to the people on the crowded dance floor bopping 
to the beat of the polish muslims as they do their version of the 
1959 clovers hit love potion no 9 
for six years the group has tried to break into the big time 
while building a following as one of the detroit areas most 
popular bar bands they like to blend standards chiefly the dance 
tunes that put motown on the map with parodies celebrating life 
among poles but at the same time they retain the music and spirit 
of the songs 
respect nowhere to run rescue me come see about 
me and doo wah diddy sound like live versions of the 
originals 
its all for fun said dave uchalik the eightmember bands 
33yearold lead singer we want to come across as a cross 
between poison and frankie yankovich 
not so says guitarist ken kondrat were like weird al 
yankovic with talent 
the polish muslims version of the 1963 beach boys hit 
surfing usa is bowling usa the lyrics revised to 
laud the popular sport mention the twostory alley that served as 
an inadvertent backdrop to pope john paul iis outdoor service here 
last fall 
if everybody had a bowling ball across the usa then 
everybodyd be bowling like at playdium lanes theyd all be 
bringing their rosin bags and their numbered shoes 
they shuffle lyrics to make room for polish phrases and 
references to pirogi kielbasa bowling the catholic church a 
little bit of everything princes lets go crazy became 
lets golambki a tribute to stuffed cabbage rolls 
where an original hit climaxes with a wailing guitar solo the 
band will insert a riff from peanut polka or some other polka 
classic 
our humor doesnt go over anyones head we try to stare right 
about eyelevel nothing too subtle or forget it said kondrat 
30 who like six others in the band is a catholic of polish descent 
in honor of the polish pontiff the beatles obladi 
oblada was rewritten as john paul two john paul one and 
ricky nelsons travelin man became travelin pope 
their blend of rock and polka puts the polish muslims into a 
tiny musical subset according to california record producer ron 
goudie 
the polish muslims are one of eight bands in north america 
that is playing rock polka or punk polka said goudie who sought 
out the bands for polka is now a sampler lp to be released 
oct 7 by restless records 
goudie identified the genres leading group as brave combo 
which works out of denton texas and treats polka rock much more 
seriously than do the muslims 
san francisco has the 20piece polka side los angeles a group 
called rotondi minneapolis boasts the wallets milwaukee the 
black holes edmonton alberta the romaniacs and new york is home 
to the allfemale polka punk band das furlines whose leader goes 
by the name deb onair 
all these bands play for rock audiences goudie said they 
do rock clubs and punk clubs and weirdo gigs 
the most successful bands create original music layered on a 
polka base goudie said 
the muslims bowling usa is a godhead but as cool as 
those little covers are they cant make money off them he said 
they need original material 
the problem he said is that the original composer collects the 
profits when a parody becomes a hit of course thats if the music 
publisher gives permission for the parody in the first place 
bowling usa to the tune of surfin usa which 
itself was to the tune of sweet little sixteen got the 
thumbsdown from chuck berrys publishing company and michael 
jackson who owns the rights to dance to the music wouldnt 
let the muslims record dance to the polka uchalik said 
they got away with recording love polka number nine only 
because the publishing house failed to answer two letters he said 
that record was a selfproduced selfdistributed single 
it was followed up by a yuletide rock opera in which the 
gloria chorus of angels we have heard on high got a heavy bass 
line and the word yelled out letter by letter gloria 
gloria 
for goudies compilation the group wrote an original song 
thats why god invented the polka 
it will be their first national exposure 
but if the record doesnt catch on the muslims will still be 
packing them in at paychecks lounge 
there are a lot of real good bands around town that you go to 
see and you know theyre not making gas money drummer mike 
miller said we havent had problems booking anywhere knock on

the little girl is so delighted she cries out 
periodically to nobody in particular im walkin with a cane 
in frederick wisemans documentary deaf and blind viewers 
go right along with the girl on her first lesson with the cane as 
her teacher helps her negotiate stairways identify corridors and 
search out the cause of a mysterious noise a water fountain 
the fourpart series begins tonight on pbs with the first 
twohour installment blind 
wiseman is probably bestknown for his 1967 documentary on the 
state prison for the criminally insane in bridgewater mass unlike 
that groundbreaking film deaf and blind is no expose it is 
set at the alabama institute for the deaf and blind in talladega a 
leading educator of the handicapped 
wisemans cinemaverite style provides an upclose look at what 
life is like for students and teachers at the institute it would 
be difficult for anyone who sees the film to look at a deaf blind 
or multihandicapped person the same way again 
deaf and blind airs in four parts each about two hours 
long blind tonight deaf on saturday 
multihandicapped on june 24 and adjustment and work june 
25 
wiseman has made 20 films about american institutions including 
the army a police department belmont racetrack and the 
neimanmarcus department store he is fascinated by the intricacies 
of institutions and he turns the camera operated by john davey 
on classrooms field trips counseling sessions and staff meetings 
at the alabama school 
there is no narration and little editing and the subjects of 
the filming seem unaffected by the cameras presence with little 
interruption and no outside explanation the films can get tedious 
but as wiseman says in his production notes by placing an 
audience in the midst of the enormous complexities of this other 
world of the disabled the films attempt to convey some of the 
feeling experiences and attitudes of blind and deaf people toward 
their lives 
in the opening of blind wisemans camera follows the 
schools blind band to an appearance at a local stockcar race 
this segment of the documentary is a profound little film in 
itself wiseman captures the sights and sounds of the racetrack and 
intersperses them with highly detailed images of the young people 
in their band uniforms gingerly feeling their way out of the 
schoolbus gathering in a little group in the infield while 
highperformance race cars whiz by on the track 
at the institute wiseman starts with the youngest children 
first on the playground an elementary school girl goes down a 
slide without comment wiseman captures her courage feet dangling 
for a beat before she lets go confidently sliding off into the 
unknown 
in another segment concerned teachers confer about a difficult 
student here as often in the films wiseman conveys a sense of 
community and caring among the teachers and administrators of the 
school 
the films also reveal that many of the problems handicapped 
youngsters have are no different from anyone elses in deaf 
for instance a students mother has made the long drive to 
talladega from mobile to meet with a counselor concerned about her 
sons displays of anger after a long discussion the son finally 
reveals he is frustrated at not seeing his estranged father 
he does not love you his mother tells him with the help of 
rudimentary sign language the boy looks at the floor she tries to 
reassure him that his stepfather does love him and he eventually 
hugs her and promises to try to behave better 
in another segment young deaf students on a field trip to a 
jail are startled when a man in a cell begins signing to them they 
sign among themselves then begin signing back to the man it is 
times like these when narration would be helpful because viewers 
without sign language skills are shut out of the silent 
conversation but then that itself is an educational turning of the 
tables

the president of the alabama institute 
for deaf and blind hopes a fourpart documentary by filmmaker 
frederick wiseman will inspire change to benefit the handicapped 
everywhere 
i think it will sensitize many americans to the uniqueness of 
the disabled the frustrations and challenges of the deaf and 
blind said jack hawkins president of the institute 
over the longer term he said the film may make a major 
contribution in the professional perception of those who choose to 
work in these fields 
the series which has been seen only at film festivals and at 
theaters in the new york and boston area reaches a national 
audience for the first time tonight with the opening installment 
blind on public television 
wisemans stark look inside a massachusetts mental hospital two 
decades ago helped transform the care of the nations mentally ill 
this look inside the institute at talladega is part of a series of 
documentaries on american institutions 
when he told a friend he wanted to do a film on the disabled as 
part of that series wiseman explained in a telephone interview he 
was told the alabama institute was one of the best schools in the 
country 
he filmed for about six weeks at the talladega complex which 
was founded in 1858 and has grown into a multipurpose program that 
provides kindergarten through 12thgrade academics competitive 
athletics vocational training as well as special skills training 
for the deaf blind and multihandicapped of all ages 
wiseman said he received complete cooperation from the 
institute and its staff as his camera recorded the anguishing 
difficulties and daily personal heroism of the handicapped and 
their teachers 
i was impressed by the kindness and compassion said wiseman 
in 1967 wisemans film titicut follies reported graphically 
on the degrading living conditions and dehumanizing treatment of 
the mentally ill at a massachusetts state hospital the widely 
acclaimed film helped draw attention to what amounted to a national 
problem as litigation to reform mental health care spread to many 
states including alabama 
wiseman disagees with those who view his work as causeoriented 
filming aiming only to expose one problem or another 
i think that was a bum rap said wiseman i report on the 
experience i had in making the film 
he said titicut follies turned out to be quite extreme 
in contrast he said the experience at the alabama institute was 
good 
i report on what i find he said 
hawkins said he was not aware of the controversial nature of 
titicut follies when he opened the doors of the alabama 
institute to wiseman but even after learning about the filmmakers 
previous work he said we felt comfortable that our program 
could withstand his scrutiny 
hawkins said wiseman and his crew seemed to become part of the 
normal environment they were the most unassuming unintrusive 
and unimposing people ive ever seen he said 
wiseman recorded the human drama and the boredom of life 
itself hawkins said he did a great job of capturing what 
deafness and blindness are all about we just happened to be the 
vehicle for him to use

cable tv has laudably provided a muchneeded 
outlet for talented comedy writers who would otherwise have to wait 
for a rare network television job or big movie deal to get their 
work before much of the public 
but in doing so cable has also created a new genre comedy you 
wouldnt actually pay money for but dont mind watching when 
theres absolutely nothing else on 
two samples of the mediocre are available this month on cinemax 
and showtime 
on tuesday night cinemax has cinemax comedy experiment teri 
garr in flapjack floozie it also airs june 23 26 and 29 
on wednesday three upandcoming comedians do their standup 
routines on showtimes funnymen triple clowns of comedy with 
pat morita as host it can also be seen june 26 28 and july 1 and 
7 
the three work an easy room a goodnatured suburban crowd in 
the civic theatre in hermosa beach calif at one point they are so 
moved by the material they give a standing ovation to the closing 
act mark mccollum 
mccollum who bounds onstage with his guitar is a facile 
musician and impressionist who almost achieves a robin williams 
level of insanity but ends up playing it safe with tired material 
doing pee wee herman and elmer fudd impressions and setting amusing 
lyrics to wellknown tunes fever becomes an ode to leave it 
to beaver his oneman impersonation of the who in concert is 
rather impressive though 
andy bumatai a hawaiian also relies on triedandtrue material 
ethnic jokes he says he is enjoying california its fun being 
mexican i cant wait to get to the east coast i understand 
there ill be puerto rican 
larry miller a robert kleinlike comic who has appeared on 
the tonight show suffers from slow timing but his epic joke 
about the five levels of drinking six if you live in a trailer 
park is worth the wait for instance by level four he says 
youre saying to yourself as long as im only going to get a few 
hours of sleep i might as well stay up all night its good for 
me i dont mind going to that board meeting looking like keith 
richards 
between acts morita offers excruciatingly long lame jokes that 
show why he is a successful actor not a comedian 
flapjack floozie on cinemax is a confusing hodgepodge of 
takeoffs spoofing the obscure musical melodrama genre as well as 
the more contemporary spate of celebrity addiction confessions it 
was cowritten and directed by former saturday night live 
contributor tom schiller who once wrote a short for snl called 
java junkie 
the cinemax film is an snl sketch stretched beyond its 
limits to be fair these comedy experiments are very 
lowbudget and you apparently get what you pay for 
garr one of the best comedic actresses around is no match for 
the silly material she plays helen eagles a singer who grew up in 
vaudeville and somehow got hooked on pancakes as a result 
a few months ago garr was saying that she and schiller were 
working up a comedy short about a woman addicted to sugar 
apparently they decided pancakes were funnier they were wrong 
flapjacks take over helens life after she falls for a gangster 
played by peter aykroyd brother of dan who opens the club 
copacapancake as a showcase for helen 
after he is gunned down by a rival mobster helen buries herself 
in shortstacks until she is committed to the ihop international 
house of psychiatry where a sympathetic doctor john standing 
attempts to cure her 
eventually shes released into the custody of her childhood 
nanny margie evans who has become aunt jemima but on the plane 
on the way to her comeback in hollywood helen succumbs to her 
lingering addiction and suffers disfigurement in a bizarre pancake 
accident 
flapjack floozie also stars laraine newman marshall efron 
and toni basil and was filmed at the variety arts center an old 
vaudeville theater in los angeles the theater has surely seen 
better

the bull market of 198287 brought lush growth 
to the mutual fund industry creating many new exotic varieties of 
funds 
now say some critical observers it may be time for some 
weeding out 
it was only natural that fund managers would respond to an 
investment boom by trying to offer eyecatching new products but 
in so doing many observers say they created a lot of confusion 
about what funds ought to do and are capable of doing 
both managers and investors strayed from the basics on which the 
concept of a mutual fund is founded investment for the long term 
in a diversified portfolio 
and even some of the new ideas that looked most sensible and 
appealing on paper turned out to be illconceived 
in the current issue of his united amp babson investment report 
veteran financial adviser david sargent reports that he recently 
participated in an industry panel discussion on the subject 
where have all the customers gone 
my answer was twofold he said first whenever the market 
takes a tumble as it did last fall the customers always vanish 
but eventually they come back 
second and more important mutual fund buyers have been sold 
on promises that cant be met performance is the name of the game 
these days and a performance so short term that it is invariably 
illusory 
good investors are lucky enough if they can stay even with the 
market but the fund industry in its offerings leads to the belief 
that the market can be beaten whether in performance or in income 
or both 
thus investors tend to be sold the fund whose recent 
performance is outstanding rather than the one which has 
temporarily lagged they end up buying high and selling low 
the industry again in the name of performance encourages 
people to try all sorts of investment gimmickry options 
financial futures junk bonds sector funds asset allocation 
schemes and the like in an attempt to beat the market 
such funds are tough to win with unless one has the investment 
skills of a houdini most of us do not 
as a case in point of an inventive idea gone wrong the san 
francisco brokerage firm of sutro inc cited the group known as 
optionincome funds 
in theory there were good results to be had in putting together 
a portfolio of investments and enhancing the income on the 
investments by selling options on them 
but in 10 years of actual practice in a wide variety of market 
environments a composite of five optionincome funds has 
consistently lagged far behind standard amp poors 500stock 
composite index sutro analysts note 
the totalreturn performance which after all is where it 
has to pay off sooner or later has never lived up to its early 
promise said sutros robert mciver 
in our opinion the concept has been given more than enough 
time to work and its time to admit that the big mutual fund 
format is incompatible with the optimum performance of an option 
income strategy 
in sargents view the funds would be better off we all would 
be if investors were simply encouraged to buy diversified common 
stock funds with only enough bonds to sweeten the current return 
where necessary 
then they could ride gradually but almost surely to success in 
the stock market and have lots left over to leave to their 
grandchildren

silver and turquoise jewelry adorn 
allyssas tiny hands and indian images hang in the small house 
across from a shopping mall far from the red stone and open sky of 
her arizona reservation 
one of the rings is a gift from a navajo elder at a recent 
powwow that 11monthold allyssa visited with rick and cheryl 
pitts who have been trying to adopt her since her birth 
the custody case has split the navajo nation many in the tribe 
sympathized but others vilified the pittses and allyssas navajo 
mother patricia keetso who moved in with the couple when she was 
pregnant and still lives with them 
a tribal court granted the pittses temporary custody of allyssa 
in april and is considering whether to grant permanent 
guardianship a 1978 federal law gives tribal courts jurisdiction 
in adoption cases of indian children as a way of preserving the 
heritage of the tribes 
i believe in the old traditional ways the elder told the 
pittses but seeing you knowing how much you love that baby you 
deserve her 
oblivious of the legal tangle allyssa plays happily a child 
with two mothers and two cultures 
she has been blessed by a navajo medicine man and a pastor of 
the evangelical free church rather than the earthenwalled hogans 
and trailer homes that dot the hot dry reservation wood frame and 
stucco houses line the streets in the pittses busy san jose 
neighborhood 
i think shell have a better understanding of both worlds 
said pitts who with his wife agreed to take allyssa back to the 
reservation frequently as she grows up and to have her learn navajo 
ways 
keetso 21 and unmarried is working as a supermarket cashier 
but has applied to join the air force and says shes eager to start 
a new life the custody fight with her tribe she says has been 
like an explosion in my face 
keetso who has lived away from the reservation most of her life 
under a mormon church education program says tribal officials have 
criticized her but many navajos have been supportive 
she plans to see her daughter regularly and mrs pitts says 
its all right with her if allyssa calls them both mom 
keetso met the pittses through an ad placed by adoption 
attorneys in a navajo newspaper the ad read pregnant were 
willing to help you keetso wrote to the attorneys saying she 
wanted to give her baby to a family that would provide a good home 
and education off the reservation 
about a week later the pittses contacted the same attorneys 
about their desire to adopt a baby after mrs pitts had three 
miscarriages trying to have a second child and then had a 
hysterectomy 
the birth and keetsos immediate release of allyssa to the 
pittses went smoothly until the tribe intervened 
following terms of the 1978 indian child welfare act they 
notified the tribe that the adoption was pending in a nonindian 
california court in february the tribe sought custody 
the pittses feared they might have lost allyssa forever when 
tribal officials took her away to arizona in april the couple had 
given her up at the airport in san jose on orders from a superior 
court judge who ruled indian courts had jurisdiction 
allyssa cried as the officials walked away with her and kept her 
separated from mrs pitts and keetso as they flew to phoenix on the 
same plane from there they expected to fly with allyssa and the 
officials to flagstaff instead the navajos drove off to the 
stark 14millionacre reservation in northeastern arizona leaving 
mrs pitts and keetso frantic about allyssas welfare 
i thought giving up the baby was hard but when the tribe 
intervened that was the hardest especially when they ran off with 
allyssa keetso says they said i brought shame on the navajo 
nation but i am ashamed at how they mistreated her 
when the pittses and keetso next saw allyssa three days later 
they say she was filthy and running a fever childpsychologist 
barry goodfield said she also was reacting in a way that reflected 
stress and fear 
shed always been a happygolucky baby and anybody could 
hold her mrs pitts said after they took her she would only 
allow me to hold her for quite some time 
she added shes pretty much back to normal now and 
goodfield agreed 
anslem roanhorse director of the navajo division of social 
welfare denied allyssa was neglected or mistreated in her stay 
with indian officials 
he said the baby was taken first to a hospital for an evaluation 
and to obtain medication for asthma then was put in the care of an 
experienced foster parent 
we know for a fact that she was not neglected roanhorse 
said 
the pittses owe 13000 in lawyers fees pitts an independent 
building contractor lost more than 10000 in income while 
fighting to keep allyssa several hollywood studios have shown 
interest in the story but no deals have been signed 
in another month or so perhaps by allyssas first birthday on 
july 20 the pittses hope the tribal court will approve their 
permanent guardianship petition 
even then pitts said i dont think the experience we went 
through the emotions it stirred up will ever be over 
well always be reminded of it because were always going to 
campaign against this law as long as its being enforced the way 
it is to help anyone else who falls into this unfortunate 
situation 
the indian child welfare act was part of an effort to stop the 
exodus of thousands of indian children as many as 35 percent of 
some tribes youngsters to nonindian homes after their parents 
rights were terminated by nonindian courts 
welfare agencies using a nonindian set of cultural values 
often found fault with indian childrearing practices or assumed 
life off the reservation would be better 
roanhorse compared indians to endangered species saying their 
future was threatened by the loss of children 
the pittses and keetso dont disagree with the reasons behind 
the indian child welfare act but they criticize the way indian 
officials handled their case 
i believe they were sincere in their concerns about their 
heritage and culture and we share their concerns pitts said 
it was our original arrangement with patricia that shed be 
able to see allyssa all she wants and wed take allyssa out to 
visit patricias family on the reservation he said thats the 
same thing the tribal court said it wanted if the indian welfare 
people had bothered to ask before they went to court theyd have 
spared all of us a lot of pain

us cardinals meet this month to renew debate 
over what to teach catholics about aids but if the struggles of a 
trailblazing religious education director in an affluent chicago 
parish are any indication the debate goes deeper than the 
muchpublicized condom furor aids is shaking ordinary 
parishioners deepest religious convictions and raising a central 
question is the church fundamentally about love or judgment 
</TEXT>

mary ann clemens nurse hospital 
chaplain mother of five and catholic educator once wrote a verse 
about trying to teach her unusual gospel of aids in this affluent 
chicago suburb 
behold 
the empty chairs and 
the quickened pace to run 
away from me who waits to 
reveal love over judgment 
knowledge over ignorance 
healing through reconciliation 
aids ministers embrace an exiled station 
behold the empty chairs 
for six years mrs clemens has been director of religious 
education at our lady of the brook a church set on 11 acres of 
lush lawns and generous parking lots 
to most in northbrook aids is as vague and distant as a foreign 
war on the evening news but in 1986 a friend of mrs clemens 
revealed his homosexuality and began drinking heavily because he 
feared getting aids later she heard from some parents that their 
children were trying alternative lifestyles including 
homosexuality 
mrs clemens came to believe that this conservative sheltered 
parish could no longer ignore the disease 
she spent 16 months writing an aids curriculum expressly for 
catholic parents from fraids to faith let us talk about 
aids told in story form blending gospel with realism about sex 
drugs and aids it was designed to help parents explain the disease 
to their children 
for fourth through sixthgraders for example there is a 
graphic discussion of bodily fluids how aids is and is not spread 
sex and marriage 
suddenly this past school year sleepy suburban northbrook found 
itself an improbable beacon of aids education 
her parish priest sunday school teachers and parents use words 
like pioneer visionary even prophet to describe mrs 
clemens who argues that aids is a cataclysmic ethical and medical 
event that raises centuriesold questions over whether the essence 
of roman catholicism is love or judgment 
despite the outward adulation however her aids gospel has been 
largely ignored she sent her curriculum to about 400 families in 
her parish but only three accepted her offer for discussions 
our homophobia is making us deny that the disease belongs to 
all of us she said 
she got brief national attention when she spoke about her 
curriculum at the national catholic education associations 
convention in new york in april she was subsequently invited to 
address other chicagoarea parishes but attracted only tiny 
audiences 
the problems she and fellow teachers have found within the 
church in some ways as intractable as the hiv virus itself are 
denial and indifference among parishioners and ambiguity and 
division in church policy 
this month she decided to leave her parish post to devote all 
her time to aids missionary work 
the story of what happened when mary ann clemens tried to get 
aids discussed in northbrook tells much about the confusion and 
moral contradictions the disease presents for catholic educators 
everywhere 
aids said mrs clemens echoing the sentiments of many 
church members is creating havoc for the catholic church 
in one sense her parish was fertile ground for trailblazing 
the chicago archdiocese led by cardinal joseph bernardin is 
comparatively liberal last december when us catholic bishops 
issued a landmark statement on aids education that included mention 
of condoms bernardin was a chief proponent 
the statement drew fire from traditionalists led by new york 
cardinal john j oconnor the nations 300 bishops have agreed to 
meet in collegeville minn june 2427 to discuss the issue again 
mrs clemens though often critical of what she considers the 
churchs lack of realism about aids never ran afoul of the 
archdiocese sister anne leonard director of catholic services of 
the chicago archdiocese and others in the hierarchy have praised 
her and her curriculum 
her pronouncements have sometimes challenged the bounds of 
acceptable dogma as when she told a gathering of nuns priests and 
lay religious teachers at the convention if a kid tells me hes 
sexually active i give condom information ill tell him how to 
put it on

the heart of her aids message however is not condoms but the 
good samaritan parable luke 102537 directing christians not to 
judge their suffering neighbors but to care for them 
let god do the judging said mrs clemens 
meanwhile northbrook parishioners were getting mixed signals 
from their pastor father robert herne who has generally supported 
mrs clemens aids mission and who agrees the church should be 
compassionate says it nevertheless should not shrink from calling 
a sin a sin 
herne wrote some verse of his own in a church bulletin 
what used to be called chastity is now called neurotic 
inhibition what used to be called perversion is now called 
alternative lifestyle what used to be called depravity is now 
called creative selfexpression 
she says god is love herne said of mrs clemens i say 
amen to that but everything people do is not ok 
herne said he agreed with mrs clemens that the church should 
soften its fingerwagging image and the perception it does not 
welcome homosexuals who contract aids 
were not against homosexuals said herne but we seem to 
be on the moral side and less on the compassionate and 
understanding side 
mrs clemens work comes as catholic educators scramble to 
devise lessons about aids 
the ncea has until august to complete an aids curriculum for 
parochial schools to use in the new school year it is likely to 
discuss but not condone condom use 
the chicago archdiocese devised its own aids curriculum which 
will be introduced this fall led by sister leonard the 
archdiocese enlisted experts from northwestern university and 
elsewhere to help train parochial teachers 
mrs clemens contends that catholic educators hold an untapped 
advantage over public schools in their ability to imbue aids 
lessons with religion 
jesus tells us a story in luke that helps us know how to treat 
persons who are sick especially persons with aids says her 
curriculum referring to the good samaritan story and using 
language that would be beyond constitutional bounds in public 
schools 
in talking to children in her parish she discovered it was these 
matters of the heart that puzzled them most 
they would ask me why does the school nurse wear rubber 
gloves now or what if somebody falls down at school and bleeds 
can i still help them 
but to most northbrook youngsters aids remains remote 
i told my kids when you go to college next year how are you 
going to know who youre with said maureen dondlinger who 
teaches religious classes for teens at our lady of the brook but 
the trouble is aids is not here the kids have a real hard time 
connecting to it 
did mrs clemens really expect to succeed 
it wasnt a matter of whether i believed parents would use 
it she said i wanted to give them the tools i feel much 
better that parents do the teaching 
at least as worrisome as the laitys denial of aids said mrs 
clemens is the lack of thought toward moral and emotional 
preparation for parochial teachers being called upon to teach about 
aids 
youre going to be giving a curriculum to a whole bunch of 
volunteer teachers who havent thought out where theyre coming 
from she said 
not every educator should be doing this if you do not have 
the heart for this please be free enough not to do it students 
dont want a oneshot filmstrip 
parents are hungry for a workable sexual theology the 
hierarchy wants to do that but they are writing from a male 
celibate perspective thats not a criticism thats a fact she 
said 
john sloan who attended mrs clemens aids lessons with his 
10yearold son kirk said he was glad of any help he could get in 
explaining aids and sexuality 
its good to have the church involved in something like 
this he said 
i like other parents was hesitant to bring up aids with my 
kids said another parent joey buck mary ann took a little 
pressure off us 
how does mrs clemens feel about the church as she prepares to 
leave her parish post 
lovehate sometimes it frustrates me she said the 
institution teaches me patience it teaches me damage control but 
i have hit an institutional wall not only in this parish but in 
this church 
on the aids issue i needed the freedom to speak

bobby is upset because he does not understand about uncle 
neds illness uncle ned has aids 
how did uncle ned get aids one way a person gets aids is 
by using a needle to stick into their body that has blood in it 
from a person with aids drug users get aids this way most of the 
time another way is by sharing your body fluids with a person with 
aids in sexual contact 
mother says that ned knows how he caught the virus perhaps 
someday he will tell you about it 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
some persons get aids from allowing an infected persons body 
fluids to enter their body they get aids from sexual contact for 
example or from french kissing when there is a cut in the mouth 
you prevent the spread of aids by not using drugs sexual 
intercourse is for married persons and by not having sex until you 
are married you will be sure not to get aids some persons now are 
saying that by using a condom sex outside of marriage is safe we 
choose not to have sex outside of marriage for other reasons than 
safety or health

the leaders of the worlds biggest industrial 
countries have much to be smug about as they gather here for their 
14th annual summit 
as a result the meeting of the leaders of the united states 
japan west germany britain france canada and italy is expected 
to be long on selfcongratulation and short on new policy 
initiatives 
the world economy is performing better than it has in years 
economic growth is accelerating unemployment dropping and 
inflation remaining under control 
with that kind of good news theres a tendency to sweep aside 
troubling questions about stillhuge trade imbalances growing 
threats of protectionism and enormous third world debt burdens 
president reagan who will be attending his eighth and final 
allied economic summit said last week that he and the other heads 
of state should forget about quitting time and continue to push 
forward on several initiatives aimed at fostering global prosperity 
but reagans colleagues cant forget that the president will be 
out of office in seven months and no longer able to carry out any 
deals he agrees to 
overhanging all of the discussions will be last octobers 
worldwide stock market crash which raised the specter of a global 
recession 
the market tumult followed a dispute between the united states 
and west germany over interest rates the public tiff rattled 
financial markets as investors feared that joint international 
efforts to support the value of the dollar were coming unglued 
with the united states now forced to borrow between 10 billion 
and 15 billion a month from abroad to finance its trade and budget 
deficits any weakness in the dollar threatens the foreign 
financing america has come to depend on 
the united states and its allies finally settled their policy 
differences with a new pledge last dec 22 to work closely to keep 
the dollar from declining further since that time the summit 
countries have gone out of their way to play down disputes and 
stress how well their drive toward closer economic cooperation is 
working 
there are several successes that they will be able to point to 
foremost among them is this economic growth is far higher than 
economists were expecting in the wake of the stock market collapse 
six months ago the parisbased organization for economic 
cooperation and development forecast the industrialized world would 
grow at a sluggish rate of 225 percent this year now the oecd is 
predicting world growth will come in at a respectable 3 percent 
virtually all of the summit nations have seen an acceleration in 
business activity 
trade imbalances while still huge have begun to narrow for the 
first time this decade the united states which suffered a record 
high merchandise trade deficit of 1703 billion last year has 
seen that imbalance between exports and imports decline to an 
annual rate of 1418 billion in the first four months of this 
year prompting hope that america will be able to lower its trade 
deficit this year for the first time since 1980 
likewise the trade surpluses in japan and west germany the 
mirror image of the us deficit have begun to shrink as both 
countries have been successful in boosting domestic demand to take 
the place of exportled growth 
there are good numbers all over the place said michael 
evans head of a washington economic consulting firm the world 
economy is doing great so the prevailing mood at the summit will be 
why bother to change anything 
the reagan administration is doing all it can to play up the 
economic successes planning to use the summit as a pulpit from 
which reagan can preach one last time to other countries the 
freemarket virtues of cutting tax rates eliminating government 
regulations and turning staterun industries over to the private 
sector 
in a presummit interview treasury secretary james a baker 
iii the administrations chief economic spokesman said efforts he 
led in september 1985 for greater policy coordination among the 
seven summit countries had become firmly entrenched and should last 
beyond reagans presidency 
we have a coordination process that has been tested by the 
adversity of the stock market crash and shown to be effective and 
successful he said 
the main goal of that coordination effort has been to manage the 
decline of the dollar from its heights three years ago down to a 
level where it has rejuvenated american manufacturing 
since february 1987 the summit countries have been striving to 
keep the dollar from going lower that effort did not work last 
year as big waves of dollar selling periodically spread panic to 
stock and bond markets culminating in the oct 19 crash 
but after countries took the cooperation pledge again on dec 22 
and backed up the words with massive joint intervention to buy 
dollars the greenbacks fall has been halted its value has been 
steady for the past six months the longest period of stability of 
this decade 
the united states will suggest making some minor improvements in 
the coordination process including adding an index of various 
commodities including gold as a way the countries can use to judge 
whether their monetary policies are threatening to boost inflation 
baker first introduced the commodity index proposal last 
september to less than enthusiastic response but he has 
successfully lobbied for the plan as a way to add another benchmark 
to the indicator process that was launched at the tokyo summit in 
1986 
third world debt will also be taken up with the summit nations 
expected to announce a plan to relieve the poorest african 
countries of their debts but the bigger question of how to handle 
the huge debt burdens of latin american countries will likely be 
left untouched because of disagreements between the united states 
and other countries over the proper approach to take 
the summit leaders are also expected to tiptoe around the 
contentious trade question of agricultural subsidies reagan a year 
ago at the venice summit called for an end to all farm subsidies by 
the year 2000 but the europeans oppose such a deadline even though 
the farm support programs are costing goverments 200 billion a 
year 
the united states hopes that the final economic communique will 
at least lend support to the current round of multilateral trade 
negotiations being conducted by the 96 member countries of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade

a massive amount of confidential information 
was improperly funneled from the defense department to mcdonnell 
douglas corp a search warrant issued in a nationwide 
investigation of possible pentagon contracting corruption revealed 
thursday 
the search warrant said the government is investigating the 
bribery of public officials in connection with a scheme in 
which defense contractors got inside information from former 
government officials whom they had hired as consultants 
attorney general edwin meese iii declined to give a direct 
answer when asked if bribes had been accepted in the pentagon 
that will all come out in the course of the indictments and 
ultimately in the trials he told reporters 
the fraud and bribery investigation involving the alleged sale 
of information to some of the nations biggest defense contractors 
drew attention all over washington 
president reagan is very concerned about the revelations of 
the past few days spokesman marlin fitzwater said after a meeting 
that included the president vice president george bush meese and 
fbi director william sessions 
reagan instructed them to move as rapidly as possible to get 
the facts 
meese said indictments may be handed down in 30 to 90 days 
fitzwater said the matter certainly poses an internal security 
problem he said reagan feels that this is a matter that 
deserves his attention and that everyone involved should know of 
his feelings the intensity which he feels about dealing with any 
kinds of crimes that have been committed here 
law enforcement sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said about 200 subpoenas had been served this week some of them on 
major defense contractors other than the 15 companies and 
consultants whose offices had been searched tuesday 
the new york times citing unidentified legal sources at the 
justice department and elsewhere reported in friday editions that 
the offices of at least three house members had been placed under 
investigation as part of the probe the sources would not identify 
the lawmakers whose offices were involved or say who might face 
charges in the case the lawmakers or their aides the newspaper 
said 
the search warrant that shed new light on the case was unsealed 
in federal court in st louis it said melvyn paisley who served 
from 1981 to april 1987 as assistant secretary of the navy for 
research engineering and systems a key acquisitions post 
provided classified andor confidential documents to mcdonnell 
douglas 
paisley was a key associate of former navy secretary john f 
lehman paisley now has numerous defense contractors as clients in 
his consulting business 
sources also said paisley is a consultant for united 
technologies whose washington offices were searched tuesday by fbi 
agents as part of the fraud and bribery probe the agents took away 
all documents in united technologiess files relating to paisley 
said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the agents also took documents relating to the 404 and t406 
engines which pratt amp whitney a united technologies subsidiary 
paisley began working as a united technologies consultant within a 
week after he left his pentagon job last year according to the 
sources 
the warrant in st louis authorized a search of the mcdonnell 
douglas office of company executive thomas gunn for inside 
information pertaining to the f16 fighter plane manufactured by 
a competitor general dynamics corp 
gunn is vice president for marketing at mcdonnell douglas which 
did 77 billion worth of pentagon business in fiscal 1987 making 
it the nations largest defense contractor 
the fraud case culminating two year of undercover work and 
wiretaps of the offices of top pentagon procurement officials 
started coming to light this week when federal investigators served 
search warrants on 15 companies and a halfdozen defense department 
officials 
government sources speaking on condition they not be 
identified said the probe has involved courtauthorized phone taps 
and bugs at paisleys consulting office after he left the pentagon 
evidence from the phone tap and the bug on paisley plus taps on 
the phones of two current pentagon officials victor cohen and 
james gaines led investigators to the defense contractors and this 
weeks widespread searches in 12 states sources told the 
associated press the taps on cohen and gaines were at their 
pentagon offices 
nbc news reported thursday that the courtauthorized wiretaps 
lasted 290 days and overheard nearly 4800 conversations of which 
671 were considered incriminating 
the washington post citing an unidentified law enforcement 
source reported in friday editions that at least 12 phones had 
been tapped including that of william galvin a colleague of 
paisleys and a consultant associated with several defense 
contractors 
the source also said one government employee received more than 
100000 in cash in return for information and that investigators 
also were looking into allegations that personal bills vacations 
and other expenses of government employees were paid by 
consultants the newspaper reported 
information that mcdonnell douglas had that was not available 
to the contracting public included data on the sale of the f16 
fighter to the swiss government information from the navy on the 
super hornet f18 and inside information pertaining to general 
dynamics the search warrant said 
the warrant also sought a proposed letter to mcdonnell douglas 
marked secret relating to the f18 which the company wanted to 
sell in europe 
in addition the warrant authorized a search of gunns office 
for documentation pertaining to the advanced tactical aircraft 
program and paisleys efforts to steer it toward mcdonnell 
douglas 
information about a companys competitors offers is never 
disclosed to a company prior to the award of a contract said the 
warrant a company which has access to that information prior to 
the time when best and final offers must be submitted can benefit 
greatly 
mcdonnell douglas issued a statement saying that much of the 
information sought by the justice department was information 
properly supplied to the company we are not aware of any 
improper requests by the company to mr paisley or any improper 
activities by mr paisley on behalf of the company the firm said 
it is cooperating with the government 
gunn issued a statement saying that his work for mcdonnell 
douglas has been thoroughly proper and legal any assertions or 
allegations to the contrary are false i have never misused any 
information related to mcdonnell douglas 
meese asked when he was first told by justice department aides 
of the investigation said ive been briefed on it some time 
ago i cant remember exactly when 
meeses name turned up on at least one of the courtauthorized 
wire taps installed as part of the probe said federal law 
enforcement sources speaking on condition of anonymity because of 
that he was not told of the investigation until late march after 
it was determined by investigators he was not involved in any of 
the alleged wrongdoing the sources said 
we are hopeful that indictments will be completed within the 
next 30 to 90 days meese said 
meese said he told reagan that the investigation in no way 
reflected on the procurement procedures of the defense 
department it appears that dishonest individuals tried to 
circumvent those procedures and that therefore we were taking the 
prompt action along with department of defense investigators to get 
to the bottom of this 
asked how much of an embarrassment the probe was to reagan 
meese said 
i dont think its an embarrassment quite the contrary i 
think the fact that whenever you can uncover dishonest activity 
investigate it thoroughly and then take the necessary action its 
a vindication of good governmental action to weed out those people 
who are taking advantage of the system or committing improper or 
wrongful conduct 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said defense secretary frank c 
carlucci has ordered two top officials to form a task force to 
monitor developments in the investigation and ascertain if 
contracting procedures must be overhauled kathleen buck the 
pentagons general counsel and robert costello the undersecretary 
for acquisition will head the panel

economists say the nations trade deficit is 
shrinking decisively in spite of a government report indicating 
that the broadest measure of trade worsened in the first three 
months of the year 
at first wednesdays negative report on the current account 
imbalance seemed to contradict the report of a day earlier that the 
merchandise trade deficit fell in april to its lowest point since 
december 1984 
but economists said the bad news was old news in truth they 
said the united states is well on the way to closing the gap 
between exports and imports 
the trade deficit is on the mend in a fairly substantial 
way said thomas f carpenter director of economics for asb 
capital management in washington 
the commerce department sparked a strong rally in the financial 
markets tuesday when it announced that the april merchandise trade 
deficit shrank to 989 billion far smaller than expectations 
on wednesday the news seemed to sour when the department said 
the deficit in the broadest measure of trade the current account 
widened in the januarymarch period to 3975 billion up 186 
percent from 335 billion in the last quarter of 1987 
but financial markets shrugged off the negative report which 
referred to trade news from early in the year that was superseded 
by the strong april results 
nevertheless bewilderment over the seeming contradiction 
between the numbers was understandable said stuart hoffman senior 
economist of pnc financial corp in pittsburgh 
its confusing to economists the rest of the people must be 
that much more confused he said 
the one dark spot in wednesdays current account report was that 
the united states ran its first deficit in investment income in 30 
years during the first quarter 
the red ink in investment income was the result of foreigners 
accumulations of huge holdings of us assets in recent years for 
the first time americans had to pay out more in interest 
dividends and rents to foreigners than they received on their 
holdings abroad 
but the deficit on investment income did not disturb financial 
markets because it was a predictable outcome of the persistent 
merchandise trade deficits 
the investment income deficit is certain to get bigger in coming 
months because foreigners will continue adding to their holdings of 
us assets as long as they run trade surpluses with the united 
states 
were making progress on the trade front but because we have 
such a large deficit were still piling up claims against us at a 
very rapid rate said robert g dederick executive vice 
president and chief economist of northern trust co in chicago 
the deterioration in the investment income account will not end 
until the united states starts running surpluses in merchandise 
trade 
that is likely to happen around the middle of the 1990s said 
roger kubarych an economist at the consulting firm of henry 
kaufman amp co 
carpenter of asb capital management thinks it could happen far 
sooner than that we will start having monthly surpluses within 
12 to 15 months he said

campeau corps plans to sell its profitable ann 
taylor clothing chain will sever campeaus ties to the specialty 
retailing business and continue the asset sales needed to help pay 
for its recent acquisitions 
campeau decided to sell the chain because it has different 
customers a different real estate base a different buying 
structure than campeaus nine department store divisions joele 
frank a campeau spokeswoman said wednesday 
ann taylor with 103 upscale womens clothing stores across the 
country was the last specialty division remaining in allied stores 
corp which campeau acquired at the end of 1986 
last month campeau sold allieds brooks brothers chain to help 
finance the purchase of federated department stores inc 
a source close to campeau said allied already has received 
interest in ann taylor which had 1987 sales of 249 million 
campeau did not announce an asking price for the chain 
wednesdays announcement came less than a week after campeau 
said it was selling federateds filenes basement specialty store 
division campeau chairman robert campeau also plans to sell two 
other federated specialty chains childrens place and main street 
as well as its gold circle discount store chain 
thomas tashjian a retail industry analyst with seidler amdec 
securities inc in los angeles said of ann taylor its actually 
a gem 
its very unfortunate that hes deleting it from his 
portfolio tashjian said but i can understand from the higher 
real estate asset value from department stores that he would want 
to preserve those and develop that area rather than the 
leaseoriented ann taylor chain 
analysts have said campeau a real estate developer was 
interested in allied and federated mainly because of their real 
estate holdings ann taylor generally leases its retail space 
the sale of ann taylor leaves allied with four department store 
chains sterns jordan marsh the bon and maas brothers most of 
allieds store divisions were sold after campeau took it over and 
the brooks brothers specialty chain was sold after campeau took 
control of federated 
proceeds from the previous sales were use to retire debt from 
the 34 billion allied purchase while funds from the sale of 
brooks brothers went toward the total 88 billion campeau is 
spending for federated 
in its announcement wednesday campeau said some of the proceeds 
from an ann taylor sale also would be used to retire bank loans 
allied would use the remainder of the money to purchase shares in 
federated which in turn would use the funds to further reduce its 
own debt 
allied and federated will be operated under the same management 
but will remain separate legal entities campeau said 
campeau has said it expects to retain federateds 
bloomingdales goldsmiths lazarus burdines abraham and straus 
and richs department store chains as well as its ralphs 
supermarkets division in california 
goldsmiths and richs have been merged into a single division

business hours will be around the clock for 
planned radio networks based in boston and colorado 
bostonbased business news broadcasting inc is signing on 
stations for a 24hour satellite feed of business and financial 
news scheduled to begin oct 1 on the am band which has been 
losing listeners steadily to fm stations in recent years 
in colorado springs colo business network radio inc is 
planning to enter the market next month with a mix of business news 
and general features 
theres a huge appetite out there for business news said 
john h knowles jr one of the five bnb founding partners were 
targeting the people at the top of the pyramid with the highest 
business acumen 
knowles said about 15 stations around the country had signed 
agreements to take either full 24hour broadcasts or partial 
reports the network will have about 25 editorial and 20 sales and 
executive employees at its boston headquarters and its offices in 
new york city and washington dc 
right now much of the am band is wasteland said knowles 
we think there is a strong niche we could fill 
demographics not numbers of listeners will draw advertisers to 
bnb said knowles who describes the projected bnb listener as a 
upperlevel executive with at least a 15000 investment portfolio 
there are about 35 million people who fit in that category 
he said were not even going to get 10 percent of them but the 
advertisers should recognize that this is a very attractive 
market 
among the other founders and investors who put up nearly 1 
million over the past two years are fred walters a former exective 
editor at wins allnews radio in new york and jim hood former 
associated press deputy director of broadcast news operations 
business radio network inc plans to begin broadcasting in 
between 12 to 15 markets on july 4 said roger petrik vice 
president and chief financial officer 
petrik said more than 100 stations had expressed interest in brn 
and the company had secured about 1 million in financing for its 
first three months of operation 
news director eric burch estimates 80 percent of the format will 
be businessrelated including mangement and investment tips and 
farming news the company plans to place staffers or stringers in 
more than 60 major cities worldwide he said 
its the wave of the future said burch it will be 
everything from hardline features to what lee iacocca eats for 
breakfast

domestic advertising spending should rise 84 
percent this year its strongest showing in four years despite some 
unexpected weakness in local retail advertising a widely followed 
ad forecaster says 
robert coen senior vice president for the ad agency 
mccannerickson inc said wednesday that total us ad spending 
should rise to 1188 billion 
his forecast of 84 percent growth this year was slightly below 
his december prediction that spending would rise 90 percent in 
1988 but it still exceeds rises of 74 percent in 1987 78 
percent in 1986 and 79 percent in 1985 
the olympics and the elections are helping to fuel a return to 
a higher growth rate for us ad spending in 1988 after a 
threeyear drought he told securities analysts at his semiannual 
briefing on ad spending trends 
it would be the biggest gain since ad spending rose 158 percent 
in 1984 another year that also had the olympics and presidential 
election 
he said many large national marketers appear to have loosened 
their tight grip on budgets but are spending significantly more 
only when bargains or special considerations justify the 
increases 
national advertising is expected to rise 94 percent to 6635 
billion coen said while local ad spending will grow 7 percent to 
5247 billion 
in the new forecast coen said national ad spending on 
television should rise 10 percent the first doubledigit rise in 
four years 
the forecast includes a projection of an 11 percent rise in 
spending on the three major television networks network executives 
have complained in recent weeks that the national ad market has 
softened 
magazine ad revenue has risen 11 percent over the first four 
months of the year but should slow and finish 8 percent ahead for 
the year he said 
the biggest adjustment in coens forecast came in his estimates 
of newspaper ad spending he said spending by local retailers a 
major source of newspaper ad revenue rose only 1 percent in the 
first quarter he said the weather and worries about takeovers may 
have made some large retailers more cautious about spending 
as a result coen said he scaled back his growth estimate for 
local ad spending in newspapers to 6 percent from 9 percent 
among the major ad categories coen said automakers boosted 
their spending on television and magazines by 18 percent in the 
first three months of the year while makers of food candy soft 
drinks and cleaning products posted doubledigit spending gains for 
the first time in several years 
on the other hand he said cigarette advertising in magazines 
fell 6 percent in the quarter and singledigit gains were posted 
by beer and airline companies 
outside the united states coen said he expects ad spending to 
grow 14 percent to 1084 billion in 1988 that would mean 
worldwide ad spending would rise 109 percent to 2272 billion 
coen said he tentatively expects us ad spending to rise 75 
percent to 1277 billion in 1989 he said while the economy and 
profits are growing many advertisers traditionally tighten ad 
budgets in a postolympic year

international business machines corp will offer 
up to 50 percent more bang for the buck next week when it announces 
a new generation of computers for the vital center of its product 
line a new report says 
the introduction tuesday of the new midsized computers will be 
one of the most important in ibms history dataquest inc a 
san jose califbased market researcher predicted wednesday 
ibm is locked in a struggle with archrival digital equipment 
corp for domination of the middle range of computing and both 
companies have been rushing products to market 
the new family of computers will succeed ibms system 36 and 
system 38 which are the worlds biggestselling computers above 
the ranks of personal computers 
the existing machines are the workhorses for thousands of small 
and mediumsized businesses they also are used as departmental 
computers in some big corporations a niche where digital has done 
especially well 
although the rivalry constantly is seesawing we expect this 
announcement to radically alter the balance in the midrange in 
ibms favor dataquest analyst allan baumgartner said 
the new computers have been codenamed silverlake and olympia 
and will be unveiled as the as200 and as400 series ranging in 
price from 30000 to more than 300000 dataquest says 
while the system 36 and system 38 are distinct machines that run 
different software the new computers all will run the same 
software although some older programs will have to be modified to 
run on them analysts say 
there are already nearly 300000 members of the system 3638 
family installed worldwide and over the next five years the new 
computers could raise the total to 700000 systems with a value of 
more than 50 billion dataquest said 
ibms share of worldwide midsized computer shipments by 
usbased companies slid to 236 percent in 1987 from 272 percent 
in 1984 while digitals rose over the same period to 189 percent 
from 152 percent according to international data corp 
each percentage point represents nearly 300 million in annual 
sales so the battle for market share is intensely fought 
it will be probably the broadest announcement that ibm has 
ever attempted in terms of the number of customers who will be 
affected said robert djurdjevic an ibm watcher who is president 
of annex research inc in phoenix ariz 
the big news is that ibm is going to make the midrange market 
exciting again win or lose said donald bellomy an analyst for 
international data corp in framingham mass 
if silverlake doesnt take back some market share then it 
will be a failure bellomy said 
digital and other computer companies are hoping to pick off some 
ibm customers during the transition by convincing them to switch to 
their products instead of trading up to the new ibm computer 
if a customers running out of capacity theyd be doing their 
corporation a disservice not to look at vax digitals product 
line gary hoppe digitals manager of us sales consultants said 
in an interview 
the competitors job will be easier if it is expensive and 
difficult to move software from the old computers to the new 
onesibm has promised that the new line will protect nearly all 
of customers investments in applications software but it has not 
been more specific 
ibm should be able to hang onto customers as long as it has done 
a respectable job of providing continuity to the new products 
annex researchs djurdjevic predicted

bargainers for the united auto workers and 
general dynamics corps land systems division reached a threeyear 
contract settlement late wednesday night averting a midnight 
strike at the defense contractor 
the two sides put the finishing touches on a settlement covering 
6000 workers that includes a drug testing program uaw vice 
president marc stepp said would be mutually satisfying to the union 
and the company 
details of the tentative agreement were not immediately 
released although stepp said it included a substantial pay 
increase and a ratification bonus along with improvements in 
health and safety provisions 
overall we were very happy stepp told a late night news 
conference we dealt with the substance abuse matter our members 
will agree to that im quite sure 
stepp said the contract would be explained to the workers 
represented by the uaw at the land systems division a tankmaking 
operation that general dynamics bought from chrysler corp in 1982 
the division has plants in the detroit suburbs of sterling heights 
and warren and at scranton pa and lima ohio 
about 1000 of the divisions workers are on layoff 
a ratification vote will take place in another seven to 10 days 
the union said 
the union had sought a 3 percentperyear increase in the 
13anhour base wage at general dynamics and increased union 
representation to help workers with benefit questions stepp said 
stepp said the company sought to reduce the number of job 
classifications or strict definitions of individual jobs and more 
flexibility in its use of workers 
stepp said earlier that drug abuse was not a widespread problem 
in general dynamics plants 
general dynamics and the union have a pilot employee assistance 
program at the detroit tank plant in warren like similar programs 
at general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler the 
professionally administered program uses counseling and education 
to help workers with drug and other problems 
stepp said the union wants the eap expanded to other land 
systems division plants 
general dynamics was required to accept chryslers uaw contract 
when it purchased the land systems division and a contract 
negotiated in 1985 closely resembled big three auto contracts 
talks on a new threeyear contract began april 11 stepp said

general dynamics and the union have a pilot drug program at the 
warren plant which uses counseling and education to help workers 
with drug problems 
other parts of the contract include a substantial pay increase 
over the three years of the contract along with a ratification 
bonus and improved health and safety provisions stepp said 
about 1000 of the workers covered by the tentative agreement 
are on layoff including 800 of the 2700 detroitarea workers 
stepp and rambeau declined to discuss specifics of how the contract 
will impact those workers if at all and also said they could not 
provide other specifics until union members are informed 
rambeau however said lump sum wage increases are included in 
the contract as the company had wanted but he would not elaborate 
the union sought a 3 percent pay increase for the base wage of 
13 an hour in each year of the pact it also sought increased 
union representation to help workers with benefits questions stepp 
said

a useuropean dispute over farm 
policy reform may spoil the atmosphere of next weeks 
sevennation economic summit a senior european official said 
thursday 
jacques delors chief executive of the european economic 
community said a divergence of views remained between 
washington and the eec over how to reduce government support for 
agriculture 
this could well spoil the atmosphere of the summit that 
starts sunday in toronto delors told a news conference at eec 
headquarters 
delors and other senior officials of the eec executive 
commission will represent the 12nation trade bloc at the toronto 
meeting which will be attended by the heads of government or state 
of the united states canada britain france west germany italy 
and japan 
delors said he expected no major new initiatives to emerge from 
the meeting 
at last years sevennation economic summit president reagan 
unveiled a proposal for phasing out government subsidies to farmers 
by the end of the century the eec has rejected the idea saying it 
supports coordinated cuts in subsidies but that some government aid 
will always be necessary to properly manage farm markets 
last fall the eec proposed what it called short term 
measures aimed at easing immediate problems of overproduction of 
sugar grain and other crops the united states has criticized this 
approach 
farm reform is a central theme of the current uruguay round of 
international trade liberalization negotiations being held under 
the auspices of the 93nation general agreement on tariffs and 
trade 
delors also said discussions of key economic and trade issues at 
toronto would be made more difficult by the fact that reagan will 
soon leave office and the us presidential election contest is 
heating up 
this will make discussion of the outlook for the world economy 
in 1989 and 1990 a little bit more difficult delors said adding 
that it also would hamper discussion of the gatt trade 
liberalization talks 
delors said he would be explaining to his summit partners the 
eecs new protocol agreement with the sovietled economic bloc the 
council for mutual economic assistance the protocol in which the 
east bloc group extends formal recognition to the eec for the first 
time is to be signed by leaders of both organizations on june 25

cattle farmers are sending cows to 
slaughter and mowing roadside ditches to feed remaining animals 
trying to survive one of the regions worst droughts since the dust 
bowl crop farmers meanwhile can only wait 
everybody is culling every cow that they dont need youre 
seeing a lot of older cows going to market said malcolm 
mcgregor a nashua farmer and regional vice president of the 
national cattlemens association 
in northeast iowa on wednesday vernon kuhn worked in his 
withering fields which yielded 50 bushels of soybeans per acre 
last year 
if we get 35 an acre well be tickled to death he said 
we need a week of rain 
elsewhere in the nations midsection and southeast farmers 
turned to sometimes desperate measures to help relieve the drought 
thats prompted widespread water conservation and threatened farm 
yields sending prices zooming on commodity exchanges 
we get a daily report on the drought each day and i must say 
most days since early may anyway those reports have not been 
good agriculture secretary richard lyng said today on cbstvs 
this morning 
asked if the situation was developing into a potential disaster 
lyng replied emphasizing the word potential yes thats 
correct the major corn belt area this is the most reliable 
farming area in the world is threatened its a serious 
matter 
speaking on the same program the american farm bureaus terry 
francl said we are reaching a critical phase over the next week 
if we do not have rain that means therell be substantial 
reductions in yields 
but weather forecasters continued to bear bleak news after a dry 
winter followed by a parched spring 
its going to be dry across the plains and the upper midwest 
at least the next couple of days hugh crowther of the national 
weather service in kansas city mo said today 
in clyde ohio florist cliff doebel spurned traditional 
forecasting science and invited leonard crow dog a sioux medicine 
man from south dakota to perform an indian rain ritual 
crow dog will use prayers and offerings to appeal to the four 
winds of the earth to bring the rain to sandusky county doebel 
said 
water levels on the mississippi reached record lows meanwhile 
stranding at least 750 barges twice that many could become mired 
by the weekend equaling a traffic jam of semitrucks bumper to 
bumper from new orleans to philadelphia pa said michael 
logue spokesman for the vicksburg district of the army corps of 
engineers 
despite predictions of scattered showers and thunderstorms 
today forecasters see no significant relief for iowa and the rest 
of the corn belt 
the area from missouri to ohio should get belownormal rain in 
the next month while dry conditions should ease with abovenormal 
rains in the south and southern plains states according to a 
forecast by the weather service and us department of agriculture 
on wednesday prices for future delivery of soybeans corn and 
oats rocketed to their daily trading limits within seconds of the 
opening bell at the chicago board of trade a reflection of lyngs 
gloomy assessment the day before 
lyng calling the drought a potential national disaster said 
damage already had been done to wheat fields in montana and the 
dakotas and that additional dry weeks of scorching temperatures 
could cause severe damage in the corn belt and across the south 
if you got hay to sell you can get whatever price you can 
ask there just isnt any said al luetmer a minnesota dairy 
and grain farmer 
mcgregor who recently attended a cattlemens meeting in denver 
on the drought said farmers in north dakota and eastern montana 
have been forced to sell productive livestock to meatpackers 
because of parched pastures and rising feed prices 
iowas not far behind he said meanwhile cattlemen here are 
trimming their herds 
i dont see any liquidation yet but it will be soon if we 
dont get any rain he said theres certainly nothing growing 
up here 
the usda has allowed farmers in 96 of iowas 99 counties to feed 
cattle on land originally left out of row crop production under the 
federal setaside program a similar measure was taken in missouri 
the decision to allow haying and grazing on diverted acres was 
a lifesaver for us said dorothy tisdale who has a herd of 70 
beef cows on the farm she operates with her husband fred near 
milton 
gov terry branstad this week ordered the iowa department of 
transportation to allow farmers to mow ditches along roads near 
their property and feed the hay to livestock 
farmers of row crops like corn and soybeans meanwhile are 
still holding out for rain to salvage 1988 yields despite one of 
the worst droughts since the 1930s dust bowl 
rep fred grandy riowa who played gopher in tvs the 
love boat toured farms in his northwest iowa district last 
weekend 
i saw stressed corn he said wednesday the farmers 
werent quite concerned yet but everyone said 10 days could make a 
difference between having a serious condition and a critical 
condition

texaco inc and a saudi arabiaowned oil company 
today announced an agreement in principle to form a join venture 
for refining distributing and marketing oil products in the us 
east and gulf coast regions 
the venture in which each side will hold a half interest valued 
at 800 million will maintain exclusive use of the texaco 
trademark for marketing gasoline diesel fuel and home heating oil 
in the 23state region a jointly released statement said 
it said an agreement in principle forming the venture had been 
signed by officials of the white plains nybased oil giant and 
aramco services co the houstonbased subsidiary of the arabian 
american oil co also known as aramco 
saudi refining inc and aramco services co subsidiary will 
hold half interest in texacos refining assets and marketing system 
in 23 eastern and gulf coast states as well as the district of 
columbia the statement said 
the assets in queston will include three major texaco 
refineries located in delaware city del convent la and port 
arthur texas in addition to 49 terminals about 1450 owned and 
leased service stations and a branded distributor network of more 
than 10000 stations it said 
saudi refining will provide 75 percent of the ventures initial 
inventory or about 30 million barrels of crude and products and 
each side will pay in half of the net working capital a barrel is 
the equivalent of 42 gallons 
by sharing the inventory and working capital texaco said it 
expects to achieve approximately 2 billion in cash benefits and 
savings from the formation of the joint venture based on current 
oil prices the statement said 
although it has been known for some time that texaco and saudi 
arabia had been negotiating this deal texaco had indicated that it 
had been held up by saudi reluctance to sign until it knew whether 
financier carl c icahns attempt to buy texaco would be successful 
earlier this year the nations thirdlargest oil company 
announced that it would pursue joint ventures such as this as part 
of the restructuring plan bringing it out of chapter 11 
bankruptcycourt protection 
the company sought that protection while it was engaged in a 
multibilliondollar legal dispute with pennzoil co that dispute 
was resolved with texacos agreement to pay 3 billion to pennzoil 
texaco emerged from bankruptcy court protection in april 
in riyadh saudi arabia saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer 
was reported by the saudi press agency as describing the move as 
an important step in the kingdoms continuing program of 
cultivating oil industry marketing 
the joint venture would provide the kingdom with a guaranteed 
utility for marketing saudi crude oil and a good opportunity for 
the kingdom to take part in a profitable commercial venture in a 
country with a large marketing potential nazer said 
under the agreement announced today the venture would have the 
right to buy up to 600000 barrels of crude daily from saudi arabia 
at prevailing market prices 
the partnership said it anticipated no significant changes in 
operations or staffing levels at the texaco facilities involved 
and no changes in the products and services provided to customers 
the formation of the joint venture is subject to further 
approvals by the saudi government and texacos board as well as 
various us governmental regulatory bodies 
it is expected to be completed by the end of this year the 
statement said

business inventories rose a moderate 05 percent in april as 
business sales slackened somewhat from marchs torrid pace the 
government said today 
the buildup of inventories was about in line with expectations 
and economists had expected sales to retreat after two strong 
months 
the commerce department said inventories rose 36 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 7237 billion while total business sales fell 
02 percent to a seasonally adjusted 4788 billion 
on wednesday stock prices edged to new postoctober crash highs 
as the government reported increases in may retail sales and 
industrial production and a widened firstquarter deficit in the 
broadest measure of us foreign trade 
a late spurt in buying on wall street pushed the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials up 693 points on wednesday to 213140 
its second postcrash high in as many days the bluechip stock 
indicator climbed 2507 points tuesday 
before the market opened the commerce department said retail 
sales rose 01 percent in may to 1319 billion after a 04 percent 
drop in april 
the sales gain was restrained by a 12 percent fall in 
automotive sales 
excluding autos retail sales rose 05 percent in may sales of 
expensive durable goods expected to last three or more years were 
down 06 percent while nondurable goods sales rose 05 percent 
in another report the federal reserve said industrial 
production rose 04 percent in may the eighth consecutive increase 
in output at the nations factories mines and utilities 
the may advance followed a revised 06 percent rise in april 
initially estimated at 07 percent with the latest growth overall 
industrial production now stands 61 percent higher than it was a 
year ago 
in the trade report the commerce department said the deficit in 
the broadest measure of us foreign trade widened to 3975 
billion in the first quarter as the first deficit in investment 
earnings in 30 years offset a sharp improvement in the merchandise 
trade balance 
the imbalance in the countrys current account balance from 
january through march surged by 186 percent from a fourth quarter 
total of 335 billion 
the current account is the most important of all the trade 
statistics because it covers not only merchandise trade but also 
trade in the services category which reflects primarily the flow 
of investment earnings between countries 
the report said the services category went from a fourth quarter 
surplus of 12 billion to a deficit of 655 million in the first 
quarter of this year the first deficit in the investment category 
since 1958 
the report on the current account came a day after another trade 
report showed the deficit in merchandise shipments narrowed to 
989 billion in april the smallest monthly deficit since december 
1984 
the current account figures showed a similar decline in the 
merchandise trade deficit in the first quarter it dropped 127 
percent to 3595 billion the best improvement in five years 
but the services deficit added 655 million to this figure and 
another 315 billion was added by us foreign aid payments and 
social security benefits paid to american retirees living overseas

time runs slow on ole man river these 
days but the moneys running out fast as the 50 towboats in 
position to nudge 750 barges up the mississippi sit stranded in 
recordlow water levels caused by drought 
officials fear that up to 1500 barges could become stranded by 
the weekend equaling a traffic jam of semitrucks bumper to 
bumper from new orleans to philadelphia pa michael logue 
spokesman for the vicksburg district of the army corps of engineers 
nobody knows for a fact how long we will be here said james 
burkett a pilot with the towboat charles f detmar jr stuck 
near this mississippi delta town some of the boats have been 
here for three days at least three days 
the low river levels have created bottlenecks in places such as 
vaucluse landing ark about three miles north of the greenville 
bridge where the river is down to nine feet 
prospects of ending that bottleneck brightened today 
late yesterday afternoon our navigation people were able to 
mark a secondary channel at greenville that we didnt know 
existed michael logue a spokesman for the army corps of 
engineers in vicksburg said today 
since we found the secondary channel it looks like the small 
tows will be able to go ahead and pass the larger tows will have 
to wait he said 
while tugboat owners are losing an estimated 10000 a day in 
expenses their crews are spending the time painting performing 
light maintenance and even fishing 
theres plenty of work theres always something to do said 
steve southern a first mate on the john m donnelly a northbound 
towboat pushing 30 barges north 
the continuing drought throughout the midwest and southeast has 
brought the mississippi to its lowest levels for this time of year 
since mark twain chronicled life on the big muddy and officials 
began chronicling river levels in 1872 
the low water has forced barges to operate only during daylight 
and to lighten their loads said jeffrey smith vice president of 
the american waterways operators in arlington va 
low water since the days of mark twain has been an 
occupational hazard and they know how to deal with it things are 
somewhat restricted but cargo is still moving smith said 
wednesday 
mississippi river barges carry such cargo as grain petroleum 
chemicals iron and steel he said 
barges with light loads wait here to be escorted one by one by a 
us army corps of engineers channel patrol boat in all about 50 
towboats were stranded wednesday along with their charges 
approximately 750 barges officials said 
the towboats which displace more than 9 feet of water were 
stranded in about 9 feet or less as they waited for the corps 
dredge jadwin to arrive today to widen the channel 
the jadwin will take at least a day and possibly two to dredge 
the channel to a depth of 1620 feet and allow the barges through 
officials said 
the drought has been good news for some however 
waterways marine which takes orders by radio and delivers 
supplies to towboats passing by has been doing a brisk business 
since the boats became stranded said the companys general 
manager james ashmore 
in addition to food and housekeeping supplies ashmore said he 
is also selling a lot of fuel because many boats are keeping their 
engines running 
towboat owners are losing money because in addition to food 
fuel and salary expenses they get paid per tonmile and every 
lost day is lost tonnage that could be delivered ashmore said 
the river gauge at vicksburg about 70 miles south of 
greenville read 25 feet tuesday the lowest level ever recorded 
was minus 7 feet in february 1940 when much of the upper river was 
frozen said ron goldman chief of water control management for the 
corps district 
ashmore said some pilots are resorting to ingenious methods to 
try and get through what has become an increasingly narrow and 
shallow channel near greenville 
one pilot radioed ashmore to ask if he could unload most of the 
fuel from his tanks to make his boat light enough to get through 
ashmore however said he wasnt able to help the pilot

interest rates headed higher as bonds plunged in 
value in early trading today reflecting widespread concerns about 
possible hikes in rates overseas a weak dollar and inflation 
longterm issues took the biggest hit the yield on the 
treasurys closely watched 30year bond jumped to 894 percent from 
883 percent late wednesday while it fell 1 point in price or 
1250 per 1000 in face amount 
prices of us securities started out lower overseas and that 
carried over into domestic trading following an unconfirmed report 
from a west german newspaper indicating that countrys central bank 
might be tightening monetary policy 
the report said the bundesbank would raise its securities 
repurchase rate a key interest rate onequarter percentage point 
to 35 percent 
it is possible said robert a brusca chief economist for 
nikko securities co international in new york 
he noted that a highranking bundesbank official recently 
indicated that his country was concerned about inflation due to 
betterthanexpected economic growth in west germany and a rise in 
money supply at the same time the west german mark has been weak 
against the dollar in foreign exchange and the bundesbank has 
intervened on several occasions by selling dollars to buy marks 
tightening credit through a hike in interest rates would keep 
west german inflation in check and also support the mark brusca 
said 
carol stone a senior economist at nomura securities 
international inc said us bond traders were concerned that 
japan might also be tightening policies especially as its economy 
continues to grow and that could carry over to the united states 
adding a negative tone to the us markets today was a decline 
in the dollar in foreign exchange and another rise in commodity 
prices both of which heighten concerns about inflation ms stone 
said 
inflation erodes the value of fixedincome securities such as 
bonds and notes 
by midday today in the secondary market for treasury bonds 
prices of shortterm government issues fell between point and 
point intermediate maturities ranged from point to point lower 
and longterm issues declined between 1 316 point and 1 point 
according to figures provided by telerate inc a 
businessinformation service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer fell 065 to 11003 the shearson lehman hutton 
daily treasury bond index which makes a similar measurement stood

texaco inc chieftains and carl c icahn the 
companys largest shareholder come to their showdown friday as the 
last ballots are cast in a proxy fight that could lead to the 
biggest corporate buyout in american history 
but the winner wont be known for weeks it is expected to take 
that long to sort out the proxy ballots 
icahn holder of 148 percent of texacos 243 million shares is 
running with four allies for the five seats up for election to the 
companys 14member board 
he is seeking the seats to pressure the company to let 
stockholders vote on his offer to buy the texaco shares he does not 
already own for 60 each or about 124 billion adding the 12 
billion he already paid for his stake would raise the acquisition 
cost to 136 billion the biggest sum ever paid in a corporate 
buyout 
two weeks ago icahn said if he lost he would sell his stake and 
go away but in recent days he said he might try a hostile 
takeover bid 
voting has been going on since late may and ends officially at 
texacos annual meeting friday in tulsa okla 
in the last hours it was widely believed there was no clear 
frontrunner several major institutions were reported to have cast 
their votes for icahn while others were said to be leaning toward 
texaco traditionally individuals tend to vote for management but 
various sources said it was impossible to assume anything this time 
on wall street texaco shares have traded near 50 a share 
reflecting the markets skepticism that icahn will be able to pull 
of the deal 
the annual meeting will bring to a head the latest phase of a 
monthslong war of nerves invective lawsuits charges and 
countercharges between the nations third largest oil company and 
the wily takeover artist 
texaco said that ichan tried to force texaco to buy out his 
stake for an abovemarket price a practice known as greenmail and 
that he tried to manipulate its stock icahn called the allegation 
a fairy tale and said texaco offered to pay him greenmail but 
he refused 
icahn in turn argued that texacos management 
misappropriated corporate assets in california texaco called 
the charge a complete fabrication 
both sides have lawsuits pending against the other 
icahn begain buying up texaco shares last fall while the 
company was struggling to overcome a 103 billion judgment held 
against it by pennzoil co 
pennzoil won the judgment when a jury ruled texaco had 
improperly interfered with pennzoils deal to acquire part of getty 
oil co then bought getty itself the ruling ultimately led to 
texacos filing for bankruptcy court reorganization in april 1987 
a december agreement by texaco to settle with pennzoil for 3 
billion was the keystone of the reorganization plan ultimately 
approved by the court in april but not without stiff opposition 
from icahn 
he battled against texacos management to strip antitakeover 
provisions from its charter 
amid increasing acrimony he accused texaco management of 
getting itself into this multibilliondollar mess then seeking 
to entrench itself at the shareholders expense 
in turn texaco president james w kinnear and other top 
executives accused icahn of seeking to bolster his own profits at 
the expense of texacos other stockholders 
icahn lost some of those battles but won some others at times 
with support from shareholders equally unhappy with the companys 
performance and particularly with the bankruptcy filing which 
resulted in the suspension of its dividend for one year 
as a result texaco agreed to include a vote on certain 
corporate governance on the proxy ballot including among 
others restrictions on the adoption of takeover defenses an 
antigreenmail provision and more participation by shareholders in 
choosing directors 
it also talked up its restructuring plan a major feature of 
which was sales of 3 billion worth of underperforming assets 
but that was not enough for icahn 
in february he announced his intention to run his fiveman slate 
for the board at the time texacos stock was selling near 38 a 
share 
icahn offered to withdraw his slate if management took more 
steps to raise texacos stock price with an eye to restless 
stockholders management restored the 3 annual dividend and added 
an additional 2 billion in proposed asset sales 
it also struck back in early may accusing icahn of violating 
federal securities laws and asking a federal judge to bar him from 
using his stock against the company 
weeks of peace talks ensued as icahn sought to find a way to 
dispose of his stake without depressing texacos price at the same 
time 
after texaco broke off the talks on may 25 he announced his 
buyout offer which put a 146 billion value on the company 
but texaco refused to let shareholders vote on the proposal 
prompting icahn to launch his proxy fight

the credit markets which were reacting to an unsubstantiated 
report in a west germany newspaper that indicated the central 
bundesbank might be tightening monetary policy

and that says effectively that if the federal reserve wants to keep 
the dollar stable it will not give interest rates much room to 
decline said hugh johnson senior vice president at frist albany

japans muscular economy shrugging off the burden 
of a strong currency grew faster in the first three months of 1988 
than at any time since 1977 according to figures released thursday 
boosted by personal spending and housing investment the economy 
grew 27 percent in the januarymarch period after adjustment for 
inflation the economic planning agency said 
that came to an unusually robust annual growth rate of 113 
percent the fastest since the januarymarch period of 1977 when 
the annual growth rate was 117 percent records show 
although growth rates tend to fluctuate erratically from quarter 
to quarter economists said the increase was nevertheless an 
impressive sign of strength 
the first three months of 1988 represent the final quarter of 
japans 1987 fiscal year growth for the entire fiscal year came to 
49 percent after adjustment for inflation more than in the united 
states and western europe the agency said 
a year ago economic planners were worried that the soaring 
value of the japanese yen would drive the economy into a recession 
by making japanese exports too expensive for foreign purchasers 
instead the value of the yen stabilized and japanese companies 
found ways to cut costs and keep their prices competitive in world 
markets 
it is easy for many japanese exporters to overcome this yen 
increase now theyre feeling very comfortable exporting many 
goods to not only the united states but many asian countries and 
european countries said yoshihisa kitai a new yorkbased 
economist for the long term credit bank of japan 
at the same time the economy has become less dependent on 
exports because of a governmentfueled expansion of the domestic 
economy the government has provided easy credit and undertaken a 
multitrillionyen housing and public works program 
the 1987 real growth rate of 49 percent topped the governments 
revised target of 37 percent for real growth that is growth 
after adjusting for the effects of inflation the government 
predicted real growth of 38 percent in fiscal 1988 
officials said personal spending which normally accounts for 
about 55 percent of japans gross national product rose 40 
percent in fiscal 1987 from a year earlier 
housing investment rose by 239 percent and industrial equipment 
investment rose by 101 percent both compared with fiscal 1986 
the official said 
housing investment softened at the end of the fiscal year 
housing starts in january february and march were up 2 percent 
from a year earlier after a string of doubledigit increases 
however consumer spending in the quarter was strong an 
additional shopping day in february helped boost consumer spending 
said shingo unami an economist for yasuda trust and banking co 
japans growth outpaced the growth in the 1987 calendar year of 
29 percent in the united states 48 percent in britain 17 
percent in west germany 22 percent in france and 31 percent in 
italy but trailed the growth of 120 percent in south korea

reported thursday that the bundesbank planned to raise a key 
interest rate next week although the central bank had no comment 
on the report 
the article in the daily handelsblatt disturbed the us 
financial markets where stock and bond prices fell sharply on 
fears that american interest rates would rise also 
the newspaper said the bundesbank decided at its wednesday 
policymaking meeting to increase the securities repurchase rate 
which is the rate the central bank pays to trade in securities in 
the open market a quarter percentage point to 325 percent 
the west german central bank has kept the rate constant at 325 
percent since nov 24 of last year as an indication of its policy 
of stable interest rates and ample moneymarket liquidity 
a bundesbank spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny 
the rate hike report 
however a top west german banking official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said several developments have made the 
situation ripe for an increase 
he listed those developments as a rise in interest rates in the 
united states and other countries a widening gap between german 
longterm and shortterm rates a climbing dollar and a weakening 
west german mark 
another official deutsche bank economist martin huefner said 
the bundesbanks hike in the repo rate if implemented next 
week wouldnt necessarily cause criticism from its partners in 
europe or overseas 
to brake the dollars recent rise either the united states has 
to lower its interest rates or west german interest rates have to 
go up huefner said

futures prices of corn oats and soybeans closed 
sharply higher thursday on the chicago board of trade while wheat 
futures plunged on fears of a reduction in export sales 
the three corn contracts for 1988 delivery advanced the limit 
for daily trading for the third consecutive session as dry 
conditions prevailed in the parched corn belt the board of trade 
expanded its daily price limit for corn from 10 to 15 cents a 
bushel thursday following two days of 10cent advances 
but profittaking limited the gains in soybean prices analysts 
said 
i think this demonstrates the more serious concern about 
potential damage to corn than to the other crops said dale 
gustafson an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
the selloff in wheat futures was prompted by us trade 
representative clayton yeutters statement early thursday that 
export subsidy programs may be reviewed if the drought continues 
analysts said 
traders sold wheat futures heavily despite agriculture secretary 
richard lyngs denial of any plans to reduce subsidized exports 
at the close wheat was 8 cents to 16 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 378 a bushel corn was 6 cents 
to 15 cents higher with july at 294 a bushel oats were 4 cents

a group of leading european 
industrialists on wednesday criticized rules for regulating mergers 
that has been proposed by the european economic community 
commission 
in a statement the european roundtable said parts of the 
proposals were unclear or unworkable echoing similar criticisms 
leveled last month by unice a federation of employer organizations 
the eec commission says merger rules are necessary as the 
12nation bloc moves to create a unified market by 1992 and has 
proposed that it be given the power to block mergers judged to be 
anticompetitive 
the roundtable which consists of about three dozen big 
companies said that it was concerned that the present draft of 
the merger regulation doesnt sufficiently support corporate 
restructuring 
it said the commission should only be able to block a merger if 
it could show that competition would be eliminated in the 
relevant market 
it also said any control by the commission should allow 
companies to make rapid decisions so that possible mergers would 
not fail simply due to administrative procedures

the exchanges consolidate nonoperating functions such as the 
legal and the administrative staffs while keeping trading 
operations separate 
the comex board endorsed the consultants recommendations late 
last year but the mercantile exchange took no action on it 
in its statement thursday the mercantile exchange said its 
board adopted a resolution wednesday night saying it intends to 
pursue the consolidation of appropriate operational and 
administrative functions

stock prices took a sharp tumble today 
mirroring a plunge in bond prices and erasing gains in the previous 
two sessions that had put the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
at a postcrash high 
the dow had climbed 32 points in the previous two sessions and 
analysts said there was a natural tendency for some profittaking 
to set in 
but the days decline was exacerbated sharply by disarray in the 
credit markets which were reacting to an unsubstantiated report in 
a west germany newspaper that indicated the central bundesbank 
might be tightening monetary policy 
there are some indications that japan might be doing the same 
and that says effectively that if the federal reserve wants to keep 
the dollar stable it will not give interest rates much room to 
decline said hugh johnson senior vice president at frist albany 
corp 
the treasurys bellwether 30year issue was off 1 points or 
more than 16 per 1000 in face value in late afternoon 
further pressuring the markets was a government report that 
showed operating rates at american factories mines and utilities 
rose to 829 percent in may the highest level in more than eight 
years 
the report well above market expectations was interpreted as a 
sign that inflation may be lurking on the horizon 
analysts fear a crack in investors confidence which has been 
building gradually but lower stock prices also could bring out 
some bargain hunters

general electric co will buy borgwarner 
corps chemical business for 231 billion in cash in a deal 
announced thursday that will help borgwarner pay off the huge 
debts acquired in going private last year 
the deal will also swell the size of ges rapidly growing 
plastics business which will do sales of nearly 3 billion this 
year 
this is a bigtime deal said nicholas p heymann an 
analyst for drexel burnham lambert inc in new york its a 
riskfree area for ge and its not controversial 
chicagobased borgwarner will use the proceeds to reduce the 
debt it took on last year in a 47 billion leveraged buyout to 
avoid a takeover by gaf corp 
borgwarner took on bank debt of 34 billion in going private 
and has been reducing it through proceeds from asset sales 
borgwarner said it will have no trouble meeting the agreement 
with banks to repay their loans by the end of 1988 its a slam 
dunk donald trauscht the chief financial officer said in an 
interview thursday 
the borgwarner chemical business headquartered in parkersburg 
wva had sales of 125 billion in 1987 it is the worldwide 
leader in resins for a kind of plastic abs that is widely used as 
a substitute for metal or glass 
this acquisition is an important step in our worldwide 
materials strategy glen hiner senior vice president for ge 
plastics said in a news release 
heymann said ges plastics business has accounted for about 5 
percent of sales and 12 percent of earnings he predicted that in 
1989 the expanded business would account for 10 to 12 percent of 
sales and 18 to 20 percent of earnings 
ge said it expects the purchase to add about 5 cents a share to 
its profits in 1989 after all acquisition costs are paid 
borgwarners other businesses are automotive components and 
information and protective services the companys protective 
services includes armored cars guards and alarm stations under the 
names of wells fargo burns security and pony express auto 
components include transmissions transmission components and 
fourwheel drive components 
borgwarners leveraged buyout led by merrill lynch capital 
partners included the payment to shareholders of more than 41 
billion in cash and slightly less than 300 million in junk bonds 
as well as the assumption of a little under 300 million in debt 
merrill lynch owns 51 percent of borgwarners stock 
among other asset sales the company sold bwac inc a finance 
unit for 7825 million to transamerica inc and chilton corp 
its creditreporting subsidiary to trw inc for 360 million 
ge said it will also assume 35 million in borgwarners 
longterm debt 
ge has been rapidly expanding its ge plastics unit which 
expects sales of nearly 3 billion this year it invested 325 
million for a new polycarbonate plant in burkville ala last 
year and will double the size of the plant by 1990 at a cost of 
315 million 
in may ge silicones announced an agreement to combine with 
union carbide corps silicones business to form ge carbide 
silicones inc a joint venture with annual sales of about 750 
million 
borgwarners chemical specialty asb which stands for 
acrylonitrile butadiene styrene is a thermoplastic with strength 
and molding characteristics that make it popular for such uses as 
computer housings helmets and car parts 
we think this is a good fit with ge heymann said it 
moves ge into new niches within the same product markets and it 
does give ge new geographical markets 
he said ge has not been a big factor in the far east an area 
where he said borgwarner is a dominant player 
the transaction is subject to government approvals and is 
expected to be completed by the end of 1988 the companies said

texaco inc and saudi arabia announced thursday 
they will jointly refine and market petroleum in the united states 
under a pact that the troubled us oil giant said would give it 2 
billion in cash and cost savings 
it was the biggest joint venture ever announced between a 
foreign supplier and a domestic oil company in the downstream 
end of the business the process for changing crude into gasoline 
and other products 
such a venture would help provide an assured market for saudi 
arabia the worlds biggest exporter of oil but some analysts said 
it raised serious questions about the consequences of increased 
foreign leverage over the us oil industry which has become more 
reliant on imports in the past few years 
weve been predicting for months that this joint venturing of 
refining and marketing assets would accelerate said george j 
gaspar oil analyst at the milwaukee investment firm robert w 
baird amp co it could potentially put the smaller refining and 
marketing operators at a disadvantage 
the announcement also came as texaco management took a battle 
against takeover strategist carl c icahn to its annual shareholder 
meeting friday which could determine the destiny of the nations 
thirdlargest oil company 
the timing of the announcement reflected the intense pressure 
management faced to foil icahn by convincing shareholders it was 
taking aggressive steps to restructure texaco and raise the value 
of their investment 
texaco is locked in the struggle with icahn and it is coming 
down to the wire said stephen smith an analyst at bear stearns 
cos in new york clearly texaco managers need to tell their 
story we are a new company weve put the past behind us were 
aggressively going to downsize 
texaco management has said it plans to sell about 5 billion in 
property to offset the disastrous effects of prolonged litigation 
with pennzoil co which resulted in bankpruptcy protection and a 
3 billion payment to that company icahn texacos largest 
shareholder has denounced management performance and has offered 
to buy texaco for 60 a share but doubts about who will prevail 
helped depress the stock by 62 cents a share thursday to 4925 
under a letter of intent between texaco and saudi arabia saudi 
refining inc will have a half interest in texacos refining assets 
and marketing system in 23 eastern and gulf coast states as well as 
washington a company statement said 
the joint ventures assets will include three major texaco 
refineries in delaware city del convent la and port arthur 
texas 49 terminals about 1450 owned and leased service stations 
and a distributor network of more than 10000 stations 
the statement said saudi interest in these assets was valued at 
800 million and the saudi side would provide 30 million barrels of 
the ventures initial inventory of 40 million barrels 
it said texaco expected to achieve approximately 2 billion in 
cash benefits and savings from the formation of the joint venture 
based on current oil prices 
the statement did not explain how the 2 billion figure was 
derived nor did it say whether either side could withdraw if there 
were a major change in texaco such as an icahnled takeover texaco 
officials at the companys white plains ny headquarters declined 
to offer further explanation 
other us oil companies have engaged foreign partners for 
refining and marketing petroleum in this country venezuelas 
stateowned oil company for example has an interest in citgo 
petroleum corp which operates one of the largest us refineries 
but the texacosaudi deal would be the largest 
some analysts said such significant foreign influence in the 
domestic oil industry was bound to upset congressional lawmakers 
and federal energy officials who already are concerned about 
americas appetite for foreign oil 
i think there are a couple of people in washington who arent 
in favor of it said carol epstein managing editor at petroleum 
analysis ltd a new york consulting and publishing concern 
people still remember the long gasoline lines of the 1970s and 
its not their most pleasant recollection

two former top executives of beechnut 
nutritional corp were sentenced thursday to a year and a day in 
prison for distributing phony apple juice intended for babies 
the case one of the largest consumer fraud prosecutions of its 
kind involved the intentional shipment of adulterated and 
misbranded juice to 20 states puerto rico the virgin islands and 
five foreign countries between 1978 and 1982 
the fraud was too extensive and too involved to go 
unpunished said us district judge thomas platt of brooklyn 
ny who also levied 100000 fines against the defendants neils 
hoyvald 54 the former president and chief executive officer of 
the company and john lavery 56 a former vice president 
platt ordered both to pay court costs which authorities 
estimated would run into the tens of thousands of dollars as well 
as a special assessment of 50 for each of the hundreds of counts 
on which they were convicted 
beechnut a subsidary of nestle sa of switzerland is the 
nations secondlargest baby food maker after gerber products co 
beechnut is based in fort washington pa 
prior to sentencing hoyvald begged the judge to spare him a 
prison term his voice was thick with emotion and at one point he 
wiped a tear from his eye 
it would be so much easier to endure the torment if i had been 
alone without a family i cannot bear to look at them i see in 
their eyes disappointment hurt disgust and fear for the future 
because of my condition hoyvald said i ask for them and 
myself please dont send me to jail 
hoyvald and lavery who are free on bail pending appeal have 
been on full paid leave from beechnut according to a company 
spokesman court documents show that hoyvald received an annual 
salary of 165000 and lavery was paid 82000 
assistant us attorney thomas roche in his presentencing 
statement asked that the defendants receive substantial prison 
terms because they had perpetrated a massive fraud on american 
and foreign consumers 
customers were deprived of the choice of what to feed their 
babies roche said they betrayed the sacred trust accepted by 
anyone who undertakes to provide nutrition to infants 
platt said the details of the case pertaining to economic fraud 
were pretty extraordinary 
i have no alternative than to do what i am going to do he 
said before imposing the sentences 
the two executives along with beechnut and two suppliers were 
charged in the phony juice scheme 
the juice labeled 100 percent apple juice for babies was 
actually made from a flavored concentrate that had little or no 
apple juice prosecutors charged no evidence was presented that 
the phony juice caused any health problems 
beechnut as a corporation pleaded guilty in november to 215 
counts of violating federal food and drug laws and agreed to pay a 
2 million fine 
after a threemonth trial that ended in february a jury 
convicted hoyvald of lebanon nj of 358 counts of violating the 
food drug and cosmetic act each count carried a maximum sentence 
of three years in prison and a 10000 fine 
lavery of schenectady ny who oversaw the upstate new york 
manufacturing plant where the juice was made was convicted of 
conspiracy 18 counts of mail fraud and 429 counts of violating 
federal food and drug laws 
conspiracy and mail fraud carry maximum sentences of five years 
in prison 
at the trial the government introduced evidence to show that 
beechnut bought adulterated and misbranded apple juice concentrate 
from two suppliers who also pleaded guilty and used this 
concentrate in apple juice and mixed apple products 
prosecutors said that lavery knew of the purchase of the bogus 
concentrate as early as 1978 and that hoyvald who became president 
in april 1981 knew of its use the previous january while he was 
still senior vice president in charge of marketing 
both defense attorneys brendan sullivan jr for hoyvald and 
steve kimelman for lavery had urged platt to sentence their 
clients to probation and community service or home detention 
sullivan said hoyvald had been punished by the loss of his 
position and loss of presitige brought about by extensive media 
coverage of the case 
alternative sentencing can achieve the desire of the system to 
punish kimelman said lavery declined to comment before 
sentencing 
andrew maloney the us attorney for the eastern district of 
new york said he was satisfied that the sentences were a 
sufficient deterrent to other executives 
he said economic fraud cases would continue to be a high 
priority adding that a great effort went into fighting this 
major corporation with all its megabucks 
dr richard c theurer the current beechnut president said in 
a written statement said the company had invested 10 million in 
the last five years to ensure the quality of their products 
our products on the supermarket shelves today are pure 
theurer said we know this because we test them every day 
in may 1987 beechnut settled a classaction suit involving the 
phony juice that was filed in federal court in philadelphia 
the company agreed to set up a 5 million cash fund for 
consumers and to provide 25 million in beechnut and affiliated 
products to retailers

corn futures prices soared the permissable daily limit thursday 
on the chicago board of trade for the third consecutive session as 
fears of drought damage to the corn crop swelled 
soybean and oat futures also advanced on droughtrelated buying 
while wheat futures tumbled in response to a threat of reduced 
export sales 
on other markets livestock and meat futures were sharply 
higher energy futures advanced precious metals were lower and 
stockindex futures retreated 
the three corn contracts for 1988 delivery advanced the 
15centsabushel daily limit as dry conditions prevailed in the 
parched corn belt the nearmonth contract for delivery in july 
approached 3 a bushel for the first time since september 1984 
but profittaking limited the gains in soybean prices and wheat 
futures fell sharply 
i think this demonstrates the more serious concen about 
potential damage to corn than to the other crops said dale 
gustafson an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
there was a lot of profittaking in the soybean and wheat 
pits said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds 
inc people are very nervous 
experts say much of the us corn crop is in a critical growth 
stage and requires moisture within a week to avoid severe yield 
losses the hardier and more recently planted soybeans can hold on 
a bit longer 
corn and soybean futures also were supported by ideas that the 
low water level in the mississippi river the traditional 
grainshipping route could result in increased shipping of grains 
out of chicago such a switch could reduce supplies of grains 
available for delivery against futures contracts on the chicago 
board of trade lespinasse said 
the selloff in wheat futures was prompted by us trade 
representative clayton yeutters statement early thursday that 
export subsidy programs may be reviewed if the drought continues 
analysts said 
traders sold wheat futures heavily despite agriculture secretary 
richard lyngs denial of any plans to reduce subsidized exports 
wheat settled 8 cents to 15 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in july at 379 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 15 cents

the stock market tumbled thursday mirroring a 
plunge in bond prices and eradicating gains in the previous two 
sessions that had put the dow jones average at a postcrash high 
the key index of 30 industrial stocks which climbed 32 points 
in the prior two trading days plummeted 3716 points to close at 
209424 
losers outnumbered gainers by about 5to2 in nationwide trading 
of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 435 issues up 1089

up from 15026 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trading at 
regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled 
186038 million shares 
analysts had said there was a natural tendency for some 
profittaking to set in following the dow averages impressive 
advance of late 
but the days decline was exacerbated by disarray in the credit 
markets which were reacting to an unsubstantiated report in a west 
germany newspaper that indicated the central bundesbank might be 
tightening monetary policy 
there are some indications that japan might be doing the same 
and that says effectively that if the federal reserve wants to keep 
the dollar stable it will not give interest rates much room to 
decline said hugh johnson senior vice president at first albany 
corp 
the treasurys bellwether 30year issue finished off 1 points 
or down more than 16 per 1000 in face value 
there was profittaking as expected but investors were given 
a shove by the suggestion that monetary policy might be tightening 
in germany and japan johnson said 
further pressuring the markets was a government report that 
showed operating rates at american factories mines and utilities 
rose to 829 percent in may the highest level in more than eight 
years 
the report well above market expectations was interpreted as a 
sign that inflation may be lurking 
analysts fear a crack in investors confidence which has been 
building gradually and described the drop as jolting it just 
points out what thin ice were on johnson said 
the dow fell through the psychologically important 2100point 
level a mark analysts had hoped would serve as a floor for a 
further advance 
but lower stock prices also could bring out some bargain hunters 
we would use any weakness as a buying opportunity one

eastman kodak co is seeking to nullify all 
federal court rulings since 1981 in polaroid corps 57 billion 
patent infringement suit claiming the presiding judge has a 
conflict of interest because her husbands late mother owned about 
100000 worth of kodak stock 
in a motion filed in us district court on wednesday kodak 
called for the immediate disqualification of judge rya zobel and 
dismissal of all of zobels rulings in the case since october 1981 
including her 1985 decision that kodak violated several polaroid 
patents on instant camera and film 
kodak also recommended an award of less than 200 million 
would be more than ample to compensate polaroid for any lost 
profits due to kodaks line of instant cameras and film which 
ceased production under a court order on jan 9 1986 
cambridge massbased polaroid however has deemed the kodak 
motion meritless and noted that zobel ruled on oct 5 1981 that 
her motherinlaws ownership of the stock would not present a 
conflict 
none of this is new to either side said polaroid spokesman 
samuel yanes who noted that polaroid will likely file a counter 
motion 
zobels husband state superior court judge hiller zobel was 
named executor of the estate of his mother harriet zobel who died 
earlier this year and owned 2250 kodak shares the zobels are both 
named as beneficiaries of harriet zobels estate 
judge zobel and her husband have through the estate a 
financial interest in a party that could be substantially affected 
by the outcome of the litigation said kodak attorneys in the 
28page motion 
the motion noted that harriet zobels stock was worth as much as 
150000 in the past year kodak also claims zobel was in a 
position to substantially affect the value of polaroid or kodak 
shares by her decisions 
zobel will likely rule on the motion on july 6 the next 
scheduled pretrial conference in the case said nina saab a clerk 
for the judge the trial for the damage award portion of the suit 
is scheduled to begin jan 9 
in february polaroid filed a 57 billion damage claim in the 
case first filed in april 1976 after rochester nybased kodak 
began production of the line kodak has called the claim 
ludicrous and ridiculously inflated 
kodak reported 525 million in sales of instant cameras and film 
in 1981 according to the motion 
after a fivemonth trial in 1985 zobel ruled that kodak 
infringed on polaroids patents and ordered kodak to stop producing 
the instant cameras and film 
in the motion kodak said zobels decision forced kodak to fire 
or reassign about 800 workers and write off 494 million in losses 
the us supreme court in october 1986 refused to hear kodaks 
appeal of zobels decision 
kodak also argued in the motion that a sale of the shares would 
not be sufficient to eliminate the conflict 
in the circumstances of this case and given its high profile 
and potential significance to shareholders and employees of kodak 
and polaroid alike there would inevitably be people who would 
question the impartiality of a judge who went to such lengths to 
remain on a case said the motion

the us justice department is investigating 
northrop corps payment of more than 7 million to korean 
businesses in connection with its attempts to sell its f20 jet 
fighter to the korean military an official familiar with the case 
said thursday 
the criminal probe which seeks to determine if the payments in 
1984 through 1986 violated the foreign corrupt practices act is in 
its preliminary stages said the official who refused to be 
identified the act bars us companies from making direct or 
indirect payments to foreign government officials 
the investigation first reported in thursdays wall street 
journal apparently parallels a congressional committee inquiry 
into northrops payments to korean companies that were made in 
connection with negotiations for sale of the fighter planes 
northrop isnt aware of the justice department probe spokesman 
tony cantafio said thursday at the companys los angeles 
headquarters 
the company previously has portrayed itself as a victim of fraud 
by the korean companies it dealt with and has sued in korean 
courts for return of its money 
korea decided against buying the f20 which northrop never put 
into production because of a lack of orders worldwide 
northrop said it invested 65 million in a korean hotel venture 
as part of a legal offset agreement to demonstrate that in 
return for the jet contract the company was willing to help boost 
the korean economy the probe by a subcommittee of the house energy 
and commerce committee focuses on that payment along with 
northrops payment of 15 million to terminate a lobbying 
agreement with a company controlled by the late park chongkyu a 
businessman well connected with the korean government 
the justice department will investigate a secret agreement for 
northrop to pay as much as 55 million to parks company if the 
lobbyist persuaded the korean government to buy 200 of the fighter 
planes sources told the journal

within a week of his departure from the 
pentagon melvyn paisley went to work for united technologies corp 
as a consultant to help the firm get defense contracts sources 
said thursday 
on tuesday fbi agents seized records pertaining to paisley when 
they searched united technologies washington offices as part of a 
massive fraud and bribery probe involving alleged corruption at the 
pentagon said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the investigation involves courtauthorized phone taps and bugs 
at paisleys consulting office after he left the pentagon said 
other sources 
the fbi agents also took from united technologies washington 
office documents relating to the 404 and t406 engines which pratt 
amp whitney a united technologies unit builds for the navy 
paisley began working as a united technologies consultant within 
a week after he left his pentagon job last year according to the 
sources paisley was the assistant secretary of the navy for 
research and engineering and systems he had been recruited for 
the position in 1981 by john lehman the secretary of the navy and 
paisleys boss 
former navy secretary james h webb jr told the washington post 
that he was briefed about the fraud and bribery probe last fall and 
as a result of his briefings it was clear that paisley was one 
of the central figures in the investigation 
in addition webb said that 10 days before paisley left the 
pentagon in march 1987 he had persuaded navy officials to give him 
a contract as a consultant to the office he was leaving and he won 
approval to maintain his security clearance for access to 
information involving the militarys most secret black programs 
webb told the post for a story in fridays editions that he 
canceled paisleys contract within days after taking office in 
april 1987 because it appeared to be a conflict of interest 
and that paisley received no fees for it 
paisley 63 a native of portland ore went to the pentagon 
from the boeing co where he was manager for international 
operations in the companys space and information division 
paisley is still a consultant for united technologies and the 
sources said his work involves lobbying efforts on behalf of 
engines built by the companys pratt amp whitney engine division 
the 404 is being built for the navys fa18 jet airplane and 
the t406 engine a smaller engine which is being built for the 
v22 osprey a vertical takeoff jet that is being developed for 
both the marines and the air force 
the pentagon has awarded 316 million worth of 404 engine 
contracts to pratt amp whitney in the past two years 
general electric originally had the chief contract to provide 
engines for the f18 but the navy seeking to drive down costs 
approached pratt amp whitney two years ago and asked if the company 
could build engines for the plane 
larry bingman a spokesman for united technologies refused to 
confirm or deny paisleys status as a consultant we as a matter 
of policy do not confirm who consults with united technologies 
bingman said in answer to questions 
while he was in the pentagon paisley was a key figure in the 
reagan administrations naval buildup which in turn was a 
centerpiece of the large increases in defense spending that reagan 
won during his first term after his 1980 campaign pledge to 
rearm america 
paisley and lehman worked with everett pyatt assistant navy 
secretary for shipbuilding 
everything on the navys procurement side went through those 
three said one congressional source thursday speaking on 
condition of anonymity
