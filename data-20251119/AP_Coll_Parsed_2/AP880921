a british citizen who was captured in rome last 
may after five years as a fugitive was fined 25000 tuesday after 
pleading guilty to violating export controls by selling computer 
equipment to eastern bloc countries 
in an arrangement with the us justice department brian moller 
butcher of london pleaded guilty to five counts of violating the 
commodities control act by funneling computer and laboratory 
equipment through britain to poland bulgaria and romania fourteen 
other counts were dropped 
in addition to the fines butcher was sentenced to time already 
served he had been held since his arrest 
the justice department contended the items were computer 
processors that had military applications but butcher said the 
equipment was lowtech hewlettpackard test lab equipment that 
could have been purchased in a number of countries but was cheaper 
in the united states 
theyre of dual use they had commercial and military uses 
assistant us attorney kevin f driscoll said in recommending 
butcher be sentenced to two years in prison and fined 150000 
but us district judge rya zobel said she did not see the need 
for so severe a sentence i may be obtuse but i dont see it 
she said 
there was no breach of security to the nato countries or the 
united states defense attorney paul f markham said the only 
way these could have hurt someone is if they had dropped out of an 
airplane and hit them on the head 
butcher and paul carlson a us citizen were indicted in 1981 
for the scheme carlson pleaded guilty and was fined 5000 when 
the case came to trial in 1983 butcher 55 said after appearing 
in court tuesday that he had fled the united states because of the 
nations political climate 
things got rather hot politically in the early days of 
president ronald reagan he said i think things have cooled 
off now and reason has returned 
sources told the associated press an associate of butchers 
indicted on similar charges in phoenix became a government 
informant and lured butcher to his arrest in rome under the pretext 
of another illegal export scheme

the cabinet on thursday put crown prince akihito 
temporarily in charge of all imperial affairs and emperor hirohito 
remained in serious but stable condition four days after falling 
ill officials said 
hirohitos chief doctor said the 87yearold monarchs condition 
clearly stabilized wednesday after an intestinal hemorrhage 
made the emperor vomit blood but the doctor said he wasnt sure 
the bleeding had stopped 
the worlds longestreigning monarch was given oxygen and 
intravenous feeding officials and news reports said but palace 
officials widely quoted in press reports said the emperor on 
wednesday requested food and a television in order to watch his 
favorite sport sumo wrestling 
chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi the governments main 
spokesman said the cabinet on thursday morning agreed to appoint 
crown prince akihito 54 in charge of all imperial duties 
taking into consideration the emperors illness and the time 
required for medical treatment we have asked the crown prince to 
temporarily assume imperial responsibilities obuchi said in a 
nationally televised news conference 
one year ago when hirohito underwent an intestinal bypass 
operation the prince took charge of all duties for three months 
last december hirohito resumed seven of the 12 designated imperial 
functions which include placing an official seal on government 
appointments and new laws and convocation of parliament 
tokyos stock market plunged and then recovered on news of 
hirohitos condition wednesday but remained calm in morning trading 
thursday following upbeat reports in local newspapers 
news reports said government officials also began the process of 
selecting a name for the next emperors reign japanese normally 
use the name and year of the emperors reign in giving dates 
rather than the system generally used in the rest of the world 
the emperors chief physician akira takagi said the emperor 
showed signs of jaundice and anemia but his condition had 
stabilized since he began vomiting blood late monday night 
on tuesday the emperor in bed in the imperial palace received 
a total of 255 pints of blood in three transfusions 
but takagi said he couldnt say with confidence that 
hirohitos internal bleeding stopped he said the emperors 
pancreas was even more inflamed than last september when pressure 
from the organ on the upper intestine forced doctors to perform the 
intestinal bypass 
at the imperial palace in central tokyo government officials 
and diplomats continued to pay their respects while hundreds of 
people gathered outside of the gates to bow and pray 
the crowd included people of all ages some having arrived by 
chartered bus from more than 500 miles away 
when i read newspapers reporting the emperor was in critical 
condition i felt like my grandfather was dying said aya kitade 
a 22yearold college student from kyoto 230 miles away 
each of the palaces seven gates was surrounded by people some 
weeping some kneeling 
i could not bear staying home and watching the emperor suffer 
on television said eiyoshi kiguchi a 71yearold tokyo resident 
who served in the navy in world war ii 
kiguchi sat on the curb in front of the main palace gate and 
rubbed tears from his eyes 
i adore the emperor and always prayed for his wellbeing he 
said he has been through a lot and his life was full of 
hardships no emperor had such a wild life as him 
a middleaged man said this may be the last chance for the 
japanese to express honest feelings about the emperor 
if you make sympathetic remarks about the emperor or the 
imperial family itself when the emperor is well people will see 
you as an imperialist or even a rightwinger he said but now 
that the emperor is visibly suffering no one can attack you if you 
express sympathy toward him 
across japan shinto shrines held services to pray for the 
ailing monarch before he was forced to renounce his divinity by 
us occupation officials after world war ii the emperor was 
considered a living god and a direct descendent of the sun goddess 
amaterasu 
many older people still hold hirohito in high regard but 
younger japanese typically have given little thought to the 
emperor a minority strongly oppose the imperial system calling it 
a vestige of the militarism that dominated wartime japan 
officials said foreign minister sosuke uno canceled a planned 
trip thursday to washington for talks with secretary of state 
george shultz although the foreign ministry did not give a reason 
for the cancellation it was known that the emperors illness 
threatened the visit 
the government also asked italian prime minister ciriaco de mita 
to postpone a scheduled visit beginning sunday kyodo news service 
reported

cruz ayala marroquin has spent his 
working life for the past quarter century standing knee deep in the 
las canas river shoveling sand onto the bank 
he is an arenero a sanddigger and ekes out a meager 
existence supplying sand for construction sites in san salvador 
the capital 10 miles to the south 
manuel de jesus spends his time pulling an ironwheeled wagon 
loaded with 800 pounds of bananas from the eastern bus terminal to 
san salvadors central market 
neither has anything to show for his work except the sinewy 
muscle of his arms and back what they earn with their toil is not 
so much a living as another days survival 
the hard life is harder for the poor in el salvador 
though there is no official parameter such as a poverty 
line it is clear that the great majority of el salvadors 55 
million people are poor 
the us agency for international development says 27 percent of 
children under 5 are malnourished infant mortality is 91 per 1000 
live births the highest rate in central america 
half the population lacks safe drinking water and the leading 
cause of death is intestinal infection according to the ministry 
of health only four out of 10 people can read and write 
with this you make enough to eat thats it says the 
grizzled ayala 55 pausing to lean on his shovel he and his wife 
reared seven children in a tworoom adobe house three of the six 
boys became sanddiggers 
ayala rises every day including sunday at 3 am so as to be 
at the river by 4 the first trucks arrive at dawn by which time 
ayala has shoveled a ton of sand 
on a good day hell dig three or four oneton truckloads and 
make 15 to 20 colones 3 to 4 with that his wife will buy rice 
beans tortillas perhaps a few eggs and some cheese enough for 
the couple and their one remaining dependent child 
you cant save a colon he says the few cents you set 
aside go up in smoke with an illness something like that 
he says he feels strong and plans on working at least five more 
years hell depend on help from his sons when he can no longer 
work 
ramon aristedes najarro who digs about 50 yards downriver from 
ayala is 48 years old and feels his strength draining he doesnt 
even want to think about how hell get by when his back gives out 
ill just have to find something else selling newspapers or 
maybe ill have to beg 
at the san salvadors central market manuel de jesus takes a 
break with three other carretoneros or cartpullers seated on 
their sturdy wagons a sweet slightly nauseating odor wafts across 
the narrow street from a pile of rotten or mashed bananas 
a middleaged woman searches through the pile for still edible 
fruit 
the cartpullers like the sanddiggers make about 3 on an 
average day de jesus 28 and granadeno perez 29 sleep in a 
nearby flophouse that charges 2 a night for a piece of cardboard 
on the floor and water for bathing that leaves them a dollar for 
food and for booze 
sometimes we go without eating to buy guaro says perez 
already in a semistupor from the cane liquor by 10 am all four 
cartpullers readily admitted they try to maintain a constant 
alcoholic haze 
several times a day they come up with the five colones to buy a 
halfliter of muneco the cheapest guaro 
its very hard this life said de jesus theres no 
future in it it damages your body the only thing youre left with 
are the knocks he motioned to perezs bandaged hand sprained 
from the strain of hauling 
asked his feelings about leftist guerrillas who say they are 
fighting for the poor ayala said i understand nothing of 
politics but some say they the guerrillas would make this 
another nicaragua i dont want that 
none of the sanddiggers or cartpullers interviewed could read 
and none has ever voted democracy which returned to el salvador 
in 1982 after decades of military rule means little to them 
democracy has done nothing says najarro it hasnt 
created jobs you look out for yourself and get by as best you 
can 
i doubt the country can progress says ayala i dont have 
faith

premier andreas papandreou has taken the 
greeks by surprise again but this time the focus is on his 
personal life and not his politics 
the 69yearold premier who is awaiting openheart surgery in 
london last week announced he intends to divorce his americanborn 
wife margaret after 37 years of marriage 
the announcement came after papandreou was pictured in greek 
newspapers strolling handinhand through hospital grounds with his 
companion dimitra liani a 34yearold flight attendant 
in a country where politicians private lives usually attract 
little media attention the socialist premier took the 
unprecedented step of disclosing his relationship with the tall 
blonde ms liani 
opinion is divided about the possible effects on his 
governments popularity 
a parliamentarian with papandreous governing panhellenic 
socialist movement who spoke on condition of anonymity said my 
constituents are farmers with oldfashioned views about family 
life and ill have a hard time explaining this the planned 
divorce away 
but political analysts point out that previous disclosures about 
papandreous private life failed to affect his approval rating 
the analysts say the premiers refusal to appoint a standin 
during his hospitalization in england is much more likely to erode 
support for his party 
papandreou has a history of womanizing that never dented his 
political appeal but his absence leaves a power vacuum that makes 
it clear pasok is unlikely to survive unless he makes a miraculous 
recovery said stratis stratigis a lawmaker with the liberal 
opposition democratic renewal party 
during seven years in power papandreou has skillfully 
stagemanaged abrupt changes in economic and foreign policy without 
endangering his governments popularity but his panhellenic 
socialist movement now faces the prospect of fighting national 
elections due by mid1989 with a weakened leader 
papandreou flew to london on august 25 for treatment of a 
narrowing of the aorta the main blood vessel carrying blood from 
the heart 
the premiers planned surgery at harefield hospital to replace a 
heart valve has been postponed several times because of a liver 
problem 
the operation now is expected to take place in late september at 
the earliest according to his doctors 
in the meantime papandreou is advising the government by 
telephone and senior cabinet ministers take turns flying to london 
for instructions 
mrs papandreou 65 who runs a socialist feminist organization 
in greece has not visited her husband in the hospital 
she has not made any public statement on the divorce and said 
in a letter to an englishlanguage athens newspaper over the past 
weekend i will not do so until the health of andreas is 
assured 
the couple married in a civil ceremony in the united states in 
1951 when papandreou was an economics professor at the university 
of minnesota both had recently divorced 
when papandreous relationship with ms liani became public 
knowledge a year ago mrs papandreou said she did not intend to 
seek a divorce 
ms liani who studied at the sorbonne university in paris and 
works for olympic airways the greek state carrier met the premier 
through his wife in 1986 and later was assigned to his official 
plane 
at that time mrs papandreou was seeking better media promotion 
for feminism in greece and chose ms liani to host a greek 
television talk show on sexual equality called misomiso half 
and half the premier was one of the first guests interviewed by 
ms liani 
ms liani is divorcing her husband alexis kapopoulos 48 an 
architect who works for staterun television 
the papandreous have four children and two grandchildren their 
marriage has weathered difficulties in the past but this time the 
premiers attitude has markedly changed as greek commentators 
pointed out 
in the past when a serious love affair produced his 
papandreous child the issue of his marriage never surfaced 
helen vlachos wrote sunday in her column in the athens daily 
kathimerini 
but he seems to have lost a sense of reality he acts as 
though hes overlooked one detail that he is the premier of 
greece she wrote 
she was referring to papandreous illegitimate daughter born 
after an affair he had with a swedish actress while his family was 
exiled in stockholm during the 196774 military dictatorship that 
ruled greece 
that affair was revealed a few days before a general election in 
june 1985 in which papandreou was reelected by a comfortable 
majority 
papandreous meeting with his 18yearold daughter emilia nyblom 
at the end of an official visit to sweden in january was widely 
reported in greek newspapers but opinion polls showed no related 
decline in his popularity 
according to political pollster panayote dimitras the lack of 
electoral reaction is due to the fact that to many greeks 
papandreou and the other politicians are like hollywood actors so 
you dont expect them to be perfect and you certainly dont judge 
them by your own domestic standards

bill emerson went blind nine years ago 
but has used computers a guide dog and determination to keep his 
job as chief censor for knbctv where he reviews more than 8000 
commercials and hundreds of shows and movies each year 
emerson 45 became the stations manager of broadcast standards 
and practices in 1971 started losing his sight because of diabetes 
in 1976 and was completely blind by february 1979 he recalled 
the general manager of knbc at the time offered him training and 
union membership as an audio engineer but emerson declined the 
offer 
i had this job for nine years before i went blind i have a 
good memory and i am able to visualize quite well he said in a 
telephone interview tuesday and most of the people have been 
with me a good number of years 
his staff of three watches shows for him and reports anything 
questionable and he can derive from the audio portion of a film or 
tape that something objectionable might be showing 
when i have a question i go to them he said of the staff 
i ask them what does this look like 
i probably am more aware of the audio track than others so i 
do catch some things that others dont he said in addition to 
tape reviews emersons wife reads scripts to him at home 
he learned braille but said reading raised dots with his 
fingers is too slowpaced 
if i had to read a book in braille i would be asleep by the 
fourth page he said i listen to all my books on audio tape on 
double speed you can train yourself to listen fast and you get 
twice the information in half the amount of time 
emerson also listens to doublespeed playbacks of audio tapes of 
shows such as family feud 
they sound like donald duck but you can understand them he 
said 
emerson navigates the halls and offices at knbc with the help of 
his yellow labrador retriever niles and a lightsensitive sounding 
device 
his workday also is made easier with help from a keyboard 
plugged into a computer thats equipped with a voice synthesizer 
and program to run it the computer announces screening 
appointments and keeps emerson abreast of time schedules for 
commercials and other matters 
the dog also gets to help in other ways 
i once did an editorial about nude beaches and we filmed it at 
a nude beach location with longdistance shots of nude bodies it 
was nothing salacious or anything recalled former knbc editorial 
director jim foy 
emerson was responsible for reviewing the tape for broadcast 
foy said 
he had it reviewed he said by his dog the dog said it was 
all right so we put it on the air and nobody complained we did 
not get one call on it foy said

propalestinian and israeli forces are 
clashing in this highbrow academic enclave over ballot questions 
addressing the turbulent politics of the occupied west bank 
the cambridge referendum calls for support in demanding that 
israel end its violations of palestinian human rights and its 
occupation of the west bank and gaza the referendum also calls 
for cutting off us taxpayers money for israels occupation of 
the west bank and gaza and for creating an independent 
palestinian state in the west bank and gaza with peace for all 
states in the region including israel 
cambridge home to harvard and the massachusetts institute of 
technology is a frequent forum for vigorous political debate the 
city with a population of 90000 people also has many 
workingclass neighborhoods and members of jewish organizations 
said they expected the majority of voters would not support the 
referendum 
similar questions are on ballots in san francisco and berkeley 
calif 
only cambridge and berkeley would have the chutzpah to think 
that they can determine national and international policy by a 
local ballot on as complicated an issue said harvard law school 
professor alan dershowitz 
clearly it is simply designed as a strident antiisrael 
unbalanced message he said 
but supporters say they are providing an outlet for what they 
perceive as a growing disenchantment with us policy in the middle 
east stoked by the recent uprisings on the west bank 
we feel the status quo simply is intolerable said matthew 
gordon spokesman for the coalition for palestinian rights which 
gathered signatures to put the questions on the ballot 
gordon said his group opposes israeli policies not israel and 
realizes you cant tackle the entire problem in just one 
referendum 
we dont hope ourselves to change it us policy but we 
feel that were part of a movement he said 
diane steinman new england director of the american jewish 
committee said the national office of the organization is opposing 
the referendum in cambridge and also a separate ballot question in 
newton just across the charles river 
the newton question asks voters to support creation of a 
separate palestinian state in the occupied territories and 
security for israel and the palestinian state 
we believe in general that ballot referenda like these are not 
an effective mechanism for addressing the complexity of the issues 
in the middle east steinman said 
in newton which has a substantial jewishamerican population 
among its 82000 residents the national committee for arab and 
israeli peace is preparing for a different campaign andrea barron 
chairwoman of the organization said the commitee is not related to 
the cambridge group 
we deliberately chose newton because an increasing number of 
jewishamericans are willing to support a palestinian state said 
barron noting that she is jewish 
opponents and proponents said they intend to wage a fullfledged 
campaign on the referendums 
i think its a serious issue dershowitz said if only a 
few people show up and vote on this ballot you can always get a 
yes pushed through 
gordon said the coalition is distributing fliers mailing out 
letters and has so far raised at least 2000 
the jewish community relations council which includes 34 
organizations plans to stay within a modest budget in its 
opposition campaign details of which are still being discussed 
said group president joel reck 
we intend to coordinate efforts to defeat these referenda 
which we consider inimicable to the peace process he said 
no one least of all israel likes the present situation of 
occupied territories reck said the question is how do we 
support israel and be supportive of israel and having referenda on 
what israel ought to do is an absurd and inappropriate way to 
address what are the very serious problems in the middle east

emperor hirohito placed under intensive care after 
repeatedly vomiting blood was in stable condition wednesday 
morning and appeared to be improving officials said 
the 87yearold leader the worlds longestreigning monarch 
was headed in a favorable direction the imperial household 
agency said 
takenori sugawara an imperial household spokesman said 
hirohito was still receiving intravenous care but was fully 
conscious after a sound sleep overnight 
quoting iwao miyao vice grand steward of the imperial household 
agency sugawara said the emperors condition appeared to be 
improving and palace doctors were not planning any further blood 
transfusions 
miyao in a briefing to palace reporters said that as of 9 am 
wednesday 8 pm edt tuesday the emperors temperature was 986 
degrees slightly above the 984 degrees of the previous night 
according to sugawara 
the tokyo stock exchange dropped more than 250 points in 
wednesdays morning session as concern continued over the emperors 
condition 
imperial household agency officials said doctors gave the 
emperor three blood transfusions tuesday after he began vomiting 
blood monday evening the vomiting continued through the night but 
stopped tuesday morning they said 
word of hirohitos deteriorating health shocked many japanese 
who remember the emperors past robust health and active life 
in recent years japans mass media have often avoided making 
negative comments about the emperors growing frailty but in a 
typical newspaper report wednesday morning the nationally 
circulated asahi shimbun said in a headline seriousness of 
emperors condition deepens 
television stations also stayed on the air late at night to 
carry updates on the emperors health 
people passing by the imperial palace in central tokyo paused 
tuesday in the rain to bow and pray for hirohitos health 
throughout the day imperial family members and government 
officials visited the palace to wish hirohito good health most 
left without seeing the emperor personally but crown prince 
akihito and crown princess michiko said he greeted them with a 
strong thank you for visiting me 
japans cabinet was expected at its next meeting thursday to 
shift hirohitos state responsibilities to akihito 54 heir to the 
throne 
among those paying respects were prime minister noboru takeshita 
and us ambassador mike mansfield 85 who had a coronary bypass 
operation in january 
about 100 reporters remained camped outside the palace late 
tuesday night watching for any activity in the emperors 
secondfloor bedroom or any sudden arrivals of officials 
news reports said former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone 
traveling in britain ended his trip early to return to japan 
imperial household agency officials said doctors suspected there 
was bleeding in the emperors intestine near the site of an 
intestinal bypass performed last september in that procedure 
doctors circumvented an intestinal blockage caused by an enlarged 
pancreas 
three times in recent weeks the emperor has been bedridden with 
a fever after a fever earlier this month hirohito took the 
unusual step of calling reporters together to tell them he was 
feeling fine and not to worry 
a news report last week said he had lost 20 pounds of the 130 
pounds he carried before his surgery 
in a briefing tuesday night for japanese reporters iwao miyao 
vice grand steward of the imperial household agency said doctors 
gave hirohito three transfusions one of 16 pints of blood and two 
of 04 pints 
an agency official quoted miyao as saying in the briefing i 
dont think the emperors condition is becoming worse but rather 
that it is stabilizing 
miyao said the emperor was continuing to receive intravenous 
feeding and was unable to eat 
hirohito has occupied japans chrysanthemum throne since 1926 
for the first 20 years of his reign he was considered a living 
god and a direct decendant of amaterasu the sun goddess 
but after world war ii us occupation officials forced him to 
renounce his divinity under japans postwar constitution he 
became a symbol of japans unity but with no real power 
it was a choice that enabled hirohito to remain as symbolic head 
of japan and assured that he would not face charges as a war 
criminalit also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much 
as this gentle shy and retiring man who was more comfortable 
working as a marine biologist that playing the role of a living 
god 
indeed the emperor was a widely respected authority on marine 
biology having written or coauthored at least 12 books on 
hydrozoa or sea animals his specialty 
many older japanese still feel deep affection for hirohito but 
younger people tend to have less interest in the imperial family 
still hirohito and the imperial system remain important to 
japan 
the japanese measure years according to the reign of their 
regent 1988 in japanese is referred to as showa 63 
and a nationwide survey by the daily newspaper mainichi shimbun 
in march 1987 showed more than 80 percent of 2184 people polled 
supported the imperial system while only 11 percent said it should 
be abolished five percent said the emperor should have more power 
opposition comes mostly from leftists who link the emperor with 
past militarism hirohitos death would plunge japan into a period 
of official mourning which could last up to two years and involve 
dozens of elaborate ceremonies and religious rites

a spat is turning nasty on a treelined 
street in this affluent chicago suburb where television commercial 
crews at ken kesslers house are keeping neighbors awake with 
latenight shoots 
kesslers nextdoor neighbors on forest avenue complain the 
crews are too noisy block their driveways with trucks and vans 
and have shooting sessions as late as 11 pm 
kessler said tuesday he believes his neighbors are just miffed 
because their homes arent being used as sets for tv commercials 
to me its pure and simple a problem of money and 
jealousy says the 45yearold institutional stockbroker who 
rents his home to film crews for between 300 and 1000 a day 
somehow i think it grates them that someone next door is 
making money off their house really i think thats the bottom 
line kessler said 
thats ludicrous retorted robert fisher who lives next 
door and wants the city to restrict the kesslers to just one 
commercial a year at their home 
after the second time i complained the next day i got a call 
from an agent saying hey do you want to use your house for a 
commercial 
i said absolutely not i have a beautiful home i dont 
want people tramping all through it i bought my house to live 
in not to use it as a filming location said fisher 40 a 
group controller for zenith electronics 
the dispute in this suburb north of chicago along lake michigan 
has been brewing since kessler and his wife ann began renting 
their threestory 12room home to film crews about three years ago 
their home has appeared since in commercials for mcdonalds 
illinois bell kraft and allstate and in an hourlong madefortv 
film called thinking big 
fisher and bob bonges who lives on the other side of the 
kesslers have lobbied the evanston city council to enact an 
ordinance restricting commercial filming 
fisher contends kessler is violating zoning laws by operating a 
commercial enterprise in his home 
kessler disagrees saying he doesnt employ anyone 
a council committee decided last week the dispute was too 
limited to warrant a citywide law but city manager joel asprooth 
took administrative steps to restrict film shootings to three per 
year at the kesslers 
in the meantime kessler said he has asked the neighborhood 
justice center an agency that mediates such spats to try to 
resolve the fight 
we feel were just defending our right to do in our house what 
we want to he said 
fisher said kessler rejected his appeal to work out a neighborly 
compromise and now hes not optimistic for an amicable resolution 
we really dont speak to them we dont like what theyre 
doing and they wont cut it out he said

argentinas dante captuo the new general 
assembly president wasted no time in telling the 159nation body 
it must close the economic gulf between rich and poor nations 
as the argentine foreign minister took the gavel after his 
election tuesday he noted the remarkable difference between all 
the progress made toward ensuring world peace and the little or 
nothing we have done to prevent the widening of the gap between 
rich countries and a large part of the developing world 
caputo a 47yearold former political science professor 
defeated the only other candidate for the presidency of the 
159member general assembly barbados un ambassador dame nita 
barrow by 9166 with one abstention during a single secret ballot 
the election the first order of business in the assemblys 43rd 
session was portrayed as a showdown between britain which backed 
mrs barrow and argentina its defeated foe in the 1982 falklands 
war 
caputo won the presidency with strong support from the soviet 
bloc the developing world japan and the nonaligned movement 
including india and pakistan said diplomats and observers 
dame nita also was backed by the caribbean nations and numerous 
commonwealth countries the united states was believed to have 
voted for her said observers 
although the presidency is largely ceremonial it has the power 
to set the tone of debate caputo took advantage of that provision 
in his opening speech in which he said the world body has been 
remiss in redressing economic imbalances 
one of the clearest examples of this impotence is probably the 
question of the external foreign debt of the developing 
countries he said 
these very high interest rates together with the pitiless 
system of successive refinancing plans and the perverse outflow of 
financial resources of the indebted countries to the creditors 
will end up eliminating the possibilities of investment for the 
developing world he said 
caputo helped bring argentina out of the international isolation 
it suffered under a series of military juntas from 19761983 and 
his speech reflected his alliance with the developing world 
as assembly president caputo can cut short speeches and arrange 
their order and has important informal powers to set up backstage 
meetings and compromises among delegateshe replaces outgoing 
president peter florin of east germany 
in his speech caputo cited recent un strides in addressing 
regional conflicts including the iraniraq truce the afghan 
accords a settlement in the western sahara and promoting dialogue 
between cypriot factions and warring cambodian parties 
but he added the situation in central america appears as a 
particularly painful contrast within the pattern of evolution of 
regional conflicts 
he also hailed the ussoviet arms agreement to destroy all 
intermediate nuclear missiles and called for the implementation of 
un resolutions that would grant a palestinian homeland and 
guarantee israels right to exist in peace with its arab neighbors 
he singled out south africas infamous practice of apartheid 
as an intransigent problem that constitutes a true affront to the 
moral conscience of mankind 
for the second year in a row secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar missed the sessions start he left tuesday for a trip to 
south africa his first in five years for talks on a regional 
peace settlement last year he was holding talks on ending the 
iraniraq war 
the assembly begins its threeweek general debate on monday when 
president reagan addresses the body

back into world diplomacy and out of its pariah status under 
military juntas that ruled from 197683 
caputo 47 is a former professor of political science who was 
virtually unknown before president raul alfonsin elected in 
october 1983 named him foreign minister he had supported alfonsin 
in a magazine he edited until 1983 
as alfonsin promoted democracy and human rights at home caputo 
promoted argentinas image as a liberal independent activist 
latin american nation 
alfonsin and caputo resolved a centuryold dispute with chile 
over the beagle channel in 1985 six years earlier the neighboring 
countries almost went to war over the three uninhabited islands in 
the south atlantic 
argentina has cut its military spending deeply it joined one 
group that demands international nuclear disarmament and a second 
group that is promoting a peaceful political solution to the wars 
in central america 
under caputo argentina has become active in the nonaligned 
movement denouncing apartheid in south africa criticizing britain 
for staying in northern ireland and supporting palestinians in 
their quest for a homeland 
argentina broke diplomatic relations with south africa in 1986 
in his own country caputo inspires strong reactions 
university students the opposition peronist party and leftist 
elements in his own radical civic union party enthusiastically 
support him the right despises him seeng him as an opportunist 
using the general assembly presidency as a stepping stone to 
argentinas presidency 
caputo offered himself as a presidential candidate for the 
radical civic union in 1983 but alfonsin won the nomination

politics he is the only remaining member of alfonsins original 
cabinet

relations at harvard and tufts in the boston area where he met his 
frenchborn wife

human rights will get high priority when 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze meets thursday and 
friday with secretary of state george shultz a state department 
official told a congressional panel tuesday 
but little hope remains for finalizing the planned superpower 
treaty cutting stocks of longrange nuclear ballistic missiles by 
50 percent assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway told the 
house foreign affairs subcommittee on european and middle eastern 
affairs 
shevardnadze is to arrive wednesday for his 28th meeting with 
shultz 
we will press the soviets to clear the books of the remaining 
human rights cases ms ridgway said among the us concerns to 
be addressed she said are exit permission for members of divided 
families separated spouses dual nationals and persons punished 
for religious activity including people jailed for trying to 
monitor human rights under the helsinki process 
we will push on emigration and positive progress would 
improve the prospects for concluding the review meeting at vienna 
she said we will also underscore the importance of the soviets 
pressing on with legal and other changes affecting the human rights 
environment in the soviet union 
ms ridgway said shultz hopes to tie down with the soviet 
foreign minister some of the complicated unresolved issues in the 
ongoing ussoviet negotiations on the start or strategic 
longrange arms treaty 
it is also hoped that shultz and shevardnadze will give a 
push to agreement on verification procedures for the unratified 
peaceful nuclear explosion and threshhold test ban treaties of the 
1970s she said 
if that happens the reagan administration would submit the 
pacts to the senate for ratification early in the next 
congress she said 
ms ridgway said the get together is the 28th for shultz and 
shevardnadze 
it may be their last meeting in washington but is not 
expected to be their last meeting she said mentioning the un 
general assembly both will attend next week in new york 
other occasions could follow she said noting that prospects 
for eastwest agreement at the current vienna review of the 1975 
helsinki conference may fall into place later this year

the us environmental protection 
agency on sunday plans to blow up a mystery container it believes 
contains cyanide if it can evacuate enough houses around a plant in 
nitro officials said late tuesday 
they plan to explode and burn a 30pound container of what may 
be filled with hydrogen cyanide they dont know if its full 
empty partly full or unstable if theres a problem it would 
spread up to 3000 feet said nitro mayor don karnes 
karnes said he was skeptical that there was much danger but 
said he would recommend residents heed the government agencys call 
for a voluntary evacuation around the closed artel chemical co 
nitro with about 8000 residents is about 12 miles west of 
charleston 
id rather err on the side of safety he said 
hydrogen cyanide is poisonous and can be fatal if inhaled or 
absorbed directly but it can be burned and its vapors contained 
federal officials took over the chemical plant after a roof 
collapsed on already leaking drums whose contents were not all 
identified 
the epa in july said the artel site was a potential 
emergency and a spokesman initially said that dangerous 
substances such as methyl mercaptan a chemical mixed in with 
natural gas to give it an odor stored at the plant could explode 
at any time officials later played down any danger 
a third epa emergency town meeting is scheduled for thursday 
evening at nitro junior high school 500 yards from the artel plant 
that tells me its probably not all that dangerous if it 
were they would have their meeting in beckley or parkersburg 
karnes said 
meanwhile area schools are to conduct a practice evacuation 
wednesday morning 
three schools in kanawha county and one in putnam county are to 
participate in the drill officials said 
county school officials said 28 buses would be sent to the 
schools to determine how long it would take to get students out of 
the area in the event there would be an explosion at the artel site

an electionyear bill requiring random drug 
and alcohol testing for railroad workers seems to be headed for a 
roadblock in the senate even though it has breezed through the 
house 
the chairman of the senate committee that oversees the 
transportation industry made that clear tuesday shortly after the 
house approved the testing legislation on an unopposed voice vote 
a spokesman for senate commerce committee chairman sen ernest 
hollings dsc said hollings prefers a senate version of the 
bill that would also extend a wideranging testing program to 
airline and trucking industry workers 
spokesman emilio pardo said hollings would block the legislation 
unless he was able to expand it to get all three modes 
protected railroads trucking and airlines 
time is also working against the drugtesting bill the 
congressional leadership is hoping lawmakers can adjourn for the 
year by midoctober 
congress began working on drug testing legislation shortly after 
the jan 4 1987 collision between a loaded amtrak passenger train 
and threelinked conrail engines in chase md after the disaster 
in which 16 people were killed and 175 injured two conrail 
crewmen admitted they had been smoking marijuana shortly before 
their train ran through stop signals and into the path of the 
amtrak train 
the legislation was held up for months because rail unions and 
their supporters in congress argued that the tests could be 
inaccurate might be used to harass workers and would be an 
invasion of privacy 
labor leaders finally dropped their opposition this summer 
saying they were satisfied with provisions designed to protect 
workers from erroneous laboratory results 
this bill will make sure we dont have another chase crash 
the bills sponsor rep thomas a luken dohio said after the 
vote 
another sponsor rep bob whittaker rkan called the measure 
a comprehensive preventive and humane program 
supporters say random testing would deter the consumption of 
alcohol and illegal drugs by rail employees the bill also would 
require testing after accidents for reasonable cause before 
hiring and as a part of annual physical examinations 
workers who test positive would be suspended without pay they 
would have their jobs restored to them if they successfully 
complete a rehabilitation program 
shortly before the house approved the drug testing bill the 
senate commerce committee rejected legislation that would have made 
it easier for shippers who believe the rates they are charged by 
railroads are too high to appeal to the government for help 
on a 109 vote the panel rejected a bipartisan bill that would 
have revised the 1980 staggers rail act which deregulated the 
railroad industry the committees action effectively killed the 
legislation until congress returns next year 
large segments of the coal agriculture utilities chemical and 
other industries which often have no alternative to rail shipping 
have been complaining since 1980 that the interstate commerce 
commission has been doing little to protect shippers against 
excessive prices charged by railroads 
captive shippers are being done wrong said one of the 
sponsors sen john d rockefeller dwva referring to 
industries that must use railroads 
rockefellers bill would have changed the complex formula the 
icc uses to decide whether rates are fair in some cases for 
example the burden of proof would be shifted to the railroads for 
demonstrating that their rates are fair 
some opponents mainly republicans argued that the icc was 
doing a good job of deciding rate cases while others said the 
legislation would be unlikely to be enacted this year because of 
opposition in the house and by president reagan 
in other congressional action 
the senate commerce committee approved a bill providing extra 
federal aid to states that adopt several programs aimed at reducing 
drunken driving among the initiatives the bill would encourage is 
the immediate confiscation of a drivers license if he or she fails 
a chemical test for intoxication or refuses to take such a test 
the house voiced approval for legislation requiring the federal 
aviation administration to devote 15 percent of its research budget 
to the study of airplane fire safety aircraft maintenance human 
performance and the use of computer simulation models 
the house also on a voice vote directed the faa to conduct 
research on how new equipment has effected the performance of air 
traffic controllers

education leaders have held the first national 
conference on how to improve teaching about the life of slain civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr 
participants on tuesday said many schools suffer from a lack of 
teacher understanding about kings political and philosophical 
record as well as a shortage of course materials 
you cannot simply go out and say im going to teach about the 
life of dr king unless you know about his life unless you 
understand and have resources available said mary futrell 
president of the national education association 
other speakers at the threeday conference conceded they did not 
know enough about king and his campaign for nonviolent social 
change to instruct on the topic 
one problem is that no one has ever been really taught about 
king said gordon ambach of the council of chief state school 
officers that curriculum was certainly before my time 
added manya ungar president of the national parents and 
teachers association 
you have to recognize that an association like mine is 
predominantly white anglosaxon protestant middle class and 
suburban the board members with which i deal with are not 
reflective of the greater society particularly that portion of 
society which increasingly has problems getting their voices heard 
and their agenda addressed 
parents have got to educate themselves and find out who 
martin luther king was ms unger said she noted that her group 
was in touch with other organizations such as the antidefamation 
league to help with producing literature by next june 
we hope to have literature aimed at the parents talking 
about how we either overtly or covertly teach prejudice teach 
racism or perpetuate this cycle of hatred and violence she said 
the washington conference was sponsored by the education 
committee of the federal holiday commission and the martin luther 
king jr center for nonviolent social change 
futrell said she hoped the conference would be the first of 
many to focus on the question of how to better prepare courses on 
king and his accomplishments

plans to set an eightyear deadline for 
finishing safety reviews of hundreds of pesticides sprayed on crops 
are on their way to the senate after gaining easy approval in the 
house 
getting this bill to the presidents desk is my top priority 
as we wrap up this congressional session e kika de la 
garza dtexas chairman of the house agriculture committee said 
tuesday as the house approved the measure on a voice vote 
the environmental protection agency would be required to 
complete safety reviews of some 600 pesticides within eight years 
under the bill the research is designed to end use of the most 
hazardous chemicals and limit use of others that present health 
dangers 
not until the year 2024 would the agency finish the reviews at 
the present pace according to the general accounting office thus 
far no deadline has been set for the research which began in the 
mid1970s 
business and government would share storage and disposal costs 
and a program under which the agency has paid 20 million to 
manufacturers to buy up stocks of banned pesticides would be 
largely ended under the threeyear reauthorization of the federal 
insecticide fungidice and rodenticide act 
the senate already has passed a similar bill and appeared likely 
to act on the house version in the three to four weeks remaining 
before lawmakers adjourn to campaign full time at home 
most envirionmentalists however are at most lukewarm to the 
bill a barebones measure without a number of provisions they 
support such as stepped up federal monitoring of groundwater 
which represents the basic drinking supply for millions of 
americans 
government research has shown some pesticides can lead to cancer 
in laboratory animals and other severe health problems 
pesticides an outgrowth of world war ii chemical warfare 
research are now found in residue form in many fruits and 
vegetables and even animal tissues that find their way onto the 
american dinner table every day 
environmentalists have been campaigning with minimal success to 
tighten pesticide regulation since 1962 when naturalist rachel 
carson spotlighted the problem with her bestselling silent 
spring 
some environmentalists ripped into the house on tuesday for 
approving the threeyear measure they said it would take the issue 
off the agenda without addressing some of the most serious problems 
were not willing to put pesticide regulation on the back 
burner for three to four years said jay feldman of the national 
coalition against the misuse of pesticides thats not any kind 
of message to be sending out to people who are facing chemicals 
in their drinking water chemicals in their workplace and chemicals 
in their food 
we think the bill is meaningless said dave baker political 
director of the friends of the earth he said the measure would 
guarantee inaction until 1992 
but janet s hathaway senior projects attorney of the natural 
resources defense council said the bill represents a plus for the 
environmental cause because it guarantees that key issues such as 
groundwater monitoring will have the spotlight to themselves next 
year 
de la garza acknowledged that the measure did not go as far as 
some would have liked 
this is the art of the possible this will not satisfy hardly 
anyone but this is what we can do at this point he said 
farmers have been highly suspicious of legislation they fear 
would ban or raise the cost of pesticides which are a fundamental 
part of their business

a congressional study says trans world 
airlines fares rose sharply at its st louis hub after it became 
the airports dominant carrier through a governmentapproved merger 
the report on tuesday by the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress found that twa fares at st louis 
increased more than twice the national average after the companys 
1986 merger with ozark air lines 
in addition the gao said travelers from lambertst louis 
international airport had fewer choices of competing airlines to 
many destinations after the merger 
the report is expected to add new fuel to the debate over 
deregulation and criticism that it has given airline industry 
survivors nearmonopoly powers producing higher fares and 
restricted service in some areas 
don morrison a spokesman for twa in st louis said he had not 
seen a copy of the report and could not comment on its contents 
sen john danforth rmo who requested the study said 
lawmakers need to consider the possiblity of some type of air fare 
regulation in light of the gao findings 
at a minimum congress should consider steps to foster 
competition at concentrated airports by removing obstacles to new 
carriers and boosting airport expansion to make room for new 
carriers said danforth 
the commerce committee is to hold a hearing on thursday on the 
issue of airline concentration at hub airports and danforth vowed 
to raise the subject of air fare regulation 
twa handled 56 percent of the passengers at the st louis 
airport before the merger but that grew to 82 percent in 1987 
according to gao no other airline has more than 3 percent of the 
airport market 
after the merger twa provided service to more cities than it 
and ozark combined had served before the acquisition however gao 
said the total number of destinations for st louis travelers 
dropped and more routes were served by single carriers after the 
merger 
the report found 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
twas average fares rose between 13 percent and 18 percent in 
1987 for 67 nonstop routes served by twa and ozark at the time of 
the merger during that same period the air fare portion of the 
consumer price index increased 5 percent to 6 percent nationally 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
twas average fares increased 13 percent to 19 percent on 53 
nonstop routes from st louis in which it competed with other 
airlines while the competitors raised their rates by no more 8 
percent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
smaller increases for twas fares from kansas city to those 
same 53 cities than the companys flights out of its st louis hub 
although twas kansas city fares rose no more than 13 percent 
competitors generally had falling ticket prices during the period 
6 percent to 8 percent less 
gao said kansas city was used for the comparison because twas 
market share there was not affected appreciably by its acquisition 
of ozark and travel distances to the cities were similar to those 
from st louis 
twa according to the report attributed the increases to 
unusually low fares in 1986 when it was engaged in a price 
competition with ozark and was trying to bounce back from an 
employee strike in addition the company said rates rose last year 
because it served more business travelers who generally pay higher 
fares

although this years drought apparently has 
slowed the recovery in us farmland prices the agriculture 
department says appraisers are optimistic for a healthy increase in 
1989 
rural appraisers surveyed in august by the departments economic 
research service reported only a 12 percent increase nationally in 
farmland values for may june and july compared with a 18 percent 
gain in the first quarter of the year 
while the appreciation rate for farmland could continue to 
slow in coming months the appraisers were more bullish for the 
year ahead expecting a 46 percent rise in values the agency 
said tuesday last may surveyed appraisers anticipated only a 
36 percent gain for the coming year 
farmland prices began rising in 1987 ending a sixyear decline 
that was part of the worst financial crunch in us agriculture 
since the depression 
one of the reasons for optimism about land prices is the 
improvement in farm income the last year or so in a related 
report the agency released new 1987 farm income statistics which 
showed last years state rankings for the first time california 
as usual headed the list 
nine of the top 10 states for net farm income in 1987 were there 
in 1986 the economic research service said north carolina 
replaced washington in 1987 
the top 10 states accounted for 54 percent of total us net 
farm income in 1987 compared with 545 percent in 1986 
the new preliminary state estimates for 1987 showed net farm 
income nationally at 463 billion up more than 23 percent from 
calendar 1986 
economists said the largest percentage increases were in 
wyoming south carolina maine louisiana mississippi and nevada 
the wyoming and nevada gains were due largely to increased 
value of livestock product marketings the report said higher 
cattle prices and livestock inventory reductions contributed 
improved farm income in south carolina maine louisiana and 
mississippi resulted from increased production and higher prices 
for tobacco potatoes cotton and cottonseed generally production 
increased from a relatively poor year in 1986 
net farm income is the difference between gross farm income and 
total expenses during a calendar year and measures the profit or 
loss associated with production in a given year 
additions to inventories are treated as income and allowances 
are made for nonmoney items such as depreciation the 
consumption of farmgrown food and the net rental value of 
dwellings 
the agency also uses a method of accounting for net cash 
income which is the difference between gross cash income and 
cash expenses current sales from inventories produced in other 
years are counted as gross income 
net cash income is often preferred by some economists since it 
shows how much actual money farmers have to spend during a year in 
1987 net cash income was estimated at a record 571 billion 
compared with the net income of 463 billion 
the usda has forecast 1988 net farm income may be in the range 
of 38 billion to 43 billion and that net cash income could be 55 
billion to 60 billion 
net farm income is typically much more volatile than net cash 
income because weather often causes sharp changes in production 
that lead to swings in inventory values the report said 
here are the leading states for net farm income as reported 
tuesday by the agriculture department ranked in order for 1987 
with 1987 income in the first column and 1986 income in the second 
in millions of dollars

prosecutors are seeking dismissal of charges 
against former cia agent joseph fernandez that he lied about his 
role in the irancontra arms and money affair so they can move his 
trial out of washington 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh filed the motion tuesday 
in response to the refusal by fernandez to stand trial in the 
nations capital for offenses that allegedly occurred in virginia 
walsh said he planned to seek to indict fernandez in alexandria 
va on all the charges against fernandez including the allegation 
that he conspired to deliver arms illegally to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels and later lied about the clandestine supply network 
the indictment says the alleged conspiracy took place in 
washington and elsewhere 
but fernandez the cias former station chief in costa rica 
also is accused of four counts of lying about the operation to his 
superiors and the presidential commission headed by former sen 
john tower rtexas that investigated the irancontra affair 
those offenses allegedly occurred in langley va at cia 
headquarters 
prosecutors asked us district judge aubrey e robinson jr to 
dismiss all five counts saying that the interest of judicial 
economy and fundamental fairness dictate that the case should not 
be splintered into unwieldy separate proceedings 
rather the case should be dismissed as a whole at that 
point the government will represent the case to a grand jury in 
the eastern district of virginia a forum to which the defendant 
has no colorable objection prosecutors said in their brief 
the indictment returned june 20 accused fernandez 51 of 
conspiring in 1985 and 1986 with former national security council 
aide oliver l north and arms dealer richard v secord to ship arms 
to the contras 
fernandez who operated in central america under the cia 
pseudonym tomas castillo was accused of overseeing the 
construction of an airstrip in costa rica from which planes flew to 
drop supplies to the nicaraguan rebels 
to obtain a new indictment from a federal grand jury in 
alexandria prosecutors would be able to summarize their case and 
present transcripts of the original grand jury testimony of 
witnesses against fernandez

a pioneering surgeon wants congress to enact 
legislation to spare families the pain of making emotional public 
appeals for money to pay for organ transplants 
transplant surgeon thomas e starzl joined the wife of a heart 
transplant patient in testifying before a senate finance 
subcommittee tuesday on behalf of legislation to create a 
taxpayerfinanced fund for organ transplants 
the trust fund would draw from a checkoff on federal tax 
returns enabling citizens to direct portions of their tax refund 
to help needy patients in their state pay for operations to receive 
new hearts livers kidneys or other organs 
the idea starzl told the subcommittee on taxation is to end 
the need for families to go public as a last resort to saving 
family members who will die without organ transplants 
i can tell you from direct experience that these are desperate 
ventures which take a frightful psychological toll on families and 
patients said starzl a professor of surgery at the university 
of pittsburgh who is regarded as the leader of the flourishing 
transplant field 
they are literally forced to advertise a dying child or adult 
to the public in hopes that out of compassion the public will 
respond he said 
rep doug walgren dpa told the panel that patients survival 
should not depend on their political connections where they 
live or the generosity of their friends family and neighbors 
in one wellpublicized case wellwishers from around the 
country donated more than 350000 and president reagan pitched in 
1000 to help pay the medical expenses of 3yearold tabatha 
foster she died last may after undergoing a rare fiveorgan 
transplant 
sherry clifton of silver spring md told the panel she 
contacted the united way the red cross news organizations and 
even washington redskins football players to try to raise 30000 
for a deposit on her 49yearold husbands heart transplant in 1984 
finally she said she called the white house and was directed to 
a public liaison who was able to secure financing from the state of 
maryland and other sources to help pay hospital bills for hardie 
clifton amounting to more than 200000 
the liaison michael batten was in the hearing room tuesday and 
said in an interview that mrs clifton has not forgotten his 
efforts she sends me a christmas card every year said batten 
now a private health consultant 
but mrs clifton said her husband received his new heart only 
because i was strong enough to fight everyone does not have the 
same strength 
i cannot see how the leaders of our country can approve a 
500000 renovation project to house two pandas and be willing to 
allow human beings to die because there is no money available for 
transplants she said 
in 1972 the government renovated a rhinoceros facility at the 
national zoo to accommodate pandas lingling and hsinghsing who 
were gifts from china zoo spokesman robert hoage said he was not 
certain the renovation amounted to 500000 but that it probably 
cost several hundred thousand dollars 
walgren is the author of the house bill whose companion is 
being sponsored by sen dale bumpers dark in the senate 
the bill is needed because the financing of transplants is a 
crazy quilt of insurance coverage bumpers said 
medicare pays for all kidney transplants but the health 
programs support for other transplants is limited witnesses said 
medicaid coverage varies widely from state to state

a senate panel says it will meet next january 
to recommend whether a committee or the full senate will hear 
evidence in the impeachment trial of us district judge alcee l 
hastings of miami 
in a report approved 90 tuesday the senate rules committee 
said the chamber has clear authority to appoint an impeachment 
committee for the second time in the nations history and to 
continue proceedings that began this year into the next congress 
the report which went to the senate leadership said the rules 
panel would conduct a hearing the week of jan 23 and issue a 
report the following week on whether the committee approach was 
proper for the hastings case 
hastings wants the full senate to hear testimony on allegations 
that he conspired with a washington dc attorney to arrange a 
bribe from two racketeers 
if only 12 senators were receiving the testimony by 
definition 88 would be unmindful of what transpired hastings 
said after the report was issued i dont want my trial decided 
at the press club or the george washington hotel i want them all 
there seeing it and judging it for themselves 
hastings said the decision to defer his trial which he 
estimated would last 21 days until next year showed how little 
appetite congress has for impeachments 
the bottom line is political everybody knows that the 
business of the senate is complex and sizable and that impeachment 
is not political fun said hastings 
my case is a classic test case to let the american people know 
that a constitutional amendment needs to be circulated to determine 
if judicial accountability should be handled by something other 
than congress he said 
the house in an action tantamount to an indictment voted 4133 
to approve 17 articles of impeachment on aug 3 the case then went 
to the senate for trial where conviction by a twothirds majority 
would remove hastings from his lifetime job that now pays 
89500ayear 
the main impeachment article accuses hastings of conspiring with 
washington attorney william borders in 1981 to obtain a 150000 
payment from two convicted racketeers in exchange for lenient 
sentencing and return of forfeited assets 
the rules panel said there are numerous impeachment cases in 
which congress carried over proceedings from one congress to the 
next most involving cases in which the house continued its 
inquiries from congress to congress the rules committee said 
in two cases senate proceedings were continued from one 
congress to the next 
the full senate sat as an impeachment jury and as judges for all 
impeachment cases until the trial of former us district judge 
harry e claiborne in 1986 
in claibornes case a 12member committee heard testimony for 
seven days in september 1986 before the full senate convened as a 
jury in october and convicted the thenlas vegas nev judge 
hastings is the first us government official to face 
impeachment after winning acquittal in a criminal trial based on 
the same charges he also is the first black to go through the 
impeachment process in which congress determines whether an 
official should be removed from office 
hastings lawyer terence j anderson has filed legal papers 
that agree with the committees recommendation to hold the 
proceedings next year 
the rules committee also recommended that house managers of the 
case who function as prosecutors and hastings be prepared to 
proceed with witnesses by march 1

patrons reading burger kings paper tray liners are 
finding the fastfood chain has served up us history its way 
but not necessarily the right way 
promotional material for the miamibased companys education 
enriches everyone campaign incorrectly credits thomas jefferson 
with writing the us constitution it also lists the wrong birth 
year for president lyndon johnson 1903 instead of 1908 
the information was published on millions of tray liners and is 
part of a promotion that includes bookmarks and about 35000 
posters to be mailed to classrooms across the nation 
according to the tray liners before thomas jefferson could 
pen our constitution he was schooled in history 
actually jefferson didnt even attend the constitutional 
convention he did however write the declaration of independence 
and initially objected to the constitutions lack of protection for 
human rights 
when the misinformation was brought to burger kings attention 
monday company officials conferred with the block group of new 
york the public relations firm that created the promotional 
material 
barbara gothard the burger king executive in charge of the 
campaign called johnsons birth date a genuine typographical 
error but held fast to the notion that jefferson did pen the 
constitution 
our research shows us that in 1787 madison actually sent a 
copy of the constitution to jefferson in france so that in a sense 
jefferson penned the constitution said ms gothard who as 
director of corporate affairs was among the last to review the 
advertising material before publication 
use of the term pen is a play on words ms gothard said 
ms gothard said burger king will contact store managers 
regarding johnsons incorrect birth date but will leave the 
constitution among jeffersons credits

the state department is praising as a 
positive step an iraqi pledge that appears to rule out future 
use of chemical weapons either against foreign adversaries or the 
countrys rebellious kurdish minority population 
us officials expressed hope tuesday that the promise made by 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz will head off the possibility of 
congressional approval of economic sanctions against iraq 
following what the state department said was convincing evidence 
that iraq had used chemical weapons against its kurdish population 
the senate two weeks ago approved comprehensive sanctions against 
iraq including a ban on agricultural and export credits 
the state department called the senate action premature and 
pressured iraq to issue a firm statement declaring that it would no 
longer engage in chemical warfare 
officials complained that the legislation could hurt american 
exporters more than the iraqis and said it was taken up without 
prior consultation with the executive branch 
azizs statement asserted that iraq respects and abides by all 
the provisions of international law concerning use of chemical 
weapons state department spokesman charles redman said 
the house foreign affairs committee is expected to take up iraqi 
sanctions legislation on thursday it is not clear what impact 
azizs statement will have on committee members 
this is a positive step redman said we take it to mean 
that iraq forswears the use of chemical weapons in internal as well 
as international conflict we will be watching closely to see that 
this commitment is carried out 
on sept 8 secretary of state george p shultz accused iraq of 
unjustifiable and abhorrent behavior in using chemical weapons 
against its kurdish minority 
iraq has denied the us charges calling them absolutely 
baseless but american officials contend that chemical warfare 
contributed to the exodus of tens of thousands of kurds from iraq 
to turkey 
redman said the iraqi statement referred to the 1925 geneva 
protocol barring chemical weapons use in international conflicts 
and to other agreements that carry the weight of international law 
he indicated that iraqi use of chemical weapons against the 
kurds would not violate the geneva agreement because of the 
domestic nature of that conflict 
he said use of chemical weapons during a civil conflict is 
barred by a 1949 protocol that deals with war victims and azizs 
statement appeared to cover that agreement 
aziz said on monday he would not agree to hold peace talks with 
iran in new york because i cant go to a town where there is a 
campaign against the arabs an apparent reference to us 
hostility against his country 
he agreed to one facetoface meeting with irans foreign 
minister in new york in early october but he ruled out additional 
discussions there for political security and practical reasons

six international treaties designed to help 
us investigators prosecute drug traffickers are being blocked by 
republican senators despite administration support the democratic 
chairman of a senate narcotics subcommittee charged 
you dont fight a war on drugs by depriving the soldiers of 
the weapons they need to fight the war theres a lot of rhetoric 
and not a lot of action said sen john f kerry chairman of the 
senate foreign relations subcommittee on terrorism narcotics and 
international communications 
but the massachusetts democrat on tuesday refused to identify 
the republicans he believes have held up the mutual legal 
assistance treaties saying only that they know who they are 
deborah demoss a republican aide on the senate foreign 
relations committee called the democrats charge absolutely 
false and a fantasy 
she said sen jesse helms of north carolina the top committee 
republican has concerns about the pacts and plans to offer 
amendments but said that he has been prepared to discuss the 
proposals all along ms demoss said only kerry and helms have 
shown interest in the treaties and she blamed the delay in action 
on a general lack of interest by other senators on both sides of 
the aisle 
a committee vote on ratification of the six treaties is 
scheduled for thursday 
the treaties are with the bahamas mexico the cayman islands 
thailand belgium and canada 
under the agreements the united states would receive 
information such as bank documents criminal records and 
depositions directly from those nations making it easier for 
investigators to follow moneylaundering paper trails 
ms demoss said helms is worried that nations such as the 
bahamas which has had political figures linked to drug 
trafficking cannot be trusted with information provided by the 
united states she declined to provided specifics about his planned 
amendments 
kerry said he too is skeptical about the bahamas and other 
nations but said the treaties are needed to see if they have 
changed and are willing to cooperate 
i dont think this nation can be critical of the governments 
of other countries for their lack of cooperation when we turn 
around and refuse to cooperate he said at a capitol news 
conference

congress is nearing final action on a plan 
designed to reduce us dependence on foreign oil foster a cleaner 
environment and cause motorists to say fillerup with corn coal 
or natural gas 
by a voice vote the senate on tuesday gave its blessing to 
legislation its 64 cosponsors hope will promote commercial 
development and production of cars trucks and buses that run on 
alternative fuels 
the vote capping four years of hearings and negotiations left 
the alternative fuels proposal a blending of similar house and 
senate bills just a perfunctory house vote away from going to 
president reagans desk 
the bill sponsored principally on the senate side by jay 
rockefeller dwva seeks to spur the wide commercial development 
of cars trucks and buses that can operate on such fuels as 
methanol ethanol and natural gas 
this is a landmark piece of legislation and represents the 
first major step toward a national energy policy in nearly a 
decade rockefeller said this legislation increases energy 
security options and provides for a cleaner environment 
the bill provides that for each alternativefuel car produced 
and sold the manufacturer would get large credits that would make 
it easier to meet the governments minimum fuel economy 
requirements for the manufacturers entire fleet 
as a further incentive the department of energy would be 
authorized to begin spending 18 million in late 1989 to buy and 
test alternative fuel cars trucks and buses offered by 
manufacturers 
backers say that widespread use of alternative fuels would not 
only help combat urban air pollution but also aid in the 
stillinfant response to the socalled greenhouse effect or the 
warming of the earths climate 
supporters say the united states has abundant supplies of 
natural gas the coal that is used to produce methanol and the 
grains that are the roots of ethanol 
currently methanol and ethanol are available as fuels in some 
parts of the country but most vehicles experience problems if more 
than 5 percent to 10 percent is blended into gasoline 
all three alternative fuels produce less of the carbon and other 
greenhouse pollutants that scientists say are collecting in the 
atmosphere and trapping heat from the sun 
sen jack danforth rmo who introduced similar legislation in 
1984 and cosponsored rockefellers bill said that the 
legislation is a grand slam for energy independence 
increased use of alternative fuels will reduce our dangerous 
dependence on foreign oil he said alternative fuels will help 
clean up our environment by reducing harmful auto emissions

out of the glare of the presidential campaign 
a bipartisan commission is quietly crafting a proposed solution to 
the federal budget deficit that would include cuts in social 
security and defense spending as well as possible increases in 
consumption taxes 
that is the word from democrat robert strauss who is 
cochairman of the 12member commission along with republican drew 
lewis 
strauss provided a tantalizing glimpse tuesday of what options 
the panel is considering recommending to the new president the 
panel concerned about becoming embroiled in the presidential 
campaign has purposely kept out of the public eye since july 
strauss indicated that work has been going on behind the scenes 
and he said the commission will resume holding public hearings 
immediately after the nov 8 election the commission would like to 
finish its work by dec 21 
the commission which is split evenly between democrats and 
republicans was created by congress last year in an attempt to 
break the impasse between president reagans refusal to increase 
taxes and the refusal of the democraticcontrolled congress to cut 
government spending enough to bring the deficit under control 
strauss said the group probably will recommend a four or 
fiveyear plan to eliminate the deficit which this year is 
expected to total about 152 billion 
social security benefits medicare and other entitlement 
programs and defense spending will have to be cut strauss said 
since they account for 68 percent of total spending 
strauss said the commission was aware of the political firestorm 
likely to be triggered by such suggestions 
that means you are withholding money from the sick the 
elderly and the defense of the nation he said 
strauss said top priority will be given to spending cuts and 
only after they are exhausted would the commission look at possible 
tax increases as a way of balancing the budget 
his comments marked the most detailed discussion yet of where 
the commission is headed the panel has been criticized for not 
holding public meetings in the past several months opting instead 
to hold informal discussions with less than a quorum present in 
order to avoid requirements of the government in the sunshine law 
but strauss defended this approach saying the commissions 
chances of success would be doomed if the presidential candidates 
were forced to take a stand now on every proposal the panel was 
considering 
democrat michael dukakis has indicated a willingness to listen 
to the groups recommendations but republican george bush has 
vowed to ignore any calls for a tax increase 
on the revenue side strauss said the commission was examining 
boosting socalled sin taxes such as federal levies on cigarettes 
and alcohol strauss said that other types of consumption taxes 
also would be considered 
while strauss did not talk about gasoline taxes in his 
presentation there have been published reports that a hike in the 
gasoline tax of up to 50 cents is among the tax options the 
commission is studying 
strauss said the panel probably will make some recommendations 
on reforming the budget process examining such issues as twoyear 
instead of annual budgets and a presidential line item veto 
strauss conceded that bushs hard line stance against taxes 
could jeopardize chances for success the presidentelect will 
nominate the final two members of the panel after the election and 
those two officials are expected to be crucial to reaching an 
agreement 
i would hope that after november 8 bush would take a closer 
look strauss said certainly former treasury secretary james 
baker one of his principal economic advisers knows we have to do 
something about the deficit 
strauss comments came during a twoday conference on the 
economic problems which will face the next president the top 
economic advisers to both bush and dukakis were participants in the 
program 
lawrence summers a harvard economics professor who is advising 
dukakis said it will be critical for the next president to deal 
quickly with the twin budget and trade deficits as well as the 
third world debt problem 
however some republicans at the conference said they were not 
convinced that the deficit problem would be a critical issue for 
the next president 
richard rahn chief economist of the us chamber of commerce 
and an economic adviser to bush said the vice presidents proposal 
for a flexible freeze on government spending would bring the 
deficit very close to balance within five years through growth in 
federal revenues 
rep jack kemp rny said it was his fervent hope that the 
recommendations of the national economic commission will be 
routinely delivered into the dustbin of history 
other members of the commission include chrysler corp chairman 
lee iacocca aflcio president lane kirkland and former defense 
secretary casper weinberger

a study by national cancer institute 
scientists shows that mammogram examinations every one to two years 
can reduce breast cancer deaths by 24 percent among women aged 40 
to 49 
the conclusion came from a detailed analysis of data from a 
clinical trial begun 18 years ago by the health insurance plan of 
greater new york researchers said it is the first comprehensive 
study to prove that mammograms can be an important lifesaving 
screening technique for women under the age of 50 
this is the first statistically significant evidence of the 
benefits for this age group said kenneth chu lead author of the 
nci analysis 
evidence has been clear for some time he said that there is a 
significant benefit in mammographic screening among women aged 50 
and above but whether these benefits apply to women between the 
ages 40 and 50 has been a matter of controversy chu said 
perhaps the new data will encourage those people who do not 
currently advocate mammography for women under 50 to reassess their 
position he said 
by analyzing the health insurance plan data over a longer 
followup period chu said it becomes clear that consistent 
screening among the younger women can lead to significant 
reductions in breast cancer mortality 
of 742 patients followed for at least 18 years the nci 
researchers found there were 24 percent fewer breast cancer deaths 
among women who had been screened at ages 40 to 49 when compared 
with those in a nonscreened group 
though mammography for the younger women has been recommended 
for some time by the american cancer society and others chu said a 
number of experts have said it was not cost effective for women in 
their 40s to use the screening procedures he said it takes time to 
develop breast cancer and that the disease is much more frequent 
among those over 50 as a result said chu some experts felt that 
not enough cancer would be found among women in their 40s to 
justify mammographic examinations 
charles smart another nci researcher said the health insurance 
plan data is based on the results of mammograms that used the 
technology of the 1960s he said benefits may be even greater when 
more modern cancer detection technology is used 
he said the health insurance plan studies showed that 
mammography in the 1960s could detect only about 39 percent of the 
breast cancers in women aged 40 to 49 another study shows that the 
improved mammographic technologies of the 1970s could detect 91 
percent of the breast cancers he said 
with the 1980s technology that benefit could be much 
greater perhaps even doubled when compared with 1960s 
technology smart said 
he said the newer mammographic procedures use less radiation and 
have a greater sensitivity than the procedures used in the 1960s 
mammography uses an xray technique to detect the presence of 
lesions such as tumors within the breast

something about george bush drives his 
political opponents to wage class warfare against him 
democrat geraldine ferraro tried it in 1984 and republican bob 
dole used that approach during the 1988 gop primaries 
now its michael dukakis turn 
here is how the democratic presidential candidate describes the 
difference between bush and himself on education 
between those who believe that good education ought to be the 
property of a few and those who believe it is the birthright of 
every american no matter who they are or where they come from or 
what the color of their skin 
in a text of that speech distributed to reporters the words 
property and few are underlined 
bush took note of the dukakis approach when he accused his 
democratic opponent of pursuing a strategy of emphasizing 
differences between rich and poor between one region of the 
country and another 
by now bush should be accustomed to that kind of attack 
a product of privilege who grew up in the moneyed confines of 
greenwich conn the son of a banker and us senator bush became 
the butt of jibes about his geewhiz preppiness during the 1980 
campaign for the republican presidential nomination a contest in 
which his very eastern image didnt stand up well against westerner 
ronald reagan 
so often during the past eight years bush was seen publicly 
struggling to shuck that image 
this is the real me he told reporters at cuzzin richies 
truckstop in greenland nh as he climbed into the cab of an 
18wheeler this is my home turf 
moments earlier inside the woodframe singlestory restaurant 
this patrician trucker had prepared to hit the road by ordering a 
splash of tea 
bush was in political trouble back then the new hampshire 
primary was fast approaching and the vice president had just been 
soundly whipped in iowa by republican rival dole who relished 
reminding crowds that im from russell kan and proud of it 
then the senator would say getting where ive gotten wasnt 
because of any wealth in my family or because i had a powerful 
father or mother 
ferraro also liked to cite her humble beginnings her italian 
immigrant parents and going to law school at night 
not long before she would debate bush the democratic vice 
presidential nominee joked that shed seen his briefing book and 
found the following lines gosh gee whiz zippidy doo dah and 
lets win win win 
of course bush often provided the best material for his 
opponents 
he explained his defeat in a gop straw poll one saturday in 
october 1987 this way 
a lot of people that support me they were off at the air 
show they were off at their daughters comingout party or they 
were off teeing up on the golf course 
democratic strategists are convinced the bush preppy image is a 
good point of attack 
the more he is viewed as this guy from a privileged background 
from yale the better off we are said kam kawata a democratic 
consultant in california 
keep pounding away was his advice 
but so far those who have attacked bush on class grounds have 
not had much success 
reagan whipped bush in the gop primaries in 1980 and to a 
degree that was a contest between the dying eastern establishment 
wing of the party and the conservative populists personified first 
by barry goldwater and then by reagan 
but once reagan hit his stride in new hampshire that contest 
was never in doubt reagans hold on the hearts of republican 
rankandfile voters was too strong for bush to break the issue 
wasnt class it was heartstrings 
ferraro of course was on the losing end of a 49state 
landslide 
dole hammered away at bushs background to the very end of the 
gop campaign but to no avail 
it worked in iowa but not in new hampshire nor in the south 
where bush swept the super tuesday primaries

republican george bush today is closeted with 
his debate coaches practicing how to be presidential when he 
meets democratic opponent michael dukakis for their first 
facetoface encounter on sunday 
the gop presidential nominee will engage in a mock debate today 
with former deputy treasury secretary richard g darman playing the 
role of dukakis said a bush campaign source 
senior staff to the vice president were asked to submit 
questions on a variety of topics that might come up in the debate 
and several top advisers are involved in briefing bush on the 
answers said rich bond the campaigns national political director 
talking to reporters tuesday aboard the campaign plane bond 
described the debate preparation as diligent and said it will 
be used for sharpening him up 
he declined to be specific about the rehearsals but said you 
want to avoid costly mistakes and you want to come across as 
presidential 
what youve got to do at a debate at this level is be 
presidential 
bush has mentioned his own distaste for learning statistics but 
said he needs to review that kind of material 
but bond commented i dont think viewers will be 
overimpressed with a mechanical recitation of facts and figures 
theyll be more impressed with whether the candidates have a grasp 
of subjects 
the top aide made the comments as bush took a quick trip into 
new jersey where he put on a patriotic show by touring a flag 
manufacturing company and said flag sales are doing well and 
america is doing well 
bush who has sought to turn the pledge of allegiance into an 
election issue addressed a rally outside the annin flag co of 
bloomfield flanked by enormous american flag banners 
the flags you make fly over an america that today is stronger 
and more prosperous than at any time in its proud history bush 
told a group of several hundred people 
he made some references to the economic record of his opponent 
as governor of massachusetts but without the same verve as he has 
used to attack dukakis resume over the past several days 
its important to put all his dukakis claims into 
perspective before the debate bond said michael dukakis is 
not running away with the assertion that the massachusetts 
miracle is the best thing since sliced bread 
dukakis officials have heatedly denied most of the allegations 
raised by bush about the state of the massachusetts economy 
employement and taxation and have countered the bush figures with 
statistics of their own 
leading the bush debate strategy sessions are media adviser 
roger ailes campaign chairman james a baker iii and pollster 
robert teeter bond said 
after the new jersey speech bush got some debate pointers from 
patrons at the glenwood diner when he stopped for a cup of coffee 
and a slice of crumb cake 
several women in the diner told bush he looked better in person 
than on television he asked them why they thought so 
because youre relaxed suggested lucie galioto 
you may have something there the vice president said bush 
said he would have to work on appearing more relaxed in front of 
the cameras 
bond said new jersey is one of nine states the campaign sees as 
critical battlegrounds within the grasp of either candidate the 
other states bond cited are california ohio pennsylvania 
illinois missouri texas michigan and wisconsin

at a ussoviet forum on human rights 
local people saved some of their sharpest barbs for their own 
government 
participants from the southern soviet republic of georgia where 
a sixday friendship conference is being held accused their own 
officials of everything from treading on a local language to 
destroying a historic monastery 
the civil rights of my mother are being violated she is being 
forced out of her apartment with her daughter and her 
granddaughter one woman her voice trembling told the 500 
people packed into the screening room at the georgian filmmakers 
union building on tuesday 
the comment came on the second day of the annual conference that 
brings together soviet and american citizens it is sponsored by 
the chautauqua ny institution and the soviet 
governmentsanctioned friendship society 
tuesdays forum echoed the sharp exchanges that often embitter 
superpower negotiations on human rights 
american freedom rests on the bones of the indians said one 
soviet member of the audience in a comment to american panelists 
mark palmer us ambassador to hungary and spencer oliver chief 
counsel to the house foreign affairs committee 
some georgians however used the forum to call on authorities 
in moscow to redress their complaints 
guram mamoulia of tbilisi accused the soviet army of slowly 
destroying a historic georgian monastery by creating an artillery 
firing range nearby 
two of my comrades came here today wanting to show fragments 
of the shells that are destroying the monastery the stocky man 
said but they were barred from entering 
mamoulia appealed to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to 
intervene personally 
a complaint by another a georgian member of the audience was 
read aloud by levan a alexidze vice president of tbilisi state 
university 
why does the military continue to destroy major georgian 
monuments why are expelled moslem georgians denied their right of 
regaining citizenship why is there no factory for 
georgianlanguage typewriters 
soviet panelist igor f blishchenko one of his countrys 
experts on international law expressed irritation with the 
questions saying there were more important matters to discuss 
but palmer said we dont see anything small about a woman 
being deprived of her apartment 
only one of the georgians complaints was answered in detail an 
official from georgias agency for historic preservation said he 
had received a letter from defense minister dmitri t yazov saying 
the artillery range had been shortened and the direction of fire 
changed 
the most emotional exchanges between soviets and americans came 
during a discussion of soviet jews many of whom have been trying 
to leave the country for years 
oliver cited an israeli government figure that 350000 official 
invitations have been issued to soviet jews so they can leave the 
country 
samuel l zivs first deputy chairman of the statesanctioned 
soviet antizionist committee said jewish emigration this year had 
already topped 10000 and would reach 15000 by years end 
in contrast only 917 jews were allowed out in 1986 zivs said 
soviet officials indicated they thought the tone of the meetings 
had improved somewhat over the past two years but not enough 
leonid i dobrokhotov an official in the propaganda department 
in the communist party central committee said if american 
speakers in the past adopted the tone and spirit of a prosecutor 
here we have felt the tone of a teacher speaking to small children 
 
i share the attitude expressed by a number of soviet speakers 
that the best way to proceed would be to act as though we were all 
students and could learn from each other

a senate panel has approved a bill requiring 
warning labels on alcoholic beverages one lawmaker said the 
measure was an attempt to counter the alcohol industrys 2 
billionayear effort to glamorize their products 
the bill approved unanimously tuesday by the senate commerce 
committee would require labels stating that alcohol could impair 
driving abilities and cause birth defects and other health problems 
labeling is realistic it will work and i think we can move 
this bill through congress this year said sen ernest f 
hollings dsc chairman of the committee 
hollings said the bill was the first in the history of congress 
to call for labeling on alcohol 
the measure is a result of a compromise by sen strom thurmond 
rsc who has sought it for the past 19 years and sen wendell 
ford dky whose state is a major producer of whiskey it would 
require a single warning on bottles and cans of distilled spirits 
beer and wine and prohibit states from requiring additional warning 
labels 
this compromise boils it down to the two warnings that are 
most critical said sen albert gore dtenn referring to 
pregnancies and driving 
the measure was approved by the committee on a voice vote with 
no member objecting 
the public is entitled to the facts and they are not getting 
them from the alcohol industry thurmond said warning labels 
represent a modest attempt to counter the 2 billion spent each 
year by the alcohol industry to glamorize their product 
thurmond added i anticipate the bills passage by both houses 
of congress before we adjourn in october 
the required label would read government warning according 
to the surgeon general women should not drink alcohol during 
pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects consumption of 
alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate 
machinery and may cause other health problems 
a similar bill has been introduced in the house by rep john 
conyers dmich it was understood that conyers will ask the house 
to accept the compromise language assuming the bill gets through 
the senate

george bush used an american bar association 
questionnaire to criticize michael dukakis for his massachusetts 
prison furlough program while dukakis accused the reagan 
administration of eviscerating a program to provide legal services 
for the poor 
the two presidential contenders got in the digs while giving 
statements on lawrelated issues to be published in the aba 
journal the responses were released tuesday 
our no 1 priority should be to ensure that those convicted of 
violent crimes remain behind bars bush said when asked about the 
nations prisons i strongly condemn the concept of placing such 
felons on furloughs an idea embraced by gov dukakis or putting 
them in minimum security facilities 
dukakis the democratic nominee has come under repeated 
criticism for a massachusetts prison furlough program a convicted 
killer escaped while on furlough and raped and killed a woman in 
another state the program has since been changed 
as a partial solution to prison overcrowding i favor 
converting unnecessary military bases and other federal 
installations to prison use added bush the republican nominee 
dukakis praised his states intensive and highly successful 
probation and parole supervision project to reduce overcrowding in 
our prisons 
both men said the longterm solution to overcrowded prisons is 
construction of new prisons 
the candidates also were asked their views of the legal services 
corp the federally funded organization providing legal help to 
the poor 
president reagan actively has sought to abolish the organization 
but congress has refused 
bush said the agency plays an important role in providing 
legal services to the poor but said private attorneys also should 
offer free help to those who cannot afford to pay 
dukakis said while a dukakis administration will encourage 
private attorney involvement programs it is clear that pro bono 
work alone cannot meet the legal needs of the poor 
the budget of the legal services corp has been savaged over 
the past seven years and i will do all i can within the 
constraints of a massive federal budget deficit to strengthen our 
commitment to this vital program 
on affirmative action bush voiced opposition to racial quotas 
but added i do strongly support affirmative action programs 
designed to remedy past discrimination and intend to by taking 
aggressive steps to recruit minorities and other groups which 
because of past discrimination have not yet been able join fully 
the american mainstream 
the reagan administration has opposed broad use of affirmative 
action seeking to limit it as a legal remedy for only those people 
who themselves have been subjected to discriminatory treatment 
dukakis said that courts appropriate public institutions and 
local communities must have the ability to take whatever 
affirmative steps are necessary to wipe out the lingering effects 
of past discrimination

a bush administration will guarantee 
access to college for anybody who wants to go sen dan quayle told 
a university audience in pitching the republicans as the party of 
hopes and dreams 
at the university of nevadalas vegas the republican vice 
presidential nominee told 600 students and others tuesday we 
understand the importance of higher education and were going to 
make sure that anybody who wants to go to higher education will 
have access to higher education no matter what 
he did not elaborate but george bush has proposed allowing 
parents to earn interest taxfree on savings bonds for college and 
pledged his support of the pell grant program which president 
reagan once tried to curtail sharply 
quayle said people want to see change and i can say we are 
the party of change he repeatedly compared michael dukakis to 
former president jimmy carter 
gambling on another liberal sounding governor coming out of 
nowhere would be a far greater gamble than anything you find on las 
vegas strip he said 
quayle was flying to arizona today to visit an awardwinning 
elementary school in chandler and then to address the rotary club 
in phoenix the city where he spent eight years of his youth 
later he was headed to california and stops in fresno 
bakersfield and los angeles where he was reuniting with his wife 
marilyn after her first solo campaign swing 
the indiana senator at rallies in boise idaho and this 
gambling capital kept up his drumbeat of criticisms of michael 
dukakis 
in both idaho and nevada he accused dukakis of favoring broader 
federal control over water on public lands he charged that dukakis 
would let some washington bureaucracy make decisions that could 
adversely affect ranchers and farmers throughout the arid west 
but tom herman domestic policy adviser to the dukakis campaign 
said quayle is misrepresenting dukakis position 
once again dan quayle simply has his facts wrong herman 
said in boston but thats no surprise because he makes a habit 
of misunderstanding and misstating the facts 
mike dukakis believes that the federal government must 
recognize the primacy of state water laws particularly in the 
west that we must insure a steady and high quality water system as 
a backbone of the western economy 
quayle who once opposed raising the minimum wage said he now 
supports raising it from 335 to 4 an hour over the next two 
years coupled with a youth wage that would pay 80 percent of the 
minimum 
but quayle said even the 455 minimum wage that senate 
democrats are pressing for isnt enough for a single parent to 
raise a family on the answer is better training and education as 
well as an expanded earned income tax credit for the working poor 
he said 
on the plight of the 37 million americans with no health 
insurance quayle suggested experimenting with letting small 
businesses buy into the medicaid program to cover their workers 
quayle got a warm reception from the crowd of more than 1000 at 
the idaho capital he encountered some heckling at the las vegas 
campus but many in the audience joined in a chant of dukakis is 
a wimp

people say they would be better off 
financially if republican george bush rather than democrat michael 
dukakis were elected president according to a washington postabc 
news poll 
the poll also found bush more capable of holding down taxes and 
keeping the country out of war while dukakis was seen as clearly 
better at protecting the social security system 
the two were close on such personal characteristics as 
experience honesty ability to be trusted in a crisis and ability 
to get things done 
results of the survey of 1271 likely voters were published in 
todays editions of the post the survey begun a week ago today 
and finished monday found bush leading dukakis 50 percent to 46 
percent if the election were being held today 
last week a washington postabc news poll showed dukakis 
leading 4845 the 3point margin of error in both surveys meant 
the candidates were essentially tied 
fifty percent of the respondents said they would be personally 
better off financially under a bush administration compared with 
38 percent saying they would benefit under a dukakis administration 
fortyfive percent said bush would do better at keeping the 
country out of war compared with 38 percent for dukakis 
fiftyfive percent said bush would do a better job of holding taxes 
down compared with 31 percent for dukakis and 50 percent said 
bush would do a better job of controlling inflation compared with 
37 percent for dukakis 
however dukakis would do a better job than bush of protecting 
social security according to 48 percent of the respondents 
compared with 38 percent who said bush would do a better job 
the survey also examined which issues were important to voters 
and how strong they considered each candidate on those issues 
according to the survey six out of 10 respondents considered 
holding down taxes to be a very important issue twothirds of the 
respondents thought preserving american family values was a very 
important issue and twothirds found creating new jobs to be very 
important 
bush had a slight lead in preserving american family values 
while dukakis was seen as better able to create new jobs 
the survey indicated that dukakis still had trouble making 
himself known among voters 54 percent said they did not know 
enough about the massachusetts governor to judge whether he would 
be a good president 
dukakis continued to benefit from his choice of sen lloyd 
bentsen as a running mate with 37 percent saying he would be more 
qualified than his republican counterpart sen dan quayle of 
indiana to assume the presidency only 9 percent said quayle would 
be more qualified

president reagan has signed a major spending 
bill that includes 12 billion to combat aids while calling on 
congress to speed up action on its remaining money bills 
i want those seven bills on my desk and in shape to sign by 
oct 1 reagan said tuesday in an appearance before the us 
junior chamber of commerce in the old executive office building 
reagan has urged congress repeatedly to complete action on its 
13 appropriations bills before the 1989 budget year begins oct 1 
now theyre working on what i asked for 13 separate 
spending bills the president said the new fiscal year begins 
in 11 days and seven of these bills are still under 
negotiation 
reagan also urged congress to amend a defense appropriations 
bill which contains some features similar to a 2995 billion 
defense authorization bill that he vetoed earlier this year 
i want defense legislation to continue the policies of the 
last eight years the policies that led the soviets to the 
bargaining table and out of afghanistan he said i want 
defense legislation that will advance national security not 
sacrifice it on the altar of congressional pork barrel 
reagan has signed three appropriations bills and spending plans 
for covering the treasury department and postal service interior 
department and military construction are awaiting his approval 
congress is still working on seven 
earlier tuesday reagan had signed a 394 billion 
appropriations bill for the departments of labor and health and 
human services during a private oval office ceremony attended by 
some of the principal sponsors of the bill 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president used 
the occasion to thank those lawmakers who had removed a provision 
from the bill that would have authorized expansion of federal 
medicaid payments for abortions 
this would have allowed use of federal funds for abortions in 
cases of incest and rape current law permits such payments only 
when the mothers life is endangered 
among the provisions of the laborhhs bill is one which 
allocates 12 billion for the fight against aids acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome about 100 million less than reagan sought 
congress last year was unable to complete work on the separate 
spending bills and had to resort to passing a catchall continuing 
resolution reagan reluctantly signed it rather than shut down 
the government even though it restricted his ability to veto 
spending plans he did not like 
reagan has said he will not sign another such spending bill and 
he repeated that vow tuesday in a meeting with the heads of the 
congressional appropriations committees fitzwater said

the reagan administration has used the cia to 
foment civil unrest in nicaragua and in the process has damaged 
efforts at a longterm peace accord between the leftist government 
and the contra rebels house speaker jim wright says 
in a highly unusual disclosure wright told reporters tuesday 
that the cia has employed agents covertly in nicaragua to organize 
and promote antigovernment rallies and protests 
wright speaking at his regular daily news conference said 
congress has received clear testimony that the cia has sought 
to provoke an overreaction by the managua government 
elaborating later in an interview the speaker added agents 
of our government have assisted in organizing the kinds of 
antigovernment demonstrations that have been calculated to 
stimulate and provoke arrests 
wright said the cia had made the admission under questioning 
from members of congress presumably the disclosure would have 
come in closeddoor oversight sessions of the congressional 
intelligence committees most of whose work is classified 
a cia spokeswoman sharon basso said there isnt anything 
the agency would say publicly about that to confirm or deny it we 
do brief congress but wouldnt discuss that publicly 
wright said he opposed the cia activity as detrimental to 
regional peace efforts because it has led to government crackdowns 
on the opposition and complicated already hostile relations 
i do not believe it is the proper role of our government to 
try to provoke riots or deliberately to try to antagonize 
governing officials into foolish overreactions he said we 
should be using the influence of the united states to encourage the 
peace process not discourage it 
but he also said the sandinista regime was foolish to 
respond to the protests with crackdowns such as the closing of 
opposition media outlets like the newspaper la prensa and radio 
catolica a churchrun radio station 
ive made that unmistakably clear to people in nicaragua they 
have to demonstrate their commitment to the democratization they 
have announced in earlier peace agreements he said 
wright said he did not know which specific antigovernment 
actions were due to ciasponsored agitation 
but a spokesman for the senate intelligence committee david 
holliday said the panel was confident that 40 people arrested at a 
july 10 antigovernment demonstration at nandaime south of 
managua were not linked to the cia 
the committee held two days of hearings july 1314 that included 
testimony from us ambassador richard melton who was expelled 
along with seven other embassy personnel following the nandaime 
protest 
we were satisfied there was no us government 
involvement in that particular demonstration holliday said 
wrights disclosure raised fears in the reagan administration 
that the sandinistas might take the comment as evidence that the 
jailed protesters were ciasponsored subversives according to an 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the contras are asking for release of the nandaime prisoners as 
a gesture of good faith before resuming highlevel peace talks with 
the government 
the two sides broke off talks monday in guatemala city after 
failing to agree on a new site for resuming peace negotiations and 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega accused the rebels of seeking to 
avoid negotiations in hopes of receiving new us military aid 
the use of agitators to stir up protests is a common method of 
intelligence operatives seeking to destabilize regimes deemed 
unfriendly it was understood that the us action in nicaragua was 
authorized by a presidential finding required by law for any 
covert action such findings must be reported to the house and 
senate intelligence committees which oversee the cia

a former ptl official said he told a 
federal grand jury that he had sex with former ptl leader jim 
bakker but bakker has denied the allegation in court 
jay babcock the former director of creative television for the 
troubled ministry commented tuesday after being asked questions by 
the grand jury apparently designed to determine whether ptl money 
was paid for sexual favors 
babcock was the first man to publicly acknowledge telling the 
grand jury of a sexual encounter with bakker 
calls by the associated press to bakkers phone number in fort 
mill sc went unanswered tuesday night 
in august bakker denied under oath that he had ever had a 
homosexual relationship 
told by a reporter tuesday outside the federal courthouse that 
bakker had denied ever having a homosexual relationship with 
anyone babcock replied im saying hes a liar 
babcock told reporters monday that he expected to be questioned 
by prosecutors about whether i had sex with the boss 
on tuesday after testifying much of the afternoon babcock was 
asked by a reporter what did you say regarding sex with jim 
bakker 
his response i commented that yes it happened a long time 
ago 
babcock said prosecutors also wanted to know about the 
circumstances surrounding that encounter im not willing to talk 
about those he told reporters 
babcock also told reporters that prosecutors asked him whether 
bakker and his personal aide david taggart had a sexual 
relationship 
i have no firsthand knowledge of that babcock said 
ptl records show that taggart drew more than 620000 from ptl 
in a 15month period that ended in march 1987 the same month 
bakker resigned as ptls president after acknowledging that he had 
a 1980 sexual encounter with jessica hahn and that money had been 
paid to silence her 
bakker and his top aides are under investigation for possible 
mail wire and tax fraud 
the grand jury probe now in its second year is focusing and 
whether bakker and other ministry leaders violated federal laws by 
raising money through the mails or on television for one purpose 
and then spending it for another 
bakker was dismissed by the assemblies of god denomination in 
may 1987 for unbecoming conduct related to his sexual encounter 
with ms hahn and because of alleged misconduct involving 
bisexual activity 
in may 1987 the rev jerry falwell told reporters that gary 
smith ptls former general manager was the target of one of 
bakkers alleged homosexual advances 
smith testified before the grand jury for about six hours 
monday but refused to discuss what he said he acknowledged 
however that the subject of homosexuality was discussed 
john wesley fletcher the evangelist who introduced ms hahn a 
former church secretary to bakker testified for about three hours 
tuesday he also refused to tell reporters what happened inside the 
grand jury room 
asked whether he had ever had a sexual relationship with bakker 
fletcher replied no comment 
fletchers attorney allen bailey told reporters his failure 
to comment doesnt indicate anything gentlemen his failure to 
comment is simply that he cannot discuss what went on in the grand 
jury room 
ptl filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy code in 
june 1987 a bankruptcy trustee has been attempting to find a buyer 
for the fort mill sc ministry which includes a christian theme 
park and real estate 
a bid by bakker for ptl apparently fell apart when bakker 
couldnt prove he had the necessary financial backing

secretary of state george shultz plans to 
press human rights issues in new talks with his soviet counterpart 
amid signs the reagan administration has given up hopes of 
completing a major nuclear arms accord this year 
shultz in possibly his last fullscale meeting with soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze hopes to tie down some 
unresolved issues in the stalled superpower negotiations to cut 
longrange nuclear arsenals by 50 percent assistant secretary of 
state rozanne l ridgway told a congressional panel 
we certainly know we cant finish the start strategic arms 
reduction talks treaty this year ms ridgway said tuesday 
shevardnadze was scheduled to arrive here this evening and hold 
talks with shultz on thursday and friday ms ridgway said the 
soviet foreign minister also was expected to call on president 
reagan 
although this weeks meetings may be the final major talks 
between shultz and schevardnadze on ussoviet topics it 
certainly does not signal the end of the administrations 
commitment to press forward on improving relations ms ridgway 
said 
we believe there is good work that can yet be done and we 
hope also to set the stage for the next administration of 
whichever party it may be she told the house subcommittee on 
europe and the middle east 
we will press the soviets to clear the books of the remaining 
human rights cases we will push on freer emigration ms 
ridgway said she mentioned exit for members of divided families 
separated spouses dual nationals and people punished for religious 
or political activity and said it would appear the exodus of 
soviet jews may again reach 2000 monthly its level of the late 
1970s the august figure was 1900 
progress on human rights in the soviet union is the key as far 
as we are concerned to other pending issues starting with a 
successful conclusion to the current review conference in vienna 
austria of the 1975 helsinki eastwest accords on security and 
human rights ms ridgway said 
we and our allies have been working very hard to bringing it 
about but on our terms we are prepared to stay as long as it 
takes to achieve it she said and there are prospects that the 
final agreement pieces we insist upon at vienna may fall into 
place 
negotiators in vienna must agree on mandates for a new 35nation 
conference on confidence and securitybuilding in europe and on 
negotiations on conventional arms by the nato and warsaw pact 
countries ms ridgway said 
the soviets have settled more divided family cases and lowered 
emigration barriers she said but we still have problems in the 
areas of freedom of assembly and speech 
ms ridgway said the us is satisfied with implementation of 
the treaty concluded eliminating landbased intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles she also said moscow appears to be keeping to its 
schedule to withdraw its forces from afghanistan by feb 15

the palace said today that the ailing emperor 
hirohitos condition was improving but cabinet ministers stayed 
near telephones for fear of the worst and members of the imperial 
family canceled scheduled activities 
the frail 87yearold who began vomiting blood monday and has 
since had three transfusions was in serious but stable condition 
and under constant medical surveillance palace and press reports 
said 
a chapter in japans modern history will close with the passing 
of hirohito the worlds oldest and longest reigning monarch the 
japanese media monitored the emperors condition roundtheclock 
takenori sugawara a spokesman for the imperial household 
agency said today that hirohito was still receiving intravenous 
care but was fully conscious he said the emperor appeared headed 
in a favorable direction 
he said palace doctors were not planning any more blood 
transfusions 
two doctors three nurses and two palace stewards were keeping 
close watch over hirohito in his bedroom the palace also 
announced adding that there were no plans to hospitalize the 
emperor 
crown prince akihito and princess michiko visited the emperor 
today in their fourth visit since he fell ill the 54yearold 
crown prince is the first in line to follow hirohito 
doctors began administering emergency care after the emperor 
vomited blood repeatedly from monday night through tuesday morning 
the imperial agency said 
the nationally circulated daily yomiuri shimbun quoting palace 
medical sources said doctors acted after hirohito initially 
vomited about 1 pint of blood court physicians suspected an 
enlarged pancreas was causing hemorrhaging of the emperors 
duodenum part of the small intestine according to the sources 
in september doctors performed an intestinal bypass operation 
in the same area circumventing a blockage caused by the enlarged 
pancreas 
major japanese dailies carried frontpage headlines today 
reporting that the emperor remained in serious condition while 
about 100 reporters maintained close watch over the imperial 
palace a green oasis in the center of tokyo 
a small group of about 20 wellwishers gathered in the large 
square in front of the palace kneeling down in prayer according 
to television reports 
but strollers in tokyos ginza a popular shopping and nightlife 
district appeared unaffected by news of the emperors failing 
health 
many older japanese still feel deep affection for hirohito but 
younger people tend to have less interest in the imperial family 
hirohito has occupied the throne since 1926 considered a living 
god for the first 20 years of his reign after world war ii us 
occupation officials forced him publicly to renounce his divinity 
under japans postwar constitution he became a symbol of japans 
unity but exercised no real power 
as the vigil over the emperor continued members of the imperial 
family cancelled all scheduled events news reports said 
prince hiro 28 the crown princes eldest son and second in 
line to the throne canceled an appearance today at a performance 
of the visiting milano scala opera prince mikasa the emperors 
younger brother called off a twoday trip outside tokyo 
prince aya 22 the crown princes second son who is studying 
in britain was to return to japan later today with former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone who cut short his visit to britain 
according to press reports 
the government on tuesday instructed all cabinet members to 
remain within calling distance of the capital in the event the 
emperor died 
the cabinet was expected to meet thursday to shift hirohitos 
state responsibilities to the crown prince 
three times in recent weeks the emperor has been bedridden with 
a fever a news report last week said he had lost 20 pounds of the 
130 pounds he weighed before his surgery

in the senate race lowry 49 staked out the liberal ground 
and bonker 51 claimed the moderate stance on the republican 
side gorton billed himself as the conservative choice despite 
opponents claims he wasnt conservative enough 
bonker who has represented the 3rd district in southwestern 
washington since 1975 spent the early part of his campaign trying 
to improve his name recognition lowry whose 7th district included 
the media center of seattle had no such problem hes been in 
congress since 1979 
although they have similar voting records the two disagreed on 
several issues chiefly those of interest to regional voters and 
bonker hammered on those differences as the campaign wore on 
bonker criticized lowry for not supporting his proposed ban on 
exporting raw logs an issue of keen interest in the northwest 
while bonker argued such exports cost mill jobs lowry said a ban 
would hurt small logging companies 
the two also disagreed over the navys proposed home port in 
everett with lowry calling it the home pork and siding with 
environmentalists against the project bonker said it would be 
vital to the everett economy 
gorton lost his senate seat to democrat brock adams many felt 
the upset lay partly in gortons icy image and perception that he 
had stopped listening to voters 
this time gorton vowed to hear better to listen better 
among other things he opposes higher taxes and favors efforts to 
control crime and illegal drugs

photographer sue bennett says her 
poster of a nude woman strategically covered by a pile of 
artichokes portrays the quintessential artichoke lover but the 
shot has drawn a prickly reaction from some other women 
bennett says she and her friend and model joanne gallaher made 
the poster as a tribute to the vegetable and to marilyn monroe who 
before achieving hollywood stardom was queen of the 1947 
castroville artichoke festival 
they hawked copies of the poster titled be an artichoke 
lover for 10 and 15 depending on the version each at this 
years festival held last weekend castroville a farm town about 
50 miles south of san jose bills itself as the artichoke capital 
of the world 
darleen dunham chairwoman of the monterey county commission on 
the status of women said monday she relayed several complaints 
about the poster to festival officials 
im not out to put other women down dunham said but what 
does a naked woman have to do with eating artichokes 
bennett defended the poster in which gallaher is covered by 
artichokes from her chest to her thighs 
the photographer said an unscientific survey the two women took 
last year showed female artichoke lovers outnumber their male 
counterparts 101 
the artichoke is probably the most feminist vegetable she 
said

interior minister tomas borge says 
nicaragua will not allow a planned opposition march because it 
could end in violence providing a pretext for new us aid to 
contra rebels 
also tuesday the government and rebels blamed each other for 
the breakdown of talks aimed at forging a lasting peace in the 
7yearold civil war 
borge told a news conference that the march planned for sunday 
the first since a july 10 rally in which 40 opposition figures were 
arrested was intended to create disturbances 
he acknowledged that the denial of the opposition democratic 
coordinates petition tuesday leaves the leftist sandinista 
government open to criticism but added 
it would be worse and would be a larger political cost and a 
greater pretext for our enemy and more of an argument for aid to 
the contras if there were provocations here that led to bloodshed 
in the streets of managua 
the sandinistas claimed the us embassy backed the june 10 
protest which ended in a clash between protesters and police 
nicaragua charged the embassy was seeking a plan to undermine the 
government the following day the us ambassador richard melton 
was expelled from the country 
in washington on tuesday house speaker jim wright said the cia 
had acknowledged in congressional testimony that it used undercover 
agents in nicaragua to stir up public protest hoping the 
government would overreact 
wright dtexas said he did not know if the july 10 
demonstration in nandaime south of managua was the result of us 
provocations 
the democratic coordinate protested the governments decision to 
ban sundays march 
political groups should have access to the means of 
communication take part in the right of association and the 
ability to hold public demonstrations the newspaper la prensa 
quoted duilio baltodano an opposition leader as saying 
government and rebel negotiators held talks monday in guatemala 
city in an attempt to reopen peace negotiations to end the war 
which the government says has claimed more than 28000 lives 
the interest of managua is to agree on a definitive 
ceasefire which the contras have rejected victor tinoco 
deputy foreign minister and sandinista negotiator was quoted as 
telling the progoverment newspaper el nuevo diario 
the rebels have said they would enter formal negotiations only 
after nicaragua frees the 40 opposition leaders 
the government and rebels signed a pact on march 23 providing 
for a temporary truce and talks in managua but the contras say 
they will participate only if they are held anywhere but the 
nicaraguan capital where they say their movement is restricted 
the sandinistas insist managua be the site of negotiations 
this is a clear demonstration of the lack of sandinista desire 
to establish or take measures and set up reforms that permit a 
democratic opening said roberto ferrey one of seven contra 
leaders he spoke tuesday on the rebels clandestine radio 
liberation 
negotiations to set a timetable for the rebels to lay down their 
arms and for the sandinistas to institute democratic reforms ended 
in stalemate june 9 
the us congress cut off military aid to the rebels feb 29 
the contras claim they need such aid to act as a bargaining chip in 
negotiations

elizabeth taylors sixth husband who happens 
to be a member of a key senate committee is getting congress to 
help her son by another marriage avoid deportation because of drug 
conviction 14 years ago 
without dissent the senate late tuesday approved a waiver 
exempting soap opera star michael wilding who has the same name as 
his late father from a law that prohibits permanent resident visas 
for aliens convicted of drug violations 
the private relief bill was sought by sen john warner rva 
miss taylors sixth husband and the 34yearold wildings 
stepfather for six years until warner and miss taylor divorced in 
1982 
michael wilding was born to miss taylor during her second 
marriage to the late british actor michael wilding 
now living in new york city and an actor on the television soap 
opera the guiding light wilding was convicted in wales in 1974 
of possessing marijuana and cultivating marijuana plants in a house 
he shared with six other people 
he renounced his us citizenship in 1971 but returned to the 
united states 10 years later because of the marijuana conviction 
in great britain however the immigration and naturalization 
service has refused to grant him a permanent resident visa 
my knowledge and respect for this man developed during my 
marriage to his mother elizabeth taylor warner said in a letter 
to the senate judiciary committee so far as i know and his 
mother knows mr wilding has lived a drugfree lawabiding 
existence since the occurrence of the offenses during his very 
early life 
warner said the ins has taken no definite steps to expel wilding 
but said the actors attorneys anticipate the government will 
commence deportation proceedings in the near future 
i can attest from my personal knowledge and that of his 
mother that mr wilding would continue to be a lawabiding 
resident of the united states the senator said

an 8yearold boy with aidsrelated 
symptoms whose family fled one city after protests over his 
admittance to school dreads another struggle because the ugly 
people are going to be back his mother says 
our big problem right now is that we just want to be a normal 
family jason robertsons mother tammie said tuesday we 
dont want to be in the spotlight i dont want to be a civil 
rights activist 
all i want to be is a housewife mrs robertson said all 
my kids want is a mother 
jasons family left the st louis suburb of granite city about 
15 miles south of here last month saying theyd been harassed for 
their efforts to enroll him in regular classes there 
last week as many as two dozen parents began picketing south 
roxana elementary school in this town of 2000 to protest jasons 
application for admission which officials are considering 
at tuesdays protest parents carried handlettered signs 
reading aids kills and help keep aids out of our schools 
if that kid comes here my daughter will go to a private 
school roseann hayes said in an interview 
charles conner superintendent of roxanas schools said the 
objections to jasons attendance come mainly from a minority 
group of parents in need of further education about aids 
the boy became infected with the aids virus after a transfusion 
of tainted blood products to treat his hemophilia 
jason has aidsrelated complex a disease that often precedes 
fullblown acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids cripples the 
bodys defenses against disease leaving the victim prey to 
infections and cancer 
the disease is spread through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring it cannot be spread 
casually 
because of his illness jason was the lone firstgrade student 
in a trailer on the granite city schoolgrounds through most of last 
school year 
his isolation ended in may when us district judge james l 
foreman ordered jason back in the classroom with his peers but the 
ruling did not end the protests and the family fled granite city 
mrs robertson said the family has been left alone in their new 
home except for a recent harassing phone call to her motherinlaw 
telling her to keep jason out of school 
the boy hasnt attended school since it began aug 29 his 
mother said hes eager to be back in class but dreads further 
protests over his attendance 
he said oh brother not that again were going to have to 
go back to court again the ugly people are going to be back 
mrs robertson said 
despite the protests mrs robertson said shes glad the family 
relocated and that they have received support from neighbors 
churches and a county aidssupport group 
my daughter plays with him jason said fredia shimchick 
schoolchildren are not going to be using his toothbrush theyre 
not going to be having sex with him theyre going to be sitting in 
a classroom with him so whats the harm 
conner said a review group including himself a school nurse 
and a doctor will decide thursday night on jasons placement 
based on jasons medical and school records the group could 
decide to put the boy in a regular classroom or a special education 
program or offer him home or hospital instruction conner said 
the superintendent said the school system will stay within the 
law this school district is not he said interested in a 
legal battle over placement of this child

the decision to close a federal probe into 
the fatal 1985 move confrontation without indictments ends the 
criminal investigation but bitterness and civil suits linger in 
the case 
the us justice department announced tuesday that a grand jury 
cleared mayor w wilson goode other city officials and police of 
criminal wrongdoing in the bombing of a west philadelphia rowhouse 
the police bombing approved by goode and resulting fire that 
officials allowed to rage out of control left 11 members of the 
radical group move dead and 61 homes destroyed 
theres always going to be some nagging doubts about whether 
justice prevailed in this case said william h brown iii the 
chairman of the mayors special investigative commission which 
found goode grossly negligent for his role in the events of may 
13 1985 
assistant attorney general william bradford reynolds head of 
the justice departments civil rights division said in washington 
that evidence was insufficient to seek indictments on any civil 
rights violations 
in a threeparagraph statement the department said no report 
will be issued by the federal grand jury that convened in 
philadelphia in april 1987 the panel based its inquiry on the work 
of an fbi investigation launched in july 1985 
a philadelphia county grand jury in may strongly criticized city 
officials for their handling of the confrontation but found no 
reason to pursue criminal charges 
district attorney ronald castille whose office presided over 
the local investigation said the federal decision confirms what 
we said last may that it was a series of tragic mistakes by 
elected and appointed officials 
goode was happy the investigation was completed 
two grand juries have fully investigated this matter and have 
reached a point of no criminality involved for that i am 
pleased goode said 
but others were angered by the federal grand jurys conclusion 
and its decision not to release a report 
louise james sister of move founder john africa who died in 
the blaze said the investigations were prejudiced against move 
i said over and over that he goode is a murderer and ill 
stick by that said ms james whose son also was killed in the 
rowhouse 
added brown to deliberately place a bomb on that house 
and having done that then make a decision to not put the fire out 
and let it burn while children are in the house if thats not 
sufficient grounds to find that their civil rights were violated i 
dont what is 
and to compound that by not even issuing a report to tell the 
people how they came to their decision i think is the height of 
arrogance he said 
five children and six adults died inside the barricaded rowhouse 
when police bombed the dwelling to evict move followers the bomb 
dropped from a helicopter contained the powerful military 
explosive c4 
the bomb touched off a fire that raged out of control while 
fireman held back afraid they would be hit by gunfire that had 
echoed through the poor neighborhood 
only two people escaped from the house a woman known as ramona 
africa and michael moses ward then 13 and known to move members as 
birdie africa all move members adopted the surname africa and most 
were black 
members of move whose name did not stand for anything in 
particular championed backtonature rituals lived in filth 
refused to send their children to school and openly disobeyed 
health and safety laws 
brown and castille said civil lawsuits filed against city

senate republicans are stalling action on a 
democratic plan to raise the 335 minimum wage in highstakes 
parliamentary manuevering being played out against a backdrop of 
presidential politics 
the republicans want a chance to add a lower pay rate for 
unskilled workers and action on president reagans nominees to the 
federal bench before democrats can move on the first hike in the 
minimum wage in eight years 
unless we see progress with the judges and keep our ability to 
amend were going to be on the minimum wage a long time senate 
gop whip alan simpson of wyoming said tuesday 
simpson made the comment following separate party strategy 
luncheons after democratic leader robert c byrd of west virginia 
filed a second cloture motion in as many days to limit further 
debate on the bill by sen edward m kennedy dmass 
according to the senate judiciary committee 25 nominations by 
reagan for federal judgeships are now pending before the panel and 
four other nominations are on the calendar for senate floor action 
kennedys bill would raise the minimum wage by 40 cents an hour 
each of the next three years to 375 in january to 415 in 
1990 and to 455 in 1991 
vice president george bushs presidential campaign said tuesday 
that bush likely would not unveil any specific minimum wage 
proposal until after his debate this sunday with democratic nominee 
michael dukakis 
were exploring a modest increase so long as its tied to a 
subminimum or training wage said david sandor a bush campaign 
spokesman but theres nothing scheduled for this week 
bushs vice presidential running mate sen dan quayle rind 
offered an amendment in the senate labor committee in july for 
raising the minimum wage over two years to 4 an hour and coupling 
it with an 80 percent subminimum for new hires 
the minimum wage has been stuck at 335 since 1981 with the 
reagan administration contending for the past three years that any 
increase would have to be coupled with a subminimum standard 
the white house reiterated that position tuesday saying its 
senior advisers would recommend that reagan veto any minimum wage 
increase that does not include a training wage at a rate 
approximately fourfifths of the minimum wage for a specified 
period of time 
the training wage would permit the administration to consider 
a reasonable increase in the minimum wage that would not bring 
about the unacceptable adverse economic effects of kennedys 
bill the white house said in a statement of administration policy 
the white house listed the primary adverse effects as fewer new 
job opportunities and higher inflation 
byrd stopped short of accusing republicans of filibustering the 
minimum wage bill saying his cloture petitions were aimed only at 
curbing unrelated amendments 
the cloture motions if approved by 60 senators in votes 
scheduled for thursday and friday would effectively require an 
upordown vote on the minimum wage package 
sen jesse helms rnc complained that byrds parliamentary 
maneuvers to force a vote would preclude consideration of 
republican amendments 
the senate republican policy committee listed at least 14 
possible amendments that gop members had ready including removing 
a 46yearold government ban on apparel industry homework and 
repealing the davisbacon law requiring prevailing unionscale 
wages on government construction projects 
were ready to vote on amendments but were not willing to let 
them run all of their amendments and ignore ours said sen 
william armstrong rcolo thats the issue 
but the biggest gop amendment to provide a 90day 80 percent 
subminimum wage for new hires already is on the senate floor 
although democrats are blocking consideration of it through a 
substitute by kennedy to slightly expand a littleused 85 percent 
subminimum for fulltime students 
under the senates rules if kennedys amendment is approved 
and he claims to have enough votes for passage the wider 
subminimum proposal by hatch would never come to a vote 
if his passes mine would be gone hatch said 
hatch quayle and bush at various times have referred to the 
republican subminimum proposals as a training wage or a youth 
training wage 
kennedy however called hatchs subminimum proposal a wolf in 
sheeps clothing saying it nowhere mentions nor requires any 
training during the 90 days nor does it make any age distinctions 
in its application 
he said the subminimum proposal effectively would eliminate any 
immediate increase in the minimum wage allowing employers to pay 
the 80 percent subminimum indefinitely as long as there is high 
employee turnover such as exists in many fastfood jobs 
the working poor who get caught up in the coils of the 
socalled training wage get pushed 20 percent closer to poverty on 
day one and bushpush into the unemployment lines on day 91 
kennedy said theyll get trained all right in destitution and 
desperation

a prosecutor plans to seek the death 
penalty against jesse jacksons half brother for allegedly hiring 
members of a chicago street gang to kill a man two years ago a 
newspaper reported today 
noah robinson a 45yearold chicago businessman and greenville 
native was charged with murder tuesday for the 1986 slaying of 
leroy hambone barber who was shot outside a downtown building 
owned by robinson 
robinson turned himself in to police tuesday evening and was in 
the greenville county detention center awaiting a bond hearing 
today solictor joseph watson said 
although robinson and jackson share relatives in greenville the 
former democratic presidential hopeful has said he has had no 
recent contact with his half brother 
robinson was the sixth person charged with murder for barbers 
slaying barber once worked for robinson in chicago and the two men 
had had several altercations over the years greenville police have 
said 
murder warrants were issued previously against five chicago men 
edgar cooksey alan earl knox eugene cleo hunter henry leon 
harris and jackie early clay clay is a fugitive and the other four 
are in police custody their ages were unavailable 
authorities have alleged that a fivemember team from chicagos 
el rukn street gang shot barber in the head jan 2 1986 after he 
was called to a pay telephone outside a lounge in the greenville 
building 
a former gang member tramell davis told authorities that the 
leader of the el rukns ordered barber killed for harassing robinson 
robinsons alleged involvement is he basically hired an el 
rukn hit team to come to downtown greenville to kill barber 
watson told the associated press on tuesday 
watson would not comment further about the case and said police 
were continuing their investigation along with the federal bureau 
of alcohol tobacco and firearms office in chicago 
the greenville news quoted watson today as saying he expected to 
file in the near future notice of intent to seek the death penalty 
against robinson and other principal codefendants because it 
was a murder for hire 
calls by the associated press to watsons home late tuesday were 
not answered 
in a statement distributed tuesday by the rev jm flemming 
who accompanied him to the jail robinson said i had no role in 
or no knowledge of that killing prior to it happening 
in the statement robinson said the case against him was based 
on statements by gang members with criminal records who were 
offered cash and lenient sentences in exchange for testifying 
against him 
flemming said robinson was being treated unfairly 
this ought not be taking place and would not be taking place 
if mr robinson was not a wealthy individual and a black individual 
in the community flemming said 
robinson was charged in june with conspiring to kill janice d 
rosemond who told a chicago grand jury last fall that she 
witnessed the 1986 slaying of barber 
within weeks of her testimony ms rosemond was attacked in her 
greenville apartment she survived five stab wounds and later 
recanted her testimony about the barber slaying saying she had 
been intimidated by police 
freddie e sweeney who once worked as a janitor in one of 
robinsons companies has been charged with assault and battery 
with intent to kill ms rosemond 
robinson and a former employee jake h oliver are charged with 
criminal conspiracy intimidation of a witness obstruction of 
justice and accessory to a felony in connection with the stabbing 
and robinson had been free on a 500000 bond

more there could be it could be very terrible dimas said

downstream and that wreckage of the fifth passenger bus was found 
30 miles downstream

laboratory tests of pieces from the shroud of 
turin have dated it within a span of 200 years a scientist told a 
newspaper hinting that reports in london that the revered relics 
origin was medieval were correct 
chemist robert dinegar refused to say directly whether tests 
showed the cloth was as old as the first century and thus possibly 
the burial cloth of jesus christ or dated from the middle ages 
which would make it a fake 
the 14footlong shroud kept in italys turin cathedral has long 
been the object of devotion because it bears the image of a 
bloodied bearded man suggestive of jesus crucifixion 
in an interview published today by the los angeles times 
dinegar said he was told the date of the shroud by an authoritative 
source but said he could not reveal it 
dinegar an episcopal priest and chemistry professor at the 
university of new mexicos los alamos campus has taken part in 
past research on the shroud but was not involved in the more recent 
radiocarbon tests to date the relic 
asked to comment on british newspaper reports that the shroud 
was medieval dinegar replied i am ticked off with oxford these 
leaks always come out of oxford and they are always correct 
the radiocarbon tests on tiny pieces of the shroud were 
conducted by separate teams of researchers at oxford university 
the federal polytechnic in zurich and the university of arizona in 
tucson 
dinegar said all three laboratories obtained about the same 
date within a 200year range which had been the predetermined 
limit for a valid finding 
i assumed we would get three out of three because they are 
excellent scientists he added 
a roman catholic churchapproved announcement of the results is 
expected in the next few weeks 
the sunday times of london citing unidentified sources said 
this week that the tests revealed a date between 1100 and 1500 
another british newspaper said late last month that the tests 
showed the shroud was made about 1350 the oldest known period of 
references to the shroud which was owned then by a french knight 
thomas f dmuhala president of the shroud of turin research 
project inc based in hebron conn said tuesday that no one in 
his group of more than 80 scientists has commented publicly on the 
shrouds age or origin

amateur astronomers in the northern 
hemisphere are getting their best look at mars in over a century as 
the red planet makes its closest approach to earth in years 
this is a rare chance for people to take a look at a world 
where humans may one day walk said susan lendroth spokeswoman 
for the pasadenabased planetary society which is sponsoring 
dozens of mars watch 88 public viewing parties and a formal 
observation program by amateur astronomers 
mars will be at its closest to earth at 1118 pm edt tonight 
when the two planets will be 3654 million miles apart said 
astronomer ed krupp director of los angeles griffith observatory 
thats the closest the two planets have been since they were 
3492 million miles apart in august 1971 and closer than they will 
get until they approach within 3465 million miles of each other on 
aug 27 2003 they sometimes are as many as 248 million miles 
apart 
because mars now appears much farther north in earths skies 
than usual during such close encounters views for northern 
hemisphere observers will be better than at any time since 1875 or 
until 2025 astronomers said 
telescope views are very good for more than a month on either 
side of tonights close approach and mars will rise earlier in the 
evening in future weeks 
many viewing parties already have been held such as last 
weeks mars mania star party in roseburg ore and a mars 
extravaganza in birmingham ala and others are scheduled through 
october some 2000 people have attended viewing parties throughout 
northern california 
about 100 of the 500 amateur astronomers participating in the 
worldwide mars watch 88 observation program have sent more than 
1500 photographs and sketches of the planet to jeff beish and dr 
donald parker official mars recorders for a group named the 
international mars patrol 
its now summer in mars southern hemisphere and the southern 
ice cap extends only to 81 degrees south latitude much smaller 
than during winter when it sometimes stretches almost halfway 
toward the equator beish said by phone from miami where he is an 
eastern airlines flight simulator technician 
the largest volcanoes can be identified by very experienced 
telescopic observers using large instruments beish said 
sometimes i see olympus mons thats the biggest one three 
times taller than mount everest 
he said observers also are now seeing mountainous clouds they 
are round or ovalshaped white puffs theyre around the known 
volcanoes 
backyard astronomers in places such as japan italy new zealand 
and new guinea also are seeing other martian surface features now 
that dust has settled from a june dust storm that measured 4800 
miles long by 2500 miles wide beish added 
they are seeing features that theyve never seen before 
including several long dark streaks that appeared recently he 
said mars changes from minute to minute theres always 
something to discover 
mars also can be seen with the naked eye although surface 
features arent visible for northern hemisphere residents it 
appears as a reddishorange spot the brightest object in evening 
skies low to the eastsoutheast after dark about 45 degrees 
above the southern horizon at midnight and low in the 
westsouthwest before dawn

hurricane helene formed early today in the central 
atlantic and forecasters say the oceans fourth hurricane this year 
has already begun to strengthen as it churns across open water 
helene packing sustained winds of 85 mph is the first 
hurricane to form since gilbert went on a rampage last week through 
the caribbean mexico and the texas gulf coast 
at 6 am edt the center of helene was located near latitude 
121 north longitude 393 west or about 1450 miles east of the 
lesser antilles a group of islands southeast of puerto rico 
according to an advisory from the national hurricane center 
the storm which registered 75 mph when it became a hurricane 
early today was moving west at 15 mph and maintain that course for 
the next day or two with a good chance for further strengthening 
the advisory said 
conditions are quite favorable for it to pick up strength 
theres nothing to stop it way out there in the middle of the 
ocean said stanley wright a meteorologist at the hurricane 
center but its still way too early to tell if it will get as 
big as gilbert 
meteorologist randy lascody said the path of helene the eighth 
named storm of the atlantic hurricane season cannot be projected 
until it moves closer to the caribbean 
its going across the warmest water of the year now which is 
perfect to fuel its growth lascody said but it really would 
be very premature to give a guess on what may happen it still has 
a long way to go 
storms that form this month near the cape verde islands off 
africas coast are often the seasons strongest because of ideal 
hurricanespawning conditions forecasters say 
factors such as lowpressure zones in the caribbean and 
highlevel winds will affect the storms path said lascody 
it looks like it will reach its makeorbreak point sometime 
later this week he said 
the depression that became helene seemed disorganized when it 
formed two days ago but satellite photos showed circulation 
improved 
it will take about four days for helene to get close enough to 
the caribbean to allow an air force reconnaissance plane to fly 
over it until then hurricane forecasters will have to rely on 
satellite reports said forecaster miles lawrence 
tropical storms are upgraded to hurricanes when sustained winds 
reach 74 mph in addition to gilbert which had top winds of 175 
mph two other much smaller hurricanes formed this season debbie 
which brushed the mexican coast and florence which moved over 
louisiana 
the atlantic hurricane season runs from june through november 
with september traditionally the most active month

the soviet government has barred foreign 
journalists from armenia where another rally was reported today 
following the renewal of ethnic unrest and violence in the troubled 
southern region 
andrei silantiev the foreign ministry official who informed the 
associated press its correspondent was being barred from making a 
scheduled visit to the region would say only that the city is 
closed for temporary reasons 
he refused to be more specific or to say that the resurgence of 
ethnic unrest was behind the governments action he said a group 
of foreign journalists waiting in the nearby georgian capital of 
tbilisi waiting for a flight to the armenian capital of yerevan 
would be stopped 
an armenian activist reached by telephone in yerevan described 
the situation there as very very tense 
telephone operators meanwhile told the ap in moscow that calls 
to stepanakert the main city in a predominantly armenian enclave 
of nagornokarabakh in neighboring azerbaijan would not be put 
through for several hours some numbers reportedly were cut off at 
a central switchboard 
rafael popoyan an activist reached at his home in yerevan said 
a crowd of thousands had gathered in the town square to await an 
announcement on the convening of the republics parliament which 
repeatedly has demanded annexation of nagornokarabakh a move 
rebuffed by the national legislature the supreme soviet 
popoyan said a strict curfew continues in nagornokarabakh he 
said some reports from the area say that water has been cut off

the date when daylight hours nearly equal 
those of darkness occurs thursday as the autumnal equinox makes 
its earliest appearance so far in this century 
the moment of equinox when the sun appears to cross the equator 
on its annual journey south occurs at 1929 universal time which 
is 329 pm edt 
not since 1897 has the equinox come this early reports leroy 
doggett head of the nautical almanac office at the us naval 
observatory 
the equinox will occur even earlier in four years when it comes 
at 1844 universal time on sept 22 1992 and also at 1801 on 
sept 22 1996 
and in 2000 the equinox will edge all the way back to 1729 
universal time on sept 22 of that year 
the tendency of the equinox to occur earlier will continue 
doggett said at least until the year 2100 when the absence of a 
leap year will shift it to later dates again 
the equinoxes are the days of approximately equal amounts of 
daylight and darkness many people including calendar makers 
arbitrarily consider the autumnal equinox the start of fall and 
the spring equinox the start of spring although there are no 
official definitions of those seasons 
the fouryear cycle of inserting an extra day in leap years 
tends to cause backandforth shifts in the calendar dates of 
natural phenomena such as the equinoxes and solstices 
all this equinox shifting occurs because the earths actual year 
doesnt come out to an even number of days 
the gregorian calendar now in use is 365 days long 366 in 
leap years the leap day added every four years means the calendar 
year averages out to 365 days 6 hours 
but it takes 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes and 46 seconds to go 
from one equinox to the next 
that means there is a difference of 11 minutes and 14 seconds 
that doesnt sound like much but over the centuries it adds up 
to compensate the calendar skips leap days in most century 
years the year 1900 for example was not a leap year 
but theres an exception century years that can be divided by 
the number 400 are leap years so the year 2000 will be a leap 
year getting an extra day 
and that means the calendar year will be a little longer 
causing the equinox to occur a little earlier that year 
thus the equinox wont be able to head back to its later dates 
until after the year 2100 which wont be a leap year since it 
cant be divided by 400 
universal time is also known as greenwich time it is five hours 
later than eastern standard time and four hours ahead of eastern 
daylight time thus 329 pm edt thursday 1529 on a 24hour 
clock is 1929 universal time

beating of the hijackers before he was shot and killed in beirut 
she also described how passenger kurt carlson a us army 
reserve officer was attacked by both hijackers although he was 
severely beaten carlson survived 
i was convinced he was dead because i had to step over him 
several times near the planes cockpit mrs derickson said of 
carlson but then i touched him and he moved 
the 44yearold flight attendant said she told hamadi about 
carlsons family and hamadi apologized to the beaten man saying

a firstgrade boy who allegedly pulled a 
gun and waved it around classmates will undergo a series of 
psychological tests officials said 
the 7yearold boy who told investigators he brought the 
38caliber handgun from home was suspended immediately after the 
sept 12 incident and was to have a disciplinary hearing today 
said john a stewart superintendent of polk county schools 
expulsion may not be the best approach with a boy this age he 
wouldnt learn anything by expulsion said stewart adding that 
the normal punishment for bringing a gun to school would be 
expulsion for more than a year 
stewart said the psychological tests will determine whether the 
boy should be transferred to a school for children with emotional 
problems 
polk sheriffs office spokeswoman lynne breidenbach said the gun 
was apparently not loaded when he brought it to crystal lake 
elementary school in his knapsack 
the boy showed the weapon to two other boys after gym class and 
again displayed it while walking home with other students after 
school she said 
bill duncan who is in charge of discipline for the polk county 
school district said that initial reports indicated that the boy 
demanded a sexual favor from two girls 
but sheriffs detective paul baggett said that did not appear to 
be the case he said the boy may have made a derogatory sexual 
statement to a girl while the children were walking home but his 
statement was not a demand for sexual favors as school officials 
first reported 
duncan said earlier he did have a weapon there at the school 
and he did threaten some girls with it we know for a fact that he 
had it because he admitted that he had it 
baggett said he would not comment on whether the boy pointed the 
gun at any of the children until he had discussed the case with a 
prosecutor at the state attorneys office in bartow 
at this point we have not charged him we have not determined 
that any violations have occurred ms breidenbach said 
theres a big if about whether charges will be filed 
crystal lake elementary school principal w james pace refused 
to comment 
don woods who supervises alternative education for the county 
cautioned against drawing conclusions before a hearing is held 
sometimes the stories come out quite different he said 
it might come out that it wasnt as serious as it sounded

saw maung the general who seized power in 
a weekend coup was named prime minister today by the new 
militarydominated government hundreds of people were reported 
dead in a ruthless crackdown on dissent 
the crackdown kept demonstrators off the streets for a second 
day today prodemocracy activists were reported going underground 
government spokesman kyaw san said troops killed 67 people 
wounded 34 and arrested 100 in the course of the governments law 
and order restoration work in rangoon and three other areas 
tuesday and today 
that brought the official death toll to at least 144 people 
killed since saw maung seized power sunday to quell a countrywide 
uprising against 26 years of authoritarian rule 
but independent accounts say more than 200 people have been 
killed and some western diplomats in rangoon put the number dead 
at up to 400 
at rangoon general hospital there were 200 corpses on monday 
night and that was only one hospital said one diplomat who 
estimated there had been as many as 400 deaths in all 
he said trucks loaded with bodies were seen after the height of 
the shooting earlier in the week 
in the heart of rangoon today troops conducted housetohouse 
searches following a rocket attack against two key government 
buildings 
gunfire was heard throughout the night but there were no 
protests almost daily occurrences in rangoon in recent weeks as 
soldiers patrolled the city 
they seem to have subdued the protesters pretty much said a 
bangkokbased diplomat its a peasant army their attitude is 
that they have to follow orders they trust their officers 
the diplomat said students who have spearheaded the uprising 
were going underground and might resort to guerrilla tactics 
against the 186000member military 
one opposition leader a student said street protests had been 
called off to avoid bloodshed he and the diplomats spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
open confronation between the army and protesters would be like 
a peashooter against a tank another diplomat in bangkok said 
the authorities have been incredibly ruthless when you look 
over the past month its breathtakingly breathtakingly callous 
behavior the diplomat said 
staterun radio rangoon said saw maung was chosen prime minister 
by the ninemember government or state law and order restoration 
council which he named on tuesday he also holds the posts of 
defense and foreign minister 
only minister of health pe thein was a civilian and at least 
six ministers were among the 18 senior officers who mounted 
sundays coup with saw maung the broadcast also said local 
military leaders will serve as top government officials in their 
areas 
saw maung is considered a righthand man of toppled president 
sein lwin who was widely blamed for earlier suppression of dissent 
bloody rioting forced an end to sein lwins presidency which 
lasted 16 days until aug 12 he had replaced ne win who ruled 
burma since a 1962 military coup but stepped down in july 
ne win is widely believed to be the power behind burmas 
government 
saw maung said he mounted his coup unseating civilian president 
maung maung to halt the countrys social chaos and ensure 
democratic elections 
maung maung burmas first civilian leader in 26 years had 
given in to opposition demands to hold elections and to the 
establishment of a multiparty system 
a sticking point was the oppositions demand for an an interim 
government before the elections 
today the government spokesman cited more than a dozen 
incidents in rangoon involving bloody confrontations between 
looters and troops a japanese embassy official quoted a rangoon 
television report saying citizens had attacked at least three 
police stations in the city and taken away more than 10 guns 
similar incidents were also reportedly occuring in other areas 
of burma the official said 
radio rangoon reported five separate incidents tuesday in which 
security forces killed 59 people including looters and injured 
several others 
in one case troops killed 14 people when civilians assaulted a 
military truck in an eastern section of rangoon the radio said 
troops on monday killed at least 100 people protesting the coup 
senior opposition leaders issued a statement tuesday appealing 
for talks with saw maung to resolve the countrys deepening crisis 
and criticizing the militarys crackdown on dissent 
burma has been in turmoil since students rioted last september 
against isolationist government policies that have crippled the 
economy

real estate billionaire harry helmsley facing a 
tax evasion trial with his wife next week has health problems that 
could have him removed from the case his attorneys say 
the disclosure came tuesday during a hearing where us district 
judge john walker agreed to unseal transcripts of previous 
closeddoor hearings concerning helmsleys health 
helmsley 79 and his 67yearold wife leona the selfstyled 
queen of the helmsley hotel chain were indicted in april on 
state and federal charges they are accused of hiding some 4 
million in renovations to their greenwich conn mansion as 
business expenses and taking bogus tax deductions 
the helmsleys have pleaded innocent to the 188count state 
indictment and the 47count federal indictment state prosecutors 
have agreed to let the federal case go first 
the associated press and several other news organizations had 
petitioned walker to release the sealed papers at the start of the 
hearing tuesday the judge said he would permit the unsealing of 
all records except grand jury materials 
walker said the material to be unsealed within the next day 
concerned the physical condition of mr helmsley and whether he 
is fit to stand trial his attorneys would give no details of 
helmsleys medical condition 
in other pretrial action attorneys for the helmsleys moved to 
have their clients case heard separately from their two former 
aides walker also delayed decision on relocating the trial to 
philadelphia due to potentially prejudicial pretrial publicity 
defense lawyer gerald a feffer said the helmsleys need a 
separate trial from defendants joseph v licari and frank j turco 
because the helmsleys plan a conflicting defense 
the helmsleys will charge that the pair onetime helmsley 
employees created false invoices in order to cover up their own 
thefts not to help the helmsleys defraud the government of tax 
revenues feffer said 
the helmsleys are slated to go on trial next monday but 
assistant us attorney james devita asked for a threeweek delay 
so government experts could evaluate helmsleys health records to 
see if more medical examinations are warranted 
walker said he would decide thursday on devitas request 
helmsleys chief lawyer john wing said he had no objection to the 
delay although he doubted further tests would reach a different 
result 
neither of the helmsleys was present at the hearing

a couple poured serum they thought was 
contaminated with the aids virus into selfinflicted cuts in a 
suicide pact after the man stole the serum from an unlocked 
hospital freezer authorities said 
eric henriques and his wife dawn who have a history of mental 
problems were rushed to denver general hospital after the incident 
monday night officials said tuesday 
authorities said both cut themselves near the wrist and elbow 
and then apparently poured the blood serum onto their arms 
police said henriques took the serum which carried labels 
warning of aids contamination from a denver general hospital 
freezer and brought it home 
hospital officials did not know if any of the 21 vials of stolen 
blood serum were drawn from aidsinfected people they ordered the 
basement freezer locked after the incident 
some of the samples drawn from a number of people during aids 
testing in 1986 may have contained aids antibodies but the deadly 
virus cannot be passed through antibodies alone hospital spokesman 
john head said 
the presence of antibodies means that a person has been exposed 
to the aids virus but it does not mean that the person has aids 
theres virtually zero chance of contamination head said 
the woman summoned officers after the suicide attempt 
henriques 24 was being kept in the hospital mental health ward 
tuesday while his 36yearold wife was being treated at another 
mental health facility 
he seems to be obsessed by committing suicide by infecting 
himself with aids head said 
the man may be charged with misdemeanor theft police said

democratic nominee michael dukakis is deriding 
republican george bushs record as one of such neglect and 
indifference to the needy that even the american flag cant 
hide his shortcomings 
dukakis challenged his gop presidential rival on tuesday to come 
out from behind the flag and tell the voters what he proposes 
to do about health care for americans who cant afford it 
dukakis said he wants to guarantee them all health insurance 
beginning with legislation to require that all employers offer 
basic coverage to working people and their families 
he was announcing another health care proposal today this one 
to offer prenatal and infant care for all guaranteed by the 
government that was to be announced in dukakis one campaign 
appearance of the day at brigham and womens hospital near his 
brookline home 
the massachusetts governor and his wife kitty who is jewish 
wished a very happy and healthy new year to their friends in 
the jewish community on yom kippur the holiest of jewish holidays 
they issued a message vowing their support for peace between 
israel and its arab neighbors respect for human rights the right 
of soviet jews to emigrate freely and for ending all forms of 
racism bigotry and antisemitism and discrimination in the 
united states 
dukakis said tuesday his ultimate goal is universal national 
health insurance to match the program he signed into law in 
massachusetts less than six months ago 
the simplest and the fairest and the most affordable first 
step toward that goal is to require all employers with some 
exceptions for small businesses to provide basic health insurance 
for their workers and dependents the governor said at western 
kentucky university in bowling green ky 
dukakis said his firststage program wouldnt cost the federal 
government anything and could actually save money by reducing 
expenditures for uninsured patients 
he offered no figures on the cost to employers 
the dukakis campaign said it had no firm cost estimates 
although issues adviser christopher edley said the employer phase 
of the massachusetts system will cost employers about 1000 a year 
for each newlyinsured worker 
dukakis kept his focus on selected themes during a twoday 
southern swing that ended tuesday night in little rock ark 
houston and kentucky he talked about economics then energy then 
health care 
dukakis sought to turn bushs pledge of allegiance issue into a 
boomerang taunting his rival for flagwaving the vice president 
has assailed dukakis for his 1977 veto of a bill to require 
massachusetts schoolteachers to lead their pupils in the pledge 
each day 
at the time dukakis cited a court ruling that the legislation 
was unconstitutional 
the democratic nominee said the vice president isnt talking 
about problems such as health care for people who cant afford it 
and dont have adequate insurance 
today hes visiting a flag factory dukakis said 
sardonically mr bush dont you think its about time you came 
out from behind that flag and told us what you intend to do to 
provide basic health care for 37 million of our fellow citizens 
the fact is that he has no plan but he does have a record a 
record of indifference a record of neglect a record that even the 
american flag cant hide 
dukakis said that from now on he intends to stick to his own 
issues agenda and leave it to his aides and allies to reply to 
accusations by bush and other republicans 
were going to make sure thats the message not some 
response he said 
in little rock dukakis had listed an agenda of designated 
issues for the campaign weeks ahead among them opportunities and 
work for people on public assistance programs to ease the 
insecurity of the elderly and proposals to make good housing 
affordable to all americans 
even so the dukakis organization was having some problems 
executing the plays in its new game book his health care proposal 
not brand new but packaged and promoted as a major campaign 
initiative was presented at a dawn briefing in houston by dukakis 
advisers then dukakis went to a houston hospital dramatizing the 
issue in a discussion of health care and insurance costs with a 
dozen patients and family members in a cancer ward waiting room he 
told them hell do something about the problem if all goes well 
on the eighth of november spread the word 
but the candidate didnt get around to making his centerpiece 
speech on the subject until hours later 
most of dukakis time during the next four days was set aside 
for debate practice the democratic nominee was looking at likely 
issues and with his aides rehearsing questions that may be put by 
panelists when the candidates meet in winstonsalem nc sunday 
night 
dukakis flight home from bowling green was detoured for an 
unscheduled maintenance stop at dulles international airport 
outside washington dc a landing light had to be repaired before 
the presidential airways jet could go on to a night landing in 
boston

a preliminary analysis of evidence in the crash of 
delta flight 1141 shows the jets wing flaps may have been lowered 
for takeoff but in an improper position according to a report 
published today 
the dallas morning news quoted a source familiar with the 
investigation as saying that analysis of the planes cockpit voice 
recorder picked up the sound of two clicks 
some investigators say the clicks could be the sound of the crew 
moving the boeing 727200s flapselection lever first to the 
2degree setting and then to the 5degree position the lever 
should have been moved a third time to the 15degree angle the 
report said 
federal investigators have previously targeted the flaps in a 
search for the cause of the aug 31 crash which killed 14 people 
they have been trying to determine whether the plans flaps 
movable surfaces on the wings that provide extra lift were 
extended in their proper 15degree position at takeoff 
what you hear on the tape of the cockpit conversation are 
two clicks in quick succession the newspaper quoted the source 
as saying that means that the flaps were at least at the 
5degree setting 
if its 2 degrees or 5 degrees or 15 degrees there are 
differences in the way the plane flies the newspaper quoted a 
safety board official as saying 
the question of whether there would be noticeable differences 
all of this will have to be determined through performance 
analysis of the aircraft 
the planes flap control lever has notches that could produce 
clicking sounds as the lever is moved the newspaper said 
obviously if they the crew thought they were at one flap 
setting when in fact they were at another there could be 
problems another ntsb official was quoted as saying 
but a safety board investigator cautioned that the sounds on the 
voice recorder had not yet been fully analyzed

frustration over having to draw up an 
unemotional report on the homeless and then go into streets where 
people were ravaging garbage cans prompted dissent by most of 
the reports authors one of them said today 
phyllis wolfe executive director of a private health care 
program for the homeless in the nations capital said that while 
gathering information for the report panel members became outraged 
at conditions they found 
it could just not be left in dots and dashes and graphs and 
figures ms wolfe said on cbs this morning 
ms wolfe joined eight other members of the committee formed by 
the national academy of sciences institute of medicine in issuing 
a supplementary statement that the institute refused to include in 
its report published monday 
the published report homelessness health and human needs 
calls the growing number of homeless children a national 
disgrace it recommends such measures as changing food stamp 
programs increasing medicaid services and expanding programs that 
help preschool children 
the authors of the supplementary statement said recommendations 
in the report were too limited they said the country should supply 
more lowincome housing raise the minimum wage offer more support 
services and guarantee homeless people adequate health care 
nine members of the 13member panel signed the supplementary 
statement saying the main study fails to capture our sense of 
shame and anger about homelessness 
the original report estimates that families with a total of 
100000 children are homeless on any given night in addition to 
countless children who have run away from home or been kicked out 
by their parents 
it says those under 18 are the fastest growing homeless group 
and homelessness is increasing in many rural areas as well as in 
the nations cities 
ms wolfe said the committees work on the report was very 
structured but members found themselves leaving committee 
meetings and walking by and seeing people ravaging garbage cans 
seeing people suffering on the street 
the supplementary statement itself expresses the same sentiment 
we have reviewed the demographic and clinical data and then 
walking home passed men asleep on heating grates or displaced 
people energetically searching in garbage piles for a few cents 
income from aluminum cans it says 
we analyzed mortality data for the homeless but lacked any 
platform from which to shout that our neighbors are dying 
needlessly because we are incapable of providing the most basic 
services 
we can no longer sit as spectators to the elderly homeless 
dying of hypothermia to the children with blighted futures 
poisoned by lead in ratinfested dilapidated welfare hotels to 
women raped to old men beaten and robbed of their few possessions 
and to pepole dying on the streets with catastrophic illness such 
as aids the supplementary report said 
it said the committee members who dissented against the reports 
limited nature endorsed its long list of recommendations but 
felt continuously uneasy because of our inability to state the 
most basic recommendation homelessness in the united states is an 
inexcusable disgrace and must be eliminated

fat briefing books are ready and surrogates 
are primed as michael dukakis and george bush settle into four 
days of intensive preparation for their first presidential campaign 
debate 
between now and 8 pm edt sunday when they square off at 
wake forest university in winstonsalem nc dukakis and bush 
will cram like college students 
each will field questions on a wide range of issues their 
answers weighed by political and media advisers 
richard g darman former deputy treasury secretary and robert 
barnett a washington lawyer were geared to assume their roles as 
the opposition candidates in debate rehearsals 
darman a protege of bush campaign chairman james a baker iii 
will play the role of dukakis in mock debates that will probably 
take place at the vice presidents residence 
barnett has experience portraying bush in debate rehearsals he 
helped prepare geraldine ferraro for her debate with the vice 
president in october 1984 
thomas donilon a top official of walter f mondales campaign 
four years ago was coordinating debate preparation for dukakis 
dukakis aides reviewed tapes of the massachusetts governors 
debates with his rivals for the democratic presidential nomination 
as well as bushs republican debates and his confrontation in 1984 
with ferraro 
a key element of the preparation for the first debate is the 
effort to lower expectations 
dukakis is a good debater bush told reporters recently on 
his campaign plane he is a professional college debater and im 
not 
bush campaign manager lee atwater said after all he 
dukakis made a living debating on television professionally for a 
couple of years facts are facts dukakis strongest suit is 
debate format 
remember bush has the experience of these debates the 84 
debate which is the only relevant experience said leslie dach 
a dukakis campaign spokesman 
during the democratic and republican primary season both men 
debated and for the most part came out ahead of their opponents 
bush was back in washington except for a trip to houston for a 
5 million fundraising dinner on thursday the vice president 
planned no other campaigning before the debate 
dukakis was in boston also concentrating on debate preparation 
sen bill bradley of new jersey was flying to boston on thursday 
to join the dukakis debate preparation the senator also was 
expected to take part in sessions with dukakis on friday 
hes being asked to input on substance and on strategy said 
bradley spokesman nick donatiello 
dukakis has consulted bradley frequently in recent months on 
foreign policy and financial affairs 
bush was conferring with domestic affairs adviser deborah 
steelman and foreign policy adviser dennis ross 
while the candidates concentrated on the issues their 
representatives still argued over last minutes details such as the 
makeup of the panel of questioners and the height of the podiums 
bush aides want the podiums to be 46 inches minimum the dukakis 
camp was demanding a maximum height of 44 inches the argument 
reflected the fact that bush is 6foot1 while dukakis is 
5foot8 todays decision bushs podium will be 48 inches 
dukakis 41 
as for the panel the dukakis staff proposed that television 
anchors from abc nbc cbs and cnn serve as the moderator and three 
questioners for the first debate with a panel of print journalists 
filling those roles for either the vice presidential or the second 
presidential debate 
all sides agree that the first debate is the critical one the 
one that gives voters their first impression of the two candidates 
the largest national audience of the campaign will focus on 
and take the measure of these two people said paul kirk jr 
democratic party chairman 
tens of millions of people are going to watch and theyre 
going to form their opinions by themselves said dach in the 
primary debates very few people watched and opinions were formed by 
the next days headlines 
rich bond a senior bush aide said you want to avoid costly 
mistakes and you want to come across as presidential 
in recent weeks bush has surged in the polls months earlier 
dukakis had a big lead in the same surveys 
if those fluctuating numbers are a sign of the volatility of the 
electorate the debate could be crucial

part of the negotiations for sundays debate 
between democrat michael dukakis and republican george bush came 
down to a spat over a few inches resolved today with a compromise 
that will have the candidates standing at lecterns of different 
heights 
a bush campaign source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
it was agreed that the tall lanky bush would stand behind a 
48inchhigh lectern after his negotiators insisted he would stoop 
no lower than a 46inch one 
dukakis who stands five inches shorter than bush will stand at 
a 41inch lectern with some kind of riser for him to step on 
according to the bush source 
dukakis aides did not immediately return a call today to comment 
on the agreement 
the two sides have yet to agree on the moderator and three 
panelists to question the candidates during the debate at wake 
forest university in winstonsalem nc 
dukakis had suggested television anchors from abc cbs nbc and 
cnn while the bush campaign said that was unfair to print 
journalists and proposed a list of 10 journalists and four 
moderators from which to pick the panel 
as for the lecterns dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas had 
said tuesday night that the bipartisan commission arranging the 
debate had agreed on heights of 42 inches brountas said that on 
tuesday the bush campaign officials asked that the height be raised 
to 46 inches because the vice president would have to crouch at a 
42inch podium 
brountas said that if the podium height was to be raised to 46 
inches the 5foot8 dukakis would insist on using a riser bush is 
6foot1 
the bush source gave a different account saying the republican 
nominee usually speaks at a 52inch podium but had agreed to come 
down to 46 inches 
this was already decided by the commission brountas said 
the bush source said the commission may have agreed to that but 
that podium size was a negotiable item in the debate talks 
bush was not insistent that the two candidate use the same 
height podium but the bush source said dukakis had been 
the dukakis camps request for a riser the bush source said 
introduced the issue of artificiality

black activist winnie mandela 
said today us officials have imposed restrictions on three 
antiapartheid leaders holed up in the us consulate since their 
escape from detention last week 
mrs mandela wife of jailed african national congress leader 
nelson mandela commented after visiting the three men at the 
consulate in a johannesburg office building 
she said us officials in washington were refusing to let the 
three communicate directly with the news media a condition which 
they initially agreed to but now want to change we would like to 
see the americans a little more committed than they are she said 
a us embassy spokesman barry walkley said his government was 
concerned with the wellbeing of the activists and at the same 
time with maintaining the appropriate posture of a diplomatic 
mission 
establishing a media forum is incompatable with either the 
concept of temporary refuge or the functioning of a diplomatic 
mission he said 
we agreed that they can convey messages through their legal 
representatives however using their legal representatives as 
intermediaries for interviews goes beyond that agreement 
elsewhere 11 activists reportedly were detained under 
stateofemergency regulations in cape town where a national 
antiapartheid conference is planned this weekend in the port city 
of durban police said 160 people were arrested after hundreds of 
striking black dockworkers went on strike 
encamped at the us consulate are two leaders of the banned 
united democratic front murphy morobe and mohammed valli moosa 
and the chairman of the banned national education crisis committee 
vusi khanyile they slipped away from guards sept 13 at a 
johannesburg hospital 
they have remained at the consulate despite a government promise 
that they will not be arrested or restricted if they leave and 
have called for the release of all political detainees 
mrs mandela said the three are wary because of a threat by 
south african authorities immediately after their escape she said 
the government said it would take the most severe measures 
against the men unless they agreed to leave the country 
lawyer essa moosa said activists taken away from their homes 
today included trevor manuel 32 cape town leader of the united 
democratic front manuel was detained without charge in august 1986 
and was placed under severe restrictions when released in july 
the detained activists reportedly included at least two whites 
an indian several blacks and people of mixedrace 
police declined to confirm the detentions but did report on the 
durban dock strike according to police the arrests in durban came 
after strikers many of them carrying sticks and pipes staged an 
illegal gathering 
the strike began tuesday to protest the dismissal of a worker 
and to demand higher pay 
initial reports from lawyers and relatives indicated nine 
activists were detained in cape town but frank meintjies of the 
congress of south african trade unions said 11 united democratic 
front activists were detained 
the antiapartheid conference is to be held saturday and sunday 
at the university of cape town and is sponsored by the congress of 
south african trade unions the countrys largest labor federation 
organizers are seeking to bring together about 75 opposition 
groups ranging from white liberal parliament members to 
organizations that advocate black selfreliance 
this is not a conference of people who necessarily agree on 
everything meintjies said but they all agree that the 
apartheid problem should be done away with once and for all 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs which are controlled by the 5 million whites 
stateofemergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict 
reporting about security force actions and treatment of detainees 
but enforcement of the rules has not been comprehensive

democratic vice presidential nominee 
lloyd bentsen today proposed a 100 million plan to bolster rural 
health care including federal subsidies to financially troubled 
hospitals threatened with closure 
speaking in a high school auditorium in this west texas town of 
2300 people the texas senator said rural hospitals are shutting 
down and farmland residents are terrorized by the prospect of 
illness 
millions of americans in rural areas are being denied one of 
the basic necessities of life they are losing their access to 
quality health care he said 
it means that some children die who could have been saved it 
means illness lingers that could have been cured 
the day after democratic nominee michael dukakis announced a 
plan to require employers to provide health insurance coverage for 
all workers bentsen outlined these proposals aimed directly at 
rural health care 
a hardship fund to subsidize rural hospitals in danger of 
being closed 
expansion of the national health service corps which provides 
scholarship assistance to medical dental and nursing students who 
agree to serve in rural areas 
increased federal subsidies for nursing education 
restoration of federal funds for migrant and community health 
centers 
bentsen said the reagan administration had slashed the last 
three programs his campaign staff estimated that all four programs 
would cost 100 million 
the senator said its sure obvious we have a problem in 
rural america under the reagan administration which he said has 
done nothing to turn it around 
we have not seen a single proposal from them to stem the tide 
of hospital closures in rural america he said 
bentsen stressed health care today after touring depressed oil 
areas of texas and oklahoma on tuesday and stressing dukakis 
promise to bolster the energy industry 
dukakis on monday evening told oilmen in houston that his 
administration would get the wells pumping again even if that took 
government subsidies and he announced that bentsen would lead the 
drafting of a national energy policy including movement toward 
further deregulation of natural gas 
bentsen followed up on tuesday by going to longview texas 
oklahoma city and odessa texas to deliver the message on a more 
local and personal level with rallies a forum and interviews with 
local news media 
the republicans like to ask are you better off today than you 
were in 1980 they had better not ask that question in oklahoma or 
texas because the answer is no he said at the oklahoma rally 
making the first appearance in that state by either democratic 
candidate 
and taking a page from the republican strategists the bentsen 
campaign did not schedule any wideopen news conferences tuesday or 
today so as not to compete with the message dukakis was trying to 
convey 
while trying to run what the democrats say is a positive 
campaign on the issues bentsen has been taking sharper shots at 
republican dan quayle george bushs running mate in attacking 
quayle on tuesday bentsen rhetorically scored the reagan 
administrations record on energy issues 
i tell you their record is as empty as dan quayles resume 
he said getting his biggest applause from more than 1000 people 
at the rally in oklahoma city

michael dukakis challenged republican rival george bush to spell 
out his health insurance program for american workers while 
negotiators for the two candidates wrangled over panel members and 
lectern heights for the upcoming presidential debate 
one issue at least appeared settled today when a bush campaign 
source speaking on condition of anonymity said it was agreed that 
bush would stand behind a 48inchhigh lectern after his 
negotiators insisted he would stoop no lower than a 46inch one 
dukakis who is five inches shorter than bush will stand at a 
41inch lectern 
meanwhile dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen announced a 
program to improve rural health care today saying millions of 
americans in rural areas are being denied one of the basic 
necessities of life they are losing their access to quality health 
care 
bentsen in an appearance in hale city texas said that if 
elected he and dukakis would work for the plan including a 
hardship fund to subsidize rural hospitals that are threatened 
with closure and expansion of a national program providing 
incentives for doctors and nurses to work in rural areas 
president reagan was asked today at the white house whether hed 
given bush any hints about next sundays debate 
take no prisoners reagan responded with a chuckle 
the democratic nominee who offered his own health care plan 
tuesday called on bush to step out from behind the flag and 
address the issue of providing health care to the 37 million 
americans who are unable to afford it 
the vice president spent the day touring a flag manufacturing 
company in bloomfield nj where he told employees my friends 
flag sales are doing well and america is doing well 
bushs own political fortunes received a boost from the latest 
abc newswashington post poll the survey of 1271 likely voters 
found that 70 percent consider the gop nominee to be a known 
quantity compared with 54 percent who said they didnt know enough 
about dukakis 
the poll conducted wednesday through monday also found the two 
candidates in a near dead heat with bush leading dukakis 50 percent 
to 46 percent the margin of error of three points either way 
virtually negated the lead 
a similar abcpost poll released last week found dukakis holding 
a slim threepoint lead 
bush was taking a day off from campaigning today to prepare for 
sundays debate with dukakis in winstonsalem nc the first 
facetoface encounter between the two contenders 
a mock debate with former deputy treasury secretary richard g 
darman standing in for dukakis and bush working on responses to 
issues questions with advisers giving their assessment were on 
the vice presidents agenda according to aides 
dukakis was introducing another health care plan 
governmentguaranteed prenatal and infant care for all tending to 
statehouse duties in boston and preparing for the debate 
bushs running mate dan quayle was flying to arizona to visit 
an awardwinning elementary school before travelling to the 
california cities of fresno bakersfield and los angeles 
negotiations on debate logistics hit a snag tuesday as the two 
presidential campaigns failed to agree on the height of the 
lecterns and the composition of the panel 
paul brountas chairman of the dukakis campaign said tuesday 
that the bipartisan commission handling the debate had agreed on 
podiums 42 inches high but bush campaign officials according to 
brountas asked that the podium height be raised to 46 inches 
the two sides also failed to agree on the makeup of the panel 
with dukakis suggesting television anchors to question the 
candidates and the bush campaign proposing print journalists 
while the debate over the debate continued dukakis used 
campaign appearances in bowling green ky and houston to propose 
a broad health care plan beginning with the 22 million americans 
who have no insurance that would leave 15 million or more 
americans still awaiting protection campaign aides said 
the simplest and fairest and the most affordable first step 
toward that goal is to require all employers with some exceptions 
for small businesses to provide basic health insurance for their 
workers and dependents dukakis said 
the plan similar to one dukakis signed into law in 
massachusetts less than six months ago would not cost the federal 
government anything he said dukakis did not provide figures on 
the cost to employers 
in announcing the program dukakis also issued his challenge to 
bush saying dont you think its about time you came out from 
behind that flag and told us what you intend to do to provide basic 
health care for 37 million of our fellow citizens 
bush campaign spokesman mark goodin branded the dukakis proposal 
socialized medicine and said such is a prescription for 
financial disaster the dukakis plan would put the american economy 
in the hospital and would list it in critical condition 
questioned about the lack of health insurance for millions of 
americans quayle suggested experimenting with letting small 
businesses buy into the medicaid program to cover their workers 
the gop vice presidential candidate told about 600 students at 
the university of nevadalas vegas that a bush administration will 
guarantee a college education for anyone who wants it 
we understand the importance of higher education and were 
going to make sure that anybody who wants to go to higher education 
will have access to higher education no matter what he said 
quayles democratic counterpart bentsen told voters in 
oklahoma that a dukakis administration would use tax incentives and 
other subsidies to revive oil production in the southwest 
he also said dukakis will light a fire under federal 
regulators blocking the sale of natural gas to the northeast

reported to his first day on the job today promising to work with 
people build a consensus and define a problem 
i really bring no agenda other than to try to advance 
education in america cavazos sworn in on tuesday told a news 
conference were all on the side of angels so we have no 
problems 
cavazos repeated his pledge to support programs to help educate 
people so they reach his or her full potential 
cavazos is the first hispanic member of the cabinet 
although president reagan leaves office in four months cavazos 
said he would concentrate on the question of how do we position 
this nation to be competitive at the turn of the century and i 
dont just mean economically rather let us look to make sure 
every person in america today is educated to his or her fullest 
potential 
cavazos said no deal has been struck for him to remain in office 
if republican presidential nominee george bush wins the november 
election 
asked by a spanishlanguage about problems facing hispanic 
children cavazos said in spanish that his biggest such concern is 
keeping hispanic youths in school 
answering another question cavazos said in spanish and english 
that he supported bilingual education programs but believes the 
emphasis should be on helping students learn english as quickly as 
possible 
my goal is to make that person competent as quickly as 
possible in english he said 
on tuesday reagan called the 61yearold cavazos who is 
president of texas tech university and a registered democrat a 
sterling example of the magnificent contributions hispanic 
americans have made to our national life 
larry cavazos has already made a major contribution to 
american education reagan said he brings to his new post a 
record of solid accomplishments that promises even bigger 
contributions in the future 
bush gave cavazos the oath of office as cavazos wife peggy 
held the family bible the couples 10 children also attended the 
east room ceremony 
cavazos said reagans leadership and commitment to education had 
truly helped this country make significant gains and strides 
but added we must awaken america to renew its commitment to 
education to help all citizens reach their potential 
some hispanic leaders have questioned the timing of reagans 
decision to nominate cavazos in the waning months of his 
administration suggesting he was courting hispanic votes to 
bolster bushs republican presidential candidacy in texas a key 
battleground against democratic nominee michael dukakis 
i think the people see it for what it is said rep albert 
bustamante a san antonio democrat and chairman of the 
congressional hispanic caucus 
bustamante said voters will focus on more substantial issues 
like cutbacks in education that occurred under this administration 
and then theyll decide and then theyll not be for bush and 
his running mate sen dan quayle

deal that went sour the man who would give his name only as 
charles talked to reporters after being interviewed by detectives

the baltimore sun on gun control 
the house of representatives shamelessly caved in to the 
political muscle of the national gun lobby when it rejected a 
modest measure that would have required a sevenday waiting period 
for the purchase of handguns 
the vote put house members on record against virtually every law 
enforcement organization in the country groups that had pleaded 
for this measure known as the brady amendment to assist them in 
their jobs 
but the house refused to listen and the reason is transparent 
and deplorable 
there is no sound argument against a cooling off period it 
would have caused only minor inconvenience to lawabiding citizens 
who could pick up their guns in a week but would have made it 
difficult for criminals to walk into a store and get a handgun with 
ease 
yet the house buckled under pressure from the wellheeled gun 
lobby and voted 228182 against the brady amendment

the birmingham ala postherald on gun control 
well all those hunters can relax it appears that the federal 
government is not going to make them wait seven days to get a new 
or used handgun 
the national rifle association convinced the house of 
representatives that it would be discommoding not to mention 
unamerican to require a prospective purchaser to wait a whole week 
to pick up a pistol 
the waitingperiod legislation was cast aside in its place 
the house substituted an amendment calling on the justice 
department to develop a system under which gun dealers could 
identify felons who seek to buy handguns 
the chances of the department fashioning a reasonably efficient 
system is doubtful and even if it does theres nothing in the 
amendment that says it should be put into effect 
thanks to the wellheeled gun lobby overthecounter 
noquestionsasked sales of handguns can continue

rochester ny democrat and chronicle and timesunion on 
social security 
when it comes to federal budget deficits baby boomers should be 
demanding more than platitudes from the presidential candidates 
the reason the deficits endanger the social security 
benefits the boomers are entitled to 
heres the problem back in 1983 congress and the reagan 
administration wisely acted to save social security with sharply 
higher taxes enough to build up 3 trillion in reserves for the 
74 million baby boomers wholl start retiring in 2010 
by law the treasury must use all available revenue before it 
borrows money to cover the deficit in return the social security 
system gets government ious theoretically payable on demand 
the solution is to eliminate or radically shrink the 
deficit then the surpluses could be used to buy back the national 
debt from the private citizens and foreign investors who now hold 
government bonds 
so its up to the boomers if they dont demand change the next 
president and the next congress may follow the path of least 
resistance and take the security out of social security

the seattle postintelligencer on the cdcaids report 
two of every five adults infected with aids are black or 
hispanic far in excess of these groups proportional 
representation in the general population 
thats why appropriately enough there is a flap over the 
centers for disease controls significant little omission in a 
report the agency made public assessing its performance in 
combatting aids 
the analysts hired by the cdc took it to task for having n 
cohesive plan of action for stopping the spread of aids among 
racial and ethnic minorities 
they said the cdc lacks information about the knowledge 
attitude and behaviors regarding aids in minority populations 
and it said the agency has no idea how much of the money it 
sends to local health agencies for minority aids programs actually 
reaches the minorities for whom it was intended 
all of this criticism however the cdc saw fit to delete from 
the report but it left intact an 11page discussion detailing the 
30 million minority aids program it administers according to the 
atlanta constitution 
cdc officials offered the lame excuse that they had merely 
condensed the report unfortunately the public already is all 
too familiar with this type of condensation of disturbing 
information unfavorable to government agencies

organizers say the olympics are 
putting south korea on the world map and they shrug off complaints 
about a lack of bigspending foreign visitors 
south korean officials say the games are meeting their goal of 
enhancing the countrys image as about 3 billion people around the 
world watch the games and the host nation on television 
the world coverage is superb the world is seeing korea as an 
advanced modern nation the reaction has been overwhelming said 
an official of the seoul olympic organizing committee 
olympic officials dismiss complaints from some businesses that 
the games have not unleashed a flood of foreign tourists spending 
millions of dollars it is still possible to get hotel rooms and 
tickets for the games despite earlier warnings of overcrowding 
tourists are not important compared to the billions of 
television viewers we did it for the world not for a few 
visitors the committee official said on condition of anonymity 
the government spent about 32 billion staging the games to 
push south korea onto the world stage and show it as a leading 
nation south korea hopes to boost its trade and diplomatic 
relations by impressing the world officials say 
olympic organizers said before the olympics that they did not 
expect a huge flood of visitors and that the main goal was 
promoting the nations image making money from the games was never 
the main goal organizers say although they want to break even 
some shopkeepers hotels and others who thought seoul would be 
bursting with foreigners complain business is below what they had 
anticipated and visitors are not spending very much 
sports people dont buy said shopkeeper chung cheee 
they only take pictures and talk 
some planes coming into seoul have empty seats and the seoul 
city government said hotel occupancy rates were about 90 percent 
with a high of 97 percent during the first weekend of the games 
the olympic committee says it has no figures on the number of 
visitors for the games but about 250000 people including 
athletes and officials were anticipated and about 200000 have 
arrived more are expected before the end of the games officials 
said 
youre looking at a very comfortable games said the 
committee official the place is not bursting at the seams but 
there are enough tourists here 
many businesses may have overestimated the number and type of 
tourists the olympics would attract and assumed a flood of wealthy 
tourists would come instead of the sports fans who came committee 
officials said 
geography and concern about overcrowding appear to have been the 
main factors in keeping down the number of olympic tourists 
committee and tourism officials said concern about violent student 
protests do not appear to have been a major factor they said 
south korea is a long way from the united states or europe and 
the cost of air travel to seoul is high concern about overcrowding 
and lack of accomodation was also a factor in discouraging 
visitors committee officials said 
people watch the olympics on television to come here you 
really have to be an olympic fan said one tourism official 
one major problem was the perception that rooms in top hotels 
would not be available and tourists did not want to spend thousands 
of dollars to get to seoul and end up in more modest hotels 
committee officials said 
the citys luxury hotels were gobbled up in advance by the 
media corporations and athletic groups officials say 
shopowners have discovered most olympic visitors came for the 
games rather than to shop or dont have much money after spending 
thousands of dollars to get to seoul 
the sportsmen are crazy about sports not spending money on 
shopping said yk kim a tailor

president reagan supporting george bushs 
attacks on michael dukakis said today that teachers should be 
required to lead students in reciting the pledge of allegiance 
because thats what theyre there for 
the president responded to a reporters question whether he 
thought bush the republican presidential nominee had overdone 
the pledge issue and impugned the democratic candidates patriotism 
ive kind of enjoyed it i think its a fine thing if our 
children reagan replied during a white house photo session 
with the joint chiefs of staff 
reagan quickly added that he didnt see any reason why they 
should not learn the various customs and so forth that have to do 
with things of that kind 
ive seen many children today who dont know what theyre 
supposed to do when the national anthem is played or when the flag 
goes by he said i remember that i learned all that in school 
why shouldnt they 
the president was asked whether teachers should be forced to 
lead students in the pledge 
thats what theyre there for he shot back theyre job 
is to teach something 
bush who concluded his acceptance speech at the gop national 
convention by reciting the pledge has tried repeatedly to make a 
campaign issue of the massachusetts governors 1977 veto of state 
legislation that would have required public school teachers to lead 
their classes in reciting the pledge 
dukakis said he does not oppose classroom recitations of the 
pledge but that he was advised by the state supreme court that the 
bill was unconstitutional he has accused bush of using smear 
tactics reminiscent of the mccarthy era in the 1950s 
reagan also praised former education secretary william bennett 
for having improved education but said that obviously 
theres much more to do 
at that point the photo session ended and reporters were 
ushered from the room

to save ethel st lawrence from the aneurysm 
pressing on her brain doctors killed her for 40 minutes they 
put her in a coma stopped her heart chilled her by 40 degrees and 
drained her body of blood 
st lawrence was back at work 10 weeks after what she calls a 
cottonpickin miracle a sort of suspended animation that lets 
surgeons cure hardtoreach highrisk aneurysms that once were 
considered inoperable 
it is everything that technology can possibly offer said 
her neurosurgeon dr robert spetzler at barrow neurological 
institute in phoenix 
it may be the surgery of the future in cases where bleeding 
poses the greatest risk to the operation said dr julian e 
bailes a neurosurgeon at allegheny general hospital here who 
studied with spetzler thats the biggest cause of death in 
surgery if you could put someone in a state of suspended 
animation you could operate in a totally bloodless field 
in a severely cold bloodless state the brain can be deprived 
of oxygen up to 55 minutes giving surgeons time to remove the 
aneurysm a bubble caused by weakness in the wall of a blood 
vessel and clip arteries feeding it without the danger of massive 
bleeding and certain death 
of 14 patients who have undergone the procedure at barrow one 
has died bailes said most had excellent results a few 
reported some weakness but otherwise did well and most remained in 
a coma no more than five days 
its getting through the surgery said dr steven shedd a 
barrow neuroanesthesiologist who worked on st lawrence if 
youve tolerated the procedure and you wake up youre going to be 
ok 
but the risks including that the heart wont restart are too 
great to use the procedure where normal anesthesia can adequately 
do the job 
its what birdseye discovered it you freeze a fresh fish it 
will come back and you can use it the problem is some people 
dont said dr louis caplan of bostons new england medical 
center and chairman of the american heart associations stroke 
council 
and because the patient has to be taken to the point of clinical 
death for the operation to succeed doctors approach it with a 
lot of respect said shedd every time i do one of these i get 
very nervous 
youre taking a patient thats alive and breathing and 
stopping their hearts and putting them into this state they are 
nothing there is no breathing no heart function the brain 
function is nil we tilt the table up and drain all the blood into 
the pump 
i dont want to say the word dead but the patient is 
definitely suspended at that point cellular activity is still 
occurring but at a rate so low that we cant detect it theyre 
not doing anything were talking cold 
st lawrence a 61yearold phoenix secretary was rushed to 
barrow on june 2 suffering from a severe twoday headache and 
unable to open her right eye tests showed that a sinus aneurysm 
detected four years ago had grown 
partly because of heavy doses of barbiturates given before 
surgery to help prevent stroke or brain damage st lawrence 
recalls nothing about the june 6 operation but she does recall 
experiencing a very strong sensation 
i just had this immense feeling that i was being cared for it 
felt like somebody was just holding me in their arms and taking 
care of me and that i would be ok it was just a feeling of peace 
four months after surgery she needs no medication and the 
severe headaches are gone though she still is unable to fully open 
her eye 
its just a cottonpickin miracle it truly is they do say 
god works in mysterious ways and one of his ways of working is to 
have capable people who know how to do things and in this case 
extremely capable surgeons 
bailes is confounded though by cecilia duffy a 76yearold 
pittsburgh woman who spent 51 minutes in suspended animation aug 
31 while surgeons removed an eggsized aneurysm that had almost 
completely disabled her 
duffy hasnt come out of the druginduced coma even though her 
brain activity is improving there is no evidence of brain injury 
and she moves her legs when stimulated quite frankly im 
worried about her because i would have thought she would have come 
out of it by now bailes said 
its hard to know why she hasnt because shes old and her 
liver isnt working that well he said shes not breaking down 
drugs that quickly so thats made it a little more confusing 
as we go longer its more likely she will have suffered some 
stroke some sort of brain injury 
cooling the body and stopping the heart before an operation was 
pioneered decades ago by cardiac surgeons particularly in children 
where there is little room to maneuver and bleeding is difficult to 
control said dr george magovern jr a heart transplant surgeon 
at allegheny general who worked on duffy 
hypothermia is an intricate part of cardiac surgery 
particularly moderate hypothermia in which the body is cooled 20 
to 30 degrees magovern said profound hypothermia in which the 
temperature is lowered 40 degrees is not done frequently but 
its done enough 
to achieve hypothermia doctors lower the operating room 
temperature to about 55 and wrap the patient in cooling blankets 
they remove several pints of blood and replace them with 
refrigeratorcold saline solution a heat exchanger like a 
radiator then runs the salineblood mixture through ice and back 
into the body when the body is cold enough the blood is removed 
entirely 
its quicker and more efficient to repair the heart in a 
bloodless field and sometimes the only way you can accomplish that 
is with profound hypothermia magovern said but the downside 
is that it limits you to 55 minutes of surgery and theres always 
the potential for neurological injury 
the difficulty in applying it to brain surgery said caplan is 
that doctors dont have a good way to monitor the person to see 
how the brains working if you purposely put them in a coma and 
decrease temperature and blood pressure you have no way of knowing 
if theres been damage until later 
its an extreme way of doing an operation that requires 
extreme measures said dr arthur day of the university of 
florida at gainesville and chairman of the cerebral vascular 
department of the american association of neurological surgeons 
the side effects are quite subtantial potentially day said 
so its not an operation technique that we do for the 
runofthemill aneurysm but for certain uncommon ones it may be 
the only way 
the problem is what would you be like if you didnt have the 
surgery most of the time having the aneurysm is such a bad thing 
that youre willing to take a much greater risk

prime minister rajiv gandhi traveled 
wednesday to embattled punjab state for the first time since 1985 
and urged sikhs and hindus to fight sikh extremists seeking a 
separate homeland 
tight security including more than 6000 paramilitary troops 
and a bulletproof shield for his podium surrounded the indian 
leader who placed the foundation stone for a new paper mill in 
this small village 
the government hopes the 170 million mill will help pump new 
life into a state shattered by six years of guerrilla and terrorist 
attacks sikh radicals have killed more than 1950 people in punjab 
this year nearly double the toll for 1987 
punjab is the only indian state with a sikh majority 
nationwide members of the sikh faith comprise only 2 percent of 
indias 800 million people but they form 60 percent of punjabs 18 
million people 
the antinationals want to break democracy in india but we 
must give our lives to maintain it gandhi said wearing a 
bulletproof vest as he addressed the crowd of 15000 factory 
workers pupils and teachers 
we have no fight with the sikhs only the terrorists we are 
fighting strongly and we are getting results the prime minister 
said speaking in hindi 
punjab has been one of the biggest crises for the gandhi 
government which fears the separatist movement could become a 
fullscale civil war and fan insurgencies by other restless 
minorities 
gandhi repeatedly has accused neighboring pakistan of training 
and arming sikh extremists a charge pakistan denies 
we maintain respect for all religions gandhi told the 
crowd we should not separate religions for the sake of foreign 
powers hindus and sikhs are living together and they are dying 
together the people of punjab have become an example of unity and 
integrity 
gandhis mother prime minister indira gandhi was killed by two 
of her sikh bodyguards in october 1984 four months after she 
ordered an army raid on the golden temple in amritsar where sikh 
militants were holed up more than 2000 people mostly sikhs died 
in the raid on sikhdoms holiest shrine 
gandhi traveled to goindwal 30 miles southeast of amritsar in 
an indian air force helicopter and was driven to the paper mill in 
a car 
between 6000 and 7000 paramilitary troops were deployed in the 
goindwal area during gandhis visit said ram krishnan deputy 
inspector general of the central reserve police force 
some had firearms but most were armed with steeltipped bamboo 
sticks they lined the roads for more than a mile around the paper 
mill and stood guard on rooftops and in rice paddies orange groves 
and sugar cane fields 
sikh extremists began fighting for a separate homeland six years 
ago accusing the hindudominated government of discrimination and 
of hampering economic development in punjab 
the government has taken steps to lure small and large 
industries to the state on monday it announced approval of a 17 
million deal with the usbased pepsico inc to set up a 
foodprocessing complex in punjab 
gandhi signed a peace accord with moderate sikhs in 1986 that 
collapsed within a year scattered killings blamed on sikh 
extremists escalated to attacks on crowded buses sleeping villages 
and teeming markets 
at first most of the victims were hindus but now an increasing 
number of moderate sikhs are being slain and sikh support for 
extremists has been waning 
when gandhi ordered a siege of the temple last june to drive out 
armed sikh extremists few sikhs publicly objected

gen saw maung on wednesday became the 
fourth head of government in two months the government said troops 
have killed more than 140 civilians since the hardline officer 
ousted the civilian president on sunday 
demonstrators demanding democracy and a halt to 26 years of 
authoritarian rule stayed off the streets for a second day during 
the crackdown 
troops killed 67 people wounded 34 and arrested 100 in the 
course of the governments law and order restoration work in 
rangoon and three other areas tuesday and wednesday government 
spokesman kyaw san told reporters 
kyaw san said he had no knowledge of a rumored sweep by 
authorities against student leaders who spearheaded the 
prodemocracy protests 
the latest tally brought the official death toll since the coup 
to 144 but some western diplomats in rangoon believe at least 400 
people have been killed in the burmese capital alone many when 
troops opened fire on largely unarmed protesters monday 
at rangoon general hospital there were 200 corpses on monday 
night and that was only one hospital said one diplomat speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
state radio said saw maung was named prime minister by the 
ninemember governing council appointed the day before and made up 
primarily of his military cronies he also holds the defense and 
foreign affairs portfolios 
there doesnt seem to be any end to the cycle of violence that 
has been going on since march said a western diplomatic source 
in bangkok thailand 
the government spokesman listed eight separate incidents in 
rangoon during a 20hour period beginning tuesday morning in which 
57 people died as troops broke up mobs looting government 
warehouses and a biscuit factory 
nine more people died when security forces beat back attacks on 
a local government office in mudon and a patrol in mandalay kyaw 
san said 
a mob in southern mergui city hurled a hand grenade at security 
personnel on patrol wounding 15 before they retaliated and killed 
one of the attackers he added 
prodemocracy demonstrators who have filled rangoon by the 
hundreds of thousands in recent weeks stayed off the streets 
tuesday and wednesday residents reported 
all major markets remained closed although small food stores and 
roadside shops were open 
troops conducted housetohouse searches in the heart of rangoon 
on wednesday after a nighttime attack against city hall and the 
main government administration residents and officials said no 
casualties were reported 
a government release said a group of people attacked the two 
buildings with an m79 grenade launcher and automatic weapons and 
fled after security forces returned fire 
saw maung 59 is known as a loyal follower of strongman ne win 
who seized power in 1962 and instituted a repressive 
militarybacked system that turned resourcerich burma into one of 
the worlds poorest nations 
after ne win resigned in late july the government was led for 
17 days by former military officer sein lwin who was succeeded by 
civilian president maung maung 
maung maung gave in to opposition demands to hold elections and 
allow a multiparty system the sticking point was the opposition 
demand for an interim government to ensure a fair vote maung maung 
was removed in saw maungs coup 
although saw maung also has promised multiparty elections he 
has shown no signs of establishing an interim government 
many observers believe ne win remains the supreme power in burma 
and are skeptical about the promise of elections 
its the same people running the country the bangkokbased 
diplomat said theyre trying to buy time and hold on to power 
government administration remained virtually shut down as civil 
servants sympathetic to the prodemocracy protests stayed on 
strike authorities have ordered employees back on the job by oct 
3 which is now viewed as a crucial deadline 
meanwhile staterun radio carried a code of conduct issued 
by saw maung to the 186000member military 
they must uphold the prestige of the defense forces by 
displaying good manners the code said it said military 
personnel had to refrain from all untoward financial dealings 
and should not act indecently or force their way with women 
although some soldiers defected to the antigovernment side the 
military has stayed loyal to burmas top leadership 
its a peasant army said a diplomat in bangkok their 
attitude is that they have to follow orders they trust their 
officers

the marines moved in 
ready to do battle what they found however when they arrived to 
fight wildfires in yellowstone national park was dirty 
backbreaking oftenboring work 
we just wanted to go at it were ready to go in there right 
up against it said lance cpl earl martin of bay city texas 
martin is with the 1st battalion 5th marines from camp 
pendleton calif which arrived in yellowstone last week and was 
moved to the fire lines after intensive training sessions 
the yellowstone fires which have been burning for three months 
have consumed more than 1 million acres of the 22 millionacre 
park in northwestern wyoming rain snow and cooler weather have 
curbed their spread during the last 10 days but as recently as two 
weeks ago the blazes threatened structures at the old faithful 
complex and two montana towns adjacent to the park 
on wednesday national park service officials said cool and 
moist weather kept the fires from spreading but drier weather 
expected later this week could burn new areas again 
when regular fire crews were stretched thin all across the west 
army troops and then marines were sent to yellowstone there now 
are 1200 marines and 2000 army troops on the fire lines in 
yellowstone 
but the job has not been what the marines anticipated they 
expected a toetotoe battle with a forest inferno they found the 
dirty job of mopup a term for strengthening fire lines and 
searching out and extinguishing hot spots in burned forest 
later they will work to rehabilitate areas cleared for fire 
lines wastelands deliberately created to deprive the approaching 
flames of fuel the rehabilitation effort includes erosion control 
and sifting ash and dirt to erase signs of human activity 
its not glamorous work 
it is important maybe the most important but wed like to 
see some kick up said marine cpl greg crowe of san diego 
the marines said it was their first nonmilitary assignment and 
they have traded their trademark camouflage field uniforms for 
green and yellow firefighter outfits 
the part theyve found most to their liking so far is the food 
catered by a lander wyo company called newway 
wed like them to contract to do our food said lance cpl 
michael mcloone of wilmington calif we never eat this good 
not even in the barracks 
us forest service fire commanders were uneasy when soldiers 
and marines first were dispatched to yellowstone because of their 
inexperience at firefighting officials said 
people were apprehensive they had no training and theyre too 
young said rex mann planning chief for the greater yellowstone 
area command 
but their discipline and command structure paid off he 
said im impressed and i probably will use them again 
yellowstone has been a coldweather exercise for the marines 
who have had to scrape snow off their tents and brush ice from 
their equipment 
marine maj jack carter had spent most of his summers in the 
park since he was a boy staying with his grandparents and parents 
in west yellowstone mont so he was able to fill in his superiors 
on the weather the marines would face 
we brought our longjohns he said 
carter said coming back to yellowstone and seeing some of it 
charred and smoking hit pretty hard when i first saw it 
at first youre devastated when you drive in he said 
its a shame that lots of people for lots of years wont see the 
park at its best 
carter said he never noticed the buildup of dead and fallen 
trees over the years an accumulation that contributed greatly to 
the hot fastmoving fires when youre walking on trails you 
never notice its the american mentality i think litter on the 
side of the road 
the marines will be in yellowstone at least until oct 15 which 
suits carter fine 
i love this park he said it never gets old

widespread fears of miscarriages or 
birth defects in sweden from the chernobyl nuclear plant accident 
are unfounded the government said wednesday 
the conclusions that can be drawn from the research give no 
support to the idea that radioactive fallout has had biological 
effects as rumored at the time of the accident said a statement 
from the department of social services 
sweden was one of several countries affected by fallout from the 
april 1986 explosion at the soviet nuclear power plant which 
killed 31 people in the soviet union in the worlds worst nuclear 
plant disaster 
radiation levels have been higher than normal among the reindeer 
herders in swedens northern lapland region but winds at the time 
of the accident blew most contamination north of swedens 
population centers 
swedens infant mortality rate showed a slight increase during 
the survey period amounting to 42 deaths higher than expected but 
anders ericson a section chief at the department said the 
increase was attributed to random statistical variations 
the infant deaths were not confined to areas with higher 
fallout he said by telephone 
the study was conducted between 1986 and 1988 and covered 
250000 child births ericson said 
it addressed miscarriages legal abortions underweight

americans personal income in august increased 
only half as fast as inflation the government said wednesday 
providing analysts with more evidence that economic growth has 
eased at least temporarily 
the commerce department said income grew a sluggish 02 percent 
in the worst showing since a 04 percent decline in january income 
was up a strong 07 percent in july and 06 percent in june 
meanwhile personal consumption spending which includes 
everything except interest payments on debt rose a moderate 05 
percent following a 03 percent gain in july 
the numbers are consistent with other recent government reports 
showing that the economy slowed in august from its vigorous pace 
during the first half of the year 
the unemployment rate for the month jumped to 56 percent from 
54 percent in july retail sales were off by 02 percent 
the key question is was this just a little summer hiatus and 
are we going to get back on track in the autumn or does it indicate 
something more fundamental said robert g dederick an economist 
with northern trust co in chicago 
my own view is it is a hiatus he said i dont see any 
reason why the economy decided to go into hibernation although it 
may have taken a little siesta primarily because of the heat 
analysts have blamed the summer heat for cutting into 
backtoschool sales and richard peach an economist with the 
mortgage bankers association of america said heavy use of air 
conditioners strained utilities in some parts of the country 
there were brownouts in the northeast its not inconceivable 
that because of the unavailability of power employers had to work 
half time or put people on temporary layoff he said 
as in june and july personal income in august was held back by 
declines in subsidy payments to farmers the payments shrank 62 
billion in august and 61 billion in july 
however farm income excluding subsidies fell 32 billion in 
august more than four times the july decline of 700 million 
analysts blamed the slippage on the farm belt drought that 
shriveled crops and parched pastures 
wages and salaries a key component of personal income were up 
a modest 03 percent in august compared with a large 10 percent 
gain in july 
however personal interest and dividend income both grew faster 
with interest income increasing 06 percent following a 05 percent 
rise in july and dividend income up 12 percent after a 09 percent 
gain a month earlier the gains were a reflection of rising 
interest rates and strong corporate earnings 
disposable or after tax income was up 02 percent in august 
and 06 percent a month earlier 
it was a month in which income growth was very moderate indeed 
and did not keep up with inflation dederick said a price index 
tied to the personal income report rose 04 percent double the 
income gain 
with spending rising slightly faster than income the personal 
savings rate savings as a percentage of aftertax personal income 
edged down from 42 percent in july to 39 percent in august the 
savings rate this year has averaged 41 percent up from 32 
percent last year 
the spending gain was strongest for services up 07 percent 
following a 06 percent rise in july purchases of nondurable 
goods rose 02 percent following a 03 percent increase a month 
earlier purchases of durable goods big ticket items expected 
to last three or more years were unchanged after falling 06 
percent in july 
the changes left personal incomes at a seasonally adjusted rate 
of 408 trillion and personal consumption spending at an annual 
rate of 326 trillion

to the downontheirluck residents of 
orlandos homeless shelter a foot ministry provides a welcome 
relief by soothing their soles while uplifting their souls 
four women in an informal nonreligious group wash and massage 
the feet of the poor and the tired 
feels good carol strail 33 said as she lifted her feet 
from the basin of hot water and epsom salts so bettesue hartwick 
could examine them 
ms hartwick an xray technician held ms strails feet and 
asked any blisters 
no said ms strail now that she has some softsoled shoes her 
feet are better shed spent the day working in a greenhouse in 
nearby apopka preparing rubber plants for shipment 
ms hartwick wearing rubber gloves and kneeling on the tile 
floor of the converted bus station blotted the womans feet with a 
towel and then rubbed some skin lotion on them 
it gives them a little bit of pampering ms hartwick said 
tuesday 
the hot water revives and the cool lotion soothes but more than 
anything the attention seems to restore if only briefly a 
sense of dignity that comes from being pampered each of the 20 
residents who signs up for the foot ministry also gets a pair of 
new socks 
the ministry modeled on programs for the homeless in atlanta 
and washington was suggested by sister julie sullivan a roman 
catholic nun and executive director of the coalition for the 
homeless of orlando which runs the shelter 
she found that foot care is one of the most overlooked health 
problems of the homeless who generally do not have good shoes and 
who spend a great deal of time walking or in jobs that require 
hours of standing 
ms hartwick and roseanna pratt who work together at the mayer 
family care center helped organize the group recently with the 
help of donations from their employer and their churches 
so far they have made two visits to the shelter but hope to 
make it a regular service 
ms pratt a medical secretary said she is pleased that people 
are affected by such a simple act massaging feet will not get 
people jobs or help them learn employable skills she said but it 
might remind them that others care about their struggle 
this is our country she said these are our own people

intellectuals from poland and the soviet 
union urged their governments to tell the truth about mistakes made 
during world war ii and the rule of soviet dictator josef stalin 
the call came tuesday as more than 100 polish and soviet 
writers filmmakers and historians opened a seminar on film and 
destalinization of culture in the basement of the union of 
writers in warsaw 
we came here to hurry it destalinization up a bit said 
soviet film critic irina rubanova one of the seminars organizers 
only the ruthless truth can be the basis of dialogue soviet 
historian natan eidelman said in the opening lecture 
the society of polish filmmakers and its soviet counterpart 
organized the seminar which held its first meeting in moscow in 
april 
they showed many films from the stalin era some of which have 
never been shown in poland but the meetings main focus was on 
historical blank spots only a few years ago such a meeting 
would have been unthinkable 
eidelman said the discussions in moscow helped eliminate soviet 
ignorance and added to the few facts available on stalins crimes 
but he stressed that facts alone will not ensure that the 
destalinization made possible by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or more openness on some 
issues will endure 
if you ask me what is necessary what is most important for 
our russian consciousness today i would say that what is lacking 
is a sense of shame eidelman said citing the forced 
deportations to russia of hundreds of thousands of poles we 
unfortunately have gone through this stage feebly 
in april 1987 gorbachev and polands leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski signed an agreement to establish a joint commission of 
soviet and polish historians to review the blank spots in the 
history books 
the most important one for poles is the of more than 4000 
polish officers in katyn forest during world war ii the soviets 
blame the nazis but western evidence indicates soviet 
responsibility 
many poles hoped gorbachev would address the issue during an 
official visit in july but gorbachev left poland without doing so 
eidelman had no explanation for gorbachevs silence but said 
that the person who finally cleared up katyn would need authority 
and time 
polish and soviet chairmen of the historical commission say they 
must further assess documentary evidence to reach conclusions on 
katyn 
other blank spots include stalins destruction of the polish 
communist party in the 1930s and the deportation of poles to 
siberia during world war ii 
another is the soviet armys failure to help the polish 
resistance in the warsaw uprising of 1944 two hundred thousand 
poles died while the red army camped a short distance away 
while some poles raised old wounds and lamented the slow pace of 
destalinization others welcomed the soviet efforts 
we have always believed often against hope that a moment 
will come when we will be able to talk here together as free people 
with free people with equal partners said polish historian adam 
michnik 
id like to say that we are for democratic russia because we 
are for democratic poland the longtime opposition activist said

an aide to michael dukakis dismissed as 
deception and disinformation a claim by gop national chairman 
frank fahrenkopf that the democratic nominee refused repeated 
invitations to visit military bases in massachusetts as governor 
unfortunately for the governor he cannot hide the fact that 
in his 10 years as governor he has refused although invited many 
many times to visit even one of the military installations of our 
great nation in the state of massachusetts fahrenkopf said 
tuesday while campaigning for republican nominee george bush 
this is the latest round of republican deception and 
disinformation said james dorsey the governors press 
secretary never let the facts get in the way of a good story 
its the first rule of deceptive campaigning 
dorsey said a quick check of his files showed that dukakis 
visited fort devens an army installation near shirley mass in 
march 1986 he said dukakis also visited the camp edwards military 
reservation which contains a national guard installation and otis 
air force base on cape cod in september 1985 for a change of 
command ceremony 
he said there also are photographs at dukakis campaign 
headquarters showing the governor visiting fort devens during his 
first term in 197478 
fahrenkopf did not elaborate on the allegation in his disputed 
statement press officials at republican party headquarters in 
washington telephoned for comment said they were unfamiliar with 
the matter 
standing on the deck of the retired world war ii battleship 
alabama at mobile on tuesday fahrenkopf said there will be 
severe cuts in defense spending and threatened cutbacks in navy 
plans for west and gulf coast homeports if dukakis is elected

naacp protests prompted a church 
school to cancel its fundraising slave auction in which 
students dressed as clowns would work one day for the students who 
bought them 
mock auctions have been held for more than 15 years at the 
750student temple heights christian school owned by the first 
baptist church of temple heights 
but this year a black student complained to the naacp and the 
auction was canceled tuesday 
i felt hurt by the plan to hold the auction said charrise 
williams 17 and one of three blacks in the 45member senior 
class i felt that my feelings were not being considered 
the tampa chapter of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people wrote to the school urging another 
way be found to raise money 
the concept of slavery is distasteful offensive and 
embarrassing particularly to a race of people who were brutalized 
killed and treated as less than human beings said helen lacount 
who heads the naacps legal redress committee 
ms williams said the auction was not her first encounter with 
racist attitudes at the school the teenagers mother teresa 
said her daughter had been called racially offensive terms as well 
by some students 
and when my daughter reacted to that stuff they kept telling 
her that she was too sensitive said mrs williams a nurse who 
moved from washington dc last november 
i dont think they would hold a holocaust scene and defend it 
i dont think they should hold a slave sale she said adding she 
was unsure if she will keep her daughter in the school 
after all my daughter told the school she was against it 
they should have known that once you offend one student with 
something like this you have offended one too many mrs 
williams said 
principal randy hurst said wednesday that after the student 
complained school officials agreed to change the name and format 
of next years fundraising event 
we were going to go through with it this year because the kids 
had already bought their clown outfits he said it seemed like 
everything was fine no one was upset 
then i got a call from the naacp there you have it he 
said weve been doing this for so many years it never had any 
racial overtones just a fun day for the students 
hurst said he has permanently canceled the auctions they 
traditionally raised 1000 to 1500 and were never meant to 
demean blacks he said 
in the auction students in clown outfits stand on a block and 
are auctioned the purchased slave spends the next day with the 
master doing minor chores like carrying books and perfoming 
ridiculous stunts

a black high school student says she was 
told to go back to the ghetto during a football game prompting 
school officials wednesday to promise to work toward preventing 
future racial clashes 
shana cannell a 14yearold freshman said a cheerleader at 
pekin led other students in racially harassing blacks at the sept 
2 game between the peoria lions and the pekin dragons 
while i was playing in the peoria band pekin high school 
students taunted my friends and me with racial slurs such as 
go back to the ghetto the teenager wrote in a letter to the 
journal star of peoria 
she added that one of the more vocal students was a pekin 
cheerleader who was standing in front of her coach and referred 
to her by a common racial epithet 
jack wilt pekin school district superintendent said he has 
found no witnesses but has no reason to doubt the girls story 
wilt said he plans on offering her a written apology 
i cant pinpoint who made the remarks but i dont doubt they 
were made wilt said wednesday 
ms cannells father julian cannell the peoria school district 
attorney said an apology is not the answer 
my speculation is the teachers and parents in pekin dont 
care he said they must educate their children that overt 
racism will not be tolerated in our society 
chic renner president of the pekin school board said wednesday 
that the remarks of a few students do not reflect the attitudes of 
everyone in pekin 
wilt said there is a history of racial problems at athletic 
events involving pekin and peoria high which has 1200 students 
and a 39 percent minority enrollment 
he noted that less than 1 percent of pekin highs 2500member 
student body is black and only one or two black families live in 
pekin 
renner is concerned the incident is rekindling the longstanding 
perception of pekin as a racist community 
i dont know how long we have to dwell on it he said we 
recognize the problem and are trying to deal with it and cure it

nuclear power plants have raised more than 55 million to defeat 
the referendum according to disclosure statements 
sponsors of the referendum citizens for safe energy have 
raised 280184 according to the disclosure forms 
getting rid of the emotion on this issue is really tough 
said robert palmer spokesman for the massachusetts citizens 
against the shutdown organization also known as the vote no on 4 
committee 
money does not buy the vote but money produces information 
palmer said tuesday this is what needs to be done to get the 
message across 
palmer said the money would be spent primarily for radio and 
television advertising he also said the money being donated by 
utilities comes out of earnings and has no effect on electric rates 
leading contributors to the committee have been boston edison 
co with 14 million the yankee atomic electric co with 17 
million and montaup electric with 450759 according to disclosure 
reports filed with the office of campaign and political finance

its cause including more than 100 academic civic business and 
labor leaders some of whom oppose nuclear power generally but also 
oppose the potential sweeping impact of the ballot proposal

the slayings of a homeless man who was 
stabbed 14 times and disemboweled and of another man who was 
covered with silver paint have stunned this community that had had 
only two previous killings this year 
three teenagers are being held in the death of the 73yearold 
homeless man police said wednesday he was beaten stabbed and 
left bleeding in an alley sunday night while the youths discussed 
how to finish the job 
the body of the man covered with silver paint was found in a 
field tuesday night he apparently was beaten with a paint can 
found nearby said lowell police capt tom cullen 
it was an unusual situation people thought it was all over 
less than 48 hours later we had another cullen siad 
the homeless man louis pozyck had lived in lowell for 10 years 
and was often seen pushing a shopping cart looking for cans which 
he collected for money cullen said he was awarded the bronze star 
during world war ii 
he was kind of a character he hung around lowell was 
harmless had a lot of friends turns out hes a decorated war 
hero we didnt know that until he was killed he said 
sunday night pozcyk was sleeping in an alley when a youth 
confronted him cullen said 
it appears he was woken up by one of them and told to take 
off he was kicked in the face and stabbed by one person who left 
the scene 
the assailant met two friends and the three returned to the 
alley and pozyck was again stabbed he said 
then they went to a shopping center they decided they better 
go back and make sure he was dead they discussed maybe they 
should burn him 
the youths returned to the alley a third time and one of them 
disemboweled the man cullen said neighbors who heard the mans 
screams called police 
brian gobis 18 and michael morrisette 17 both of lowell were 
charged with murder monday and were being held without bail cullen 
said a hearing has been set to determine if the 16yearold 
suspect can be tried as an adult said a spokesman for the 
middlesex county district attorneys office 
in the second murder the man whose name was being withheld 
was found in a field a few hours after he had gone to buy paint 
at first it looked like a ritualtype killing but then as we 
tried to reconstruct it it appeared that the paint can was the 
weapon cullen said 
no arrests have been made in that case 
lowell with a population of about 100000 is 25 miles 
northwest of boston police sgt patrick burns said wednesday 
afternoon that to his knowledge the city had had only four murders 
so far this year

higher food shelter and gasoline prices 
maintained an annual inflation pace of 52 percent in august as the 
effects of the drought on consumers began to ease the government 
said wednesday 
food and beverage prices rose 05 percent for the month 
compared with 09 percent in july when the labor department said 
the greatest impact of the dry weather in the farm belt began 
reaching consumer pocketbooks 
but gasoline prices jumped a whopping 3 percent in august the 
biggest increase in 12 months analysts noted that the normal 
summer vacation season price spikes for gasoline are usually over 
by august but that there were shortages of unleaded grades in many 
markets this year 
despite lower utility bills and home energy costs shelter 
expenses also were up 06 percent in august their largest increase 
in seven months the labor department said 
increases in the food shelter and energy components accounted 
for over fourfifths of the august advance in the consumer price 
index the government said 
when combined with large price declines for clothing and natural 
gas the overall august price increases were the same as the 04 
percent in july 
the calculated annualized rate also was the same for both months 
52 percent in contrast to a 44 percent inflation rate in 1987 
and the first six months of this year labor department economists 
said 
we have a gradual worsening of underlying inflation but it is 
gradual sneaking in sort of like dust through a window said 
robert g dederick an economist at northern trust co in chicago 
one month is up one month is down but pretty soon you have 
higher inflation 
but private analysts agreed with a white house assessment that 
there was nothing alarming or dramatic in the numbers 
the scare that were off to the races or that an inflationary 
sprial is under way has not materialized and it wont 
materialize said larry chimerine of the wefa group a bala 
cynwyd pa consulting firm 
there is a gradual acceleration of inflation heavily 
concentrated in material prices and prices of imported goods 
chimerine said but at this point it is not spreading throughout 
the economy 
a separate report by the commerce department showed personal 
income rising a modest 02 percent in august the smallest gain in 
eight months although much of it represented declines in both farm 
subsidies and farm income wages and salaries were up just 03 
percent 
after adjustments for inflation the labor department said 
americans average weekly earnings fell a percipitous 13 percent 
in august the decline in workers buying power was the third in 
the past four months and the worst ever on record since the 
government began keeping tabs on real earnings in 1964 
the decrease stemmed from a 09 percent drop in the average 
number of hours worked from 349 hours to 346 hours and the 04 
percent hike in consumer prices average hourly earnings were 
924 unchanged from july 
another commerce department report showed housing construction 
falling 33 percent last month with a steep drop in new 
apartments for the first eighth months of this year housing 
starts are running 99 percent below the same period in 1987 
analysts said apartment construction has never recovered from 
the blow suffered from the elimination of tax shelters in a law 
taking effect in january 1987 
the easing of food price increases had been anticipated by most 
analysts grocery prices alone were up 08 percent last month but 
that compared with a jump of 14 percent in july the biggest 
increase in 4 years 
about 90 percent of the august advance was due to price 
increases for items that were adversely affected by the drought 
fruits and vegetables cereal and bakery products poultry and 
eggs the government said 
fruit and vegetable prices rose 13 percent atop a 29 percent 
gain in july they have jumped a total of 106 percent over the 
last year cereal and bakery product prices were up 16 percent 
the largest monthly increase since january 1981 reflecting higher 
prices for wheat oats and eggs the government said 
excluding food there were wide price swings in both directions 
the 3 percent increase in gasoline prices for example was 
partially offset price declines of 12 percent for natural gas 08 
percent for home heating oil and 02 percent for electricity 
apparel prices fell another 16 percent after smaller declines 
in june and july reflecting what the government said were 
unusually large endofseason discounts for womens clothing 
but auto financing charges and used car prices jumped 15 
percent in the month and auto insurance rates climbed another 08 
percent 
if there is any surprise its in the number of large price 
changes said donald ratajczak director of economic forecasting 
at georgia state university it indicates that sellers are having 
a hard time determining what is an acceptable price in the 
marketplace 
ratajczak said preliminary data from his own surveys suggest the 
same thing occuring this month 
the big declines in clothing and natural gas prices are 
over he said next month the fall fashions come in so 
clothing should be up sharply and school tuitions will come in 
even bigger 
but the effect of the drought pretty much should have run its 
course by then and we shouldnt have another large increase in food 
prices ratajczak said and gasoline prices shouldnt be up 
well have a couple of good things and notsogood things

a conductor of the soviet unions bolshoi 
opera defected in bolivia earlier this month and has been granted 
asylum in the united states state department officials said 
wednesday 
ruben vartanan described as one of four or five conductors 
associated with the bolshoi turned up at the us embassy in la 
paz about two weeks ago and has since arrived in washington he is 
scheduled to appear at a news conference on thursday 
one official said vartanan defected while on vacation but the 
jamestown foundation a private group that assists defectors and 
has arranged for the thursday news conference said the artist went 
to the us embassy while on a concert tour 
according to the officials vartanan said he was tired of 
artistic restrictions in the soviet union in addition he told 
us officials that his career has not thrived in recent years 
because he was perceived by soviet authorities as having developed 
an affinity for life in the west 
as part of a cultural agreement between bolivia and the soviet 
union vartanan spent an extended period in bolivia in the mid 
1970s conducting the countrys national symphony orchestra said 
the officials who insisted on anonymity 
us law provides that asylum may be granted to an alien who has 
a wellfounded fear of persecution if he returns to his 
homeland based on race religion political views or other 
criteria the granting of asylum to soviet defectors is virtually 
automatic 
vartanan is the latest in a long list of soviet artists who have 
defected to the united states 
two of the best known over the past decade are alexander 
godunov a bolshoi ballet dancer and maxim shostakovich a 
conductor godunov defected in 1979 and shostakovich in 1981 
others include oles vidov a movie star who defected in 1985 
and nicolai and bertalina nikolski high wire artists in 1986

the fbi said wednesday it has launched a 
kidnapping investigation based on a couples allegation that their 
healthy baby was swapped in a hospital nursery nearly a decade ago 
for a fatally ill child 
ernest and regina twigg of langhorne pa contend someone at 
the hospital deliberately switched the children allegedly to 
provide for someone willing to pay to adopt a well baby 
after consultation with the us attorneys office we have 
opened a preliminary investigation to gather facts said russ 
wood fbi spokesman he refused to discuss specifics 
meanwhile the father of a 9yearold southwest florida girl 
said he will not permit a blood test to satisfy questions about 
whether she is the his biological daughter the st petersburg 
times reported wednesday 
the twiggs think the girl may be their daughter and their 
lawyer marvin ellin of baltimore said sophisticated genetic blood 
testing should resolve the question ellin said he talked to the 
girls father and he indicated that he would think about it 
but the father had a different recollection 
i said no he told the newspaper our sympathy is there 
for their problem but at some point i have to draw the line 
we dont have to prove anything to the world we already know who 
we are 
ellin has filed a 100 million lawsuit against three doctors a 
nurse and hardee memorial hospital in wauchula he also has asked 
federal authorities to look into the possibility that the babies 
identification bracelets were switched and hospital records altered 
arlena twigg the child raised by the pennsylvania couple died 
last month of a lifelong heart problem a month earlier 
sophisticated blood and tissue testing at johns hopkins hospital in 
baltimore concluded that the girl was not related to the twiggs

afghanistans official news agency 
said wednesday that 10 people were killed and eight wounded when 
rebels rocketed the capital the day before 
it contrasted with a tuesday night report on official radio 
kabul that indicated 62 people died in the attack 
the communist bakhtar news agency said the 10 deaths occurred 
when six rockets landed in separate parts of the city late tuesday 
afternoon 
radio kabul monitored in islamabad said in its pashtolanguage 
broadcast tuesday night that since the april 14 signing of the 
geneva accord providing for a soviet troop withdrawal kabul and 
its suburbs were hit by criminals rockets 15 times and the 16th 
rocket attack took place tonight 
as a result of the attack 62 innocent people including women 
and children were killed and 104 were wounded it said 
but the radio earlier reported the 10 dead and it appeared the 
announcer meant to say there had been a total 62 dead from all 16 
attacks 
western diplomatic sources have reported the number of guerrilla 
rocketings and casualties to be much higher 
weekly accounts relayed from western embassies in kabul report 
incoming rockets almost every day 
moslem insurgents fired dozens of rockets into kabul airport on 
sept 1 and 5 blowing up a massive ammunition dump and destroying 
at least five aircraft moscows tass news agency put casualties at 
nine dead but western and guerrilla sources said they believed it 
was more like 50 or more 
the guerrillas have been fighting the marxist government since 
the communists seized power in a 1978 military coup 
under the geneva agreement all of an estimated 100000 red army

us officials expect little progress in arms 
control talks thursday between soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and president reagan in large part because the 
administration and congress cannot agree on what strategic weapons 
to deploy in the future 
we certainly know we cant finish the start strategic arms 
reduction talks treaty this year assistant secretary of state 
rozanne ridgway told a congressional panel tuesday 
the us presidential election makes it hard to hammer out the 
incredibly complex details of a start agreement during reagans 
remaining four months in office particularly the inspection 
regimes needed to verify proposed 30 percent to 50 percent cuts in 
strategic weapons systems 
besides the devilish details however the united states has 
reached an impasse in its own strategic planning that vastly 
complicates efforts to conclude an arms control treaty an 
agreement that would govern the deployment of american forces for 
decades 
shevardnadze who was arriving wednesday afternoon was to meet 
thursday with reagan secretary of state george shultz and vice 
president george bush 
the talks say us officials will concentrate mainly on the 
nonarms aspects of the administrations fourpoint agenda 
bilateral relations human rights and multilateral issues such as 
the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan and cuban troops 
from angola 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev made little 
progress on arms control at the june summit in moscow and movement 
will probably be slow well into the next administration according 
to many observers in the administration and on capitol hill 
the three key stumbling blocks are the star wars program to 
develop landand spacebased antimissile weapons the development 
and deployment of mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles 
icbms and whether to control submarine launched cruise missiles 
slcms 
the soviets oppose a start deal without a us commitment that 
star wars research will not break the 1972 antiballistic missile 
treaty for a set period of time probably eight to 10 years 
the soviets also want the united states to agree to a limit on 
nucleartipped submarinelaunched cruise missiles above the 
overall 6000warhead limit agreed upon in the proposed start 
treaty 
on the third major issue the united states is pressing for a 
ban on all groundlaunched mobile icbms which would require the 
soviets to dismantle their already deployed ss24 and ss25 mobile 
missiles 
the united states has not decided whether or how to deploy a 
mobile missile the administration and congress are sparring on 
whether to develop a 10warhead railmobile mx missile similar to 
the soviet ss24 or a singlewarhead roadmobile midgetman 
similar to the soviet ss25 
reagan vetoed congress defense authorization bill for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 in part because it provided only about 
4 billion for star wars versus the administration request of 48 
billion and because congress insisted that star wars tests not 
violate the abm pact 
the potential conflict between the abm treaty and star wars 
formally known as the strategic defense initiative or sdi has 
dominated public discussion of arms control for years 
but it may be diverting attention from other crucial issues 
even sdi advocates such as former white house national security 
adviser robert mcfarlane acknowledge that we do not know and 
cannot know for the next 10 or 15 years whether sdis defensive 
technologies provide the means to defend us against ballistic 
missiles 
us negotiators have rejected soviet proposals for putting 
limits on nucleartipped submarinelaunched cruise missiles 
weaponry in which the united states holds a technological and 
numerical lead 
we have not seen any way to verify such limits without in 
effect giving up our navy to soviet inspection and control 
assistant secretary of defense ron lehman in an interview last week 
despite the us lead in cruise missiles launched by submarines 
this could turn out to be a problem for the united states in the 
future 
although the soviets have fewer cruise missiles deployed aboard 
their submarines they have the worlds densest antiaircraft 
system estimated by the pentagon to consist of 12000 missiles 
and most soviet cities and military targets are located deep within 
the country presenting slowmoving cruise missiles with a long 
potential flight time 
the united states in contrast has virtually no antiair 
defenses along its extensive coastlines and major us cities lie 
right on the east and west coasts 
shortly before reagan flew to moscow for the summit there the 
house armed services committee issued a report urging the 
administration to take a long hard look at us strategic forces 
and determine what it wanted before concluding a new arms control 
accord the treaty appears no closer than it did then but neither 
does domestic agreement on the shape of the us strategic arsenal

patients will not be able to identify the recalled tablets 
themselves and should check with their pharmacies the fda said

if one picture is worth a thousand words

his seventh and eighthgrade students to find one thats worth 1 
million 
oyer a teacher at midprairie junior high school assigned each 
letter of the alphabet a value a equals 1 b equals 2 and so 
on to z which is worth 26 and challenged his students to find a 
word tha when the letters numerical value is multiplied equals 
1 million 
for example the word cab would be 6 c 3 times a 1 
times b 2 
the reward for finding a winning word is best expressed with a 
letter not a numeral 
the first student that brings it in gets an a on the 
assignment oyer said 
proper names are not allowed the word has to be in the 
dictionary 
oyer said he knows of at least two words worth a million 
although students have yet to find one so far the closest is 
village at 997920 located by heidi troyer an eighthgrader 
oyer said he cannot take credit for designing the competition 
its not original with me it came from the arithmetic teacher

the new el dorado county jail would 
be ready to open except for one problem the cell doors wont lock 
faulty electronics have affected the high technology locks 
along with television monitors and a communication system jail 
commander ed newman said recently 
these are very dramatic problems said newman adding that 
13 flawed electronic panels are literally the hands and feet of 
the officers the panels have been shipped to a maryland 
electronics company to be reworked and wont be back for three 
weeks 
the jails design relies on a central control post from which 
guards can electronically open and close cell doors communicate 
with inmates and operate lights 
to compensate the county for the delays general services

despite a larger tobacco crop this year a 
drop in inventories points to a smaller total supply in the 198889 
marketing season the agriculture department said wednesday 
stocks entering the new marketing year likely will equal 285 
billion pounds about 14 percent lower than a year earlier the 
departments economic research service said in a new outlook 
report although surpluses continue for some kinds and grades 
there are shortages for others 
nationally the 1988 tobacco harvest is up about 10 percent from 
last year because of increased acreage and greater yields due to 
better weather for fluecured and some other kinds of tobacco dry 
weather kept burley yields below normal but those still were up 
from last years low levels 
prospects for world tobacco use next season indicate a small 
increase in sales and use of cigarettes and unmanufactured 
tobacco the report said us tobacco use may increase from 
198788s 166 billion pounds because of greater use of 
domestically grown tobacco in us cigarettes and higher cigarette 
production 
the report said us cigarette output this year is expected to 
increase from 689 billion pieces in 1987 because of rising 
exports 
however cigarette consumption among americans 18 years and 
older is expected to continue a longterm decline dropping around 
1 percent this year from an average of 3196 cigarettes in 1987 
which was the lowest since world war ii cigarette use peaked at 
4345 pieces about 217 packs of 20 cigarettes each in 1963 
the cigarette use figures are estimates that include smokers and 
nonsmokers alike and are used as statistical comparisons from year 
to year

apartment construction in august sunk to the 
lowest level in more than six years outweighing a small gain in 
singlefamily home building the government said wednesday 
the commerce department said housing construction fell 33 
percent last month to an annual level of 144 million units a 169 
percent plunge in the volatile apartment category to 350000 units 
more than offset a 21 percent gain in singlefamily homes to 109 
million units 
the singlefamily home category has fluctuated in a fairly 
narrow range this year at an annual rate of around 11 million 
units however the apartment sector has approached a rate of 
500000 units in some months and now rests at its lowest point 
since june 1982 when the last recession was ending 
the singlefamily level is pretty good its been an 
incredibly stable element of the market but the multiunit number 
is staggering said david seiders chief economist of the 
national association of home builders 
analysts have been expecting housing activity to taper off 
because the federal reserve board has been pushing up interest 
rates since late march in an effort to curb inflation 
but seiders said home buyers appear to be turning to adjustable 
rate mortgages which cost less than fixedrate mortgages but whose 
rates can change 
also fixedrate mortgages have not risen as fast as many 
economists were expecting according to the federal home loan 
mortgage corp fixedrate mortgages not including addon fees 
known as points hit a high of 1071 percent in midaugust but have 
since eased dropping to 104 percent last week 
the overall decline in august housing starts followed gains of 
14 percent in july and 52 percent in june 
for the first eight months of 1988 housing starts have been 
running 99 percent below the level of activity during the same 
period in 1987 singlefamily construction is lagging by 67 
percent while apartment construction trails by 176 percent 
mark obrinsky an economist with the us league of savings 
institutions said apartment construction was dealt a heavy blow 
when the tax law that took effect in january 1987 reduced the 
profitability of real estate investments also vacancy rates are 
high 
the vacancy rate for rental housing was 77 percent in the 
apriljune period this year compared with rates between 5 percent 
and 6 percent through the 1960s and 1970s he said 
building permits a good barometer of future housing activity 
were up 19 percent last month to 145 million units a year after 
falling 49 percent in july 
by region housing starts fell 207 percent in the northeast to 
207000 units and 172 percent in the midwest to 240000 
starts were up 143 percent in the west to 424000 units and up 
04 percent in the south to 565000 
the northeast is taking a beating now said michael 
sumichrast a private housing economist in washington the new 
york sales market is practically dead its still suffering from 
the financial market collapse and layoffs in the securities 
industry

former teamsters president roy l 
williams could be paroled from federal prison as soon as tuesday 
under the recommendation of a us parole commission panel his 
lawyer said wednesday 
f russell millin said the commission is to act on the 
recommendation of the parole examiners by friday a deadline 
imposed by a federal judge millin said the commission is not 
bound by the recommendation but a spokesman told the kansas city 
star such recommendations are followed 90 percent of the time 
joseph korbinsky a commission spokesman in washington refused 
to disclose the examiners recommendation after the hearing in 
springfield 
williams was convicted in 1982 of conspiring to bribe former 
us sen howard cannon of nevada to influence trucking 
deregulation williams a longtime kansas city area labor leader 
was forced to resign the union presidency which he had held for 
about a year following his conviction 
the commissions guidelines called for his release after 24 to 
36 months of the 10year sentence he began serving in december 1985 
but the commission set williams parole date in 1990 after his 
links to organized crime were established by testimony he gave in 
another case earlier this month the commission set a new date of 
jan 13 1989 saying it was a reward for williams cooperation and 
in consideration of his health williams 73 suffers from 
emphysema and an enlarged heart 
us district judge william r collinson reviewed williams 
petition for release and ruled last month that the parole 
commission was unconstitutionally punishing him for admissions the 
government forced him to make about his links to reputed mob 
leaders he said he would order williams release friday if the 
board did not reconsider his parole 
bruce c houdek a second kansas city lawyer representing 
williams said the examiners said their recommendation would 
include a condition that williams would continue to cooperate 
with the authorities 
houdek said williams told examiners tuesday that he was sick 
and wanted to go home to his farm in leeton

negotiations on us use of greek military 
bases will resume in athens early next month greek foreign 
minister karolos papoulias announced wednesday after meeting with 
secretary of state george shultz 
but there has been no change on the deadlocked issue that 
prompted a us break off of the talks sept 5 greeces demand 
for us forces to vacate hellenikon air base at athens 
international airport papoulias told reporters 
besides hellenikon the fiveyear usgreece bases agreement 
expiring this year covers the nea makri us communications base 
near athens a naval and an air base on the island of crete and 20 
smaller installations 
hellenikon is an issue on which the greek and american sides 
have taken different opinions however the outcome of the 
negotiations cannot be judged at this point they can only be 
judged when the negotiations are completed papoulias said 
the foreign minister who described his state department talks 
as constructive said negotiations would resume the first week of 
october 
departing from wideranging discussions and lunch with shultz 
and other senior us officials at the state department papoulias 
said he was flying to boston on wednesday afternoon to meet 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis the democratic presidential 
nominee whose parents were born in greece 
the election campaign has stirred intense interest in greece 
welljustified because dukakis is the son of greek immigrants to 
america papoulias said 
the foreign minister sought meetings with both dukakis and his 
republican rival vice president george bush said achilles 
paparsenos the greek embassy press attache a bush meeting has not 
yet been fixed for papoulias who plans to attend the un general 
assembly next week in new york the attache said 
after seeing dukakis the greek foreign minister plans to return 
to washington for meetings thursday with several members of 
congress and with commerce secretary william verity and us trade 
representative clayton yeutter in his dual capacity as the current 
ministerial chief of the european economic community paparsenos 
said 
those attending the lunch wednesday with papoulias included 
ambassador alan h flanigan the chief us negotiator who 
suspended the athens talks earlier this month to return to 
washington for instructions on the surprise greek demand to quit 
hellenikon 
papoulias also met with assistant secretary of state rozanne 
ridgway who on tuesday described hellenikon as a central issue in 
the negotiations the united states has a contingency plan for 
quitting hellenikon if there is no agreement but has not started 
any preparations to leave she told a congressional hearing 
the us bases issue does not affect the north atlantic treaty 
organization because the agreement under renegotiation is a 
bilateral matter not covering use of the installations by nato 
papoulias said 
urban development and congestion around athens airport are major 
reasons greece wants us forces to quit hellenikon paparsenos 
said 
shultz briefed papoulias on the ussoviet dialogue and the two 
discussed uscommon market trade relations the middle east 
southern african and eastwest issues the foreign minister said

us district judge oliver gasch refused 
wednesday to bar the department of housing and urban development 
from selling singlefamily homes it had acquired through mortgage 
foreclosures to the highest bidder 
gasch issued an order denying a preliminary injunction requested 
by a coalition of advocates for the homeless but said the reasons 
for his ruling would be made public later 
two temporary restraining orders issued last month prevented 
hud from selling houses in michigan and washington dc and its 
suburbs 
hud general counsel j michael dorsey commenting on the 
decision said through the press office that the departments 
inventory of 47000 foreclosed houses would go on sale thursday 
morning through its field offices 
hud will continue to make certain singlefamily acquired 
properties available to homeless providers through lease and 
discount sales programs he said 
the coalition represented by the national housing law project 
had argued that hud had violated the law by selling its stock of 
foreclosed singlefamily homes to the highest bidder without 
determining whether they could be beneficial to the homeless and 
lowincome people 
gasch was told by the coalition last friday that hud receives 
70000 houses each year about 7000 a month but the agency 
cannot proceed as if it is simply in the real estate business 
they must consider the homeless said attorney william bradford 
we are disappointed that he did not grant the preliminary 
injunction bradford said of wednesdays order however he 
declined further comment until a written opinion is issued by gasch 
hud has said that it generally sells the homes to the highest 
bidders frequently investors but insists that it has several 
programs designed to help homeless people find places to live 
recently hud has been selling an average of 7100 properties 
each month houses that had federal housing administration mortgage 
insurance and that went into foreclosure when their owners could no 
longer keep up the mortgage payments the program has produced some 
24 billion in proceeds since oct 1 the start of the current 
fiscal year 
hud officials had argued that the temporary restraining orders 
if upheld could cost the agency 3 billion a year and bankrupt its 
singlefamily mortgage insurance fund

solidaritys lech walesa commenting on 
the resignation of prime minister zbigniew messners government 
said wednesday that poland does not need another personnel shakeup 
but a change in the system 
the influential communist weekly polityka gave frontpage play 
wednesday to a deputys remarks in parliament that the government 
lacks independence and is too subordinate to the polish united 
workers communist party 
messner and all 19 of his cabinet ministers under attack for 
their handling of the economy stepped down monday in the first 
mass resignation of the government in polands postwar history 
the sejm or parliament is scheduled to meet sept 27 to name a 
new prime minister who would have a brief period to assemble a new 
government the staterun pap news service said 
under polands political system the party is the ultimate seat 
of power it appoints the government through its mandated majority 
in parliament the party sets goals and it is the responsibility 
of the government to execute them 
i am against personnel shakeups i am for systematic 
changes walesa a nobel peace laureate said in a telephone 
interview 
if the personnel changes dont bring about any systematic 
changes then they are good for nothing 
walesa said however that removal of messner and his cabinet 
may enable certain systematic changes he said the government 
had been burdened by negative solutions 
his remarks were echoed by journalist tadeusz mazowiecki a 
senior adviser to the outlawed solidarity free trade union movement 
which walesa helped found and formerly headed 
mazowiecki said the government changes would be positive if 
one were to look at it as a manifestation of some broader changes 
if it is to be only a personnel shakeup then we are not 
interested 
deputy mikolaj kozakiewicz told parliament on monday that the 
government cannot be held responsible for polands problems because 
it lacks freedom of action he cited the dominance of the party 
apparatus over daytoday government affairs 
i am only stating aloud what everybody has known for some 
time that under the present political system the government has 
not been and is not sovereign kozakiewicz a reformminded 
member of the communistallied peasant party said 
it is impossible to institute radical economic and 
sociopolitical changes without an equally radical change in the 
manner of exercising the leading role of the party 
polityka on wednesday ran a frontpage story on the governments 
removal under a headline saying government collapsed problems 
remained 
the article devoted considerable space to kozakiewiczs remarks 
and commented in our country the crisis has covered the whole 
system of ruling and it is not new faces in the government that 
will help overcome it

rioters burned homes and cars and gunfire rang 
throughout a city at the heart of an annexation battle between the 
southern soviet republics of armenia and azerbaijan the official 
tass news agency reported wednesday 
officials in azerbaijans disputed territory of nagornokarabakh 
imposed a curfew and banned gatherings to cool ethnic passions 
after violence broke out tuesday and wednesday in and around 
stepanakert the territorys largest city 
in yerevan capital of neighboring armenia officials rejected a 
demand by thousands of protesters for a new meeting of the 
republics supreme soviet or parliament to renew a petition for 
annexation of nagornokarabakh a mountain enclave 
there are hundreds of thousands of people in front of the 
supreme soviet said arpenay popoyan wife of activist and former 
political prisoner rafael popoyan 
the city is very tense she said in a telephone interview 
from yerevan a general strike that began sept 16 continued 
her husband said later by telephone that a government 
announcement was read on armenian television declaring such a 
session by the supreme soviet would be illegal and rejecting the 
demand 
this answer is a violation of the constitution said popoyan 
he said by law a session must be held if onethird of the 
supreme soviet deputies request it and he said more than onethird 
have signed such a request 
the soviet government wednesday banned foreign journalists from 
traveling to yerevan from tbilisi georgia for temporary 
reasons 
tass said no one was injured in the disturbances in 
nagornokarabakh 
the gunfire and arson by ethnic rioters in stepanakert and 
vicinity followed a gun battle sunday in the nearby village of 
khadzhaly one man died and at least 25 people were wounded 
activists also said a bomb exploded monday at a dormitory for 
armenian construction workers near stepanakert 
all this created an alarming situation many residents in the 
central city of stepanakert and rural regions are worried about 
their safety tass said 
tass did not say whether armenians azerbaijanis or both were 
behind the violence 
it said homes and cars were set afire in nagornokarabakh 
tuesday night and wednesday morning and that shots were heard it 
said factories schools and transportation companies were closed in 
stepanakert 
the nagornokarabakh communist party and council of peoples 
deputies said in an appeal to the population in the current 
situation various kinds of meetings demonstrations marches and 
gatherings can aggravate the situation further 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze speaking in 
copenhagen denmark said without elaborating that the kremlin was 
considering the use of some emergency action to deal with the 
rising unrest 
the stepanakert and agdam regions of nagornokarabakh were 
placed on a special status lower than a state of emergency 
and a curfew was imposed tass said 
telephone calls to stepanakert did not go through 
popoyan said soldiers patrolled stepanakert and received 
permission to search houses at will 
people are simply sitting home and not going anywhere 
naturally theyre not going to work he said 
although nagornokarabakh is part of azerbaijan it is 
predominantly armenian residents began agitating in february for 
annexation to armenia 
popoyan said in a telephone interview earlier wednesday that 
military units were in yerevan but not visible on the streets 
popoyan said armenians were demanding that the annexation issue 
be reconsidered because the government can no longer guarantee 
the safety of armenians living in nagornokarabakh 
the armenian parliament made a similar appeal to the national 
government in june but azerbaijan opposed it and the central 
government rejected the idea instead central authorities 
developed a plan of economic and social development 
about 25 armenians at an armenian cemetery in moscow wednesday 
afternoon criticized the soviet press for what they called 
unbalanced reporting on disturbances in the southern republics 
thirtytwo people were killed in ethnic rioting in sumgait an 
industrial city of azerbaijan at the end of february 
some calm returned after the national supreme soviet on july 18 
rejected annexation a handful of foreign journalists was permitted 
to visit yerevan this month before the city was closed again

chicago businessman noah robinson jesse 
jacksons halfbrother remained jailed wednesday on murder charges 
in a case described by authorities as a ganglandstyle execution 
this is absolutely the most complicated case weve ever worked 
on said detective keith morton he said tuesdays arrest follows 
a 2year investigation that took him to chicago 10 times in the 
past year 
robinson was the sixth person charged with murder in the 1986 
slaying of leroy hambone barber outside a greenville business 
owned by robinson five others alleged members of chicagos el 
rukn street gang were charged several weeks ago 
barber once worked for robinson in chicago and the two men had 
had several altercations over the years the greenville piedmont 
reported wednesday 
robinson 46 surrendered tuesday and was being held at the 
greenville county detention center a bond hearing wednesday was 
postponed at the request of robinsons attorneys and was not 
immediately rescheduled 
the warrant charging robinson said witnesses and codefendants 
allege that robinson hired people to murder barber 
matt hawley deputy assistant solicitor said his office 
probably will seek the death penalty against robinson hawley said 
under state law hiring directing or soliciting a murder is 
considered an aggravating circumstance 
the rev jm flemming a greenville pastor distributed a 
statement by robinson that said i had no role in or no knowledge 
of that killing prior to it happening 
in the statement robinson said the case against him was based 
on information given to police by el rukns who have criminal 
records and were offered cash and lenient sentences in exchange for 
testifying against him 
he attacked their credibility and provided the arrest records of 
some codefendants who he said were cooperating with the 
investigation 
robinsons attorney robert f simone of philadelphia described 
robinsons case as a relatively simple one 
simone said wednesday the case has to do with whether you 
believe the governments informants its all a question of 
credibility or believability 
robinson owns a construction company and several other

a top gibraltar police officer testified 
wednesday that this british colonys border officials were 
purposely kept uninformed about an antiterrorist operation to 
permit an ira unit to enter unhindered from spain 
the operation resulted in british commandos shooting and killing 
three unarmed irish republican army members on march 6 
gibraltar police chief inspector joe ullger told a coroners 
inquest that neither gibraltar immigration officers nor those in 
customs were informed of the operation because the only way for 
it to succeed was to allow the terrorists to come in to the 
colony 
his disclosure came under crossexamination on the 12th day of 
the inquest into the deaths of sean savage 24 daniel mccann 30 
and mairead farrell 31 
members of britains elite special air service sas branch of 
the military who fired more than two dozen bullets into the bodies 
of farrell mccann and savage testified that the antiira mission 
had been to arrest the three 
another witness gibraltar resident josephine celecia testified 
wednesday that from her secondfloor bedroom window she saw one of 
the soldiers standing over two fallen bodies at a filling station 
across the street and then heard four or five shots fired 
she said that earlier she had seen mccann and ms farrell 
walking together toward the border 
i looked away and then heard two loud bangs she said 
mrs celecia said when she looked back she saw a man whose 
hands were pointing towards the ground with two people lying 
there 
she said she then heard four or five more shots 
michael hucker the lawyer for the seven sas commandos involved 
in the operation challenged her statements 
a lot of this youre saying just isnt the truth hucker 
said the events have been muddled over the months 
im just saying what i saw mrs celecia said 
the seven commandos and several british intelligence officers 
have testified they believed the three were armed and dangerous and 
on a mission to set off a car bomb in gibraltar by a radiocontrol 
device when they were shot 
the commandos who did the shooting said they fired with intent 
to kill when the three answered their challenge with sudden and 
aggressive movements 
after the shootings police found no radiocontrol device and no 
bomb in the car parked by savage in gibraltar but the ira 
acknowledged the three were members on active service 
two days later police found a car linked to the ira unit packed 
with 141 pounds of czechoslovakmade explosives in nearby marbella 
spain 
critics of british prime minister margaret thatchers government 
have claimed the deaths show an unofficial shoottokill policy 
against ira members the outlawed ira seeks unification between 
protestantdominated northern ireland and the roman catholic irish 
republic 
the inquest has no powers of prosecution but is expected to 
determine whether the soldiers actions were lawful 
ullger acted as liaison between police officials directing the 
operation and gibraltars undercover police surveillance team he 
said spanish police were informed of the operation and were given 
photos of the three but failed to spot them

radon gas evaporating out of drinking water 
could be as large a contaminant as anything were dealing with 
the head of drinking water programs at the environmental protection 
agency said wednesday 
watersource radon every year probably accounts for a few 
hundred fatal lung cancers caused by breathing radon indoors which 
the agency has estimated could total as many as 20000 deaths a 
year said mike cook director of the agencys office of drinking 
water 
radon a radioactive gas that can be concentrated in houses 
generally arises from the soil beneath a home working its way 
through foundation cracks or other entrances 
but experts have known for several years that water can carry 
radon posing its danger not in the drinking of the water but by 
liberating into the air in showers washing machines and other ways 
cook commented in an interview on a discussion on the usa 
today television show quoting results of a survey of wells across 
the country that said 72 percent had dangerously high radon 
levels 
cook did not use the term dangerous he said the poll 
findings referred to a water contamination of radon that would 
increase the risk of getting lung cancer by about one in 10000 
the risk level used informally by some epa programs to determine 
when action is needed 
this risk level would correspond to 200 picocuries per liter of 
water which the agency believes would add 002 picocuries per 
liter to the air in a typical home roughly a tenth of the normal 
outdoor concentration 
a picocurie is a standard measure of radiation 
last weeks call for home tests said homeowners should find the 
radon source and try to reduce it if indoor contamination is above 
4 picocuries per liter of air the agency says this concentration 
increases the risk of lung cancer by about one in 100 
probably half the private wells in the country show some 
contamination with radon and about 30000 public water supplies 
contain 200 picocuries per liter with perhaps 5000 systems above 
2000 picocuries per liter cook said 
we believe it accounts for only a few percent of all radon 
deaths but at a few hundred deaths per year radon looms as 
large a contaminant as anything were dealing with cook said 
our recently adopted volatile organic compound regulations are 
aimed at 30 deaths a year 
the agencys current regulations on radioactivity in water do 
not cover radon but epa expects to ask for public comment soon on 
possible options cook said 
the watersource concern arose the same day that two employees 
of epas waste programs released a letter to administrator lee m 
thomas asking if the agency were not overlooking a source of indoor 
radon in building materials 
the two employees hugh kaufman and william sanjour said in 
their letter that the agency in 1978 considered classifying some 
sources of building materials as hazardous waste but eventually 
left them unregulated 
we have never seen any studies of whether building materials 
contribute to the radon problem kaufman and sanjour said 
epa spokesman chris rice said the agency had concluded that 
building materials could be significant contributors to radon only 
in the west where uranium mill waste might have been used or 
where phosphate slag from florida had been used 
kaufman has not been involved with radon for 12 years said 
dave cohen the agencys chief press officer since then the 
agency has found building materials to be negligible hugh hasnt 
stopped to find out whats been going on 
we could not accept the conclusion that there is nothing to 
regulate kaufman and sanjour said suggesting that radon tests 
could be made a condition of governmentguaranteed housing loans

democrat michael dukakis said wednesday the 
reaganbush administration has given a cold shoulder to 
children and families and he promised that if elected no poor 
mother or child will go without essential health care 
dukakis commented at brigham amp womens hospital in a speech that 
was his only public appearance on a day spent mostly in preparation 
for sundays first presidential debate with republican rival george 
bush 
he spent considerable time reading briefing papers on issues 
likely to arise at the debate and also has rented a meeting room at 
a downtown boston hotel for practice sessions a campaign source 
said dukakis was scheduled to take part in a mock debate friday 
with washington attorney bob barnett standing in as bush a role he 
played in 1984 when bush debated democratic vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro 
preparations included a meeting wednesday with sen bill bradley 
of new jersey and meetings were scheduled later in the week with 
govs mario cuomo of new york and bill clinton of arkansas as well 
bradley and possibly cuomo were to sit in on the mock debate said 
the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
during the hospital tour dukakis was asked if he wanted to talk 
about the debate and he quickly answered no but as he walked 
away from reporters he said he was slowly getting ready 
dukakis as has been his practice in recent days sprinkled 
criticism of bush into his speech ridiculing the vice presidents 
stated commitment to the needy by listing what he said were cuts 
the reagan administration has made to medicaid and numerous other 
programs that assist poor families 
when children and their families have needed a helping hand 
mr bushs administration has given them a cold shoulder dukakis 
said at the hospital where he met with two new mothers and their 
babies when the time came to stand up for our childrens health 
care needs george bush was nowhere to be found 
but he was there when his administration conducted an annual 
assault on immunization programs the democratic presidential 
nominee said he was there when they cut maternal and child 
health programs he was there when they cut nutrition supplements 
for pregnant women and their families and he was there when they 
cut off medicaid for 700000 children 
dukakis said his national healthy start program would be 
modeled after a massachusetts program that has served 16000 women 
since 1985 and has been cited as a factor in the reduction in the 
states infant mortality rate 
we know that we can give all of our children especially those 
most at risk a healthy start on life dukakis said in his 
speech which was interrupted several times as one of the children 
he shared the stage with took a stroll past the massachusetts 
governor 
the dukakis program like the state program would provide care 
for pregnant women and later to their children when uninsured or 
underinsured dukakis aides said it would cost 100 million in the 
first year but that the money would be made up within 12 months 
because the prenatal care would help prevent serious illnesses in 
the babys first year 
dukakis whose father was a family doctor recalled that when 
i was growing up he talked the principle that every doctor lives 
by above all do no harm i wish somebody had told that to 
george bush 
he said that during the reagan years the number of children 
immunized has dropped 20 percent and that the incidence of several 
childhood diseases has increased today an infant born in this 
country has less chance of survival than those born in 18 other 
countries including spain and singapore dukakis said 
he was introduced by his daughterinlaw lisa dukakis who is 
expecting her first child in january 
the healthy start program is part of the democratic tickets 
focus this week on health care dukakis on tuesday detailed his 
plan for a universal health care system financed largely by 
employers and his running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen 
announced a rural health care initiative on wednesday 
dukakis has been increasingly critical of bush in recent weeks 
but did not deliver a line in the prepared text of his speech that 
attacked the vice presidents upbringing his vision of america 
doesnt extend beyond the gates of the country club 
he did continue to include in his oratory lines associated with 
john f kennedy at one point saying that his vision was of an 
america with new horizons to reach and new frontiers to conquer 
dukakis also met wednesday afternoon with greek foreign minister 
karolos papoulias who came to boston after meeting secretary of 
state george shultz in washington to discuss negotiations on us 
use of greek military bases 
the foreign minister sought meetings with both dukakis and bush 
but a meeting with bush has not been scheduled an aide to 
papoulias said

negotiators for george bush and michael 
dukakis were still squabbling over who should ask the questions in 
sundays first 1988 presidential debate and a dukakis spokesman 
disputed information from the bush side that agreement was reached 
on how high the candidates lecterns should be 
both candidates spent at least part of wednesday going over 
issues and likely questions with advisers as they counted down the 
days to a confrontation that both sides consider crucial 
dukakis made a campaign appearance in boston but bush stayed 
out of the public eye both men have limited public schedules the 
rest of the week as debate preparations intensify 
a disagreement over how high the lecterns should be for the 
lanky republican nominee bush and the fiveinchshorter democrat 
dukakis ended in compromise according to one source in the bush 
campaign 
bush the source said will speak at a 48inch lectern down 
slightly from his customary 52 inches dukakis the source said 
will stand behind a 41inch lectern and will use a small riser 
but campaign spokesman leslie dach disputed the 41inch figure 
saying he doesnt know how high it will be for dukakis 
as for a riser the dukakis campaign hasnt addressed that 
issue and any other information is just the bush campaigns 
misinformation he said 
on tuesday the campaigns had quibbled over the matter dukakis 
officials pushing for shorter lecterns for both bush staff members 
arguing for a minimum of 46 inches and saying their 6footone 
candidate would not stand behind anything that made him stoop 
under discussion on wednesday was the makeup of the panel of 
journalists that will question the two presidential contenders 
during the debate at 8 pm edt at wake forest university in 
winstonsalem nc 
dukakis had proposed that television anchors from abc nbc cbs 
and cnn serve as the moderator and three questioners for the first 
debate with a panel of print journalists filling those roles for 
either the vice presidential debate on oct 5 or the second 
presidential debate on oct 13 or 14 
the bush campaign offered a list of 10 questioners and four 
moderaters from tv and print media from which to select the 
panelists 
meanwhile president reagan weighed in with encouragement for 
his vice president asked whether hed given bush any hints in 
preparation for the debate he responded with a chuckle take no 
prisoners 
when bush was asked last week whether he would try to emulate 
reagans ability to project a personable image he said he might 
review some of reagans debate tapes because i think it is 
important to be able to say what you feel in your heart 
the republican candidate was scheduled for only one campaign 
event the rest of the week a 5 million fundraiser in houston on 
thursday with reagan 
on wednesday bush engaged in a mock debate with former deputy 
treasury secretary richard darman playing the role of dukakis 
darman is a protege of bush campaign chairman james a baker iii 
to prep dukakis the bush role in practice debates is being 
played by washington lawyer robert barnett a return engagement of 
his portrayal of bush in debate rehearsals with 1984 democratic 
vice presidential candidate geraldine ferraro dukakis will have a 
mock debate with barnett on friday a campaign source said 
dukakis had one campaign stop on wednesday a health care event 
at a hospital he also put in some time on gubernatorial chores at 
the massachusetts statehouse in addition to reviewing debate 
briefing papers 
he met with advisers including sen bill bradley dnj who 
has given him foreign policy and defense advice bradley and 
possibly gov mario cuomo with whom dukakis is meeting this week 
were to sit in on the mock debate 
thomas donilon a top official of walter f mondales campaign 
four years ago was coordinating debate preparation for the 
democratic governor 
dukakis aides reviewed tapes of the governors debates earlier 
this year during the democratic presidential primary contests as 
well as bushs performance in the republican primary debates and 
his 1984 debate with ferraro 
both campaigns were trying to lower expectations for their 
candidates so sunday nights performances would seem good by 
comparison the debate comes at a time when most polls show the 
race is close with bush perhaps slightly ahead 
dukakis is a good debater bush told reporters recently on 
his campaign plane he is a professional college debater and im 
not 
but dukakis spokesman dach countered remember bush has the 
experience of these debates the 84 debate which is the only 
relevant experience 
all sides agree that the first debate is critical 
tens of millions of people are going to watch and theyre 
going to form their opinions by themselves said dach in the 
primary debates very few people watched and opinions were formed by 
the next days headlines 
bushs national political director rich bond said you want to 
avoid costly mistakes and you want to come across as 
presidential

a jury wednesday decided that gambler 
and math whiz herbert coddington convicted of the strangulation 
murders of two women and sexual assaults on two teenage girls 
should receive the death penalty 
the el dorado county superior court jury reached the verdict in 
the penalty phase of the lengthy murder trial after 3 hours of 
deliberations over two days superior court judge terrence finney 
set sentencing for nov 18 
coddington 29 lowered his head and stared at the defense table 
as the verdict was read 
joette hotchkiss one of the jurors said the panel took five 
votes before it agreed on the death penalty 
the whole jury was very disturbed about herbs lack of 
remorse she said the only time he was emotional was when his 
mom was on the stand or when district attorney ron tepper said 
something he didnt like 
jim whiting son of victim maybelle martin 69 burst into tears 
and was led from the courtroom 
i dont even understand the emotions that went through me when 
i first heard the verdict he said when i tried to have 
compassion for her coddingtons mother i kept thinking about my 
mother 
coddingtons lawyers said he believed he received messages from 
god through traffic signals when he committed the crimes in may 
1987 but the prosecutor said coddington was a deliberate killer 
who kept diaries of his acts 
i think the jury reached the right verdict tepper said 
coddington who has a fondness for disguises was convicted aug 
11 of strangling reno modeling agency owner martin and dorothy 
walsh 73 at his south lake tahoe mobile home 
he also was convicted of imprisoning two teenage models in a 
specially built chamber in his bedroom and sexually assaulting them 
over a twoday period 
according to testimony coddington lured the women and girls to 
his home by pretending to be a producer of an antidrug videotape 
the girls then aged 12 and 14 were models in martins agency 
but after the females arrived coddington strangled martin and 
walsh and stuffed their bodies into trash bags and locked the 
girls into a soundproof room

after thousands of outgoing phone calls 
knocked out the state capitol phone system officials disconnected 
state employees attempts to win radio station callin contests 
state workers were trying to reach a local radio station 
offering a 1000 prize and the phone system collapsed under the 
pressure said carl stringfellow the states director of 
telecommunications 
it would shut it down it essentially left all major agencies 
with no phone service stringfellow said tuesday 
we thought we had just had an equipment failure he said 
but the second time it went down one of our employees suggested 
it was at the same time as one of the radio contests 
officials discovered the failure occurred within a minute of the 
starting time of a local radio station contest 
the capitol phone system has about 14000 lines and its usual 
capacity is about 2000 calls at any time but the radio contest 
bumped the phone traffic up to 8000 calls stringfellow said 
officials reset the system to prevent calls to numbers beginning 
with 390 the exchange assigned by southwestern bell for radio 
callin contests 
one guy called me raising hell about the decision to bar 
calls to the contests stringfellow said i told him i didnt 
realize calling game shows was state business 
an official for a state employee organization said there are no 
plans to contest the decision to prevent contest calls from state 
phones 
its a shame they have to do that lane zivley executive 
director of the texas public employees association said about the 
workers efforts to win money 
i think there are even more state employees trying to figure 
out how to get food stamps because they havent gotten a raise

most nicaraguans who want to attend president daniel ortegas 
speech to the general assembly nicaraguas un ambassador said 
wednesday 
ortega family members including his wife and children his 
doctor chief of protocol and many of his senior advisers are among 
the 22 to 25 nicaraguans whose visas will not be processed in time 
for the sandinista leaders sept 28 address said the nicaraguan 
un ambassador alejandro serrano caldera 
the state department told the nicaraguan mission that ortega and 
some senior nicaraguan officials will receive their visas in time 
for their scheduled arrival saturday said serrano 
but serrano said the state department also told the nicaraguan 
mission that the other 22 to 25 visas will not be decided until 
oct 4 a week after ortega speaks to the 159member general 
assembly 
in washington a state department official denied that the 
administration is delaying or blocking the visas 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the us 
embassy in managua is working as fast as it can on the visa 
requests but has been slowed by personnel shortages 
the official noted that nicaragua expelled eight us diplomats 
from managua in july and has refused to allow the state department 
to replace them 
the leftist sandinista government accused the us diplomats of 
interfering in nicaraguas internal affairs the state department 
retaliated by expelling eight nicaraguan diplomats from washington 
serrano said ortega will deliver his speech but said the delay 
in visa approval is a violation of the united states treaty with 
the united nations under the headquarters agreement 
that agreement requires the host nation to allow un missions 
and diplomats to maintain offices and conduct normal business 
nicaraguan envoys took up the matter with the uns legal staff 
and hope to receive word from them thursday said serrano 
serrano speaking spanish and assisted by a translator said the 
state department told nicaraguan officials that foreign minister 
miguel descoto deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco and 
their security staffs will receive visas by saturday 
they have not yet received visas he said the nicaraguan 
delegation for this years general assembly is about the same size 
as in previous years he added 
serrano said that if the united states has a dispute with 
nicaragua it should be dealt with between the two nations we 
cannot see how any other considerations can apply he said 
the united states since 1981 has supported the rebels seeking to 
overthrow the nicaraguan government

a second creditor has filed court papers 
asking that ptl the television ministry founded by jim bakker be 
closed and auctioned off piece by piece 
the accounting firm of arthur andersen and co wants the us 
bankruptcy court to convert the ptl case to a chapter 7 from 
chapter 11 a courtsupervised reorganization 
under chapter 7 the christian theme park and retreat at fort 
mill would be closed and its assets auctioned 
the television ministry has been in bankruptcy reorganization 
since june 1987 three months after bakker left amid a 
sexandmoney scandal 
a federal grand jury in charlotte nc has been looking into 
ptl and jay babcock ptls former director of creative television 
said tuesday he told the panel he had sex with bakker 
babcock said he gave the information to the grand jury after 
being asked questions apparently designed to determine whether 
ministry money much of which comes from taxdeductible donations 
was paid for sexual favors 
babcock is the first man to publicly acknowledge telling the 
grand jury of a sexual encounter with bakker in august bakker 
denied under oath that he had ever had a homosexual relationship 
when he was told that babcock responded im saying hes a 
liar 
bakker did not return phone calls to his office in fort mill 
sc on wednesday 
two other grand jury witnesses former ptl general manager gary 
smith and former ministry board member the rev charles cookman 
also acknowledged that the subject of homosexuality had come up 
during their testimony this week 
it was a very small almost insignificant issue because the 
assemblies of god has already spoken on that said cookman 
referring to the pentecostal denomination he serves as north 
carolina superintendent there is not a lot of question about 
where we stand on those matters 
bakker was dismissed by the assemblies of god in may 1987 for 
unbecoming conduct related to his sexual encounter with jessica 
hahn in 1980 and because of alleged misconduct involving bisexual 
activity 
after his testimony babcock was asked by a reporter what did 
you say regarding sex with jim bakker 
his response i commented that yes it happened a long time 
ago he would not elaborate 
in the matter involving creditors andersen officials cited the 
bankruptcy trustees midaugust report that ptls operating costs 
have exceeded revenues by 12 million since april 15 
the continuing loss and diminution of the estate is occurring 
and there is no reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation of the 
debtor company officials said in court papers 
the first request to put ptl on the auction block came sept 7 
from fairfax savings of baltimore ptl owes fairfax 122 million 
the courtappointed trustee mc red benton has said ptl 
would get a better deal if it could stay open while trying to sell 
its assets 
benton has had various negotiations since may with prospective 
buyers including bakker bakkers 172 million offer fell apart 
sept 10 when he failed to come up with a down payment 
after benton said bakker was out of the running canadian real 
estate executive peter thomas reinstated his bid which he had 
backed earlier with a 1 million deposit 
we are actively pursuing reaching an agreement this week 
said bob ransford spokesman for thomas whose company has offered 
113 million for ptl 
us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds has told benton to 
recommend a buyer by tuesday benton said he has offers from two 
other unidentified groups 
among ptls assets are the 504room heritage grand hotel a 
threeacre water park and a studio and satellite network

a bomb exploded in a concrete 
trash bin at the main white bus terminal in johannesburg at rush 
hour wednesday injuring 19 people almost all of them white 
commuters police said 
a white police constable was among the injured more than 100 
bombs have exploded in the country since a national emergency was 
declared june 12 1986 
black activist winnie mandela visited three escaped detainees 
who sought refuge in the us consulate nine days ago she 
criticized american restrictions barring the detainees from giving 
interviews 
a fourth person entered the consulate wednesday apparently 
after escaping from detention a state department official in 
washington said the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
identified the man as clifford ngcobo and said he was given 
temporary refuge in the consulate 
the duty officer at the consulate early thursday refered all 
questions to the us information office in pretoria but telephone 
calls there went unanswered 
no additional information on the man was available 
the government detained 11 activists in cape town where 75 
antiapartheid organizations are planning a weekend gathering to 
discuss opposition to government actions lawyers and relatives 
said the activists were taken from their homes by police under 
emergency laws which do not require them to confirm the detentions 
or give a reason for the actions 
in the port city of durban police said 160 people were arrested 
after hundreds of striking black dockworkers some carrying sticks 
and pipes held an illegal gathering 
police said they were released after their names and addresses 
were taken down the strike began tuesday in protest against the 
dismissal of a worker and to demand higher pay 
mrs mandela wife of jailed african national congress leader 
nelson mandela visited the three black escapees at the us 
consulate on the 11th floor of a johannesburg office building she 
said they were in a boardroom crowded with furniture and that 
their food was provided by the black community 
she said us officials under orders from washington were 
refusing to let the three communicate directly with the news media 
a condition which they initially agreed to but now want to change 
to highlight the position of detainees and their own 
conditions it is necessary for them to communicate with you she 
told a press conference in an empty groundfloor office of the 
building 
we would like to see the americans a little more committed 
than they are she said 
a us embassy spokesman barry walkley said in response that 
the us government was concerned with maintaining the 
appropriate posture of a diplomatic mission as well as the 
wellbeing of the activists who escaped sept 13 from a 
johannesburg hospital where they were undergoing physiotherapy 
we agreed that they can convey messages through their legal 
representatives he said 
encamped at the us consulate are two leaders of the banned 
united democratic front murphy morobe and mohammed valli moosa 
and the chairman of the banned national education crisis committee 
vusi khanyile 
mrs mandela said the three are wary of government promises that 
they will not be rearrested if they leave the consulate

of black people ended early wednesday is a poor violent and 
dangerous neighborhood known locally as the grove 
state sen greg tarver who is black and a former shreveport 
city councilman called the area officially known as cedar grove 
a time bomb waiting to explode he blamed high unemployment 
among black teenagers and a feeling that police are not providing 
equal protection to blacks 
the riot broke out after a white woman fatally shot a black man 
tuesday night near palmer park an area described by police as a 
curbservice market for crack the smokable form of cocaine 
police familiar with cedar grove said drugrelated stabbings

midnighttodawn shift in the area for more than seven years 
therell be 100 people standing around and nobody saw anything 
a decade ago the area was a working class mix of whites and 
blacks but white flight to the suburbs left the neighborhood more 
than 90 percent black with practically all the whites living in a 
middle class area on the fringe 
work on interstate 49 has carved up the area and the vacant 
buildings along the route make the area look like a war zone 
drugs also have carved up the community with the elderly and 
families feeling intimidated by dealers working out of business 
fronts and parking lots police say 
the drugs are there said officer cedric wilson who also 
patrols cedar grove on the night shift and its only going to 
get worse before it gets better 
racial tensions are high fueled by a slaying by a white 
teenager of a black teenager on aug 4 at a restaurant that 
borders cedar grove 
police say many of the younger grovites as that areas 
residents have become known have become belligerent to officers 
responding to crime reports

presidential rivals george bush and michael dukakis plunged into 
preparations wednesday for their first debate poring over fat 
briefing books and getting tips from media and political advisers 
dukakis took out time to propose a healthy start program 
guaranteeing basic medical care for poor women and children 
when children and their families have needed a helping hand 
mr bushs administration has given them a cold shoulder dukakis 
said during a visit to brigham amp womens hospital in boston where 
he met with two new mothers and their babies 
when the time came to stand up for our childrens health care 
needs george bush was nowhere to be found the democratic 
nominee said 
bush also was the target of criticism from an unexpected source 
retired sen barry goldwater the outspoken conservative and 1964 
gop presidential nominee 
goldwater introduced bushs running mate sen dan quayle at a 
rotary club luncheon in phoenix and then before relinquishing the 
microphone said i forgot something that i had to say and i hope 
you take this kindly but i want you to go back and tell george 
bush to start talking about the issues ok 
quayle merely laughed and said i wish barry would just say 
whats on his mind 
republican bush with his schedule cleared of public 
appearances spent the day in washington meeting at the vice 
presidential mansion with advisers in preparation for the 
nationally televised debate sunday night the 1hour encounter at 
wake forest university in winstonsalem nc will begin at 8 pm 
edt 
bushs schedule included a mock debate with former deputy 
treasury secretary richard g darman playing the role of dukakis 
according to bush campaign sources 
bush also met with polish solidarity figure janusz onyszkiewicz 
on wednesday and reaffirmed his support for the legalization of the 
trade union movement in poland 
bush also had a labor endorsement to gloat over wednesday the 
leadership of the boston police patrolmans association voted 510 
to endorse bush over dukakis and bush planned to travel to 
dukakis backyard on thursday to accept the endorsement 
a report out of london however threatened to dampen that 
celebration a british television documentary said bush complained 
to panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega five years ago about 
the laundering of drug money in panama 
bush has said the reagan administration took action as soon as 
it learned of narcotics and other federal charges against noriega 
in indictments issued in florida last february 
bush spokesman steve hart said bush met in 1983 with noriega and 
other officials but did not speak of any allegations against 
noriega 
with the real debate just four days away the two campaigns were 
closer to settling their argument over the height of the lecterns 
where the two candidates will stand 
the 6foot1 bush will stand at a 48inch high lectern down 
slightly from his customary 52 inches dukakis at 5foot8 will 
stand behind a 41inch lectern and use a small riser a bush source 
said 
but dukakis spokesman leslie dach said there was no agreement on 
what size lectern dukakis will use and the issue of a riser has not 
been addressed 
before resolving the matter dukakis officials had pushed for 
shorter lecterns for both while bush staff members argued for a 
minimum of 46 inches saying their lanky candidate would not stand 
behind anything that made him stoop 
still to be decided is the makeup of the panel of journalists 
who will question the candidates 
at the white house president reagan offered encouragement for 
his vice president asked whether hed given bush any debate hints 
reagan responded with a chuckle take no prisoners 
reagan also gave bush support in his criticism of dukakis for 
vetoing a 1977 bill in massachusetts that would have required 
public school teachers to lead students in reciting the pledge of 
allegiance thats what theyre there for reagan said 
referring to the teachers 
in boston dukakis spent most of the day getting ready for the 
debate sen bill bradley of new jersey who has helped advise on 
foreign policy issues attended morning briefings with dukakis and 
planned to return on friday for another session 
govs mario cuomo of new york and bill clinton of arkansas also 
planned to meet with dukakis this week to help him prepare 
campaign sources said dukakis would have a mock debate friday with 
washington lawyer bob barnett who played bush when he debated 
democratic vice presidential nominee geraldine ferraro in 1984 
slowly getting ready dukakis told reporters 
dukakis said his national healthy start program would be 
modeled after a massachusetts program that has served 16000 women 
since 1985 and has been cited as a factor in reducing the states 
infant mortality rate 
the national program like the state plan would provide 
prenatal and postpartum care including vaccinations to pregnant 
women and children who are either uninsured or underinsured 
dukakis aides said it would cost 100 million in the first year but 
that the money would be saved within 12 months because the prenatal 
care would help prevent serious illnesses in the babys first year 
meanwhile dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen announced 
a program to improve rural health care saying millions of 
americans in rural areas are being denied one of the basic 
necessities of life they are losing their access to quality health 
care 
speaking in hale center texas bentsen said a dukakis 
administration would propose a hardship fund to subsidize rural 
hospitals that are threatened with closure and expansion of a 
national program providing incentives for doctors and nurses to 
work in rural areas 
bushs running mate quayle campaigned in arizona and 
california 
you are a bunch of winners quayle told students at frye

the leadership of bostons police union endorsed 
george bush for president in a unanimous vote wednesday saying the 
vice president would do a better job than massachusetts gov 
michael s dukakis of seeing after the needs of law enforcement 
dukakis the democratic presidential nominee said he wasnt 
surprised and said he still had the support of most law enforcement 
organizations both in massachusetts and across the country 
the 510 endorsement by the boston police patrolmans 
association the largest law enforcement in new england led to a 
change of plans for the bush campaign campaign spokeswoman alixe 
glen said bush would travel to boston on thursday to accept the 
endorsement 
the union represents 1500 members 
the trip to boston is the second this month for bush and affords 
the vice president a chance to embarrass dukakis politically bush 
toured boston harbor early this month and claimed dukakis did 
little to clean up the heavy pollution in the harbor 
union president robert guiney said union leaders were pressured 
from the highest levels of state government to thwart the vote 
we had a few calls guiney said 
maybe people took us for granted he said the police 
officers in this state are upset with the governor and his 
policies 
one officer emerging from the vote at the unions hall in the 
dorchester section of boston said were sick and tired of all 
these drug addicts and all these furloughs for murderers out in the 
state and we felt we had to send a message the officer declined 
to give his name 
gov dukakis said the association has a history of supporting 
republicans he also pointed to previous endorsements he has 
received from law enforcement organizations including the 
massachusetts police association the international brotherhood of 
police officers the international union of police associations and 
the combined law enforcement associations of texas which is bushs 
home state 
im very proud of the fact that the entire law enforcement 
community has endorsed me dukakis said 
dukakis has come under frequent attack from bush for the states 
former policy of releasing convicted firstdegree murders on 
weekend furloughs one notorious case involved convicted murderer 
willie horton who escaped in 1985 and was arrested the following 
spring for raping a maryland woman and stabbing her fiance 
dukakis has fired back that the reaganbush administration has 
granted prison releases to serious criminals from federal prisons 
dukakis also reversed his stand on the furlough policy coming out 
in favor of a policy that continues some furloughs but bans them 
for convicted firstdegree murderers

sen dan quayle went out of his way wednesday to 
bring retired sen barry goldwater to his campaign appearance and 
wound up getting a dig from the outspoken conservative about the 
way george bush is running 
goldwater introduced the republican vice presidential nominee to 
a rotary club luncheon saying the indiana senator had done the 
most fabulous job on a senate armed services subcommittee 
goldwater called quayle to come out from the wings then returned 
to the microphone to say 
i forgot something that i had to say and i hope you take this 
kindly but i want you to go back and tell george bush to start 
talking about the issues ok 
goldwater did not elaborate and afterward he avoided reporters 
saying im not talking i want to get the hell out of here 
but the dig appeared aimed at bushs capturetheflag 
campaigning including his pillorying democrat michael dukakis for 
vetoing a mandatory pledge of allegiance school bill in 1977 
quayle laughed and said only i wish barry would just say 
whats on his mind 
the indiana senator returning to the town where he spent part 
of his youth then launched into his standard stump speech 
portraying dukakis as a liberal who supports gun control is weak 
on defense and belongs to the american civil liberties union 
he questioned whether dukakis might not use aclu membership as a 
litmus test for his judicial appointees 
earlier quayle visited an awardwinning school in chandler 
ariz where he offered children a brief civic lesson on free 
speech after demonstrators yelled chicken hawk at him 
he detoured on his way to the rotary luncheon to pick up 
goldwater at his hillside home 
is one of his requirements going to be that you have to be a 
member of the aclu quayle asked the 400 rotarians we know 
what kind of judges george bush is going to appoint hes going to 
appoint people like william rehnquist and sandra day oconnor 
that are strict constructionists 
later at a rally at california state universityfresno quayle 
blasted dukakis saying he signed a proclamation on feb 27 1985 
supporting a union boycott of grapes 
quayle speaking in the heartland of californias raisin 
industry said dukakis has done all he can to put 
grapegrowers out of business bush made a similar assertion 
while campaigning in californias central valley last week 
the dukakis campaign had no immediate information on whether he 
signed such a proclamation dukakis says such a boycott wouldnt be 
necessary under his administration because it would adopt 
stringent policies to regulate pesticides the united farm workers 
union has been objecting to the exposure of workers to pesticides 
quayle also criticized dukakis for opposing the death penalty 
under any circumstances and again asserted that dukakis would make 
dangerous judicial appointments quayle said that if elected 
dukakis would appoint judges like californias former supreme court 
chief justice rose bird who was recalled by voters in part because 
of her opposition to the death penalty 
quayle was also making a stop in bakersfield before teaming up 
with his wife marilyn for a party fundraiser wednesday night in 
los angeles 
at frye elementary school in chandler he got an enthusiastic 
welcome from 600 flagwaving children and 200 adults and jeers 
from a dozen produkakis demonstrators some clad in chicken 
costumes 
dont pay any attention to them you know in this country of 
ours we have a thing called freedom of speech he said 
they have the freedom of speech but you know what kids so do 
we 
frye a kindergartentograde six school where twothirds of the 
670 youngsters are hispanic or other minorities was among several 
hundred elementary schools named earlier this years as winners of a 
coveted excellence in education award from the us department 
of education 
quayle kept his remarks mostly nonpartisan although he said he 
was presenting the award on behalf of the us department of 
education on behalf of secretary bill bennett and on behalf of 
george bush bush swore in lauro cavazos as bennetts successor 
tuesday 
police escorted jim driscoll a local vietnam veteran and leader 
of the protest away from the outdoor ceremony when he began 
shouting 
quayle spent eight years of his youth in the phoenix area where 
his father worked on one of the familys newspapers 
his grandfather gene pulliam owned the arizona republic as 
well as newspapers in indiana 
goldwater who said quayle had done the most fabulous job on 
a senate armed services acquisitions subcommittee quipped we 
all knew gene pulliam you either knew him or you better get out 
of town

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen unveiled on wednesday his tickets plan for upgrading 
rural health care which he said has been hurt by a weak farm 
economy made worse by an uncaring republican administration 
bentsen announced the plan in the small west texas town of hale 
center were he toured a hospital and spoke at a high school 
auditorium 
the sad fact is my friends that rural america has been left 
in the lurch by the republican administration he said not 
once in those eight years have we seen a positive program to help 
rural america 
the democratic proposal as described by bentsen would 
subsidize those providing health care in rural communities to keep 
their services available in areas which might otherwise be unable 
to attract them 
millions of americans in rural areas are being denied one of 
the basic necessities of life they are losing their access to 
quality health care he said 
it means that some children die who could have been saved it 
means illness lingers that could have been cured he told the 
audience of about 700 which included many young school children 
it means despair and recession for rural communities all across 
america 
bentsen said the democratic plan included 
a hardship fund to subsidize rural hospitals that are 
essential to their communities and threatened with closure 
expansion of the national health service corps a program where 
medical dental and nursing students get scholarships if they agree 
to serve in rural areas 
increased federal subsidies for nursing education rural areas 
have been especially hurt by the current shortage of nurses the 
campaign said 
restoration of federal funding for migrant and community health 
centers 
the hospital fund would be a new effort and take the buggest 
chunk of the 100 million earmarked for the program according to 
campaign aides who said they did not know how much each of the four 
programs would cost or how the programs would be financed bentsen 
made no mention of either in his speech 
bentsen announced the rural segment of the democtats health 
policy a day after michael dukakis the democrats presidential 
nominee announced his major proposal for a national health 
insurance program 
dukakis on wednesday announced his program for care of pregnant 
women and bentsen flew from texas to california to underscore that 
message 
bentsen and his wife ba scrubbed and put on hospital garb to 
visit an intensive care ward for newborn babies at sutter memorial 
hospital in sacramento and afterward bentsen met with hospital 
employees and guests 
republicans george bush and dan quayle have consistently 
supported efforts to cut health care he said 
its easy to vote against something and call yourself a 
conservative but america pays a very heavy price for neglecting 
health care for children he said for all of the bounty of 
america its shameful that millions of our children must face 
illness without proper care or proper medicine 
a quarter of our children have not received their measles 
vaccines dan quay 
youre the big banana the big enchilada 47 electoral votes 
terribly important to winning this race he said with your 
help well put it all together and on nov 8 well have california 
in the democratic column and michael dukakis in the white house 
bentsen began his day wednesday in lubbock texas where his 
hotel was across the street from the memorial for buddy holly the 
rockandroll musician from there who was killed in a 1959 airplane 
crash 
the texas senator strolled over to the holly statue so 
television cameras could film him asked if he had been a fan 
bentsen responded ohsure 
the skeptical press corps then asked what his favorite song was 
and bentsen had a ready answer 
bas my peggy sue he said referring to his wife beryl 
ann and one of hollys biggest hits

the lebanese army said wednesday it will 
take over the country by friday if parliament fails to elect a new 
president 
the army is the only force capable of change and of leading 
lebanon to salvation the armys commander gen michel aoun 
said 
president amin gemayels sixyear term expires on friday and 
parliament is scheduled to meet thursday to elect his successor 
the constitution prevents gemayel from running again 
but lawmakers are deeply divided over several candidates and 
the last time they scheduled a vote not enough lawmakers showed up 
to form a quorum 
the impasse has threatened to reignite lebanons civil war 
which has claimed 130000 lives since 1975 
the army is considered stronger than the various warring 
christian and moslem militias and is believed capable of 
controlling them if it had the political mandate to do so 
in washington white house spokesman roman popadiuk said 
president reagan sent a telegram to cardinal john oconnor of new 
york saying the us government attaches great importance to a 
peaceful and constitutional presidential election in lebanon on 
sept 22 
we remain strongly committed to helping restore lebanese 
unity sovreignty and territorial integrity reagan said in the 
telegram sent in response to one by oconnor urging reagan support 
lebanon at this extremely critical moment 
twentyseven christian parliamentarians said wednesday they will 
boycott thursdays election unless the session is shifted from 
moslem west beirut to the nomans land at the citys dividing 
green line 
we shall not go to the moslem side there will be no session 
tomorrow unless the venue is changed said deputy emile rouhana 
saqr 
the boycott again would prevent the 51member quorum that the 
76seat parliament needs to hold the election 
lebanons main christian militia the rightwing lebanese 
forces are backing veteran politician raymond edde for president 
edde a maronite catholic is an outspoken critic of foreign 
intervention in lebanon he says he will seek to force israel from 
its selfdesignated security zone in south lebanon within 20 
days if he is elected 
edde has been living in selfimposed exile in paris since 
fleeing lebanon after three assassination attempts in 1976 
two other maronite catholic candidates former president 
suleiman franjieh and parliament deputy mikhail daher have syrias 
backing syria a supporter of lebanons moslem and leftist 
factions has 40000 troops in eastern and northern provinces of 
the country as well as beiruts moslem sector 
the christians charge that franjieh president from 1970 to 1976 
and a close friend of president hafez assad of syria will make 
lebanon a syrian satellite 
christian deputies boycotted the aug 18 presidential vote in 
parliament to prevent a quorum when franjieh was the only serious 
candidate 
lebanese sources said franjieh was likely to withdraw his 
candidacy in favor of daher who was selected this week as a 
compromise candidate by us envoy richard murphy and syrian 
leaders 
the christians have wielded political power since independence 
from france in 1943 when they were considered to be the majority 
moslems now comprise an estimated 55 percent of lebanons 4 million 
population 
according to an unwritten national covenant dating to lebanons 
independence from france in 1943 the president should be a 
maronite the house speaker a shiite moslem and the prime minister 
a sunni moslem 
if parliament fails to elect a president thursday gemayel was 
expected to form a caretaker cabinet which could formalize the de 
facto partition of lebanon into sectarian areas 
syrias moslem and leftist allies charge that gemayel would name 
a maronite prime minister and have threatened to respond by 
declaring their own republic in territory they control 
gemayel met in damascus with assad and lebanese christian 
leaders afterward presidential spokesman jibrane kourieh said 
an agreement for saving lebanon has been reached between the two 
presidents he gave no further details except to say the lebanese 
election will be held

an oldmodel nozzle inlet ring was 
used in the final test of morton thiokols redesigned space shuttle 
booster rocket but nasa doesnt believe the discovery will delay 
next weeks scheduled shuttle launch a spokesman said wednesday 
nasa spokesman ed medal said it had not yet been determined if 
the outdated ring was used in the two boosters attached to the 
space shuttle discovery scheduled for launch sept 29 but 
preliminary investigation showed it had not 
theres no indication that the old configuration is in the 
boosters in discovery but weve got to go ahead and check the 
records and clear that medal said 
we certainly dont believe the situation will impact the 
launch though medal said at nasas marshall space flight center 
in huntsville ala which oversees the booster rocket contract 
asked how the ring with the old design might have been installed 
on the test rocket he said were taking a long hard look at 
how the old ring got there one of the leading possibilities is a 
cross labeling of parts 
medal said it is necessary to check records because actually 
searching through discovery for the ring would be too difficult 
we are going through the records and checking to clear the 
boosters for flight if one of the old inlet rings was there there 
would be no safety issue for flight the old design worked 
perfectly well on all space shuttle flights the modification was a 
very minor one medal said 
the ring located inside the nozzle assembly at the tail of the 
shuttle booster was redesigned for production models of the solid 
rocket motors 
but for some reason the nozzle installed in the aug 18 test 
booster contained a ring of the old prechallenger design medal 
said 
it is true that a nozzle forward nose ring not of the 
redesigned solid rocket motor design the rsrm design was 
inadvertently installed in the pv1 production verification motor 
fired aug 18 said ed snow a morton thiokol spokesman at 
ogden reading a prepared company statement 
the forward nose ring performed satisfactorily the error was 
discovered during regular posttest examination and analysis of the 
part nasa and morton thiokol are working to discover how the error 
was made and how it can be prevented in the future the statement 
said 
medal said he believed the mistake was discovered within the 
last day or two 
barbara selby a spokeswoman at nasa headquarters in washington 
said space agency officials now are concentrating on trying to 
determine if the old ring or the redesigned ring was installed in 
the rockets on the launch pad 
she said no decision would be made about the effects on the 
launch until this was known but added when i left they didnt 
think it would cause a postponement 
a firm decision on that may come on thursday she said 
we fully believe the correct parts are in the flight set 
company spokesman rocky raab told the associated press we and 
nasa are researching the record the documents to make sure they 
are the correct parts even if they were not they would not affect 
the safety of the flight 
raab said the discovery was made during xray analysis of the 
part after the test firing there is no visible difference 
between the two parts he said 
raab said the search would include xrays of the nozzle rings on 
the discovery booster and engineers should have an answer within 
days 
we expect to be able to tell that by two days before launch 
and perhaps sooner but certainly by then he said 
the aug 18 test the fifth fullscale static firing of the 
redesigned booster was conducted at thiokols wasatch operations 
plant 25 miles west of brigham city under nasa and thiokol 
supervision 
after the test engineers disassembled the rocket and began a 
lengthy process of examining it nasa later pronounced the test a 
success and certified discovery for launch 
most of the booster redesign was aimed at making the rocket 
safer a faulty oring seal on one of the booster segments was 
blamed for the jan 28 1986 explosion of the space shuttle 
challenger which grounded the nations manned space program 
medal said that uder the old design the flame from the rocket 
hit the ablative carbon cloth fabric on the ring at an angle of 90 
degrees under the new design it hits at an angle of 45 degrees 
thats slightly improves the ablative tolerance of the ring 
he said 
an ablative substance melts off in layers when hit by the rocket 
flame protecting the ring and preventing it from burning through 
he said these parts are not marked for technical reasons the 
old design ring certainly did not affect that test in august he 
said

ranchers have no constitutional right to 
kill grizzly bears to protect their sheep a federal appeals court 
ruled wednesday 
the grizzly bear is a threatened species and the government is 
entitled to prohibit its killing except in selfdefense said the 
9th us circuit court of appeals in a case from montana 
the 30 decision upheld a 2500 civil penalty against rancher 
richard christy for killing a grizzly that was menacing his sheep 
on land near glacier national park in 1982 christy gave up his 
lease on the land later that month having lost 84 of his 1700 
sheep to bears in two months 
joined by two other ranchers he challenged the law forbidding 
the killing of grizzly bears saying it violated his property 
rights the ranchers also claimed discrimination because licensed 
sport hunters are allowed to kill up to 25 grizzlies in montana 
us district judge paul hatfields ruling upholding the law was 
affirmed by the appeals court which said there was no fundamental 
constitutional right to kill federally protected wildlife in 
defense of property 
we do not minimize the seriousness of the problem faced by 
livestock owners nor do we suggest that defense of property is 
an unimportant value said the opinion by judge arthur alarcon 
we simply hold that the right to kill federally protected 
wildlife in defense of property is not implicit in the concept of 
ordered liberty nor so deeply rooted in this nations history and 
tradition that it can be recognized by us as a fundamental 
right alarcon said quoting supreme court standards for 
fundamental rights 
he also said the government did not violate ranchers rights by 
authorizing a closely regulated hunt of grizzlies as a population 
control measure in certain areas 
the judge said the law does not prevent ranchers from taking 
other steps to frighten bears away and authorizes federal wildlife 
officers to kill troublesome bears at private citizens request 
when other measures have failed

about 1000 kurdish refugees will return 
voluntarily to iraq the foreign ministry announced wednesday 
ministry spokesman inal batu said the kurds will begin returning 
thursday under the supervision of a delegation from the 
international red cross 
about 60000 kurds fled to turkey last month and some claimed 
iraq dropped chemical bombs on their settlements 
iraq acting at the urging of turkey has proclaimed an amnesty 
for the kurds only two kurds have returned to iraq so far 
shortly after the kurdish refugees began arriving in turkey 
iran said it would accept all the kurdish refugees who wanted to go 
to that country 
batu said the transfer of 2000 kurds who chose to go to iran 
was made possible by turkish authorities last week he said about 
6000 kurds went to iran via turkey earlier 
premier turgut ozal on friday called on western countries to 
accept half of the refugees in turkey or to extend financial aid to 
ease turkeys burden 
batu said only the netherlands has made an offer to accept 60 
kurds 
the united states has accused iraq of using chemical weapons 
against its kurds who are fighting for autonomy 
the us state department has said the accusation was based on 
evidence gathered from kurdish refugees in turkey and the 
interception of iraqi air force communications 
turkey has maintained no traces of poison gas was found on the 
refugees in medical screenings but turkish officials have said 
that this does not prove iraq did not use chemical weapons in its 
campaign against the kurds in northern iraq 
iraq has denied charges of poison gas use against kurds but has 
acknowledged using poison gas against iran in the 8year persian 
gulf war 
in london british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said 
wednesday compelling evidence exists that iraqi forces used 
chemical weapons against kurds in north iraq 
howe said that if true it was nothing less than barbaric 
he spoke to reporters after meeting in london with iraqs 
minister of state for foreign affairs saddoun hammadi 
a foreign office spokesman who in accordance with british 
practice refused to be identified said howe and foreign office 
minister of state william waldegrave indulged in plain speaking 
at the meeting with hammadi a catch phrase usually taken to mean 
strongly worded criticism 
the spokesman said howe urged the iraqis to allow a united 
nations team to investigate the allegations 
the spokesman said hammadi repeated iraqi denials that it used 
chemical weapons against the kurds and said iraq opposed a un 
team as an unprecedented intervention into iraqs affairs 
he said hammadi was told britain was consulting its un 
colleagues over what further action could be taken

a foundation that rescinded mandatory 
aids tests at a childrens hospital after they stirred controversy 
has decided to leave testing to the discretion of doctors an 
administrator said wednesday 
under a new policy issued by the jacksonville flabased 
nemours foundation patients at the alfred i du pont institute 
will be tested for the aids virus only at the discretion of their 
physician and employees will be tested only if they request it 
testing will be confidential 
as far as the foundation is concerned im glad weve been 
able to explain our position a little bit better with this new 
policy as opposed to the former one said w jeff wadsworth 
foundation general manager 
in addition to the wilmingtonbased du pont institute the new 
policy will affect the nemours health clinic for the elderly in 
wilmington and the nemours childrens clinic in jacksonville fla 
the foundation drew national attention this summer by requiring 
aids tests before a patient could be admitted to the du pont 
institute it would have denied admission to any patient who tested 
positive for the human immunodeficiency virus which causes acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
the foundation also had called for mandatory annual aids tests 
for employees and would have required those testing positive to 
transfer to nonpatient work areas 
the mandatory testing policy was rescinded in july after 
virulent protests from state officials and the medical community 
the american hospital association recommends against screening 
patients for aids institutions that accept federal money are 
precluded from such action according to the association 
the nemours foundation facilities dont accept federal money it 
administers its facilities according to the will of alfred i du 
pont a member of the family that built the giant chemical company 
he died in the 1930s and specified that his fortune be used to help 
the elderly and crippled children but not incurables 
in the past year one patient at the institute was found to have 
been exposed to the aids virus and was transferred to another 
hospital the institution said 
a positive test for the aids virus does not mean the person has 
the disease 
under the new policy wadsworth said a physician would have to 
comply with a recent delaware law requiring patients to be notified 
before administering an aids test 
the physician also will determine the best course of 
treatment if a patient tests positive for the hiv virus he added

skies began to clear over 
yellowstone national park on wednesday but fire managers there and 
in california and oregon said the worst was over for firefighters 
i think we have enough precipitation on the ground to keep 
these things down and still hold the upper hand said yellowstone 
fire information officer bob valen 
the worst is over said area commander ken dittmer 
steady rain on tuesday prevented any significant growth in the 
blazes that cover more than 1 million acres of the park 
in northern california a backfire and favorable weather helped 
hundreds of firefighters divert a 5dayold blaze away from 
expensive homes but officials citing the extremely dry conditions 
that have allowed more than 40000 acres to burn recently banned 
outdoor smoking in portions of 44 counties 
the fire west and north of vacaville calif continued to burn 
over a 32mile area wednesday after 500 evacuated residents were 
allowed back into their homes tuesday 
firefighters completed a 10milelong fire break tuesday just 
west of vacaville about 45 miles east of san francisco and set 
fire to brush west of the break the only part of the blaze 
uncontained by fire lines was in rugged terrain in an unpopulated 
area 
fire officials predicted they will have the vacaville fire out 
by saturday evening one week after the start of the blaze which 
has destroyed seven homes and blackened 27000 acres 
elsewhere across the west the situation was improved as the 
worst summer for fires in three decades wound to a close nearly 
70000 fires have blackened more than 41 million acres about half 
of them in alaska 
fire crews in oregon mopped up hot spots on the stubborn shady 
beach wildfire wednesday in the willamette national forest as fire 
bosses prepared to declare the nearly 9000acre blaze contained by 
fire lines 
with the fire 85 percent contained at 8987 acres about 300 
firefighters have been dismissed putting the total personnel at 
2116 forest service spokeswoman lorette laferriere said 
the fire was expected to be declared contained wednesday night 
and controlled on sept 30 she added fires are considered 
controlled when they can not jump fire lines 
as nights lengthen over yellowstone the period of humidity 
recovery when small fuels such as pine needles and twigs soak up 
moisture also becomes longer said dittmer 
fires continue to creep along some 12 million of the parks 22 
million acres but analysts do not expect more of the blazes that 
in earlier weeks forced firefighters to retreat from advancing 
100foot walls of flame

portauprince haiti ap soldiers who toppled the regime of 
lt gen henri namphy mutinied against more commanders wednesday 
and civilians rallied to join the uprising witnesses said a 
12yearold boy was killed when troops fired on a crowd 
lt gen prosper avril made president sunday after a coup led 
by namphys presidential guard tried to quell the military 
uprising tuesday by naming a new armed forces chief and retiring 
nine unpopular commanding officers 
the situation is precarious after all we are in the midst of 
a general mutiny a western diplomat said wednesday 
coup leaders who put avril in power demanded that he institute 
democratic reforms including free elections that haiti has not had 
in 31 years but even though avril appealed for calm the purge 
that put him in power continued to spread to military barracks and 
the streets 
radio haiti inter said army units opposed to avril attacked a

prime minister margaret thatcher of britain 
said wednesday that a europe without borders would be a 
nightmare and lashed out at efforts to centralize the 
continents economy 
she made her second stinging attack since tuesday on the notion 
of a united states of europe a key ideal of the 12member european 
economic community 
mrs thatcher on a threenation swing of europe told a 
luncheon group in echternach luxembourg 
in the great changes which are taking place we must ensure 
that we do not allow europe to become entangled in a new network of 
rules and regulations which stifle initiative and enterprise 
britains leader warned against more centralized economic 
control when the common market drops trade barriers among member 
nations these are due to fall in 1992 with the creation of a 
single european market 
she said a better alternative to centralized economic authority 
is active cooperation between governments 
i will only say that those countries like the soviet union 
which have tried to run everything from the center are now learning 
that success depends upon dispersing power and decisions away from 
the center she said 
it would be absurd for us in europe to move in the opposite 
direction a centralized european government would be a nightmare 
the remarks echoed statements she made tuesday in bruges 
belgium the first stop on her tour she flew to madrid spain 
after her visit to luxembourg 
the prime ministers strong comments set off a stir back home 
opposition leaders expressed fears that mrs thatcher damaged 
britains role in the common market with tuesdays speech in which 
she also rejected moves to centralize power or to suppress 
nationhood 
the prime minister must learn to hold her tongue and not treat 
europeans to her own inimitable brand of foghorn diplomacy said 
george foulkes foreign affairs spokesman for the labor party 
the centrist social and liberal democratic party said mrs 
thatcher demonstrated xenophobia in velvet gloves 
she brings to the issues of european cooperation all the 
finesse of a soccer hooligan on the rampage said party leader 
paddy ashdown 
at its headquarters in brussels belgium the eec commission 
the groups executive body withheld public comment 
a spokesman for eec commission president jacques delors said 
mr delors believes that that which unites us is more important 
than that which divides us 
belgian foreign minister leo tindemans however called mrs 
thatchers tuesday comments disappointing 
premier andreas papandreou of greece president of the european 
community the eecs umbrella organization told the british 
broadcasting corp that he was worried mrs thatchers remarks in 
bruges run counter to the treaties the trade bloc already has 
passed 
i consider it extremely important at this stage that mrs 
thatcher informs the community of the exact meaning of her vision 
of europe papandreou said 
he said it was difficult for him to believe mrs thatcher would 
be prepared to question the european single act which binds member 
states to open trade under an international treaty already ratified 
by their parliaments

real estate billionaire harry helmsley charged 
in a massive tax evasion case with his wife leona and two former 
aides is trying to get himself removed from the case for medical 
reasons defense lawyers said tuesday 
lawyers would not disclose the nature of the 79yearold 
helmsleys health proble but us district judge john walker 
agreed to unseal transcripts of previous closed door hearings on 
the issue 
the associated press and several other news organizations had 
petitioned walker to disclose the sealed papers and at the start 
of the hearing the judge said he would permit the unsealing of 
all records except grand jury materials 
walker said the material to be unsealed the next day 
concerned the physical condition of mr helmsley and whether he 
is fit to stand trial 
helmsley and his 67yearold wife were indicted in april on 
state and federal charges that they allegedly disguised about 4 
million in renovations to their greenwich conn mansion as 
business expenses and took bogus tax deductions 
the helmsleys have pleaded innocent to the 188count state 
indictment and the 47count federal indictment state prosecutors 
have agreed to let the federal case go first 
they are slated to go on trial next monday but assistant us 
attorney james devita said he wanted a threeweek delay so 
government experts could evaluate helmsleys health records to see 
if more medical examinations are warranted 
in another development defense lawyers for the helmsleys sought 
to have the other two defendants joseph v licari and frank j 
turco severed from the case because the helmsleys plan a 
conflicting defense 
they plan to claim the pair created false invoices as a cover 
to permit turco and licari to steal from the helmsleys said 
defense lawyer gerald a feffer and not to perpetrate tax 
evasion by the helmsleys as charged by the government 
neither of the helmsleys was present at the hearing 
the judge also delayed considering a defense request to move the 
trial to philadelphia because of prejudicial publicity in news 
reports walker said last week it was too soon to decide on moving 
the trial but said he would consider again if selecting impartial 
jurors in new york proves difficult

a study by national cancer institute 
scientists shows that mammogram examinations every one to two years 
can reduce breast cancer deaths by 24 percent among women aged 40 
to 49 
the conclusion came from a detailed analysis of data from a 
clinical trial begun 18 years ago by the health insurance plan of 
greater new york 
researchers said it is the first comprehensive study to prove 
that mammograms can be an important lifesaving screening technique 
for women under the age of 50 
this is the first statistically significant evidence of the 
benefits for this age group said kenneth chu lead author of the 
nci analysis 
evidence has been clear for some time he said that there is a 
significant benefit in mammographic screening among women aged 50 
and above but whether these benefits apply to women between the 
ages 40 and 50 has been a matter of controversy chu said

the reagan administration has used the cia to 
foment civil unrest in nicaragua and in the process has damaged 
efforts at a longterm peace accord between the leftist government 
and the contra rebels house speaker jim wright says 
in a highly unusual disclosure wright told reporters tuesday 
that the cia has employed agents covertly in nicaragua to organize 
and promote antigovernment rallies and protests 
wright speaking at his regular daily news conference said 
congress has received clear testimony that the cia has sought 
to provoke an overreaction by the managua government 
elaborating later in an interview the speaker added agents 
of our government have assisted in organizing the kinds of 
antigovernment demonstrations that have been calculated to 
stimulate and provoke arrests 
wright said the cia had made the admission under questioning 
from members of congress presumably the disclosure would have 
come in closeddoor oversight sessions of the congressional 
intelligence committees most of whose work is classified

trevor pinnocks debut as an operatic conductor 
at the metropolitan opera has already raised eyebrows but the 
british early music specialist says youve got to start 
somewhere why not here 
pinnock will conduct handels giulio cesare which premieres 
tuesday with kathleen battle as cleopatra and tatiana troyanos as 
caesar jeffrey gall in the role of ptolemy is the first 
countertenor male alto to appear at the met 
the more significant first for the met is having an early music 
specialist in the pit pinnock who founded and directs the english 
concert is one of britains bestknown workers in the original 
instruments field along with christopher hogwood and john eliot 
gardner 
however the announcement that pinnock would conduct giulio 
cesare provoked some critical grousing last season donal 
henahan chief music critic of the new york times ended a 
laudatory review of one of pinnocks performances with this warning 
shot followers of the metropolitan opera must wonder what 
qualifies mr pinnock to conduct next seasons julius caesar 
the trouble is people are always ready to pigeonhole 
everybody pinnock said before rehearsal recently 
ive done giulio cesare ive done it with students on stage 
in london but the fact is ive never conducted in an opera house 
before he said 
i do know the music through and through i love the music of 
handel and i love working with singers in a certain way all 
music is sung i hate music that doesnt breathe 
pinnock 41 has been performing professionally since 1966 and 
he formed the english concert in 1973 
the met has only been doing handel since 1983 when rinaldo 
entered the repertory followed by an operatic version of the 
oratorio samson in 1985 
this production of giulio cesare was done by john copley for 
the english national opera in 1978 with charles mackerras 
conducting 
pinnock is not working with original instruments at the met but 
with a small orchestra 18 violins six cellos three basses and 
harpsichord of modern instruments 
the early music influence will come in the style of playing 
especially the ornamentation in both the instrumental and vocal 
parts 
of course it has been paramount in my musical considerations 
the combination of what handel wants and how to fill the hall 
pinnock said 
its interesting how much thats affected ornamentation i 
have quite strong ideas about the type of ornamentation that is 
suitable for a large space as opposed to a small room i think the 
ornamentation in general needs more space it cant be tight and 
fast ornamentation 
it also has to suit the voice 
ive found that ive had to write quite different 
ornamentation in some cases for cover singers pinnock said 
because obviously one is trying to solve two things in 
ornamentation first and foremost for me ones trying to enhance 
the meaning of the words and the whole sense of the aria if the 
ornamentation doesnt do that its completely wasted notes 
secondly it is to show off the voice and it must be to show off 
the beautiful qualities of whoever is singing it 
giulio cesare premiered in london in 1724 and was revised 
and revived in 1725 1730 and 1732 following its last german 
performances in 1733 it disappeared from the repertory until the 
1920s 
restoring the reputation of handels more than three dozen 
operas has become a cause for his partisans winton dean and john 
merrill knapp in a monumental scholarly survey of handels operas 
published last year contended that handel ranks with monteverdi 
mozart and verdi among the supreme masters of opera 
pinnock said handels operas have unfairly gained a reputation 
for being static that has something to do with the limitations of 
the opera seria form of recitatives mixed with da capo 
arias solos which have two movements repeating the first 
pinnock sees giulio cesare as a series of pictures in which 
the audience is invited to take part 
the da capo aria musically enhances the meaning of the 
words he said so what weve begun to understand in the 
beginning weve entered the picture then were fully in 
accordance with whats being sung and can relish the atmosphere 
before moving on to the next picture 
now of course it is possible in a certain production to make 
it so static that we as the audience are not invited in but i 
believe that the good production of a handel opera will at the same 
time honor that concept of the picture and not destroy it by 
ridiculous movement 
among pinnocks future projects is next seasons launching of 
the classical band in new york an original instruments 
orchestra of 40 or 50 players which will have guest conductors 
leonard bernstein wants to have a go pinnock said though 
thats not yet definite 
he says he wants to be free to perform any kind of music though 
pinnock admits some limitations 
im not good enough at playing jazz which upsets me a lot 
becaust cards he said 
naming the various cards he used the picture cost 100000 and 
i put 40000 on credit cards it earned 8 million at the box 
office

when oil prices fell in 1986 support surged 
for carl i hagens small but boistrous antitax party 
the progress party once shunned as a rightwing fringe group 
has been surging ever since 
recent polls indicate the party has the support of 22 percent of 
norways voters in a political arena traditionally dominated by the 
labor party and the conservatives 
the storting parliament where the progress party has only two 
of the 157 seats appears headed for a political earthquake in 
next years elections the weekly newspaper nytt fra norge said 
recently 
antitax forces have also gained ground in denmark another 
scandinavian welfare state norway however had grown rich from 
its north sea oilfields and the 1986 price collapse hit norwegians 
particularly hard 
the standard of living has dropped in norway for the first time 
since world war ii triggering a wave of discontent and criticism 
of the established parties 
we have a whole load of solutions to the problems hagen 
tells norwegians 
hagen 44 wants to lower taxes restrict immigration cut down 
the public sector and let private companies handle traditional 
welfare state tasks such as hospital care child care and care for 
the elderly 
in a country where big welfare benefits financed through taxes 
were taken for granted even by conservatives hagens policies were 
considered extreme 
however conservative party policies recently outlined 
borrowed some of hagens ideas an apparent attempt to ride the 
trend in advance of the elections set for sept 11 1989 
hagen is a powerful speaker who often shouts down opponents in 
the storting a chamber more accustomed to hushed and polite tones 
sitting amid piles of newspaper clippings at his small office in 
the storting building hagen told a visitor that the state handles 
defense schools hospitals in a miserably poor way 
he claimed the scandinavian welfare state does not function well 
because he said it is modeled after east bloc socialism and 
acts as a guardian interfering in all things between heaven and 
earth 
a strong advocate of a freemarket economy hagen maintains the 
governments functions should be restricted to basics such as 
defense and law and order 
political analysts say hagen became so popular mainly because 
there is no other nonsocialist alternative to prime minister gro 
harlem brundtlands labor party 
lars hellberg a political commentator for the conservative 
newspaper aftenposten wrote that cooperation among the 
conservatives the farmerdominated center party and the christian 
democrats had completely crashed since conservative leader 
kaare willochs threeparty coalition resigned in 1986 
he said the consequent irritation frustration and 
desperation benefited hagen 
the progress party also is getting support for its attacks on 
norways opendoor refugee policy hellberg said 
in a poll published in aftenposten on sept 3 hagen had support 
from 222 percent of the voters compared with 37 in the election 
of 1985 
the three nonsocialist parties fell from 453 percent in 1985 
to 331 percent with the conservative party dropping from 304 
percent to 208 the labor party dropped from 408 percent to 31 
percent 
despite the potential impact of the progress party in the 1989 
elections the other parties in the storting have refused to 
cooperate with hagen 
he studied economics in britain and formerly represented a 
british sugar company in norway he joined the progress party when 
it was formed in 1973 and became its leader the same year 
in 1985 when oil prices were at their highest point our 
election results were poor he said in the interview in his 
office but in 19861987 when it became necessary to save people 
grew more interested 
largely because of the oil norwegians had grown accustomed to a 
steady rise in economic growth and an expanding welfare system 
government revenue from north sea oil was 73 billion in 1985 
more than 21 percent of the national budget for 1988 it is 
expected to be about the same as for 1986 and 1987 at 23 billion 
or 5 percent of the budget 
finance ministry spokesman janove ekeberg said the slump came 
amid a twoyear consumption party where private consumption 
increasedby 16 percent 
he added that norwegians should brace for big reductions in 
coming years 
brundtlands labor government has lowered consumption levels 
slowed inflation and lessened the current trade deficit but the 
growth of the gross national product is expected to remain at about 
1 percent in 1988 compared with 44 percent in 19841985 and an 
expected 25 percent average for the western industrialized 
countries

church lawyers are laying down some strict 
guidlines on what religious organization can and cannot do in 
the current crush of political campaigning 
the key warning is that they must not support or oppose specific 
candidates or seem by implication to do so since it would 
endanger a churchs tax exemption 
attorneys for the countrys two largest christian groups 
baptists and roman catholics have issued lengthy instructions for 
church organizations on avoiding partisan political activity 
indications were of a new cautiousness among church groups about 
the matter in an election year 
the internal revenue service has a newfound enthusiasm for 
scrutiny of religious organizations says mark e chopko general 
counsel of the us catholic conference 
citing restrictions laid down in the irs code on tax exemptions 
for religious organization he advises 
during an election campaign exempt organizations remain free 
to address issues of concern to them and to their membership 
however such discourse must focus on issues and not 
personalities 
oliver s thomas general counsel for the baptist joint 
committee on public affairs advises that churches to avoid 
jeopardizing their taxexempt status must heed the following rules 
dont support or oppose a candidate directly or indirectly 
whether in a sermon church newsletter sample ballot or by 
financial means avoid pejorative labels when mentioning a 
candidate by name 
dont provide volunteers mailing lists publicity nor 
distribute or display campaign literature on church premises or 
provide free use of facilities unless made available equally to all 
parties and candidates 
however both catholic and baptist advisories note that churches 
may hold nonpartisan public forums or debates where all candidates 
have a chance to state their views and distribute their literature 
the sponsoring church organization however must not present 
its views on the topics discussed thomas says 
it is advisable for the organization in introducing a 
candidate to state clearly and emphatically that the views of the 
candidate are not necessarily the views of the church and no 
endorsement is intended by the candidates presence 
nevertheless it was emphasized that religious organizations 
have a constitutional right to take sides on political issues so 
long as their views arent explicitly applied for or against 
specific candidates 
in reality participation in the public debate on important 
issues inevitably overlaps with positions taken by certain 
candidates chopko observes 
nonetheless issueoriented speech is protected by the first 
admendment of the constitution and is entirely proper 
also church employees and officials may participate freely in 
the political campaigning as individuals providing it is made 
clear they are not acting as representatives of the church 
if a diocesan or parish official speaks at a rally supporting 
a particular candidate he should avoid being introduced in his 
official capacity chopko says 
thomas also stresses that point adding that if a minister is 
involved and mention is made of his church there should also be a 
disclaimer making clear he is not speaking on the churchs behalf 
separating the ministers role as an individual voter from his 
role as a church leader is always difficult thomas says adding 
a minister should never endorse a candidate from the pulpit 
even though he might insist he is speaking in his individual 
capacity 
regarding church newspapers or other publications chopko said 
they may not endorse any candidate through an editorial or 
otherwise but they may report election and other political 
news in an unbiased manner 
the attorneys cite these among permissible church political 
activities 
they may distribute materials to educate voters provided the 
publications state their educational purposes and disclaim any 
intention to favor or oppose any candidate 
they may sponsor voter registration drives provided no 
evidence exists of bias toward any candidate or party 
they may poll candidates on positions so long as the 
questionnaire is unbiased and covers a wide range of issues and 
results are reported fairly 
they may distribute voting records of legislators or members 
of congress so long as there is no indication of bias as would be 
the case in stating whether legislators positions agree or 
disagree with church positions 
chopko notes that the catholic church operates under an irs 
group ruling of tax exemption covering all its affiliated 
institutions and parishes 
violations would endanger exemptions for everyone thus we 
must take the prohibition seriously

ensign karin 
berglund explained as she navigated this swedish missile carrier 
through a treacherous baltic archipelago that shes just a sailor 
like everybody else on board 
ive always been interested in sailing and the sea and i 
couldnt find anything i wanted to do more than go into the navy 
said the 25yearold officer seated at a bank of radar screens and 
navigation maps on the bridge i dont see myself as a woman in 
the navy im just one of the crew 
she is one of three women the only woman officer in the 
32member crew of the hms stockholm a 330ton corvette serving as 
the flagship of swedens hardpressed antisubmarine warfare unit 
for a nation once considered a leader of the sexual revolution 
professional military service for women came late swedens officer 
corps were opened to women only in 1980 
military life still attracts few females and many of them use 
their military training in technical professions to move into 
higher paid civilian careers 
defense ministry figures say 114 women are among the 16000 
officers in the standing and reserve services of all branches the 
highest ranking officer is col annemarie goransson a surgeon in 
the medical corps 
women are not drafted as men are but have served since early 
this century in auxiliary units as cooks cleaners or drivers more 
than 50000 women belong to these units today 
having girls on board has changed the way the men behave 
theyre much more civilized than they were said cmdr lennart 
danielsson who has women in his compliment for the first time this 
year 
unlike many ships no pinups grace the walls of the enlisted 
crew quarters where two women sleep among 12 men there are no 
curtains or special facilities but the women dont seem to mind 
it took a week or so to get used to but then it was so 
natural said sgt ewa kroog a 20yearold signals operator 
kroog said she adjusted to a male environment during basic 
training and in her signals course when she was bunked in a room 
with five other women in an otherwise allmale barracks 
of course the first week you took the towel into the shower 
with you but after that you dont think about it you get used to 
it very fast she said 
once on board ship she said it was the guys who had 
problems i knew what i was getting into when i decided to go into 
the navy the guys didnt beg to have girls here 
officers normally sleep in twoman cabins which could have been 
problematic for berglund her skipper said danielsson assigned her 
to a fourbunk cabin to avoid gossip 
shipboard romances were out said kroog who has a boyfriend on 
another ship it must be all business otherwise it wouldnt work 
down here 
the navy and air force have been more successful absorbing women 
than the army which issued a report last year that women were 
performing badly in the artillery and engineering corps but they 
often do better than men in services requiring technical ability 
the report said 
the report recommended that women remain barred from the 
cavalry armored corps and infantry which it said were physically 
too demanding the air force has no women pilots 
there is something unnatural about young girls lifting heavy 
gun carriages or running with heavy weapons the army commander 
lt gen erik bengtsson said in a newspaper interview last year 
and later came under heavy criticism for saying it 
in the navy women are not allowed to serve in submarines or as 
naval commandos where deep sea pressure could cause miscarriages 
in pregnant sailors

joe cocker the hellraiser of rock n 
roll has unchained his heart and says hes a reformed man 
though its been almost two decades since he performed a 
memorable rendition of with a little help from my friends at 
the woodstock music festival cocker is riding a new wave of 
popularity with his album unchain my heart and is proving he 
is no fading star 
on his eighth tour to australia this month the 44yearold 
rocker is playing 15000seat venues amid huge publicity 
his consumption of booze and drugs is legendary as are his 
rasping voice and twitching body moves but hes best remembered 
for his appearance at woodstock in 1969 and the mad dogs and 
englishmen tour with its huge entourage of 40 musicians wives 
girlfriends children and hangerson recordings and movies were 
made of both hes also known for many comebacks 
 
with a little help from my friends was cockers first big 
hit single in europe and the title of his first album in 1969 
 
his hit singles in the united states include the letter and 
cry me a river in 1970 you are so beautiful in 1974 and 
the 1982 duet with jennifer warnes up where we belong from 
the soundtrack of an officer and a gentleman the duet has been 
his only no 1 hit in the united states and won both cocker and 
warnes their only grammy 
cockers three most recent albums are on capitol civilized 
man in 1984 cocker 1986 and unchain my heart 1987 an 
lp inspired by ray charles who originally recorded the title cut 
hes come through some tough times and made and lost baby 
fortunes but his appetite for life remains undiminished the 
calm contented cocker of 1988 is vastly changed from the raw 
rampaging singer of more than a decade ago 
he once was known as one of the most unreliable people in show 
business nowadays cocker treats his business very differently 
i still go a bit nuts once in a while everybody does he 
said but i take my performing very seriously now i dont like 
to get wrecked before a show 
moderation is his keyword hes aware he took himself to the 
brink and survived 
cocker born in workingclass sheffield in the north of england 
began working as a musician at the age of 16 playing drums and 
harmonica for a band known as the cavaliers he switched to vocals 
in 1961 and the group changed its name to vance arnold and the 
avengers supporting such acts as the hollies and the rolling 
stones 
cocker quit his job as a gas fitter in 1964 for a music career 
but he wasnt very successful and returned to life with the east 
midlands gas board 
his big break came when he assembled the grease band in the 
1960s the group recorded a cover of the beatles tune with a 
little help from my friends which became a no 1 hit in britain 
after woodstock cocker went on to team with leon russell for 
the legendary mad dogs and englishmen tour of 1970 which produced 
a film a double lp and the hit songs delta lady and the 
letter 
then his career went downhill his drunkenness increased and he 
was arrested in australia for possession of marijuana 
i had times when i went on very bad down trips he said 
his output despite the 1974 hit you are so beautiful 
became decidely patchy 
there are things about the mid70s that i dont remember at 
all he admits 
his career revived in 1982 when he teamed with warnes for up 
where we belong his recent hits include a civilized man 
shelter me dont you love me anymore you can leave your 
hat on and the rhythm and blusey unchain my heart 
cocker says that while he has mellowed and become more 
disciplined his stage performance has not 
im still a pretty wild performer he said i feel 
reenergized recently 
but he now shuns drugs at 44 how many times can you beat 
yourself against a wall without it hurting 
i had a taste of just about everything out there he said 
i feel grateful i came out of it 
in 1979 he moved to santa barbara calif and married last 
year for the first time

the moody blues the british band that 
brought an elegance of sound to rock n roll in the 1960s is 
struggling with political infighting over its direction and style 
but swissborn keyboardist patrick moraz who joined the band in 
1978 with the departure of singer mike pinder says hes confident 
its five members can soar above the turmoil to write some 
incredible material as a group 
there is a lot of political decisions and policies being made 
behind the scenes about who composes what moraz said in a 
telephone interview from los angeles prior to a recent concert at 
parkwest resort near salt lake city but that really shouldnt 
hinder the fact that we are a group and we are a very good group 
probably one of the best in the world 
the group launched a nationwide tour this summer in cincinnati 
to mark the 20th anniversary of the british rockers first us 
tour 
the outspoken moraz said he was not happy with the groups 
newest album sur la mer on the sea released in the 
united states in june it was weak he said and had undergone a 
corporate approach 
he was particularly upset that flutistsinger ray thomas an 
original member of the moody blues was not called by the producer 
to participate 
i think its inexcusable personally hes a very important 
force in the moody blues like all of us moraz said the album 
is selling moderately well and one of its songs i know youre 
out there somewhere was at the top of the pop charts this summer 
it was 1967 when the moody blues delighted millions with the 
release of its single nights in white satin a haunting 
choirlike love song written by lead singer justin hayward that 
was followed by the highly acclaimed and successful album days 
of future passed the group had earlier hit the charts with go 
now the no 1 single in britain in 1964 
in their 22 years the moody blues the other members are 
singerguitarist john lodge and drummer graeme edge have sold 
more than 50 million albums and traveled the world time and again 
giving concerts and writing songs 
the group broke up in the early 1970s but reunited six years 
later in the interim hayward and lodge produced an album blue 
jays thomas pinder and lodge each produced albums of their own 
however in 1978 the five decided to revive the moody blues 
sound in the course of making octave their 10th album pinder 
left and moraz with his classical music background and a string 
of selfproduced albums behind him was recruited 
do the conflicts within the moody blues auger badly for the 
future 
conflict always weakens if the conflict can come to a 
selftransformation which calls for growth of creativity and then 
fanning that fire so the group would benefit its good said 
moraz a former keyboardist for yes if a conflict generates into 
a bitter situation then obviously it weakens the whole system 
and that probably is what happened on this last album 
its a very simpletype political matter theres a 
segment of egos out there and that weakens the whole thing and a 
group like the moody blues should show the example because they put 
it in their songs so why cant we apply it to our lives and our 
artistic life as a group 
despite the disagreements the moody blues have no intention of 
breaking up again 
i mean things happen all the time with rock n roll groups 
and everything but after 22 years of almost living happily ever 
after theres no reason why we should do that he said 
no no no we all are conscious of our own mistakes and 
everybody makes mistakes im absolutely positive the group will 
stay together 
said lead singer justin hayward in an earlier interview with the 
associated press we might go on forever there is no such thing 
as retirement as far as we are concerned after all what would we 
do then

when celebrity biographer albert goldman began 
digging into the lives of john lennon his first move was to 
mail a long reverential request for help to yoko ono 
she was numero uno youve got to start with her i sent her a 
sincere letter because at that time i was a true believer in 
rocks greatest love story i told her im in your corner 
goldman recalled 
ono never responded and after 1200 interviews and 6 years 
the dream was over for goldman his mythic view of lennon the great 
altered 
expecting the best goldman claims to have uncovered the worst 
a volatile debauched lennon who evolved into the howard hughes of 
rock n roll tucked in his dakota bed for days at a time 
that vision of the exbeatle has infuriated lennon supporters 
family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing it also 
taught goldman who says he is a john lennon fan a hard lesson 
it doesnt pay to meet your idols just enjoy them dont try 
to see the reality goldman said my books are a cold dose of 
reality you get in the beatle shower and suddenly the water goes 
cold 
goldman whose past tellall biographies dealt with elvis 
presley and lenny bruce remains unmoved by the hue and cry from 
the music industry from ono and from lennons beatle buddy paul 
mccartney 
my books are bad for business goldman said in a phone 
interview from munich west germany theyre bad for pauls 
business bad for yokos business back for the jive myth of rock 
business those people have to hate me 
mythshattering is a not a bad thing goldman said for example 
he cites lennons disillusioning meeting with presley at graceland 
in 1965 
john was very hooked into elvis elvis was his measure of 
success said goldman and the myth of elvis awesome but the 
reality of elvis a mess 
goldman also rejected the complaint raised by ono mccartney 
julian lennon and others that lennon is an easy target to defame 
because hes no longer around to answer the allegations 
you cant say john lacks for defenders and yoko isnt dead 
colonel parker presleys manager isnt dead ninetyfive percent 
of the people in my books arent dead they can do something about 
it said goldman his voice quickening 
this business of making it easy for defending myself is 
insane im the target of scores of attacks i cant imagine a 
harder thing for an author 
those attacks dont really bother him unless they come from 
someone who hasnt read the lives of john lennon goldman said 
a lot of people already made up their minds they hear albert 
goldman john lennon homosexuality bang let him have it i 
resent people commenting on a book they havent read including 
yoko the author said 
onos reaction came on a nationally broadcast response to the 
book she labeled goldmans version of life with the lennons 
totally fiction and brought out lennons sons julian and 
12yearold sean to refute the biography 
these giant promotions of yoko are presented as honest 
documentaries when theyre inhouse documentaries said goldman 
who complimented ono on a wellprepared show she takes no 
chances this was another nochance yoko 
as for the sensational charges of bisexuality drug abuse by 
yoko and john wild drinking binges anorexia and reclusiveness 
goldman says it all fits together with the image of lennon 
presented by those who knew him 
my thesis is john lennon was a divided mind every yin had a 
yang said goldman there is nothing more natural than for john 
to try the other side sexually thats just the kind of guy he 
was he wanted to try everything once

in the three months 
yellowstone national park has burned firefighters have struggled 
heroically politicians have pointed fingers and the park has 
quietly gone about healing itself 
just eight weeks after flames roared past the grant village 
complex on lake yellowstone wildflowers already have sprouted from 
the blackened soil 
by the time a blueribbon panel of experts convenes in 
midoctober to review the devastation and recommend a 
rehabilitation plan the seeds for recovery will have been sown 
in some cases by the very flames that have destroyed nearly half 
the parks 22 million acres 
the meadows i would anticipate by next july you would not 
even be able to tell that there was a fire there said john 
varley the parks chief researcher they respond that fast 
the areas of the forest that had a ground fire but not a 
crown fire it will be difficult to tell that they were burned 
he said the areas that were totally consumed by fire will come 
back and essentially be 100 percent plant cover in three to five 
years that 100 percent plant cover will be perennial grasses 
wildflowers the return of the shrubs and willows and so forth 
also returning to the landscape will be lodgepole pines which 
already are reseeding the fires melted a protective resin covering 
the pine cones allowing seeds to fall to the earth 
fires have changed the face of yellowstone this summer but 
much has not changed said ed lewis executive director of the 
greater yellowstone coalition the group serves as a public 
watchdog over management of yellowstone and neighboring national 
forests 
elk bison bears and other wildlife species still roam the 
park and the surrounding millions of acres of wildlands he said 
yellowstones worldfamous geysers still gush whistle and roar 
and yellowstones spectacular rivers and waterfalls still flow 
gone from yellowstone will be many of the insectkilled trees 
that littered the forest floor and fueled the fires 
while experts debate how to clean up the scorched landscape now 
littered with snags and ash the insect world will be converting 
the timber into detritus 
they the trees are being attacked by insects right now 
right this very moment that love freshly killed trees varley 
said adding that they include termites ants beetles and other 
species 
they are not let me make this distinction the same kinds of 
insects that attack live trees so we are not serving as some kind 
of pestilence for the remaining live trees he said that will 
in turn bring in a host of bird species that feed on those kinds of 
things 
the bears spend a lot of time with ants and termites in these 
freshly dead and decaying trees so there is a very interesting 
component coming in there in the insect world that will feed a lot 
of animals birds and so forth 
the fires have spawned political controversy over the national 
park services let it burn policy toward naturally ignited 
fires wyoming sens malcolm wallop and alan simpson have called 
for park service director william penn motts resignation over the 
handling of the blazes 
but many observers say nothing in yellowstone really was 
destroyed they say the alterations are simply the parks latest 
growing pains 
no species have been driven from the park or tossed into 
extinction by the fires varley points out 
he said the only real tragedy of the fires that charred more 
than 15 million acres in yellowstone and its surrounding national 
forests in wyoming idaho and montana was the destruction of some 
structures and the economic hardships endured by some 
ecologically strictly ecologically speaking there is really 
no downside to this story varley said where the downside 
comes in is when you talk about human values values to life and 
property and the very legitimate and sincere concerns that the 
people who are our neighbors have and so forth 
this area has been putting up with fires like this for the 
last 10000 to 12000 years and it has adapted to be able to deal 
with it he said 
many businessmen in the cities and towns surrounding 
yellowstone while suffering through a dismal tourist season this 
year actually expect the fires to spur a boom of sorts next year 
i think the park will have a lot of people out of curiosity 
said dan dowdy who runs a campground and motel in gardiner mont 
on the northern edge of yellowstone 
those visitors as they make their way around the grand loop 
that links old faithful mammoth hot springs and several campsites 
and stopovers will be able to pull over and watch the park mend 
itself said varley 
we have in progress the development of an interpretive plan 
that will tell the visitor next year the story of the summer of 
88 i think it will be a fascinating story he said the 
visitor will be able to go into and look at these areas one year 
postburning 
but then we have areas along the roadside that are 10 years 
postburning 35 years postburning 80 years 100 years and so 
theyll be able to see this forest succession that is caused by 
fires varley said 
the tourists also can expect to find elk moose bears and bison 
in many of the areas where they were before he said 
the information that comes to us from the firefighters and all 
the other people that are out in the field right now suggests that 
the animals are surprisingly nonchalant about the fires said 
varley we have numerous observations of elk bedded down in 
meadows right next to where these great conflagrations are going on 
and we also have a lot of evidence that they move into these 
blackened areas soon after the fire passes he added 
theres really no reason to avoid yellowstone in the years to 
come lewis believes 
the reasons that people visit the park are still there and 
will still be there next year he said the message is is that 
yellowstone has changed but has not disappeared or died

the sun comes up a 
faraway fireball heralding another day of waning summer in 
yellowstone national park 
after three nervewracking months and a blessed few inches of 
early snow the walls of flame are gone the 60 mph winds that 
danced embers from treetop to treetop have died away the small 
tourist towns that hug the boundaries of the worlds first national 
park are no longer threatened with annihilation 
on the horizon is only a hint of smoke and haze 
but yellowstone is a casualty of what historians describe as its 
worst summer of drought and flames in 300 years famous around the 
world as a pristine symbol of wilderness this vast park is now a 
mosaic of green and black living forests and dead trees 
nearly half of yellowstones 22 million acres have been touched 
by fires with names like hellroaring and storm north fork and 
clover mist millions of black matchsticks are all that remain of 
oncethriving lodgepoles and blue spruce aspens and firs 
because the flames were fickle there are also huge patches of 
sweetsmelling pines growing next to miles of charred forest there 
are fragrant meadows hard by singed marsh delicate ferns turning 
gold with the equinox still grow next to creekbeds seared of every 
blade of grass 
yellowstone national park is not a total wasteland of scorched 
earth and moonscape but it is not the place it used to be 
already charges of mismanagement and bad policy are being 
leveled against park rangers congressional hearings and internal 
reviews promise to drag on from autumn into winter and beyond 
there are fears about the future of yellowstones fisheries and 
wildlife when ash and silt flow into streams and lakes next spring 
more than 8000 firefighters from the national park service 
forest service the army and even the marine corps descended on 
yellowstone to do battle taking on one of natures most awesome 
forces with picks and shovels hoses and hand tools 
daily they still crisscross the park in camouflagepainted 
armored vehicles and chartreuse pumper trucks bearing license 
plates from california to florida they overflow campgrounds with 
their tents and catering crews and line up at pay phones to call 
faraway loved ones who demand to know when theyre coming home 
but beyond the hustle of command posts and bivouacs the birds 
are singing old faithful still is trumpeter swans swimming in 
pairs still grace the madison river as it meanders through its own 
plateau the fountain paint pots still gurgle and steam and the 
mountains cast the same shadows hunters saw as far back as 5000 
years ago 
the park is just a howling wilderness of 3000 square miles 
full of all imaginable freaks of a fiery nature wrote rudyard 
kipling of yellowstone in 1889 
and so it is today 
those who come to yellowstone after the fires will still see the 
same breathtaking vista from artist point that inspired painters 
thomas moran and albert bierstadt in the 1800s 
the 700foot sheer drop and two roaring waterfalls of the grand 
canyon of the yellowstone are the same as when the parks first 
superintendent nathaniel p langford was prompted to write i 
realized my own littleness my helplessness my dread exposure to 
destruction my inability to cope with or even comprehend the 
mighty architecture of nature 
along virginia cascade drive are many unspoiled spots where 
falling pine needles have created a soft carpet of ground cover 
but farther down the slope lies graphic evidence of the ominous 
spiral of fire that swept through that place with particular fury 
right above the falls there are still little puffs of smoke and 
an occasional lick of distant flames still waiting for mopup 
crews in one turnout five tidy picnic tables stand ready for the 
next batch of campers 
in the pastoral hayden valley herds of bison graze in the 
untouched meadows a ragged chevron of geese fly overhead and the 
yellowstone river its flow diminished by drought braids its way 
through the vast open bowl bull elk are everywhere 
just as president theodore roosevelt wrote during his visit in 
1903 we saw an occasional pine squirrel snowshoe rabbit or 
marten and in the open meadows around the hot waters there were 
canada geese and ducks of several species and now and then a 
coyote 
farther south around yellowstone lake some hills on the 
horizon are charred some are not but the fabled evening stillness 
of the lake remains its surface sometimes a mirror of its 
surroundings 
the geysers erupt as they did for naturalist john muir in 1885 
the wildest geysers in the world in bright triumphant bands 
are dancing and singing in it amid thousands of boiling springs 
mud volcanoes mush and broth caldrons whose contents are of every 
color and consistency splash and heave and roar in bewildering 
abundance 
as has been the case in recent years most of yellowstones 
bears are elusive but many firefighters have seen them park 
biologists are confident the bears are still in the back country

the financial health of farm families has been 
aided dramatically in recent years by federal subsidies but 
agriculture department economists say a good job in town is the 
real meal ticket for a growing number of those who live on the land 
all told the jobs and government payments helped push farm 
household earnings ahead of the us average in 1985 and again in 
1986 the first time that has happened since the 1970s 
the mainstay for many families has been offfarm income the job 
in town a regular paycheck that is isolated from drought and the 
whipsawing of commodity prices 
although many observers and analysts previously considered 
offfarm employment as a transitional step to fulltime farming 
operation offfarm employment is becoming more common as farm 
operators and members of their households choose to pursue dual 
careers says donn reimund of the departments economic research 
service 
the agency noted in a report last winter that offfarm incomes 
were of growing importance to farm families and that the income gap 
between farm and nonfarm narrowed again in the mid1980s after 
widening since 1978 
in the latest installment reported in a forthcoming issue of 
farmline magazine reimund and his colleagues noted that the 
incomes of farm households trailed the us average for six 
straight years before moving ahead in 1985 to an average of 29436 
against the national average for all households of 29066 a 1 
percent lead 
the gap widened in 1986 to 11 percent as the farm average rose 
to 34246 per household compared with 30759 for the us 
average both were record levels 
department analysts attributed the rise in 1985 and 1986 to 
lower production costs and higher direct government payments to 
farmers although increased incomes from offfarm jobs were also 
factors 
federal payments to farmers were 8 billion in 1985 and rose to 
12 billion in 1986 comparatively in 1981 those were only 19 
billion 
but comparisons of average incomes do not explain income 
distribution and can mask differences at the very high and low 
levels that is true of urban as well as farm families but reimund 
said a higher percentage of farm operator households are below 
the official povery level than are other households 
only about 16 percent of the nations farm families reported 
receiving no offfarm income in 1986 based on usdas annual farm 
costs and returns survey 
mary ahearn another agency analyst said that about half of the 
households of farm operators in 1986 depended on offfarm sources 
for twothirds or more of their total cash income 
these households were generally involved in small farming 
operations with sales of less than 40000 a year she said on 
the average they reported a loss of 2950 on farm operations in 
1986 but earned 40904 off the farm resulting in a net cash 
income of 37954 
only 20 percent of the households in this group participated in 
federal direct payment programs and they received an average of 
6380 each their small size precluded larger payments because 
federal subsidies are related to production 
until the 1970s the nations farm operator households lagged 
behind the us average in household incomes the report said 
today their incomes remain much more volatile than the steadily 
rising us average but no longer are they always in the bottom 
position 
farm household income exceeded the us average in eight of the 
17 years 1970 through 1986 only two of those years 1985 and 
1986 were in the 80s 
reimund said the first time was in 1972 as farm export markets 
began to grow rapidly in 1973 farm income shot up to an average 
of 17854 per household 47 percent more than the us average of 
12157 a difference that has not been matched since 
has the trend continued in 1987 and 1988 reimund said he had to 
hedge a bit particularly for this years income comparisons 
last year was pretty good he said but 1988 its a tough 
one with the drought and all i guess well just have to wait and

the reporters trailing george bush could 
overlook the smell of something burning aboard their boeing 727 
but two days later when the pilot dumped fuel over lake michigan to 
make an emergency landing theyd had just about enough 
once on the ground in chicago they refused to reboard the key 
air charter jet and scurried to make their own arrangements on 
scheduled flights to the west coast to catch up with the candidate 
who had flown on air force ii 
key air meanwhile trying to salvage its 18 million contract 
shadowed the bush campaign with an empty airplane 
the unexpected return to chicago was prompted by concern about 
flaps working properly 
mechanical troubles aborted takeoffs surprise government 
inspections the grounding of at least one plane even a delay 
caused by secret service agents poking holes in a plane when they 
closed a door improperly have marked this years presidential 
campaign trips 
among reporters a skeptical lot under any circumstances 
theres been much chatter about safety aboard the chartered flights 
which carry the press campaign staff and candidates except for 
bush who normally travels on air force ii 
the concerns were not eased after the bush campaign dumped the 
key air charter and temporarily hired united airlines on the first 
united flight an overheated engine prompted a pilot to abort a 
takeoff as his boeing 737 raced down a runway in houston texas 
key air key air came the sarcastic chant from the press 
corps 
the following week trouble struck democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis campaign plane in chicago its the same 
plane he has flown all year and one aides say he particularly 
favors although members of the press have dubbed the stubby 
20yearold boeing 737 sky pig because it cant make a 
crosscountry trip without landing for fuel 
the plane owned by presidential airways was grounded after faa 
inspectors found several problems including a faulty emergency exit 
light and a damaged vane that measures air flow and triggers the 
alarm that would warn the pilots if their aircraft was about to 
stall 
the faa inspection unleashed a controversy because of its 
timing dukakis staffers wondered why inspectors showed up only 15 
minutes before departure when the jet had been parked at the 
airport all night dukakis had to cancel a campaign trip to ohio 
faa officials denied any political motives and said the 
inspectors had not been told they had so little time before the 
scheduled departure in the future well try to stay invisible 
said bob goodrich director of flight standards 
even for vice presidents there are no guarantees once when 
vice president spiro agnew was on board air force ii was struck by 
lightning and several years ago with bush aboard it almost collided 
with a small plane while landing in seattle 
news organizations reimburse the campaigns for the cost of the 
charters with prices ranging from about 1 times the cost of a 
first class ticket to considerably more depending on how many 
people are on board a seat on one coasttocoast flights early in 
the bush campaign cost 5000 because few reporters were aboard 
until recent years the planes usually belonged to one of the 
major airlines but they no longer have the extra aircraft to 
accommodate demands for charters 
recently when united took away its plane bush reporters were 
told on the tarmac at andrews air force base near washington they 
had better make up their minds quickly about the replacement 
airline american trans air because the dukakis campaign was 
negotiating for the plane as well 
the charter airlines insist their safety record ranks favorably 
with the major regularly scheduled air carriers the faa agrees 
i think its unfortunate that these events involving the bush 
press entourage occurred but mechanicals are sort of a way of 
life said scott andrews a vice president of world corp the 
owner of key air he said his airline has a good maintenance record 
world corp formerly world airways when it was providing 
scheduled air service and its key air subsidiary has six dc10s 
and eight boeing 727s carrying everything from a planeload of 
tourists to rock bands 
flights on campaign charters over the years have never been 
examples of decorum or for that matter strict compliance with 
cabin safety regulations 
people have been known to surf and ski down the aisles on 
takeoff says ap political writer evans witt a favorite pastime 
begun is the rolling of an orange down the aisle on takeoff to see 
how far it gets before disappearing under a seat nancy reagan used 
to be a frequent participant 
it also has not been unheard off for a flight attendant to be 
hooted down during a preflight safety announcement 
some campaign veterans say the inflight antics arent as 
rambunctious this year they also suggest that this years horror 
stories pale when compared to some in campaigns past 
four years ago a lockheed electra carrying sen john glenns 
campaign flew into sioux city iowa in a blinding snowstorm on the 
first approach the plane flew closer to the terminal than to the 
runway so glenn the former marine fighter pilot and astronaut 
stuck his head into the cockpit to make sure the second landing was 
more on target 
those covering jesse jacksons 1984 primary campaign still talk 
about a trip on the same electra from washington to dallas when it 
was buffeted so severely by a storm that passengers were thrown 
into the aisles upon landing jackson knelt and kissed the ground 
vowing never to fly the plane again and didnt 
nine months later the same electra belonging to galaxy 
airlines crashed upon takeoff from the reno nev airport 
killing 68 people aboard this time the plane was carrying a 
minnesota group returning from a weekend gambling excursion

for the second time in the brief 
history of manned space flight the united states is poised to 
rebound from tragedy 
the explosion of the shuttle challenger on jan 28 1986 bore 
some striking similarities to another disaster almost exactly 19 
years earlier the apollo 1 fire of jan 27 1967 
in both cases poor design inadequate management safety lapses 
and communications breakdowns were at fault recovery required 
months of remorse realignment and repair 
failure to recover from apollo 1 would have derailed americas 
goal of a manned lunar landing before the end of the decade 
another challengertype accident could deal a death blow to the 
nations space program 
but the national aeronautics and space administration bounced 
back brilliantly from the 1967 fire and sent astronauts to the 
moon and now the agency says it has done everything it can to make 
the shuttle a safe ship and the first flight since challenger is 
set for liftoff thursday 
nasa is counting on success to revive its fortunes and provide a 
springboard to a future that will include a permanent manned space 
station and eventually flights to mars and other parts of the solar 
system 
there is also the matter of national pride before challenger 
the united states held undisputed world leadership in space 
exploration but since the accident the soviets have overtaken the 
americans in many categories including manned spaceflight 
experience and they have a stated goal to dispatch men to mars 
early in the 21st century 
in 1967 the united states also had its eye on the soviet union 
america had been stung by early russian space successes and the two 
superpowers were in a race to see which could first land men on the 
moon as a symbol of technological prowess 
against that backdrop the three apollo 1 astronauts gus 
grissom ed white and roger chaffee entered their capsule atop a 
saturn 1b rocket on that day late in january for a launch pad 
countdown test they were scheduled for launch into earth orbit in 
february on the first flight test of the apollo spacecraft that was 
to transport astronauts to the moon 
five hours later all three were dead killed by a fire that 
swept through the spacecraft 
an investigation board could not pinpoint definitely the cause 
of the fire but listed the most likely source as an electric arc 
in defective wiring under grissoms seat 
the report criticized nasa and north american aviation the 
capsule builder for poor management carelessness negligence 
sloppy work and failure to adequately consider the safety of the 
astronauts 
top management at both were overhauled and a 75 million 
program was launched to redesign the spacecraft 
twentyone months after the accident on oct 11 1968 the 
effort paid off when three astronauts rode a redesigned capsule 
into orbit and thoroughly checked it out during an 11day flight 
the mission was so successful that nasa scheduled the next flight 
as an orbital trip around the moon on christmas eve 
two more preliminary flights followed and on july 20 1969 
astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin set foot on the moon 
beating president john f kennedys endofthedecade deadline by 
five months 
six more moon missions followed but three others were canceled 
the united states had won the race to the moon leaving the 
soviets far behind but ironically with the end of this era came a 
long troubled period for nasa 
the agency should not have been surprised from a peak budget of 
6 billion in 1965 at the height of apollo development nasas 
fortunes had been declining every year several nextgeneration 
proposals had been rejected or scaled down 
nasa had counted on the tide of apollo 11 enthusiasm to rescue 
its bold plans for the future but the agency misread the mood of a 
nation torn by vietnam and by racial unrest much of the press and 
some politicians came to view the space effort as a symbol of 
misplaced national priorities with detente the soviet threat no 
longer seemed so ominous 
congress and the nixon administration told the agency to scrap 
its plans for large space stations a moon base and manned trips to 
mars nasa budgets fell below 4 billion its personnel from a peak 
of 36000 to 21000 
the only major project to survive was the reusable space 
shuttle but it was years away 
in the interim nasa used leftover apollo rockets and spacecraft 
to build skylab a modest space station which in 1973 and 1974 
served as orbital home to three crews for periods up to 84 days 
another leftover apollo capsule carried three american astronauts 
to a linkup with two soviet cosmonauts in 1975 
following that flight the american manned space program entered 
a dry spell of six years 
nasa had hoped to launch the first shuttle in 1978 but there 
were funding difficulties and serious design and development 
problems 
the shortage of money forced engineers to abandon plans for a 
fully reusable shuttle employing only liquid fuel engines instead 
they settled on two solid fuel rockets to assist the craft into 
orbit a decision that would come back to haunt them the day 
challenger blew up 
columbia the first shuttle made it into orbit in april 1981 
starting a string of 24 successful flights the program boasted 
some remarkable achievements from flying the first american women 
and black astronauts to deploying satellites retrieving and 
repairing others and conducting pioneering experiments in a cargo 
bay unit known as spacelab 
spaceflight seemingly had become routine and nasa became so 
confident of its machine that it added congressmen a saudi prince 
and nonastronaut researchers and scientists to the crews 
a schoolteacher christa mcauliffe was in the crew of seven 
when the string ended with that awful explosion of challenger 73 
seconds after liftoff on a cold january day in 1986 
when the rogers commission that investigated the accident 
released its report it sounded as though the space agency had 
forgotten the lessons of apollo 1 
the report said the direct cause of the explosion was a leak at 
a joint between two segments of one of challengers two solid fuel 
booster rockets flames shot past two synthetic rubber orings and 
ignited the external fuel tank 
the commission said cold weather 36 degrees at launch time 
contributed to the accident by robbing the rings of their 
resiliency preventing them from sealing the joint properly some 
engineers had argued with lowerlevel managers against launching in 
the cold but their concerns never were communicated to those 
making the launch decision 
the report scored nasa for lapses in judgment safety design 
communications and management there were wholesale shakeups of 
management at the space agency and the booster rocket maker morton 
thiokol and a 12 billion redesign program was undertaken 
a total of 56 major and 400 lesser changes have been made to 
discovery nasa says it now is ready to put them and its future to 
the test

four years ago while space shuttles were 
making regular satellitedelivery runs into orbit the air force 
began agitating for a return to rocket launches in case something 
went wrong with the shuttle fleet 
something did go horribly wrong challenger and the space 
program is back where it started 30 years ago using expendable 
rockets 
edward c aldridge then undersecretary of the air force 
sounded the warning before congress in 1984 
we simply cannot afford to be in a situation whatever the 
view on its likelihood that could result in our being denied all 
access to space he said the department of defense must not be 
totally dependent on the shuttle we feel that having our total 
launch capability placed on the shuttle is an unacceptable risk 
aldridges testimony was the capstone of a furious fight with a 
sister agency the national aeronautics and space administration 
which contended that the air force was trying to undermine the 
civilian shuttle program by pushing for a return to large 
expensive expendable launch vehicles to put military 
satellites in orbit the space agency all along had counted on the 
military to be its paying customer on at least onethird of all 
flights 
aldridge now secretary of the air force got his elvs his 
warnings proved to be prophetic when the challenger blew up on jan 
28 1986 because of his efforts an assembly line was starting to 
put an improved version of the air forces workhorse titan rocket 
together 
like all disasters the space programs came in threes on april 
18 a titan 34d exploded five seconds after launch with a secret 
military payload and on may 3 a delta carrying a 57 million 
weather satellite had to be destroyed when it veered out of 
control the united states was left with no capacity to launch 
heavy payloads 
with the shuttle fleet grounded for nearly three years and 
expensive satellites sitting in warehouses with no place to go the 
expendable launch vehicle industry had a slow rebirth 
president reagan ordered nasa out of the commercial launching 
business the air force began spending billions to restore an elv 
fleet that was all but depleted owners of satellites with no way 
to orbit began booking rides with the european consortium 
arianespace and both china and the soviet union began soliciting 
launch business 
as of july 23 arianespace has contracts to launch 40 satellites 
for 23 billion including 7 from the united states and more than 
a dozen from other countries and international organizations that 
previously used american launch vehicles 
for years the united states had encouraged development of a 
private launch industry but not a single customer had been signed 
in the new climate the big three rocket builders suddenly got into 
the buiness of selling satellite deliveries as a package deals 
rocket and launch for one price discounts available for two or 
more 
there has been a resurgence in this industry said fred 
bettinger of general dynamics which makes atlascentaur and atlas 
2 rockets general dynamics has 18 atlascentaurs on its assembly 
line although only four are sold for 50 million to 60 million 
each it has orders for 11 atlas 2s through 1997 for 856 million 
mcdonnell douglas has a major share of the air force elv 
buildup the air force has ordered 14 delta 2s for 4938 million 
and has options for six more for a total 690 million in addition 
said mcdonnell douglas tom williams the company began to market 
the deltas commercially and has seven orders through 1991 
two years ago we were going out of business in the area of 
elvs williams said that was before the reagan administration 
revived the elv business 
during that vacuum when challenger crashed and before our elv 
business was resurrected arianespace cleaned up securing many 
contracts the balance has been redressed especially this year we 
landed four contracts in 1987 and three this year 
among mcdonnell douglas commercial customers are british 
satellite broadcast limited the governments of india and 
indonesia nato and two for inmarsat 
martin marietta has contracts for 55 billion worth of its 
titan rockets and their launches three different launch vehicles 
for air force and commercial customers 
what really gave us the impetus to start our commercial titan 
business was the presidential decision to take commercial payloads 
off the shuttle said judy herb a martin marietta spokeswoman in 
denver we announced within days of that that we had formed the 
commercial titan co 
the firm is marketing a version of the titan 3 an air force 
standby since the 1960s as the commercial titan and has sold 
four at 100 million to 125 million each for launches through 
early 1990 it also has an agreement with general electric to 
launch up to 15 satellites over a number of years all on the 
commercial titan 
the titan 2 a refurbished intercontinental ballistics missile 
was launched for the first time this month september and there 
are 13 more on order for 6387 million 
the newest and biggest of the line the titan 4 is on a pad at 
the cape canaveral air force station in florida for launch in 
october it has the greatest lift capacity of any american rocket 
being able to put a 10000pound satellite into orbit 22300 miles 
above earth 
twentytwo more titan 4s are on order bringing the price tag to 
42 billion through 1993 and the air force has just announced its 
intention to buy 20 more of the behemoths 
an irony is that nasa which fought elvs so long as a threat to 
the manned space flight program now is standing in line to buy 
them from the air force 
in 1984 aldridge called an elv capacity a modest hedge 
against unanticipated and unforeseen shuttle problems which might 
cause fleet groundings or outages in 1988 nasa tends to agree

air force col richard covey 
expects to be flooded with memories of the challenger astronauts 
when he climbs aboard discovery for the first shuttle launch in 
more than 2 years 
im sure as i crawl in ill think about the crew crawling 
into the orbiter and strapping in and sitting on the launch pad 
what they were thinking what they were doing said the veteran 
astronaut who was picked to pilot discovery 
covey a former air force fighter and test pilot also guided 
discovery three years ago on a mission billed by nasa as its most 
successful flight yet he said he is confident the upcoming mission 
also will be a success but realizes his family is concerned because 
of what happened to challenger 
it would be strange for them not to be the last time anybody 
saw a space shuttle come off the launch pad it blew up covey 
said you dont forget about it 
and the 42yearold covey said he too will reflect on the 
challenger astronauts 
ill also be knowing that they would be pleased that we have 
gotten back to the point where we are going to fly again 
his wife kathleen a real estate agent and daughters sarah 
14 and amy 12 will attend the launch 
coping with the risks of space flight at the covey household 
doesnt involve a lot of talk about it he said 
they understand that i do these types of things because i want 
to do them and thats what makes me the type of person that i am 
and they dont really question that 
recently the five discovery astronauts talked to dozens of 
reporters at the johnson space center for their final news 
conference before the flight but covey said the big event that 
day was a volleyball game the season opener for his daughters 
team they won 
i was there i made it he added smiling 
covey was born in fayetteville ark and grew up in fort walton 
beach fla his late father was an air force lieutenant colonel 
he earned a bachelors degree from the us air force academy in 
1968 and a masters in aeronautics and astronautics from purdue 
university a year later 
while in the air force covey flew 339 combat missions during 
two tours in southeast asia he has flown more than 4000 hours in 
more than 25 different types of aircraft 
he was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1978 during his 
other shuttle mission the crew deployed three communications 
satellites and repaired an ailing satellite 
i fully intend to stay around and fly as a commander if i get 
that opportunity covey said 
although there will be plenty of work to do on the flight the 
astronauts also get a chance to relax 
theres a lot of time for looking out the window he said 
i just look out a lot at earth thats where the real scenery 
is

marine lt col dave hilmers says 
the challenger disaster made him realize the importance of 
explaining to his family how he feels about being an astronaut 
before he flew into space again 
this is a dangerous world that we live in and i think that 
everyone should be ready to tell the people that they love how they 
feel and what they believe is important said the former jet 
pilot who will help deploy a 100 million communications satellite 
on the discovery mission 
where your faith lies what your beliefs are what you want 
them to accomplish in life all these sorts of things 
hilmers said the rewards of being an astronaut outweigh any 
risks involved and he feels privileged to be flying on the first 
postchallenger mission but he acknowledged with a smile that his 
wife lynn sometimes may wish he had picked a different profession 
hilmers 38 has two sons matthew who will be 12 on sept 28 
and daniel 9 
hilmers grew up in dewitt iowa and graduated with a bachelors 
degree in mathematics summa cum laude from cornell college in 
1972 he earned a masters degree in electrical engineering in 1977 
and the degree of electrical engineer from the us naval 
postgraduate school in 1978 
two years later he was selected as an astronaut 
his only other shuttle mission launched in october 1985 was 
the maiden voyage of the orbiter atlantis hilmers was a mission 
specialist on that flight a classified department of defense 
mission 
he often jogs with his fellow discovery crew members along the 
backroads at the johnson space center discovery pilot dick covey 
said hilmers generally runs the most about four miles 
when he was asked to be part of the discovery crew hilmers said 
he felt no reluctance to accept 
there was a big lump in my throat when i was chosen there 
really was just a real sense of privilege he said 
hilmers will take several bible verses written on ribbons into 
space for friends who have supported him with prayers he said 
hell also take several flags including one from texas 
like the other astronauts hilmers said the liftoff generally is 
the most tense time of the mission 
its a very awesome two minutes he said 
when he first flew he said he was so overcome by the physical 
sensations that he didnt get much of a chance to think this 
time he believes he will be concentrating more on his job 
but hes sure he will think about challenger which exploded 73 
seconds after takeoff 
were going to be remembering what happened back then were 
going to be remembering the crew our friends were going to 
remember that something did happen in the first two minutes and 
hopefully its not going to happen again but i dont think were 
going to be dwelling on that he said 
i think that when it gets right down to the last couple of 
minutes that were going to be looking up at the sky and not 
behind us

when astronaut mike lounge soars 
into orbit aboard discovery he will carry a symbol of a bygone era 
of transportation a picture of a wagon wheel 
the wheel is displayed on a banner honoring the centennial of 
his hometown of burlington colo it contains the signatures of 
about 4000 people has a picture of a wagon wheel with a shuttle 
orbiting it and says 100 years of pioneers 
lounge who made his first shuttle flight three years ago aboard 
discovery also will carry his wifes wedding ring pins and 
drawings and several cassettes of music on the shuttle including a 
rap tape a teenage friend made for him 
the memory of the challenger tragedy will add to the anxiety 
astronauts always feel during the first few moments after launch 
lounge said 
i think the first 10 minutes of flight are always the ones 
youre most tense because youre converting so much potential 
energy in those solid rocket boosters into kinetic energy as you 
get up above the atmosphere he said in an interview once we 
get off the solids and the three main engines are running smoothly 
and it gets real quiet my heartbeat will probably go down quite a 
bit 
tanned and relaxed the former navy aviator is the lead 
astronaut in charge of deploying the 100 million communications 
satellite 
his other flight which launched aug 27 1985 is described by 
nasa as its most successful shuttle mission so far with astronauts 
deploying three satellites and repairing an ailing satellite 
lounge said there hasnt been much tension at home about the 
upcoming mission his wife kathryn anne is an engineer at the 
johnson space center and she understands the challenges as well 
as i do his family including his children shannon 17 kenneth 
7 and kathy 4 plan to be there for the liftoff 
to my two little children who live at home it hasnt become 
real to them yet we talk about going to florida and how they get 
to go watch daddy launch and they get to go to disney world and im 
not sure which is the more important of the two 
but seriously lounge said his children do understand what he 
does 
a couple of times my 4yearold has talked about how youre 
going to go fly in the space shuttle but its not going to blow up 
right so shes remembering that image of challenger he said 
but its not like a cloud of anxiety thats following her 
around she wanted some reassurance and i reassured her and that 
was ok because daddy knows everything he said smiling 
lounge a member of the texas air national guard who flies with 
his unit at least once a week said he doesnt think much about the 
risks and dangers 
but its characteristic of people that get into this kind of 
profession that were all bulletproof you can shoot at me but 
you cant hit me it might hit someone else but it wont hit me

swimming children giggle a breeze stirs 
the eucalyptus and paolo borsellino tries to forget the murder and 
corruption that are the focus of his daily work 
but a gloom that has enveloped italys war against the mafia 
follows the graying magistrate like a cloud even as he relaxes 
outside his beachfront vacation home 
a certain weariness has overcome palermo he says staring 
broodingly at the purple sicilian hills today the commitment to 
fight the mafia isnt as strong as before 
government and police officials in the sicilian capital express 
similar feelings they speak of blocked investigations of 
political indifference of threats to those who take on the mob 
the problem has grown so serious that italys president

shortly thereafter giovanni falcone italys top mafia 
investigator submitted his resignation saying working conditions 
were impossible he withdrew the resignation last week but his act 
in the beginning had a demoralizing impact

others see the corrupting hand of the mafia

the case has alarmed the national government which has 
appointed a new mafia commissioner it also has raised concern at 
the us justice department which conducts joint investigations of 
the mafia with italian officials 
at the center of the crisis are a group of investigating 
magistrates who in the italian legal system draw up indictments 
using police and judicial methods they often work alone 
falcone borsellino and his colleagues instead formed a pool so 
that the mafia could not as in the past kill off a case by 
killing off an investigator 
in the five years since the magistrates intensive teamwork has 
paid off with evidence not only about the mafias local operation 
but its business in europe and the united states as well 
it culminated in 338 convictions this past december in the 
maxitrial of mafia members accused of murder robbery and drug 
trafficking to the us east coast 
it also contributed to the 18 convictions in the pizza 
connection trial of heroin suppliers who used american pizza 
parlors as fronts 
but since january when italys superior council of magistrates 
chose 68yearold judge antonino meli to head the antimafia 
pool a split has developed in the unit the council passed over 
the 49yearold falcone ruling he was too young 
a few months after meli took over the system was changed 
completely says borsellino who left the team last year 
the new director began sending mafia cases to judges outside the 
pool and assigning nonmafia cases to pool members he says 
we are returning to the system of the 60s in which each 
judge did his job and no one knew what anyone else was doing and 
no one had a global view of the mafia asserts borsellino 
he complained publicly in july and the italian president ordered 
an investigation a week later falcone resigned and his pool 
colleagues threatened to follow 
we feel we are in danger of losing a way of coordination in 
the fight against the mafia that brought optimal results says 
pool member gioacchino natoli 
melis office said he would not comment on the accusations in 
his few public remarks he has said he spread cases among different 
judges to increase the level of experience 
the other magistrates say meli with little experience in mafia 
investigations does not realize the importance of specialization 
other people insist the problem is political influence 
it could be that instead of direct pressure its an 
environment created by that part of the city that says the mafia is 
not a danger says pintacuda in that group are also 
politicians 
on sept 14 the superior council of magistrates concluded that 
no one had tried to remove the pool from mafia cases but it also 
endorsed the pools working methods 
even if the magistrates remain the split in the judiciary has 
hurt 
tommaso buscetta a key mafia informer said he would not make 
further disclosures while the judges were divided important 
investigations have languished according to us officials 
in natolis office next to a window with double rows of 
bulletproof glass hang plaques from the fbi the us drug 
enforcement administration and the new york city police department 
when all the institutions have worked together we have had 
splendid results says the 41yearold natoli 
the judges difficulties he adds have been exacerbated by a 
decline in support from such institutions as the police and 
parliament in rome 
it was parliament that provided the key to many past successes 
against the mafia in 1982 it established a new crime that of 
mafia association and allowed inspection of suspects bank records 
but there has been no movement on judges requests for a witness 
protection program or a provision to reduce informers sentences 
there have been moments in which it has appeared the state 
would resolve the problem natoli says fingering his goldframed 
glasses later it is always set aside 
more problematic he adds has been the police situation the 
detective unit that formerly handled mafia investigations has been 
destroyed by two mafia assassinations and the arrests of several 
officers in the death of one of the suspected assassins 
one of the last members of the unit francesco accordino was 
recently transferred after receiving death threats reportedly 
traced to a police telephone 
the threats to italys war on organized crime have come just as 
the antimafia pool was beginning to focus on politicians 
links to the mafia some say the timing is no coincidence 
when judges limit themselves to trying mafia chief michele 
greco fine says carmine mancuso a police inspector who also 
heads a citizens group to rally popular support against the mafia 
the problem begins when falcone and the others begin to talk 
about political investigations 
the wail of sirens has increased this summer in palermo 
magistrates and government officials speed past in police 
motorcades authorities recently increased security for those 
active in the war on the mafia even assigning bodyguards to two 
priests 
at borsellinos house a bodyguard in sunglasses and a pink 
opennecked shirt relaxes on a lounge chair his large black pistol 
hidden in a folded newspaper 
society has paid a terribly high price for the war on the 
mafia borsellino says this has created a climate of 
weariness 
mayor leoluca orlando of palermo says the public hasnt lost 
heart and he notes the government has responded to the crisis by 
naming a prominent antiterrorism investigator domenico sica as 
the mafia commissioner and increasing his investigative powers 
the state made a strong effort during the maxitrial 
orlando says the message was clear we must recover that clarity 
to move forward

ford fseries trucks are everywhere on americas 
roads 
they take johnny to school and take dad to his landscape 
business they haul garbage to the dump and tow horse trailers to 
weekend horse shows they are workhorses that america has come to 
love 
for 11 years the fseries trucks have been the bestselling 
trucks in the united states they have outsold any car nameplate 
for the last six years and the trucks popularity is expected to 
continue into 1989 with few major changes planned for the new 
model year beginning in early october 
the test truck a twowheeldrive 1988 f150 styleside pickup 
seemed to need few changes it was sturdy and spacious the 
interior was neat in appearance with needle gauges that were easy 
to read and a large center armrest that folded down there was room 
to store some items behind the bench seat and the seat folded 
forward for easier access back there 
like all trucks the f150 offered a high perch to view traffic 
and visibility was good in all directions the truck was relatively 
easy to handle even park as long as the driver kept in mind the 
983inch truckbed in back 
there was little body sway around corners thanks in part to the 
handling package option that included front and rear stabilizer 
bars however the ride could be a bit bouncy on rough terrain and 
in some road conditions seat belts were needed to keep everyone in 
place on the seat at those times in addition the bench seat did 
not offer the adjustability and comfort of many car seats 
the engine a 58liter electronic fuelinjected v8 teamed 
with automatic transmission was powerful and performed rather 
smoothly but it really sipped the fuel making me glad to have the 
optional second fuel tank that could be tapped with a flip of a 
switch on the dashboard the government mileage rating for the 
truck was a mere 12 miles per gallon in the city 14 mpg on the 
highway 
brakes performed well with antilock brakes in the rear the 
truckbed was easy to climb into and out of especially because of 
the optional stepup bumper in back the tailgate folded down with 
ease though it was a bit heavy 
thats not likely to bother the typical fseries buyer however 
ford said 95 percent are men with median age of about 45 
eighty percent are married and 40 percent have some college 
education median annual income is 39000 and 27 percent have 
whitecollar jobs the automaker said 
buyers use the trucks for both personal and business use with 
ford truck manager beryl stajich saying the biggest single use is 
back and forth to work 
in fact trucks overall have become so much a part of american 
life that industry statistics show that while only one truck was 
sold for every 10 cars in 1966 today one truck is sold for every 
two cars 
fseries competitors include the chevrolet ck pickups and the 
dodge fullsize pickup trucks twowheeldrive versions of all 
those models with at least 116inch wheelbase have starting 
prices ranging from 7700 to 9600 but prices can get up over 
11000 with additions for towing handling and comfort features 
in style and function the ford chevy and dodge trucks all seem 
pretty similar another similarity is the fact that all truck 
buyers no matter what model they get rank durability as a prime 
concern auto analysts say 
consumer reports said ford twowheeldrive v8 pickups for the 
198183 model years ranked average in owners reporting troubles 
for the 198486 model years the ranking fell to worse than 
average but the current fseries trucks were redesigned for 
1987 and there was no consumer reports ranking for the later 
models 
ford offers a wide selection of powertrains and body styles to 
fit buyers needs towing capacities range from 2100 pounds to 
12500 pounds for example 
ford has a large number of repeat buyers stajich said a 1987 
study showed 47 percent of buyers had been previous ford owners 
compared with 36 percent for chevy he said 
that loyalty plus the fact that trucks traditionally are kept 
longer than cars are 13 years before scrappage vs 10 years for 
cars and a growing us truck market help account for the volumes 
of ford trucks on americas roads 
the trend is likely to continue considering that by midyear 
the fseries continued to hold down the topselling spot in the 
industry with sales of more than 312800 the chevy ck trucks 
were second followed by the chevrolet corsicaberetta cars

lafarge corps french parent says it has no 
interest in talking with the wouldbe buyers of the north american 
cement maker who have offered 147 billion cash 
the offer came tuesday from a group of private anonymous 
investors and was made through a new york law firm adler hindy 
turner amp glasser lawrence orbe the attorney handling the matter 
said his clients were willing to pay 30 a share in cash for 
lafarge which has about 49 million shares outstanding 
orbe said the investors owned less than 5 percent of lafarges 
outstanding shars which means they do not have to make an 
extensive disclosure filing about themselves and their intentions 
to the securities and exchange commission 
he would not provide further details about the clients but said 
their offer was contingent upon obtaining federal antitrust 
clearance sufficient financing and no opposition from the board of 
lafarge coppee the parisbased cement producer that owns a 58 
percent interest in the company 
orbe said his clients had met with two major investment banks to 
talk about financing but would not identify them 
for now the feeling is we want to meet with the parent 
company to disclose the backgrounds of the principals orbe said 
thats the most appropriate way 
it was the second time this month that the group had approached 
lafarge coppee about selling the company the earlier offer also 
for 30 share was only for the french parents controlling 
interest 
lafarge coppee issued a brief statement through the us 
subsidiarys office in reston va reiterating its rejection of 
the takeover overture and questioning its authenticity 
the statement called the latest offer yet another unsolicited 
letter to lafarge coppee from an attorney who purportedly 
represents an unidentified group of lafarge corp stockholders 
it concluded lafarge coppee confirms that it has no interest 
in selling its holdings in lafarge corp and does not intend to 
pursue any discussions relating thereto 
wall street reacted skeptically to the takeover proposal 
lafarge stock rose only 187 a share to 1987 well below the 
30 offering price 
securities analysts knowledgeable about lafarge also expressed 
doubts about the offer robert g maloney who follows the company 
for wood gundy ltd in new york said it doesnt sound like the 
way youd start if youre serious 
maloney said he strongly doubted the french parent in the 
cement business for 100 years would seriously consider selling its 
north american operations which have been moving aggessively to 
improve efficiency and profitability 
i dont think you need to take this offer seriously at all 
said another securities analyst who spoke on condition he not be 
identified the company has spent this cycle cleaning itself up 
why the heck would they want to sell unless somebody pays through 
the teeth for it 
lafarge corp was formed in 1983 as the parent to canadian 
cement lafarge ltd and general portland inc it is one of the 
continents leading cement producers with more than 6000 
employees and with factories in texas florida ohio kansas 
pennsylvania alabama michigan and throughout canada 
the companys earnings have come from its canadian business in 
the past few years largely because of the depressed economy in the

business executives expect profits to rise 
during the final three months of this year while retailers in 
particular expect higher sales and prices during the crucial 
holiday selling season according to a private survey 
dun amp bradstreet corp a leading marketer of business 
information said its quarterly survey of 1500 executives found 
that although expectations had moderated along with signs of a 
slowing economy business executives were painting the rosiest 
profit picture since 1984 
retailers are headed into the fourth quarter with high 
expectations for the holiday sales season said joseph w duncan 
corporate economist and chief statistician for dun amp bradstreet 
at the same time the outlook among durable manufacturers 
remains strong so we should close out the year on an economic high 
note 
however the survey indicated manufacturers and wholesalers were 
less optimistic about the economy than retailers as sustained 
consumer demand and increased exports have pushed the manufacturing 
sector to full capacity 
the survey was conducted during the final half of august 
overall the report said dun amp bradstreets sales optimism index 
fell slightly for the fourth quarter to 70 from 73 in the third 
quarter but among retailers the index rose to 72 from 65 
the index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of 
respondents expecting decreases in a category from the percentage 
expecting increases 
an index measuring expectations for increased profits rose to 
67 the highest level since the fourth quarter of 1984 and up from 
63 last quarter retailers were the most optimistic with a 
10point increase from the third quarter to 69 the index among 
wholesalers slipped to 63 from 64 and among manufacturers to 68 
from 70 
while the overall index of expectations for higher prices fell 
to 42 from 44 retailers are forecasting prices will climb during 
the years final quarter with their index rising from 39 to 45 
the report said 
in the category for employment prospects the index decreased to 
22 from 25 the retail sector index rose one point to 14 while

the head of shamrock holdings inc says 
the company will continue its unwanted bid for polaroid corp 
despite polaroids rejection of a sweetened 26 billion offer and 
proposal for a defensive stock issue 
polaroids board of directors on tuesday rejected shamrocks 42 
a share offer as inadequate and urged shareholders not to tender 
their stock 
the instant photography company also indicated in a filing with 
the securities and exchange commission that it had begun 
preliminary negotiations regarding a possible issuance of preferred 
stock to third parties a defensive move that would make a takeover 
more difficult 
in a letter to polaroids directors tuesday shamrock president 
stanley p gold said he was disappointed with the rejection which 
marked the second time polaroid has turned down an offer from 
shamrock a burbank califbased radio and television concern 
gold also reiterated shamrocks willingness to raise its offer 
further if it believed an increase was warranted 
we believe that your continued unwillingness to meet with us 
is contrary to the best interests of polaroids stockholders 
gold wrote 
he also claimed polaroids stock proposal was intended simply to 
impede the shamrock offer 
we will therefore make every effort to stop any such placement 
and will hold polaroid directors and management and the purchaser 
of any such securities responsible for participating in what we 
percieve is an unlawful scheme furthermore any such placement 
will not achieve its purpose since it will not divert us from our 
efforts to acquire polaroid gold said 
polaroid stock fell 112 a share to close at 4012 in new 
york stock exchange composite trading 
its a very good defensive move alex henderson a 
photography analyst with prudentialbache securities in new york 
said of the stock plan 
the question now is what is the next step he said the 
balls in shamrocks court now 
polaroid last month rejected an unsolicited offer from shamrock 
that would have paid stockholders 40 a share plus 40 percent of 
the eventual award in polaroids 57 billion patent infringement 
lawsuit against eastman kodak co analysts valued the offer at 
about 44 a share assuming a 1 billion settlement in the kodak 
case 
shamrock which is owned by the family of roy e disney nephew 
of the late animator walt disney has indicated that if its bid 
succeeded it would drop polaroids fledgling venture into 35mm 
film sell most of the companys undeveloped real estate narrow 
the companys manufacturing facilities and simplify polaroids 
research and development to focus on core businesses 
shamrocks offer was contingent on the invalidation of 
polaroids recent issuance of 97 million shares to a new employee 
stock ownership plan a move polaroid made early in its attempt to 
block shamrock 
the hostile bid values the company at 26 billion based on the 
62 million shares that would be outstanding if the issue of 97 
million shares is rolled back 
in a statement i macallister booth polaroid president and 
chief executive officer said the board was advised by its 
financial adviser shearson lehman hutton inc that the latest 
offer from shamrock was inadequate 
booth said polaroids own plan to restructure the company which 
includes massive job cuts would benefit stockholders more 
the foundation of our plan is a carefully targeted 
reorganization and streamlining of operations to focus more sharply 
on key growth areas booth said this will result in a 
strengthening of the companys competitive posture improved future 
operating prospects for the company and a 15 percent reduction in 
the number of polaroid employees in the united states 
booth said polaroid will save about 100 million a year as a 
result of its restructuring 
shamrock has filed suit in delaware where polaroid is 
incorporated to block the employee stock ownership plan a trial 
has been set for next month

a company that keeps tabs on the aircraft 
industry reports jet aircraft orders are booming as commercial 
airlines worldwide modernize their fleets with more fuelefficient 
aircraft 
the company forecast international says more than 3400 
aircraft worth 114 billion are either on order or on option to 
order most to be delivered over the next six years 
in 15 years of tracking aircraft developments ive never 
never seen a replacement cycle like this said company president 
edward m nebinger 
he said tuesday airlines are ordering new planes because they 
can save 20 to 25 percent on fuel costs with newer models with 
fuel being an airline companys largest operational expense 
nebinger also said the industry had weathered an era of 
cutthroat competition prompted partly by the deregulation of the 
industry a decade ago that has seen lessefficient carriers fold 
amid a series of mergers and consolidations 
the survivors are economically stronger he said 
newer models also reduce the risk of metal fatigue which 
literally can cause a plane to fall apart 
nebinger recalled this years aloha airlines incident when the 
entire front section of the cabin roof flew off in flight due to 
fatigue cracks that plane had made 90000 takeoffs and landings 
he said 
the aloha airlines incident and the recent crash of a 
1973vintage boeing 727 jet in dallas renewed questions about the 
reliability of aging aircraft nebinger said 
his figures indicate the average age of a boeing 707 is 203 
years while the average age of a boeing 727 is 154 years the 
average age of a mcdonnell douglas dc8 is 214 years and the 
average age of a dc10 is 12 years 
forecast international maintains computer data on aircraft 
inventories worldwide 
nebinger said jet planes are the last major items that the 
united states exports and his data provide encouraging news as the 
united states attempts to trim its trade deficit 
us manufacturers are expected to deliver 1738 new aircraft 
worth about 725 billion through 1994 of that 254 billion is 
destined for american airline companies while the remaining 471 
billion will go to foreign customers nebinger said 
but he also said european companies specifically airbus 
industrie are taking an everincreasing bite of the market away 
from us giants like boeing and mcdonnell douglas which 15 years 
ago claimed virtually the entire world market 
he said airbus industrie was expected to deliver 852 aircraft 
through 1995 while other european producers will deliver about 
575 much of those will go to countries other than the united 
states but about 128 billion will go to us operators he said

kohlberg kravis roberts amp co is marching into 
a takeover battle again against dart group corp offering 46 
billion to acquire kroger co in a rival bid that tops darts 
latest offer for the giant supermarket 
kohlberg kravis the new york investment firm that has outbid 
dart for three other corporations in recent years offered to pay 
5850 a share in cash and securities for kroger in a buyout aimed 
at keeping the companys present management at the helm 
kroger which refused to meet with kohlberg indicated it would 
review the offer but also would continue pursuing its own proposed 
restructuring plan 
kroger stock soared after the kohlberg kravis announcement 
closing at 5625 a share up 350 from monday in new york stock 
exchange composite trading 
kohlberg kravis offered to pay kroger shareholders 50 in cash 
and securities valued at 850 for each share they own 
dart the landover mdbased retailing company headed by the 
haft family has offered to pay 55 a share 43 cash and 
securities valued at 12 for each of krogers 786 million 
outstanding shares or about 432 billion 
kohlberg kravis in a letter sent to kroger chairman lyle 
everingham said its takeover plan would leave krogers 
headquarters in cincinnati and its current management in place 
the firm specializes in leveraged buyouts in which a company is 
acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with cash 
raised by the target companys cash flow or from the sale of its 
assets 
krogers restructuring plan valued at between 42 billion and 
46 billion was announced after learning that hafts had received 
federal clearance to buy at least 15 million in kroger stock 
the plan would pay 40 a share in cash plus securities valued 
at 8 and a remaining publicly traded stock worth between 5 and 
10 
analysts earlier suggested that kroger might turn to kohlberg 
kravis as a socalled white knight kohlberg kravis won a 
hostile takeover battle for beatrice cos in 1985 in which the 
hafts were a bidder and outbid the hafts for safeway stores in 
1986 and stop amp shop cos earlier this year 
kohlberg kravis apparently offered to act as a white knight but 
was rebuffed by kroger management the firm in its letter 
revealed that its request to discuss a buyout offer in a 
facetoface meeting with kroger advisers was turned down 
the entry of the kohlbergs brings a whole new level of 
seriousness to this said gary giblen a vice president with 
rotan mosle inc in houston 
linda morris analyst with provident national bank in 
pittsburgh said shareholders may lean toward the kkr proposal 
because it offers more cash 
furthermore because the hafts have a reputation for pushing 
companies into takeover battles and then making a big profit by 
selling their stock on those companies there was uncertainty over 
whether dart would pursue a costly takeover fight 
morris called the kkr package a fair offer and said kroger 
would be hard pressed to top it even if it joined up with another 
buyout firm 
morris speculated that kohlberg kravis was drawn to the deal 
partially because it wants to spend some of its considerable funds 
before the white house changes guard in november 
they are sitting on an attractive war chest she said 
adding that the federal governments attitude toward takeover 
activity could change once a new administration is elected 
in addition to bidding for kroger kohlberg kravis is engaged in 
a bidding war for publishing giant macmillan macmillan has agreed 
to a 236 billion buyout led by kkr but british publisher robert 
maxwell has made a competing 241 billion offer

interco inc says it will sell its ethan allen 
furniture subsidiary as part of a major restructuring program aimed 
at stopping a 266 billion hostile takeover from a washington 
dc investment group 
interco a major maker of furniture and apparel said tuesday 
that its board of directors rejected as inadequate a revised 
72ashare bid from cardinal acquisition corp headed by the 
brothers steven and mitchell rales of washington 
the board instead approved a previously announced restructuring 
it includes paying a special dividend of 25 per share to 
shareholders on nov 7 and selling the ethan allen unit 
interco suspended the regular quarterly dividend pending 
completion of the restructuring program which it valued at 76 a 
share 
but wall street seemed unimpressed in composite trading on the 
new york stock exchange interco shares closed down 112 to 
6925 tuesday 
interco said the board had been told by its financial adviser 
wasserstein perella and co that cardinal acquisitions latest 
offer was inadequate to shareholders 
recognizing the bright prospects for intercos leading 
consumer brands we believe it is not an opportune time to sell the 
company interco chairman harvey saligman said in a statement 
tuesday 
interco has rejected the rales overtures since they first 
offered in july to acquire the company by paying 64 for each of 
the 37 million shares outstanding the rales already own about 87 
percent of intercos shares 
on monday the rales made public a letter that had been sent to 
interco warning against an antitakeover restructuring the 
response was to an interco filing with the securities and exchange 
commission last week in which the company disclosed the possibility 
of a defensive restructuring 
interco said in its filing that it had retained a group of 
bankers to explore how to finance the restructuring 
selling ethan allen could make interco whose products also 
include london fog outerwear florsheim and converse shoes and 
broyhill furniture an unattractive acquisition target 
interco said that if cardinal acquisition was interested it 
would be provided the same information on ethan allen under the 
same terms and conditions as other potential buyers 
the rales had said in their letter that they wanted a chance to 
bid on assets that interco might put up for sale 
in order to avoid any unfortunate consequences should you 
decide to pursue asset sales we expect to be consulted well in 
advance so that we can evaluate the effect that any such sale would 
have on our offer the rales letter also said 
the group did not elaborate on what the unfortunate 
consequences might be but presumably it was warning of legal 
action or a shareholder proxy fight to block a restructuring plan 
that would spoil its strategy 
as part of the special dividend portion of its restructuring 
interco said it plans to pay shareholders of record on oct 13 14 
in cash and 11 in securities 
the board plans to announce additional distributions of cash 
securities or share repurchases as the company progresses with 
its divestiture and cost savings program interco said

a south africancontrolled gold conglomerate today 
offered to buy consolidated gold fields plc for about 49 billion 
in britains largestever takeover attempt but consolidated 
immediately rejected the bid 
consolidated said the cashandstock offer by minorco sa based 
in luxembourg and run by two south african mining companies was 
lacking financial justification and devoid of commercial 
logic 
the proposals announced show that minorco will be forced to 
begin dismembering gold fields both to help finance the bid and in 
recognition of the regulatory and commercial problems associated 
with south african control gold fields chairman rudolph agnew 
said in a statement 
the offer would be the largest takeover of a publicly held 
british company surpassing nestle sas 43 billion acquisiton of 
confectioner rowntree plc earlier this year 
minorco controlled by anglo american corp of south africa and 
de beers consolidated mines ltd currently owns 29 percent of 
consolidated gold fields on londons stock exchange gold fields 
shares quickly shot above the takeover offer price to 1408 pounds 
or 2365 a share up from tuesdays closing price of 1078 pounds 
or 1811 
minorco said the bid fits in with its strategy to become a 
worldwide natural resources group with direct operating control of 
its activities gold fields is one of the largest gold producers in 
the world 
the gold fields stake represents too large a proportion of 
minorcos assets to remain a passive investment the company said 
minorco said that if successful it would immediately begin 
negotiations on the sale of gold fields 38 percent holding in gold 
fields south africa and would review gold fields 493 percent 
stake in newmont mining corp of new york 
minorcos offer includes about 3192 in cash and one new 
minorco share for every two gold fields shares it doesnt already 
own 
a successful bid by minorco would result in an increase in the 
number of its own outstanding shares by about 47 percent and 
effectively reduce the combined holdings of the companys two major 
shareholders to a minority stake 
the companies issued a joint statement supporting minorcos bid

for food shelter and gasoline although inflation remained under 
control according to a government report released today 
meanwhile the government also reported that housing 
construction fell 33 percent last month and personal income rose a 
modest 02 percent the least in eight months consumer spending 
rose a brisker 05 percent 
in its consumer price index for august the labor department 
said last months increase was equivalent to an annual inflation 
rate of 52 percent the same as in july higher rents and gasoline 
prices in large part replaced food as the sharpest spurs to higher 
prices the department said 
shelter costs reflecting higher rates for hotel and motel 
rooms were up 06 percent the steepest gain in seven months food 
and beverage prices were up 05 percent last month while energy 
prices jumped 09 percent

in apartment construction more than offset a modest gain in 
singlefamily home building the decline followed gains of 14 
percent in july and 52 percent in june

in subsidy payments to farmers in an apparent indication of the 
droughts impact farm income excluding subsidies fell 32 billion

product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 30 percent in 
the apriljune period slower than the 34 percent expansion rate

been a more robust 39 percent

the second quarter one price measure tied to the gnp rose at the 
fastest pace in nearly six years and was more than triple the 
firstquarter rate 
the gnp deflator which reflects changes in buying patterns as 
well as prices rose at an annual rate of 55 percent in the second 
quarter compared with 17 percent in the first quarter it was the 
biggest jump since the third quarter of 1982

at an annual level of 399 trillion in the second quarter 291 
billion higher than the januarymarch period

profits by corporations surged 89 percent in the second quarter to 
an annual rate of 1627 billion up from a 25 percent annual rate 
of increase in the first quarter it was the most profitable

as more americans find themselves priced 
out of the housing market doityourself home building could get a 
taste of the good old days when thousands cut costs by raising 
their own roofs 
one company in the business miles homes believes the concept 
of sweat equity still has some attraction particularly among 
consumers with annual incomes of less than 60000 
the companys biggest years were in the late 1970s when it sold 
doityourself packages to as many as 2200 people a year many of 
whom lived in thenbooming texas 
having taken some hard licks during the recession miles is now 
happy to sell 800 homes a year but the company is optimistic about 
the future 
this is not our best year but we expect 1989 to improve 
said richard cornwall president and chief operating officer of 
miles homes 
the real heyday for doityourself home construction in this 
country was from 1900 to 1940 when two of the biggest kithome 
manufacturers were sears roebuck amp co and montgomery ward 
according to research published earlier this year by tab books inc 
of blue ridge summit pa 
sears alone sold more than 100000 kit homes from 1900 until the 
start of world war ii when all domestic construction came to a 
virtual standstill according to tab 
it wasnt until the late 1960s that a resurgence in the 
doityourself attitude and an upswing in construction costs caused 
kit homes to become popular again tab says 
since that time the industry has grown to the point where about 
20 percent of the new singlefamily homes built annually in the 
united states have some degree of owner involvement according to 
the national association of home builders 
the build your own home directory says about 138000 americans 
built their own houses last year 
currently there are more than 2000 kithouse manufacturers and 
dealers nationwide according to the tab research 
although cornwall admits miles share of the market is small he 
said miles is one of the few companies in the country offering a 
complete package for the doityourselfer land evaluations 
blueprints materials construction loan money and mortgage 
financing 
under new owner peter degeorge who paid meriden connbased 
insilco corp about 100 million for the company in april miles 
has pulled in its territorial reins so that its principal markets 
are in the midwest and along the eastern seaboard 
cornwall said miles makes much of its money off the package of 
precut materials used in the construction process but the 
companys financing arm also profits when customers make good on 
the threeyear construction loans that are at the heart of the 
sales pitch 
dave dunnigan publicity director for miles said 65 percent of 
the customers are firsttime homebuyers many of them with annual 
incomes of 25000 to 60000 a year who often do not have enough 
savings to make a big down payment 
land costs not included miles will finance the purchase price 
of its homes which range from 25000 to 65000 for up to 36 
months around market rates no down payment on materials is 
required but an appraisal fee of 250 is required upon credit 
approval payments on the threeyear loan cover interest only and 
at the end of the three years the construction loan balance is due 
in full and usually is paid through the use of a mortgage which 
can be obtained from miles 
weve frontended so much money out of our pocket the 
customers are usually in a good position said scott gerber 
marketing manager but most people will not come out ahead unless 
they are involved in building it 
ideally if the customer does enough of the construction and the 
home is built in a location that has value the result will be a 
structure that is worth more than it cost to build it 
but as gerber said we have people whose expectations arent 
met 
indeed in april 1978 the federal trade commission ordered miles 
to stop making false misleading and deceptive claims related 
to the construction process for instance the company used to 
advertise that the only skill required for assembly was the 
ability to drive a nail or use a hammer 
dunnigan said the company has long since made the corrections 
and no other action has been taken by the ftc 
now when customers do not come out ahead it is usually because 
they added a luxury item like a whirlpool bath that was not called 
for in the blueprints 
only a handful of people have walked away from their houses as 
they were under construction gerber said those who have 
frustrations in the process can turn to company experts for advice 
the sweat by the way still produces some equity the council 
of american building officials says consumers can cut home 
construction expenses by 25 percent to 50 percent depending on how 
much labor they do themselves

today on the chicago board of trade in a technical recovery from 
the low levels of the past few days grain futures were mixed 
active european markets for soybean products and a large 
purchase of us soybean oil by pakistan added further support to 
soybean prices analysts siad 
wheat and corn futures were mixed in early trading with the 
strength provided by a growing lineup of export bids reports of 
quality problems with some newly harvested illinois corn were 
another bullish factor analysts said 
but overall gains were limited by selling linked to the 
advancing corn and soybean harvest said walter spilka a grain 
market analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
were slowly getting into the harvesting season and these 
markets have a hard time sustaining any momentum to the upside as 
long as buyers know that just around the corner theres going to be 
some good supplies coming onto the market he said

with the contract for delivery in september at 406 a bushel corn

higher costs for food shelter and gasoline 
sent consumer prices up 04 percent in august the government said 
today as the effects of the drought in the farm belt began to ease 
the august increase equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 
52 percent was the same as in july higher rents and gasoline 
prices in large part replaced food as the sharpest spurs to higher 
prices 
food and beverage prices were up 05 percent last month 
compared to 06 percent and 09 percent gains in june and july 
respectively 
shelter costs reflecting higher rates for hotel and motel 
rooms were up 06 percent the steepest gain in seven months 
energy prices jumped 09 percent on a 30 percent boost in 
gasoline prices their sharpest gain in a year the labor 
department said however that gasoline prices were still slightly 
below the level of august 1987 and were 26 percent below their peak 
of march 1981 
the higher gasoline prices offset decreases for all household 
fuels heating oil costs were down 08 percent natural gas prices 
were off 12 percent electricity costs slipped 02 percent 
the lower home energy prices somewhat offset 04 percent 
increases in rents and repair expenses and a 05 percent gain in 
mortgage costs 
increases in the food shelter and energy components accounted 
for over fourfifths of the august advance in consumer prices 
said the labor department 
excluding those three areas which account for twothirds of the 
goods and services consumers spend money on prices rose just 02 
percent last month compared to a 03 percent jump in july 
the overall increase is marginally higher than in recent 
months but not dramatically so given the monthtomonth 
variability of this inflation measure said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
grocery store prices continued to climb but at a slower pace 
than in july those prices were up 08 percent last month compared 
to a 14 percent jump in july that had been their largest gain in 
4 years 
about 90 percent of the august advance was due to price 
increases for items that were adversely affected by the drought 
fruits and vegetables cereal and bakery products poultry and 
eggs the department said 
fruit and vegetable prices rose 13 percent after being up 29 
percent in the preceding month they have jumped a total of 106 
percent over the last year 
cereal and bakery product prices were up 16 percent reflecting 
higher prices for wheat oats and eggs the august increase was the 
largest since january 1981 
the governments calculation of prices for meats poultry fish 
and eggs rose 05 percent as gains of 84 percent for eggs and 21 
percent for poultry were partially offset by declines in the costs 
of beef pork and seafood 
restaurant meal prices gained 03 percent while alcoholic 
beverage prices jumped 01 percent 
the steepest price drop overall was in apparel down 16 percent 
in august and 26 percent from june through august after rising 38 
percent in the years first five months 
the government said unusually large endofseason discounts for 
womens clothing were responsible for most of the decline 
laundry and dry cleaning costs meanwhile jumped 08 percent 
their largest gain since february 1985 
new car prices rose 02 percent while used car costs and 
automobile financing expenses were up 15 percent each automobile 
insurance costs were up 08 percent and have climbed at an annual 
rate of 89 percent so far this year 
the august increases left the consumer price index at 1190 
compared with 1185 in july and 1144 in august 1987 that means a 
hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 in 198284 would have 
cost 119 last month 
for the first eight months of 1988 retail prices were up at an 
annual rate of 46 percent compared to a 44 percent gain for all 
of 1987

gold prices slumped as much as 10 an ounce 
wednesday and bullion dealers said it was poised to fall below 400 
an ounce for the first time in 18 months 
the dollar strengthened in quiet trading boosted by a few large 
corporate orders 
bullion dealers said bearish sentiment was pushing gold down 
eased concern about inflationary trends worldwide has depressed the 
metal which investors historically have used as a hedge against 
inflation 
interest rate hikes in late august aimed at curbing inflation 
have broken the bull trend in gold and forced a change in 
peoples perceptions said analyst julian baring of brokers james 
capel and co 
one dealer said the impetus is there for it to go lower but 
a partcorrection is still likely before it breaks through 400 
dollars 
a correction is market terminology for a temporary move in the 
opposite direction

dollars determined to avoid taking big positions ahead of the 
saturday meeting of finance ministers from the leading 
industrialized democracies

than another reaffirmation of the ministers desire for stable 
exchange rates 
one chief corporate dealer said a few big orders out of the

a south african mining conglomerate launched the 
largest takeover bid in british history wednesday with a 49 
billion offer for consolidated gold fields plc 
consolidated which controls 8 percent of the worlds annual 
gold production quickly rejected the bid which sparked concerns 
about a south african monopoly in the gold mining business 
the offer by minorco sa for the 71 percent stake it doesnt 
already own in londonbased consolidated would significantly 
strengthen south africas dominance over the western worlds gold 
production 
consolidated is the worlds second largest gold producer behind 
south africas anglo american corp which controls minorco along 
with de beers consolidated mines ltd 
minorco offered 1306 pounds 2194 worth of cash and stock 
for each of the shares it doesnt already own minorco already 
holds 29 percent of consolidateds approximately 213 million shares 
outstanding excluding options a stake bought mainly in 1981 
on londons stock exchange consolidateds shares shot above the 
takeover offer price to finish at 14 pounds 2352 a share up 
from tuesdays closing price of 1078 pounds 1811 
if successful the bid would surpass britains largest completed 
takeover nestle sas 43 billion acquisition of confectioner 
rowntree plc earlier this year according to the industry 
publication mergers and acquistions 
the offer for consolidated immediately sparked a controversy 
even though anglo american and de beers said they would relinquish 
control of the publicly held luxembourgbased minorco and minorco 
said it plans to sell consolidateds south african interests 
it would mean that anglo american would control the gold 
industry said one mining analyst at a london investment firm 
who didnt want to be identified 
the analyst said he expected the offer to be reviewed by the 
british government through its department of trade and industry 
tim read director of mining at the london investment firm smith 
new court ltd noting that minorco would be gaining control of 
substantial gold mining operations on other continents said in 
terms of the dominance of gold mining you can make a judgment for 
yourself 
sixty percent of the worlds gold is mined in south africa the 
acquisition would raise south african control to about 70 percent 
of the noncommunist worlds production analysts said 
analysts expressed concern that such a takeover might hamper 
consolidateds businesses 
there may be a problem with local governments and 
shareholders resentment to south african control said rob 
davies a mining analyst with shearson lehman hutton securities in 
london 
south africas system of apartheid which sustains white 
minority rule over a black majority has many opponents around the 
world 
consolidated which has been the subject of takeover rumors in 
recent years described the bid as lacking financial 
justification and devoid of commercial logic 
the proposals announced show that minorco will be forced to 
begin dismembering gold fields both to help finance the bid and in 
recognition of the regulatory and commercial problems associated 
with south african control said consolidated gold fields 
chairman rudolph agnew 
minorco said the bid fits in with its strategy to become a 
worldwide natural resources group with direct operating control of 
its activities 
its current consolidated stake represents too large a 
proportion of minorcos assets to remain a passive investment 
the company said 
minorco said that if its bid succeeds it would immediately 
begin negotiations to sell consolidateds 38 percent holding in 
gold fields south africa and would review the targets 493 percent 
stake in newmont mining corp of the united states 
the stockswap part of minorcos bid would result in an increase 
in the number of its own outstanding shares and effectively reduce 
the combined holdings of the companys two major shareholders to a 
minority stake anglo americans holding would shrink to 266 
percent from 391 percent and de beers to 143 percent from 21 
percent 
the wealthy south african oppenheimer family holds unspecified 
stakes in the two companies 
consolidated which traces its ancestry back to the 19th century 
british industrialist cecil rhodes has built up big stakes in 
mining ventures around the world it has diverse operations and 
investments in britain north america africa and australia 
including crushed stone and coal production 
its aftertax profit rose 295 percent to 2125 million pounds 
357 million on revenue of 123 billion pounds 21 billion in 
the year ended june 30 
minorco holds stakes in a number of companies dealing with 
investment banking commodities trading industrial operations and 
extraction industries primarily gold mining 
its operating profit rose 58 percent to 104 million dollars in 
the year ended june 30 it doesnt report a revenue figure

blue mountain arts inc which is battling 
greeting card industry giant hallmark cards inc over the look of 
its cards on wednesday asked the us supreme court to deny 
hallmarks request for a review of the case 
hallmark has asked the us supreme court to review an 
injunction affirmed by the us 10th circuit court of appeals in 
denver that prohibits the kansas citybased company from producing 
and marketing the cards that resemble blue mountain arts cards 
pending a trial on the dispute 
but blue mountain arts submitted a plea to the high court to 
reject the proposed review and accused hallmark of trying to delay 
the trial now scheduled for jan 2 1989 
hallmark is engaging in piracy not competition said bob 
gall general manager for the boulderbased blue mountain arts 
like a pirate ship with a hundred guns hallmarks army of 
lawyers are trying to prove that might makes right 
the dispute developed when hallmark produced a line of cards 
like blue mountain arts both featured watercolor decorations and 
long freeverse poetry with mostly personal messages 
blue mountain brought a lawsuit against hallmark for copying its 
product and after testimony in a denver federal court the 
injunction was issued against hallmark the appeals court in denver 
later upheld the injunction pending the scheduled trial but 
hallmark wants the us supreme court to step into the case 
its request for the action claimed that the injunction was the 
equivalent of granting blue mountain arts the exclusive rights to a 
particular artistic style of card arguing that the decision was in 
direct conflict with the constitution and with the copyright act 
hallmark argues that it may counterfeit the appearance of 
competitive products with impunity blue mountain said in its 
filing contrary to hallmarks assertion hallmark does not need 
to copy blue mountains cards in order to compete 
gall said the request was mailed to the us supreme court on 
wednesday 
hallmark spokesman steve doyal said the companys general 
response was a reflection of its petition 
our petition is simple and straightforward he said we 
question the constitutionality of granting blue mountain perpetual 
exclusive rights to an idea or artistic style 
they are seeking a monopoly and we believe that is unfair and 
anticompetitive he said 
he said the company sees the issue as completely separate from 
the scheduled trial for which its attorneys are preparing at this 
time

on the eve of major talks on the worlds economic 
problems former west german chancellor willy brandt made a strong 
plea wednesday to reduce the debt of third world countries due to 
reach 12 trillion by the end of the year 
what sense does it make that for years now there has been 
more money flowing from the south to the north as interest 
payments than new money flowing out of the north to the south 
he asked 
he called it a reverse blood transfusion from patient to 
doctor the flow has been estimated at 30 billion annually in 
recent years 
traditionally poor developing countries like the united 
states 150 years ago have received more money in new loans than 
they were paying as interest in this century the rich countries 
are in the northern hemisphere the poor ones largely in the south 
the world bank and its sister organization the international 
monetary fund are holding their joint annual meetings this year in 
berlin though formal sessions start on thursday delegates have 
been arriving all week and informal contacts are taking place 
brandt said not much can be expected from the current meetings 
because of the presidential campaign in the united states 
given the situation i think the europeans would be well 
advised to take the initiative themselves he said 
michel camdessus the frenchman who is the funds managing 
director saw separate problems for rich and poor countries 
we still have serious problems to surmount especially the 
large payments imbalances among the biggest trading nations and 
the debt burdens of so many low and middleincome developing 
countries which are struggling to restore adequate levels of 
growth he said 
brandt emphasized what he saw as the responsibility of rich 
countries toward poorer ones he endorsed the criticism that the 
fund sets austere conditions for its loans that cause hardship in 
poor countries 
both brandt and camdessus spoke at a public meeting sponsored by 
a foundation called development and peace of which brandt is 
chairman at the age of 74 brandt also heads the socialist 
international a grouping of socialist and social democratic 
parties from many countries

wednesday on the chicago board of trade but corn finished mixed in 
a day of lackluster trading dominated by technical factors

upham amp co in new york

pm cdt the september soybean contract expired at 827 a

the market after tuesdays sharp gains spilka said 
the corn market enjoyed some spillover buying from the soybean 
pit but the gains were slight 
at the close wheat was cent lower to 1 cent higher with the

the head of japans central bank denied wednesday 
that japan was being pressured by its allies to keep interest rates 
low and said the bank would raise its key discount rate whenever it 
felt such a move was necessary 
satoshi sumita governor of the bank of japan made the comment 
at a news conference when he was asked about market speculation 
that japans benchmark rate was being held down because of 
international pressure 
sumita said the bank would not hesitate to take action on 
interest rates to defend the prevailing price stability in the 
country 
there had been expectations that the bank of japan might push up 
its discount rate following increases in key lending rates in the 
united states and some western european countries but the bank 
held the rate at 25 percent 
the currency markets briefly pushed up the yen against the 
dollar following sumitas remarks but then the yen slipped back 
people at first thought the bank of japan might raise the 
discount rate and sold dollars said one dealer on further 
reflection they realized that sumita didnt say anything he hadt 
said before

brazil will sign an unprecedented 82 billion 
financial package with its international commercial bank creditors 
it was announced wednesday 
the deal to be signed thursday was billed by citicorp as a 
possible landmark in the third world debt crisis a preliminary 
accord was reached in july 
brazil is the biggest third world debtor with a foreign debt of 
more than 120 billion about one tenth of all third world 
external debt which is estimated at 12 trillion 
the mediumterm package is the largest ever assembled on the 
international markets said william r rhodes vice president of 
citicorp 
rhodes chairman of the 16bank committee that negotiates with 
brazil in the name of creditor banks worldwide added wednesday 
that this is the first package since the debt crisis began in 
august 1982 to combine new money with substantial debt reduction 
in that respect rhodes said the brazil package may point 
the way to the future in the management of the debt crisis 
brazilian finance minister mailson da nobrega was quoted by 
citicorp as saying that before withdrawing the first installment 
under the new money agreements possibly next month brazil will 
be current on all interest payments to its commercial bank 
creditors 
brazil suspended interest payments on its foreign bank debt for 
about a year starting in february 1987 and has beem making partial 
payments this year 
thursdays package includes 52 billion in new money to help 
brazil cover its external financing needs for 1987 1988 and the 
first half of 1989 citicorp said said this includes 36 billion 
in cofinancing and parallel financing with the world bank 1 
billion in newmoney bonds and a 600 million mediumterm trade 
facility 
the package also includes a multiyear restructuring agreement 
covering about 62 billion of brazils approximately 67 billion of 
medium and longterm debt to foreign commercial banks 
it further includes 15 billion in trade and interbank 
facilities through which international commercial banks will 
continue to extend shortterm trade and interbank lines of credit 
brazil will pay the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
1316 percent on the newmoney credits the bonds and the 
restructured debt the libor rate fluctuates daily and currently 
stands at around 85 percent 
the 62 billion of restructured debt includes private and public 
sector loans maturing from jan 1 1987 to dec 31 1993 it will be 
rescheduled over 20 years with the final maturity in 2007 
principal payments on the restructured debt will begin in 1995 
citicorp said 
the restructured debt and some of the newmoney facilities are 
eligible for conversion to investments under a brazilian 
debtforequity program creditors could thus become investors in 
brazil and their converted loans on being transformed into 
investments would reduce brazils foreign debt load 
separately wednesday in brasilia president jose sarney 
officially announced brazil had ended its foreign debt moratorium

kohlberg kravis amp roberts cos unsolicited 
464 billion bid for the kroger co supermarket chain underscores 
the notion that leveraged buyout firms are no longer interested in 
just friendly deals 
the leveraged buyout transaction typically has hinged on 
cooperation with a management that ultimately will stay on to run a 
company long after the deal wizards have finished their work but 
in the push to do deals some lbo partnerships might abandon a 
touch of their previous gentility 
hamilton james a managing director at dlj securities corp 
noted wednesday that the level of aggressiveness in the buyout 
industry has been on the rise recently 
people are out beating the bushes and not waiting for the 
phone to ring he said they are more aggressive in terms of 
the prices they are willing to pay and the amount of risk they are 
willing to take 
the line between friendly and unfriendly encounters has fused 
from distinct blackandwhite into a murky grey 
something that might start out looking unfriendly may end up 
being a white knight noted one lbo partner who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
with more money available for deals he predicted there will be 
more circumstances where the firms capable of doing the larger 
lbos are stepping up to the plate and doing things in a more public 
fashion 
since its founding in 1976 the privately held kkr has 
spearheaded the growing popularity of leveraged buyouts in which a 
purchase is made with mostly borrowed money that is repaid with 
funds from the target companys operations or the sale of its 
assets 
kkr has amassed an estimated 56 billion that can be used as 
equity to leverage roughly seven times that amount the 
partnership which controls corporate giants ranging from beatrice 
cos to stop amp shop most often has entered into friendly 
transactions 
despite the unsolicited nature of kkrs bid for kroger analysts 
are reluctant to characterise the overture as hostile 
the harddriving new york partnership wasnt the first one to 
tee the company up to put it into play said dljs james 
marylands haft family did that with a bid of 436 billion a 
day before kkr appeared on the scene and kroger directors also 
stirred the pot by stating that they were considering a 
restructuring 
the company already was on the auction block kkr didnt put 
it there james said in addition kkr has yet to try to force a 
tender offer without board approval 
you will not see firms that want to be major players in the 
lbo industry doing anything unfriendly because that would be bad 
for the management in the next deal said alberto cribiore a 
partner in the lbo and investment firm clayton amp dubilier inc 
kkr is becoming much more of a financial company than an lbo 
company its a different kind of animal he said 
the kroger bid is similar to kkrs pursuit of the chicagobased 
beatrice foods conglomerate kkr came on the scene uninvited and 
continued to pressure the board until beatrice directors finally 
accepted in what the industry dubbed a bear hug 
fortune magazine reported in july that both henry kravis and 
george roberts privately argued in favor of launching a hostile 
tender offer for beatrice while awaiting word from the companys 
board on what it would do opposing such a move was jerome kohlberg 
jr who has left the firm amid talk that he was dismayed not only 
by the size of the deals the partnership was spinning but also by 
the growing agerssiveness of his younger partners 
analysts note that kroger could be forced to capitulate in the 
same way that beatrice did 
krogers options are limited and a higher offer by them is 
unlikely said linda morris a analyst at provident national bank 
in philadelphia 
she thinks kroger could be pushed into the arms of another 
leveraged buyout firm namely odyssey partners or gibbons green 
van amerongen ltd both of which have interests in supermarkets 
so far there havent been two leveraged buyout firms in a 
bidding war against each other but we havent seen a lot of 
things yet morris said 
the lbo firms are just another player out there that has the 
capacity to bid for companies it just adds to the list thats 
already there she said

in calling for a federal inquiry the consumer federation of 
america joins twas flight attendants union the independent 
federation of flight attendants which made a similar request last 
month 
bill mosley a spokesman for the department of transportation 
said wednesday that no decision has been made regarding the 
requests 
consumers hold almost 500 million in unsecured obligations of 
twa in the form of prepaid unused tickets mark cooper director 
of research for the consumer federation said in a statement 
as a group consumers are the secondlargest current creditors 
of twa just behind travel agents and tour operators he said 
if twa were to file for bankruptcy which cooper claims is a 
distinct possibility if the 3048 million privatization goes 
forward consumers would have virtually no redress because of the 
fragmented nature of their claims he said 
this is a unique risk placed upon the consuming public by 
the special business practices of the airline industry requiring 
full payment far in advance for many of its most attractive product 
offerings cooper said 
after running up huge amounts of debt the icahnled group now 
proposes to take all its money and then some out of twa leave the 
company with absolutely no equity and leave the airline on the 
brink of bankruptcy cooper said 
in addition consumers would have claims against the airline in 
the form of unused frequent flier credits the group noted 
the group also said some consumers are virtual captives of 
twa because of its domination in several cities such as st 
louis where 80 percent of all flights are operated by twa 
the failure of the airline or a significant reduction in 
service would have a devastating impact on these consumers who have 
few alternatives for air travel cooper said 
the consumer federation of america believes that the 
department of transportation has the authority and in light of the 
facts the obligation to open a fitness evaluation of twa the 
statement said 
we are still looking at it and deciding what to do said 
mosley the dot spokesman we are expecting some decision fairly 
soon 
in its own attempt to stop icahns privatization plan the twa 
pilots union filed suit in new york state supreme court on sept 7 
to stop the deal which won shareholder approval the same day 
twa declined comment on the consumer groups action until the 
attorneys have more time to study it they are not going to 
comment said twa spokesman robert blattner

the cows which come from nine states 
each heifer is expected to have about five calves during her 
lifetime nichol said after giving birth this fall they will be 
artificially inseminated to bear the next generation of holsteins 
he said 
the shipment represents the type of trade that will help 
pennsylvania set new food and agricultural export records said

since early last year republic national bank of new york quoted

at any point during the day 
preciousmetals strategists have attributed the recently

bullion as a hedge against inflation which appears to remain tame 
in the united states because of federal reserve pressure to tighten 
interest rates 
the key is how long can the fed can control the inflation 
rate said sharon ziemian assistant vice president for precious 
metals at citibank in new york weve got to see some numbers 
that show the fed has started to lose its grip before gold turns 
around 
some strategists predicted gold would fall to as low as 380 an 
ounce in the next few weeks

history publishing copying printing and computer services to 
soviet private citizens according to an announcement at the soviet 
consulate 
in addition the capitalistic partnership will sell computers 
audiovisual and related products cultural services advertising 
services souvenirs and books in the soviet union the announcement 
said 
california businessman martin b lopata chief executive of the 
american side of the project said the idea for the venture came 
from the soviets last winter following their new policy of 
glasnost and perestroika or openness and restructuring 
before recent changes in soviet law no document could be 
commercially printed without a censors permit and an official 
document number 
lopata said the deal was agreed to by the soviets as an 
experiment with plans to start in moscow in january leningrad 
next summer and kiev a few months later 
in a separate deal alphagraphics printshops of the future a 
tucson arizbased chain of more than 250 print shops said 
wednesday that it would announce on thursday its plans to open its 
first two shops in moscow this winter

gorbachevreagan moscow summit meeting earlier this year when 
both sides reiterated their strong support for development of 
economic ties between the two sides said soviet deputy consul 
general gennadiy i zolotov who sat next to lopata 
its also the result of the ussrs new joint project

average soviet citizen rubles as well as dollars will be 
accepted as payment

chemical plant in southern california until he sold out last year 
he said he was approached in february by a staff member of 
goskomizdat the soviet publishing and printing committee

gold futures prices fell for the sixth straight day wednesday on 
the commodity exchange in new york and settled below 400 a troy 
ounce for the first time in more than 19 months due to slack 
investor demand 
with the latest economic statistics still indicating only modest 
inflation gold futures could fall as low as 385 a troy ounce 
before finding many buyers analysts said 
on other markets wednesday other precious metals futures also 
declined copper futures were lower livestock and meat futures 
were higher energy futures were mixed grains and soybeans were 
mixed and stockindex futures advanced 
gold for delivery in october settled at 39920 a troy ounce 7 
below tuesdays final price gold futures last closed below 400 on 
feb 18 1987 
the market did break that psychological barrier today and the 
next stop in in the 385388 area said peter cardillo an 
analyst in new york with josephthal amp co 
the gold market pressured for the last four months by a 
stronger dollar and only slight inflation sold off in reaction to 
the governments report that consumer prices rose just 04 percent 
in august analysts said 
the labor department said the increase in the consumer price 
index was equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 52 percent 
the same as in july 
the commerce departments report that americans personal income 
rose a modest 02 percent in august compared with 07 percent in 
july also was bearish for gold prices analysts said 
gold is considered a good investment hedge against rising 
prices so investor demand for gold tends to rise and fall with 
expectations of inflation 
the latest batch of economic statistics are generally 
noninflationary said james steel metals market analyst with 
refco inc in new york there appears really to be no worry of 
inflation therefore the precious metals are coming off 
steel said the extremely bearish tone of the precious metals 
markets was evident in the narrowing gap between gold and platinum 
prices platinum almost always trades at least 100 above gold but 
on wednesday platinum for october delivery on the new york 
mercantile exchange settled at 48510 a troy ounce 980 below 
tuesdays final price and just 8590 above the october gold price 
silver settled 75 cents to 8 cents lower on the commodity 
exchange with september at 6177 a troy ounce 
copper futures declined markedly on the commodity exchange amid 
profittaking but the fundamentals of tight supplies and steady 
demand remained strongly bullish steel said 
there hasnt been any fundamental news to change anybodys mind 
about copper he said 
copper settled 95 cent to 260 cents lower with the spot 
september contract at 1123 a pound and the more active december 
contract at 101 a pound 
most cattle futures moved lower on the chicago mercantile 
exchange pressured by continued weakness in the cash markets due 
to slack demand analysts said 
hog futures were mixed with prices for nearmonth deliveries 
steady to lower on speculation that cash prices would be pressured 
thursday by large hog marketings 
live cattle were 45 cent lower to 17 cent higher with october 
at 6910 cents a pound feeder cattle were 33 cent to 75 cent 
lower with september at 7975 cents a pound hogs were 32 cent 
lower to 28 cent higher with october at 3877 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 05 cent to 55 cent lower with february 
at 5065 cents a pound 
energy futures finished mixed on the new york mercantile 
exchange with higher prices for gasoline and nearmonth deliveries 
of crude oil reflecting concerns about about falling inventories 
and the outcome of an opec pricing committee meeting next week 
analysts said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents lower to 19 
cents higher with november at 1456 a barrel heating oil was 23 
cent lower to 18 cent higher with october at 4109 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 30 cent to 101 cents higher with october at 
4535 cents a gallon 
soybean and wheat futures prices finished higher on the chicago 
board of trade but corn was mixed in a day of lackluster trading 
dominated by technical factors analysts said 
wheat settled unchanged to cent higher with september at 405 
a bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with september 
at 276 a bushel oats were 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with 
september at 249 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 7 cents higher 
with november at 837 a bushel 
stock index futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange

eastern airlines machinists union overwhelmingly 
voted down a costcutting proposal described by a company 
spokeswoman wednesday as our best offer 
there were 7596 no ballots or 982 percent against the 
offer that union local president charles bryan said would cut 
salaries by 56 percent the tally compiled wednesday also showed 
nine void votes and 90 ballots favoring the offer 
the union represents about 9500 mechanics and groundsupport 
workers bryan said 
it makes it crystalclear that the membership were very 
concerned by the number who turned out said bryan for 81 
percent to show up to vote is an unprecedented turnout 
the offer was unacceptable because it would reduce pay sick 
days vacation time and medical benefits he said 
eastern just kind of gutted what had been accomplished over 
the last 4550 years said bryan who said he expected contract 
talks would now be resumed 
we believe it was our best offer eastern spokeswoman karen 
ceremsak said of the proposal offered in july 
eastern estimated the 161 million in wage concessions sought in 
the proposal amounted to 10 to 20 percent of salaries and accused 
union leaders of stalling contract talks that began nine months ago 
the predictable defeat of the contract proposal by more than 
98 percent should send another strong message to the national 
mediation board that the two parties are at an impasse said tom 
matthews senior eastern vice president of human resources 
while negotiations are stalled easterns losses continue in 
the meantime eastern has been forced to sell assets lay off 
employees and reduce service in order to survive matthews said 
in the latest round of cuts eastern cut service to 14 cities in 
late august and eliminated about 4000 jobs or about 12 percent of 
its work force on sept 10 
eastern which has lost about 1 billion in the past decade has 
repeatedly sought to have an impasse declared that would happen if 
federal mediator harry bickford a veteran of solving union 
disputes at the miamibased carrier told the board he could do no 
more 
if the board agreed both parties would have a chance for 
arbitration if either party declined a 30day cooling off period 
would kick in if no resolution were reached in that time the 
union would be free to strike and eastern could impose its 
conditions 
while the board has caused the eastern situation to drag on 
for almost one year matthews said it released pan am and its 
transport workers union from federal mediation monday after only 
eight months of negotiations and less than two weeks of mediation 
clearing the way for arbitration or the possibility of a negotiated 
settlement within 30 days 
but bryan charged frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent 
firm texas air corp hoped for a strike as he has in the past 
bryan contended that lorenzo aims to give eastern assets to sister 
carrier continental airlines which is largely nonunion 
absolutely not true ms ceremsak said what we do want is 
a 30day coolingoff period we believe the only way we can reach a 
settlement is if we have a deadline without a deadline theres no 
incentive for the iam to settle 
eastern is also negotiating a contract with its pilots union 
which with the flight attendants union took 20 percent wage cuts 
in 1986 the carrier contends the cuts are needed to restore 
eastern to profitability bryan who blames the companys money 
troubles on poor management said the union offered to take a 
oneyear pay freeze

northrop corp on wednesday announced it had 
adopted a poison pill defense against hostile takeover 
attempts although it is not aware of any potential suitors 
in the event of a hostile takeover move the plan would allow 
northrop shareholders to buy additional northrop stock or stock in 
the potential buyer at a 50 percent discount 
such plans in common use for several years are called poison 
pills because they dilute the value of a potential buyers 
holdings thus making the target company harder to swallow 
the board noted that the action was not taken in response to 
any acquisition attempt and the board is not aware of any effort 
to acquire control of northrop according to a news release by 
the aerospace and electronics company 
rather the board considered such a plan prudent because of a 
spate of corporate takeovers in recent years the company said

multimillionaire brothers nelson bunker hunt and 
william herbert hunt each filed for personal bankruptcy protection 
wednesday to avoid having to post a 225 million bond required for 
appealing a federal jury verdict against them 
a spokesman for the hunts said the brothers decided to seek 
chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from creditors to keep 
minpeco sa which won the verdict against them from beginning 
foreclosure proceedings on their personal assets until the appeal 
could be made 
the jury decided aug 20 in new york that the two hunts and 
brother lamar hunt must pay more than 130 million in damages for 
conspiring to corner the worlds silver market in the late 1970s 
ruining the investments of minpeco the peruvian governments 
mineral marketing company 
the hunts maintain that peru as the secondlargest producer of 
silver in the world could only be helped as the silver price rose 
tom whitaker executive vice president for the hunt energy 
corp said the decision to seek chapter 11 protection stemmed from 
a court requirement that they post a 225 million bond to appeal 
the verdict 
the hunts said raising 225 million in an extremely depressed 
economy would force a fire sale of assets and also would 
result in nonpayment to business and personal creditors 
bunker and herbert believe the jury verdict in new york is so 
unjust that they elected to seek chapter 11 protection of the 
united states bankruptcy court in order to insure their ability to 
continue their businessses while at the same time appealing the 
silver case whitaker said in a prepared statement 
the jury trial is the first step of a long civil process and 
i expect that the verdict will be reversed or substantially 
modified and we will continue to work to that end bunker hunt 
said in a statement released by whitaker 
wednesdays filing was the latest chapter in the hunts furious 
struggle to keep alive what once was one of the worlds wealthiest 
legacies 
the texas brothers inherited a fortune from their late father 
texas oilman hl hunt but heavy losses in silver oil and real 
estate had cut the brothers wealth from more than 5 billion to an 
estimated 1 billion according to published reports 
last friday a federal bankruptcy judge had approved a 
reorganization plan to settle 750 million in loans and pull the 
trust funds of the two hunts and their brother lamar out of chapter 
11 bankruptcy 
the plan called for turning their financially strapped penrod 
drilling co which is not in bankruptcy into a corporation 
jointly controlled by creditor banks 
that plan was part of a settlement aimed at ending litigation 
between the hunts and the banks which they claimed were trying to 
force them out of business by refusing to renegotiate 15 billion 
in business loans 
the agreement approved by us bankruptcy judge harold 
abramson also called for the brothers to pay 538 million in cash 
and surrender real estate in texas kentucky and arizona in 
exchange for 200 million in debts 
placid oil co owned by the hunt trust estates also is in 
chapter 11 bankruptcy the trust estates had offered in july to pay 
8035 million to placids lenders including 6635 million in 
cash 
a proposed placid reorganization plan called for the sale of the 
hunt brothers interest in thanksgiving tower in downtown dallas 
it also would require the brothers to come up with 250 million in 
cash by borrowing on their successful petroleum properties 
wednesdays bankruptcy filings will not affect the 
reorganization of placid oil or the hunt brothers trust estates 
whitaker said

a supreme court justice wednesday temporarily 
lifted a court order blocking a strike by rail workers against the 
chicago amp north western railroad but a union official said he knew 
of no immediate strike plans 
justice john paul stevens granted an emergency request by the 
employees and their union to suspend a federal judges march 16 
order temporarily enjoining the strike 
stevens stay will remain in effect until the high court acts on 
a pending appeal in the case 
but james brunkenhoefer national legislative director of the 
united transportation union said late wednesday that he knew of no 
union plans to go on strike over the proposed sale of 208 miles of 
the rail line in wisconsin workers fear the loss of more than 200 
jobs if the sale takes place 
officials of campnw a leading midwestern freight hauler that also 
runs commuter trains serving 40000 people a day in chicagos 
suburbs also predicted there would be no strike as a result of 
wednesdays ruling 
the effect of the ruling is difficult to determine at this 
time campnw spokesman james m foote said in a telephone interview 
late wednesday we will have to discuss the change in the 
situation with the buyer in the near future 
campnw plans to sell the rail line from milwaukee to green bay 
wis to a newly formed railroad frvr corp a subsidiary of 
chicagobased itel corp 
the railway labor executives association had filed a motion to 
stop the sale arguing that the railroad was obligated to negotiate 
over the effects of the sale on employees 
but the us 7th circuit court of appeals ruled last month that 
campnw corp could sell the track without giving labor unions a voice 
in the decision 
the sale of the line is not related to another controversy over 
train crew sizes that caused a brief strike against the campnw in 
august 
an estimated 2600 rail employees went on strike for a few hours 
sept 9 against the campnw over another issue involving possible 
layoffs of brakemen 
were dealing with two unrelated issues said robert reppe 
jr president of utu local 577 which represents about 420 union 
members in the chicago area 
both reppe and brunkenhoefer said they did not expect any strike 
to result from stevens ruling brunkenhoefer said he expected the 
main effect of the ruling would be that the campnw would not rush to 
complete the wisconsin track sale until labor and legal issues were 
further resolved 
the railroad and the united transportation union have been 
battling for more than a year over the size of crews on campnw 
freight trains but that dispute is not directly at issue in the 
emergency request acted upon wednesday by stevens
