two members of a religious cult avoided 
prison terms friday for their roles in helping to conceal the 
slayings of a family of five last year 
dennis patrick and his wife tonya got 18 months in prison 90 
days in jail and one year probation but the prison terms were 
suspended and they were given credit for jail time already served 
judge james w jackson said patrick must continue the counseling 
he is receiving along with his wife and their 10yearold daughter 
molly 
were very happy very much relieved with the sentence that 
was given patrick said this has been a real tragedy in the 
lives of many people 
in a separate courtroom mrs patrick wept as she read a 
statement to judge martin o parks 
she said she had been afraid to notify authorities about the 
murders of dennis and cheryl avery and their three daughters 
because cult leader jeffrey lundgren told her he would kill her 
daughter if she did not cooperate 
investigators said lundgren who admitted to shooting the 
averys at one time also intended to kill the patricks 
the patricks said they still feared lundgren who last month was 
sentenced to death 
the couple pleaded guilty last month to one count each of 
obstruction of justice prosecutors had reduced their original 
charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder 
during testimony witnesses said patrick helped dig the pit 
under the kirtland barn where the averys were killed and buried in 
april 1989 he said he was told the pit was to be used for 
baptisms 
mrs patrick testified that lundgren forced her to become his 
captive wife and live with him in his tent when the cult 
members moved to the wilderness in west virginia after the 
slayings 
prosecutor steven latourette said the patricks should have 
revealed the murders to fbi agents who came to the farm the day 
after the killing the agents questioned cult members about rumors 
that they were planning to take over the kirtland temple of the 
reorganized church of latter day saints by killing its leaders 
lundgrens wife alice is serving five consecutive life 
sentences in prison for complicity in the murders 
the lundgrens son jeffrey must serve at least 120 years in 
prison for his conviction on four counts of aggravated murder in 
the deaths of four of the averys he was acquitted in cheryl 
averys death

rei kawakubo at comme des garcons is being saluted 
for a summer readytowear show keyed to wearability some think it 
was her prettiest ever 
when a wayout designer like kawakubo goes straight the results 
might be boring or pretty 
there was a little bit of both in this show thursday as some of 
kawakubos minimalist styles simple gray chiffon tunics over 
tights or lean jumpsuits looked cool and wearable though not 
exciting 
however she presented some stunningly attractive numbers a 
whole line of white heavylace guipure jackets and jumpsuits or 
simple vnecked dresses to the knee they were terribly appealing 
for summer 
her most beautiful idea of all was in the cathedralwindow silk 
prints lightly veiled in chiffon the slim pants tunics and 
skirts glowed with the colors and motifs like the rose or lunette 
windows of chartres 
another japanese going for prettier commercial ideas was yohji 
yamamoto he threw in some of his usual black or navy ideas with a 
tad of asymmetry 
but with little flared shorts and jersey tank tops or aline 
short tunics the effect was quite perky 
yamamoto went in for some color over black body stockings or 
catsuits beautiful in royal blue or emerald cotton crochet 
tunics jackets or cap sleeves he often tied the crochet work on 
with satin ribbons a fun new idea if perhaps a bit complicated for 
dressing 
white and black were worked in with similar tying on of various 
sleeves cowls collars and skirt shapes sometimes in stiffened 
white linen with drawstrings 
pantsuits often came out with cutouts and asymmetrical details 
perhaps a shoulder wrap turning into a crisscross sleeve feature 
the sculpted or crimpedpaper effect effect however 
looked more suited to the runway than to a traveling woman today 
the japanese clothes had a figurehiding side to them 
concealing the body with the panels the tunics the lace 
angelo tarlazzi on the other hand spared the body nothing his 
collection was angled for the youthful figure with tiny clinging 
stretch minisuits or legrevealing full skirts 
like many other designers tarlazzi loved the lingerie look he 
trotted several fitted pastel slips out of the underwear closet 
they usually had laceedged tops with spaghetti straps plus black 
lace gussets in the flared skirts they would be perfect under a 
suit if you got tired of wearing them out to the disco 
another young tarlazzi theme was done with eyelet the cutest in 
this vein with shorts or minis had red scalloped edges on the 
shorts and fichu wrap tops 
his shirred clinging print micro dresses with their lacy edges 
looked as if he took very seriously the bathingsuit eveningdress 
idea started by emanuel ungaro a couple of seasons ago 
for his second collection shown in paris english designer john 
galliano went in for some offthewall models that outdid the 
japanese of yore 
his silhouettes were often quirky and asymmetrical even 
including a paperdoll paper dress with cutouts galliano had a 
tendency to show a lot of skin with some curious results since 
the outfits were obviously not beachwear

as if calcutta didnt have enough slums 
hollywood built another one the collection of patchwork shacks is 
so authentic that filmmakers had to erect a fence to keep out 
people hoping to move in 
the 600footlong street of 52 houses is the location for the 
movie based on dominique lapierres bestselling novel city of 
joy a story about a rickshaw puller and a polish priest in the 
slums of calcutta 
but it is more than just a movie set the dilapidated homes are 
careful replicas of slum shacks made of tin mud stone wood and 
tiles 
they were based on dozens of photographs from slum quarters in 
calcutta bombay and new delhi said philip kohler the production 
manager 
and they are so authentic we had to build a 10foot fence 
around the lot to keep out people who wanted to move in kohler 
said 
the homes were built on a lot owned by the national oil company 
near calcuttas docks in the heart of the industrial zone they 
will be demolished when filming is completed 
the film for warner bros is to be directed by roland joffe of 
the killing fields and the mission the 12week shooting 
schedule begins in february 
calcutta has 300 slum neighborhoods known as bustees housing 
an estimated 43 percent of the citys 12 million residents some 
estimates say up to 300000 people are homeless streetdwellers 
city of joy is about one of them hasari pal an 
impoverished villager who brought his family to the city when he 
could no longer meet debts from his small landholding 
after working as a rickshaw puller a human horse in the last 
major city of the world where men still pull rickshaws pal can 
afford to move into the slum of ananda nagar which is bengali for 
city of joy 
from the beginning the movie project ran into political 
problems last year the state government of west bengal objected to 
putting calcuttas poverty under the filmmakers kleig lights 
the film company argued that the movie would highlight the 
citys indomitable spirit according to news reports at the 
time 
we feel there is no need to show only slumdwellers to show 
the indomitable spirit of calcutta retorted parvatheneni 
upendra the information and broadcast minister of the federal 
government in new delhi 
the information minister for the communistled state government 
at the time budhadev bhattacharya also objected to the film he 
complained that the book was written from an imperialist point of 
view 
details of the negotiations that cleared the way for the film 
have not been disclosed the estimated 5 million the company is 
likely to spend in calcutta may have helped persuade the 
authorities to reconsider 
kohler also said there was a contribution to an undisclosed 
charity of an unknown amount 
the polish priest has been written out of the preliminary 
script he is replaced as the main character by an american doctor 
who comes to calcutta to help the lepers and the poor 
the doctor is a secondary character in lapierres 1985 book 
the rewrite could reflect the sensitivity in this predominantly 
hindu nation about christian missionaries or the filmmakers 
belief that the doctor would have wider audience appeal than the 
priest

operation desert shield along with 
holding off iraqi soldiers is also shielding the desert from 
another force that each year devastates saudi rangeland millions 
of iraqi sheep 
an inadvertent side effect of impending war conservationists 
say is that iraqi herders have ceased their traditional migration 
across the border to find pasture for sheep goats and camels 
that they say is no small windfall to saudi arabia where a 
loss of plant cover threatens to convert arable range into 
wasteland across much of the country 
tanks and jeeps running around up there are nothing compared 
to what happens from overgrazing said graham child senior 
consultant to the national commission for wildlife conservation and 
development 
crisis or not the commission is pressing ahead with a 10year 
plan to protect endangered habitats and restock them with 
diseasefree gazelle ostrich and native birds 
the measures have already brought the arabian oryx back from 
extinction in the wild two species of gazelle are being bred by 
the hundreds 
there are also some new houbara bustards large birds beloved by 
saudis who hunt them with falcons 
arabian rangelands slowly degrading for a thousand years now 
suffer badly from saudi bedouin now able to use water trucks to 
graze their animals on fragile land they could not reach before 
under historic accords iraqi and jordanian nomads have crossed 
regularly into northern saudi arabia to find fresh range they have 
benefited from the same generous subsidies allowed the saudis 
at the same time swift rural development in saudi arabia 
brought new roads irrigated farming and other incursions on 
natural habitats 
saudi leaders realized they faced a crisis in the mid1980s when 
hunters consistently camehome emptyhanded in 1986 the 
commission was set up to do something about it 
within four years 57692 square miles were designated protected 
areas specialists came in to shape a wildlife research center from 
a neglected private zoo on the late king khalids farm north of 
here 
at a second center scientists experimented with ways to breed 
enough houbara bustard chicks to save the threatened wild 
population 
theyve achieved an enormous amount in three years said 
doug williamson an englishbased biologist who runs the king 
khalid wildlife research center 
things are far from perfect but there is goodwill and money 
is being committed he said 
abdul aziz abu zinada the commisions secretarygeneral said 
his priorities were protecting habitats seeking environmental 
legislation restocking wildlife and building public awareness 
conflict with iraq has stalled plans for regional cooperation 
he said but international organizations have continued to help 
with data and advice 
now in the north you can see idmi sand gazelle where they 
had almost disappeared abu zinada said it is thrilling 
at the king khalid center scientists have all but eliminated 
the tuberculosis which traced back to a gift deer from spain had 
crippled herds left for years in a single enclosure 
soon the 600 to 700 gazelles now thriving as a result of the 
program will be breeding hundreds of kids a year to be released 
into the wild williamson said 
the center has two pairs of afri or saudi dorcas gazelles 
among the last 27 believed left in the world 
altogether there are 20 species from five continents 
the animals thrive in separate pens and paddocks and include a 
mix of indigenous species and gifts from visitors there are idmi 
rheem mountain gazelle other rare gazelles arabian oryx 
zebras ostriches and assorted extras including a mad halfgoat 
halfibex that thinks its a deer 
williamson an antelope specialist who worked in botswanas 
kalahari desert is also conducting research on how gazelle cope 
with roasting desert temperatures 
we havent been affected much by the iraq crisis he said 
echoing remarks by scientists conducting other commission projects 
there is a lot to do still but were doing it

a generic drug manufacturer was fined 1 
million thursday for bribing and lying to food and drug 
administration officials in applying for approval of drugs the 
justice department said 
american therapeutics inc of bohemia ny was fined after 
pleading guilty to five charges in us district court in 
baltimore 
ati pleaded guilty to interstate travel in aid of racketeering 
making false statements to a government agency failing to follow 
required drug manufacturing practices obstruction of an agency 
investigation and making unlawful payments to fda officials 
judge john hargrove fined ati 1 million on the first four 
counts and 500000 on the bribery charge the 500000 fine was a 
concurrent fine meaning ati must pay a total of 1 million 
the case reveals a depressing and sinister picture of the 
generic drug industry us attorney breckinridge willcox said in 
a statement 
unfortunately the picture will get even darker as heinous as 
the conduct of american therapeutics and its former chief executive 
is the conduct of ati was altogether commonplace he said 
as part of a plea bargain agreement the company agreed to 
assist prosecutors in a continuing investigation of possible 
misconduct by former ati employees 
the company admitted to substituting newer pills of the 
antihypertension drug clorazopate dipotassium for older ones in 
reserve samples which are required by the fda for testing 
purposes the fda investigated the drug after hearing complaints 
that it crumbled in storage prosecutors said 
the company also admitted that it submitted false data and 
prepared false records for two other generic drugs it had submitted 
for approval prosecutors said 
clorazopate dipotassium made it to the market but the other two 
did not justice department spokesman michael robinson said 
whether the drug posed a health risk to consumers was not known he 
said 
the company engaged in the actions at the direction of its 
former chief executive officer and president raju vegesna 
prosecutors said 
vegesna was convicted in april of giving 60000 in bribes to 
employees of the fdas generic drug division in exchange for 
favorable treatment of drug applications 
the division where the employees worked is responsible for 
reviewing applications from pharmaceutical manufacturers who want 
to produce and market generic equivalents of brand name drugs 
we are grateful that the vegesna chapter in atis history 
finally has been concluded said dr john meloy a director of 
ati ati has been committed from the outset to fully cooperate 
with the government and to ensure that there are not safety and 
effectiveness concerns about any ati product 
the pleas thursday were part of an ongoing investigation of 
fraud in the generic drug industry being conducted by the justice 
department the us attorneys office the fda and the department 
of health and human services inspector general 
the investigation already has led to the felony convictions of 
four former fda employees five generic drug company executives

if the federal government shuts down because 
congress and president bush cant agree on spending cuts 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter will be among those essential 
employees to remain on the job 
with a few restrictions that is 
for example if no budget agreement is reached bush has said he 
will shut down the government saturday morning when federal 
spending authority is due to expire 
the goal is for congress and bush to agree on a 500 billion 
deficitreduction plan to guide government spending over the next 
five years the agriculture departments share as approved this 
week by house and senate farm bill negotiators is 136 billion 
yeutter meanwhile is to leave sunday for meetings next week in 
argentina brazil and chile on the current uruguay round of talks 
in geneva under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
kelly shipp yeutters press secretary and director of the 
usdas office of public affairs said that if on sunday the 
governments not up then he will not go on the south american 
trip 
that is one example of what a shutdown will mean at the 
department yeutter and selected aides would still be considered 
essential would work and collect their pay but most of usdas 
100000 fulltime employees would not 
no one can tell you today precisely all the people who would 
be essential in the event of a shutdown shipp said thursday in a 
telephone interview i can give you broad categories thats 
why they have to leave it up to the discretion of the various 
managers 
in other words there is no central board or office that 
designates essential employees each usda agency from the 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service to the rural 
electrification administration handles its own designations 
shipp said a very very rough estimate is that 20000 to 
30000 usda employees would be considered essential in a 
governmentwide shutdown of services those would include about 
7500 federal meat and poultry inspectors who would remain on the 
job 
there are several general guidelines used to help determine 
essential duties and employees the spokeswoman said those 
include 
functions that affect the health and safety of the general 
public meat and poultry inspection is an example 
employees who are needed to conduct an orderly shutdown of the 
government 
those whose jobs involve the safety and security of government 
facilities forest rangers and others needed to protect federal 
property would be in this category 
some other jobs that could be considered essential include 
workers needed to maintain feed and water for animals at usda farms 
and laboratories those would include quarantine stations operated 
by the animal and plant health inspection service 
workers and technical people involved in campaigns against 
intruding pests such as the mediterranean fruit fly could be kept 
on if their duties are essential to the program 
shipp said the campaign this week against africanized honeybees 
in the rio grande valley of texas would be another example of 
essential work 
as for yeutters staff no determination would be made until an 
actual shutdown began she said but receptionists and some other 
office people probably would be furloughed 
essential people would not necessarily include yeutters 
senior aides shipp said it would depend on what kind of 
activities they were overseeing 
would shipp remain at work in a shutdown i dont know 
because it depends on whats going on she said 
 
washington ap the agriculture department says china has 
bought an additional 299740 metric tons of us wheat under a 
price subsidy program 
officials said the subsidies for wheat sold to china have about 
doubled from what they averaged only a few months ago 
f paul dickerson general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said thursday that three private 
exporting companies made the deals under the export enhancement 
program or eep 
delivery of the wheat is scheduled for the first three months of 
1991 he said it was the first wheat sale to china under eep since 
aug 1 
the sales were part of 2 million tons authorized china under eep 
on may 2 dickerson said china has about 460000 tons remaining in 
its current allocation 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the latest sales would be about 11 million bushels at 
current prices estimated by usda at around 242 per bushel the 
wheat would have a farm value of around 27 million 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in 
selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged 4138 per ton or 
about 113 per bushel 
that was double the bonuses paid on chinas previous wheat 
purchase on aug 1 which averaged 2040 per ton or 56 cents per 
bushel a glut of wheat from bumper harvests in key producing 
countries has pressured world prices thus requiring larger 
subsidies to keep us grain competitive 
the subsidized sales were handled by bunge corp 150000 tons 
louis dreyfs corp 100000 tons and tradigrain inc 49750 
tons 
with the latest sales china has bought nearly 28 million tons 
of us wheat for delivery in the 199091 wheat marketing year that 
began june 1 compared with 56 million tons in 198990

a federal judge lowered charles h keating 
jrs bail thursday from 5 million to 300000 allowing the 
former savings and loan chief to walk out of jail after a month 
behind bars 
relatives whisked away a smiling keating after his release 
us district judge john g davies reduced keatings bail 
saying superior court judge gary klausner arbitrarily set it as 
much as 50 times higher than that of his codefendants who already 
had made bail 
i can see no rational reason whatsoever for this disparate 
treatment among defendants davies said 
keating 66 an arizona developer was jailed on charges of 
fraudulently selling junk bonds issued by his american continental 
corp which owned the failed lincoln savings and loan association 
a federal bailout of lincoln savings is expected to cost 
taxpayers 2 billion which would make it the nations costliest 
thrift bailout 
the bail decision came as the senate ethics committee 
investigated whether five senators who received campaign 
contributions from keating improperly intervened with banking 
regulators on keatings behalf 
keatings family posted the reduced bail 
one of keatings attorneys jeffrey powell said keating would 
return to his home in an exclusive phoenix suburb and begin 
preparing his defense 
im extremely pleased powell said but i think its 
unfortunate it took us 33 days to get to this point 
deputy district attorney paul turley said prosecutors would not 
appeal davies bail ruling but contended klausner ruled carefully 
in considering bail 
i believe judge klausner viewed all the evidence in front of 
him and that evidence supported the bail amount without any 
arbitrariness turley said 
when klausner initially set keatings bail at 5 million 
klausner described it as 2 percent of the alleged 250 million in 
losses to people who invested in worthless bonds through 
irvinebased lincoln savings 
davies called that proof of arbitrary bail and said the 
constitution allowed bail to be set only high enough to ensure a 
defendant would appear to answer charges 
the 42count state grand jury indictment accused keating and 
three of his former officials of misleading investors about the 
security of american continental junk bonds sold at lincoln 
branches 
at the end of a twoday hearing last month klausner let stand 
the 5 million bail he set earlier he said the potential 10year 
prison term in the fraud case might make flight likely for keating 
who also faces a federal criminal investigation and civil lawsuits 
including a 1 billion racketeering case 
keating appealed his 5 million bail to the federal court aftr 
exhausting appeals through state courts going all the way to the 
california supreme court without success 
in federal court keating appealed the bail on constitutional 
grounds 
the bottom line is there was a violation of mr keatings 8th 
amendment rights against excessive bail davies said 
keating was not in court although several family members were 
davies ruling followed an impassioned plea by a character 
witness former keating attorney john jack quinn of los 
angeles 
in washington the senate ethics committee adjourned thursday 
without announcing a decision on whether to intensify its 
investigation of three senators alan cranston dcalif dennis 
deconcini dariz and donald w riegle jr dmich 
committee documents obtained by the associated press show the 
three had more extensive dealings with keating than previously

the anastasia island cotton mouse is gone 
forever 
so is the insular longtongued bat of puerto rico and the texas 
henslows sparrow 
all are victims of mismanagement and a shortage of money that 
has kept the interior department from adequately enforcing the 
federal law that is supposed to protect endangered species 
according to government auditors 
a report by the departments inspector generals office said 
thursday that hundreds of other rare animals and plants may become 
extinct without any federal effort to save them because of 
shortcomings in the federal endangered species program 
during the past decade 34 species have disappeared because of 
inadequate protection under the endangered species act the 
internal report said it cited underfunding and personnel shortages 
and blamed the us fish and wildlife service for not adequately 
managing the program 
craig rieben a spokesman for the fish and wildlife service 
acknowledged a huge backlog of endangered species cases but he 
maintained the problem largely involves a lack of money 
working with the budget constraints that we are we feel 
that were doing the best job possible thats not to say that more 
couldnt be done he said 
the internal report said it could cost as much as 46 billion 
to protect all of the presently known endangered species while the 
fish and wildlife service is provided about 33 million a year to 
administer the program 
the cost of merely listing the current leading candidates for 
protection was estimated at 36 million the agencys listing 
budget is 35 million 
the fish and wildlife service has put about 50 plants or animals 
on the threatened or endangered list yearly but has a backlog of 
601 applications where the species probably deserve immediate 
protection the investigators said 
an additional 3000 species are suspected of being endangered 
but are receiving little or no protection while they await the 
federal review the report added it estimated that at the current 
pace it would take the agency almost 50 years to bring those 
species under the protection of federal law 
the endangered species act enacted in 1969 to protect species 
in danger of extinction has been under attack in recent months 
largely because of a bitter controversy over how to protect the 
northwests spotted owl 
the fish and wildlife service last summer declared the owl 
threatened and the bush administration has been trying to come up 
with a way to protect the bird while limiting the loss of 20000 
jobs in the timber industry 
the owls are rapidly dying off because of intense cutting in the 
oldgrowth forests of the pacific northwest any owl protection 
plan is likely to include restrictions in cutting 
interior secretary manuel lujan caused an uproar last summer 
among environmentalists when he suggested the endangered species 
law be made more flexible to take economic considerations into 
account in some circumstances 
in its report on the enforcement of the law the departments 
investigators concluded the fish and wildlife service has neither 
developed nor implemented a basic management system for effective 
administration of the endangered species program 
it said investigators also found that in addition to the huge 
backlog of petitions to list species for protection the agency has 
failed to develop recovery plans for many plants and animals 
already under the laws protection

specific financial demands were ever made

president bushs apparent decision to sign yet 
another stopgap spending bill represents his latest reversal in a 
budget debate that has seen more than a few presidential 
flipflops 
earlier this week the president declared in political 
appearances in texas and iowa that he would not sign another 
shortterm bill when the current one expires at midnight tonight 
lest there be any doubt let me make clear to congress just 
how serious i am about meeting that friday deadline he told a 
republican audience in dallas on monday this friday times up 
the american people deserve more than this stopgap government 
but his spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday that bush had 
decided to sign such a measure after all so long as satisfactory 
progress is made by tonight toward a final budget compromise 
well decide at the time midnight tonight what satisfactory 
progress is fitzwater added 
the white house sent scrambling several times over the past 
days to explain interpret or deny a bush budget turnabout found 
itself in the same position once again thursday 
asked why the president had changed his mind on whether to sign 
another stopgap bill fitzwater insisted that he really hadnt 
the point is we want to get a budget agreement we want a 
budget and if weve got two bills weve been in conference weve 
worked out something thats reasonable were willing to sign a cr 
to get it fitzwater said 
a cr is a continung resolution legislative jargon for a 
stopgap spending bill 
a housesenate conference committee must reconcile vast 
differences between the housepassed budget which bush opposes 
and the senate version which he supports 
the president wants to get a budget and he feels this is the 
best way to get one fitzwater said 
so far in the deliberations on a budget for the fiscal year that 
began oct 1 bush 
abandoned his 1988 read my lips no new taxes campaign 
pledge and endorsed a package proposing 134 billion in new taxes 
over five years including levies on cigarettes alcohol gasoline 
and luxury items like yachts and furs the plan was rejected by the 
house 
appeared to contradict white house chief of staff john sununus 
declaration in a television interview that the administration would 
not support any increase in income taxes bush at a news 
conference early last week said he was open to a compromise that 
would include higher taxes on the wealthiest americans in exchange 
for a cut in capital gains taxes 
backed away from this formula under pressure from republican 
leaders according to participants at a white house meeting at 
which bush renewed his opposition to any increase in income taxes 
added to the confusion and mixed signals as he jogged in st 
petersburg fla he responded read my hips and pointed to his 
buttocks when asked by a reporter if he was dropping his support 
for a lower capital gains tax 
suggested late last week that he could support a package to 
raise the top tax bracket from the current 28 percent to 31 percent 
if it were accompanied by a decrease in capital gains taxes to 15 
percent but then he said he wouldnt push such a plan because he 
didnt think it could muster enough votes to pass congress 
bush said in political speeches this week in dallas omaha 
neb and des moines iowa that he was ready to close down the 
government again if necessary as he did over the columbus day 
weekend 
there have been 37 of these emergency measures since 1981 
seven in one year alone just to keep the governments door 
open he told the omaha audience i am sickened by such 
mortgaging of our childrens future 
but fitzwater said thursday closing down the government is 
only something you do if you absolutely have to

democrats are the ones boasting about the 
republican candidate seeking to replace gop rep lynn martin in the 
us house 
republican john hallock is probably the worst candidate in the 
country this year says howard schloss a spokesman for the 
democratic congressional campaign committee in washington 
hallock was clocked driving 107 mph by a state trooper and has 
been embarrassed by public disclosure of a child support dispute 
with his exwife 
hes gotten a lot of press for his inability to obey the 
law schloss said hes doing everything possible to lose the 
race 
democrat john cox hopes hallocks problems will help him break a 
gop stranglehold on the northern illinois district martin is 
giving up her house seat to challenge democratic sen paul simon 
rockford where hallock lives anchors an eightcounty gop 
stronghold bordering iowa and wisconsin the city has been 
represented in congress by republicans for all but two of the past 
135 years 
but the 1989 election of a black democrat as rockford mayor 
signaled a potential shift in voter loyalties 
cox a lawyer has a history of taking on entrenched 
republicans he won the first of two consecutive terms as jodaviess 
county states attorney in 1976 becoming the first democrat 
elected to that post since 1933 
hallock has raised 500000 cox 250000 national committees 
for both parties are contributing manpower and money in what is 
likely to be the only competitive race in the region 
republicans are counting on a boost from the martinsimon race 
although she trails simon substantially in published polls 
republicans hope the rockfordarea congresswoman will draw well in 
her home district and pull extra votes for hallock 
hallock a state representative since 1979 has softpedaled his 
personal troubles and tried to shift attention to his differences 
with cox on taxes 
hallock pleaded guilty last summer to a may 11 speeding ticket 
a state trooper said hallock was driving 107 mph on interstate 55 
after missing his court date hallock pleaded guilty to going 95 
mph and paid a fine and court costs of 400 
in september hallock was stopped for speeding in a 30 mph zone 
but was released with an oral warning state police said 
lets not make more of it than it is hallock said i got 
a speeding ticket we all make mistakes 
its the credentials of a candidate thats important not his 
driving record 
hallock also has come under attack for his position on abortion 
he supports the right to abortion through the first trimester of 
pregnancy but not after he has voted in the state legislature for 
parental notification and consent for underage girls seeking 
abortions he is against federal funding of abortions 
cox staked out a prochoice position early and has the support 
of abortion rights groups 
hallock has attacked cox as a proponent of higher taxes 
my options dont include any tax increase hallock said 
my options are cutting the budget collecting back taxes and a 
balanced budget amendment 
cox said he has not supported five tax increases as hallock 
says but suggested five areas where revenue could be raised if 
necessary he said he favors increasing the income tax rate for 
people making more than 150000 a year from 28 percent to 35 
percent to pay for the thrift bailout and perhaps budget 
reduction 
he criticized hallock as a career politician who embodies the 
problems in washington and the lack of public respect for 
government 
the first thing we have to do is get credibility back to our 
leaders in washington cox said its experienced legislators 
in washington that have gotten us into the budget deficit mess

it is 8 am at la colline a fashionable 
capitol hill restaurant and connecticut democrat toby moffett is 
trolling for campaign dollars 
suddenly who should step around the bend doing the same thing 
but gary franks moffetts republican opponent in the race for 
connecticuts 5th district house seat 
it was incredible moffett said we just shook hands and 
said hi 
by coincidence moffett and franks rented separate rooms for 
fundraising breakfasts at the same time on the same day 
both candidates are tapping their washington connections as they 
battle for a congressional seat that has been controlled by 
republicans for 12 of the last 18 years the seat is being vacated 
by republican rep john rowland who is running for governor 
this race will probably be in the top 20 in terms of national 
interest said doug sosnick political director of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee 
franks 37 is hoping to become the first black in connecticut 
history to serve in congress his campaign says and he would be 
the first black republican in the house since 1935 the alderman 
from waterbury conn is one of three black republicans running 
for the house this year 
moffett 46 is a liberalleaning democrat seeking to return to 
congress where he served four terms from another district he 
moved so he could seek the open house seat 
moffett wandered into the wrong district says franks 
during the campaign franks has hobnobbed at the white house 
with president bush both are yale university graduates and were 
campus athletes bush is committed to a campaign swing through 
connecticut before election day the republican party also promised 
to provide franks campaign the maximum 63000 in cash and inkind 
contributions 
in the current political climate insider status can be a 
disadvantage so moffett is trying to exploit franks ties to 
washington 
we just cant match that he said of franks ability to draw 
attention and campaign visits from gop bigwigs they just drop in 
on you like paratroopers a cabinet member a day the president 
but moffett has ties of his own 
the democrat has tapped into alliances formed during his years 
on capitol hill to pick up 120565 from political action 
committees 
moffett also has used his status as an excongressman to lobby 
on the house floor against decreases in medicaid benefits 
franks calls moffett a taxandspend career politician 
trying not to seem too much the insider franks notes that he 
disagrees with the president on the deficitreducing budget plan 
because it calls for tax increases 
he also claims underdog status in the race moffett has higher 
name id than a little alderman from waterbury he says 
moffett frequently refers to franks as a creature of the 
republican national committee and brands his opponent as too 
conservative for connecticut 
the republican party is controlled by conservatives and the 
conservatives think franks will be another jesse helms moffett 
said he forgot where he came from and i didnt 
sosnick says the republicans desperately want a black to win 
but mark nuttle executive director of the republican national 
congressional committee said it makes no difference whether 
youre black or white the goal he said is holding onto the 
seat now held by rowland a republican and defeating moffett a 
wellknown democrat

kentuckys medical licensure board chided 
dr harvey sloane the democratic nominee for us senate for 
writing prescriptions with an expired federal drug registration 
but the board said thursday no formal sanction was warranted 
sloane said the inquiry into his writing prescription refills for 
himself was a carefully orchestrated republican dirty 
trick 
a spokesman for republican sen mitch mcconnell accused sloane 
of outrageous lies 
it was the second inquiry by the state board of medical 
licensure into sloanes prescriptions 
last fall the board advised sloane to stop prescribing sleeping 
pills for himself sloane who no longer has an active medical 
practice said he wrote refills of the pills because of arthritis 
pain in his hip and back pain from a degenerative disk disease he 
did not write the original prescriptions 
the inquiry was prompted by the disclosure that sloanes drug 
enforcement administration permit to write prescriptions had 
expired in february 1987

alaska oil spill researchers killed as 
many as 350 birds this summer as part of a study commissioned by 
the federal government a newspaper reported 
the researchers fitted the dead birds with radio transmitters 
and smeared some with oil then tossed the bodies into the sea to 
track their progress the sacramento bee reported thursday 
the federal government commissioned the 600000 study to help 
its case against exxon corp owner of the tanker that ran aground 
and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil into prince william 
sound in march 1989 the newspaper said 
by tracking the dead birds researchers hope to develop a 
formula to estimate the number of birds killed in the spill 
during a highly publicized program after the spill the us 
fish and wildlife service said 797 birds had been rescued cleaned 
and released the newspaper said thousands more birds were 
believed to have died then 
the birds killed this summer were shot on islands most in 
national wildlife refuges outside the spill zone the newspaper 
said without providing specifics the birds included murres 
scoters common eiders cormorants ancient murrelets and auklets 
the research was conducted by a portland ore company 
ecological consulting inc under a contract with the us 
department of justice and the fish and wildlife service the bee 
said 
the study is among a series of research projects upon which the 
federal government will rely to try to prove natural resources 
damages 
jack hession alaska representative of the sierra club said the 
study is important on the other hand its unfortunate they had 
to collect live birds for the study he said why didnt they 
use dead birds they collected last year 
bruce batten a spokesman for the fish and wildlife service in 
anchorage said the government knew the study would be 
controversial 
the justice department felt strongly that this study needed to 
be done to make its case he said

blame the founding fathers if you like but 
there is still disagreement in americas third century over who 
decides whether to go to war the president congress or both 
the undeclared war in vietnam almost tore the country apart 
today the possibility that president bush might send american 
troops into action against iraq is driving a wedge between congress 
and the executive branch 
at this point emotions are under control there are few 
antiwar protests but if americans fight and die in the persian 
gulf the country could be torn apart again 
the problem basically is a constitutional one but dont look to 
the supreme court to settle it 
even the warren court which did not shrink from controversy 
over segregation gerrymandered legislatures and heavyhanded 
police interrogations avoided judging the legality of the vietnam 
war 
the justices hoped that somehow the white house and congress 
would work it out but they never came to an agreement 
the root of the problem is that the constitution gives congress 
the right to declare war while designating the president as 
commanderinchief 
at first blush that may seem a workable arrangement but the 
white house and congress have been wrestling over powers of war and 
peace ever since 
toward the end of the indochina war after thousands of 
americans had died in combat congress decision to enact the war 
powers act in 1973 reflected widespread public disapproval of the 
powers assumed by the white house 
passed over president nixons veto the law attempted to make 
sure congress would serve as a rein on the white house in future 
conflicts 
the law requires the president to withdraw american troops from 
combat or from situations of imminent involvement of 
hostilities within 60 days unless congress gives its approval 
the deadline can be extended by 30 days at the presidents request 
some members of congress are trying to apply the resolution to 
todays situation in the persian gulf they are particularly 
anxious because congress may adjourn late next week until 
midjanuary 
the concern is that bush will send americans to war while 
congress is away 
secretary of state james a baker iii assured the senate foreign 
relations committee on wednesday that the administration would 
consult with congressional leaders during the adjournment period 
but sen paul s sarbanes dmd told baker that consultation 
is not authorization 
sarbanes one of several senators who challenged the 
administrations approach lectured baker the notion that the 
president alone would be able to commit american forces in a 
military assault in effect without receiving a shared decision by 
the congress is contrary to the constitution 
and sen nancy l kassebaum rkan while describing herself as 
not a supporter of the war powers act still advised baker that 
it is the law of the land and as long as it is the law of the 
land i think we have to adhere to it 
actually in the 17 years of the laws existence congress has 
never required that troops be brought home congress tried to force 
the president to carry out the law only once when marines landed 
in lebanon in 1983 but it extended the deadline for 18 months and 
the marines were withdrawn in the meantime 
the current debate is over who decides to go to war some of the 
members of congress who are challenging the executive branch seem 
inclined to support force against iraq others are skeptical of the 
wisdom of such a move 
among them is sen terry sanford dnc who told baker i 
feel very strongly absent some severe provocation that it would 
be a tragic mistake of lasting proportions if we started the 
shooting 
ultimately bush may have to face the war powers issue although 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny drawing on his experience as 
a former us ambassador to the united nations suggested another 
approach thursday in a brief interview 
moynihan took the position the president has the authority to 
send us troops into action under article 25 of the un charter 
which binds nations to abide by un resolutions 
as moynihan explained it the president could arrange with the 
security council to make american troops available for combat under 
a council resolution but even then the senator said congress 
would have to approve the agreement

a document written by sen alan cranstons 
fundraiser provides a textbook lesson in approaching political 
donors and shows that the california democrat never did so 
unprepared 
ironically cranston dcalif was told in the 1988 memo to be 
aware of one couples desire to keep trent lott out of the 
senate 
lott rmiss not only won hes now one of the six ethics 
committee members deciding how to proceed in an investigation of 
cranston and four other senators involved in helping charles h 
keating jr the former owner of the failed lincoln savings and 
loan association of irvine calif 
the committee met thursday without taking action and was 
resuming deliberations today in the case of the keating five 
senators 
the panel is deciding whether to follow its special counsels 
advice to advance its investigation of cranston sen dennis 
deconcini dariz and sen donald w riegle jr dmich the 
counsel advised dropping investigations against sens john mccain 
rariz and john glenn dohio 
the 1988 memo from fundraiser joy jacobson provided advice on 
how cranston should approach potential donors for a democraticrun 
voter registration project keating gave 850000 to the project 
the bulk of the 13 million he and associates contributed to the 
five senators campaigns and causes 
jacobson advised cranston to approach a california couple 
about giving 250000 and giving directly to the efforts in four 
states 
one was mississippi because it will be a priority with them to 
keep lott out of the senate the memo said the couple knew 
democratic sen howard metzenbaum of ohio is going to have a very 
tough race and so would sen frank lautenberg dnj 
the memo went on north carolina you will need to explain how 
this effort is building toward defeating republican sen jesse 
helms in 1990 
jacobson also advised cranston to approach ann cox chambers a 
daughter of cox communications founder james cox and her daughter 
anne is an avid democrat who was one of jimmy carters biggest 
supporters the memo said before asking her for money you 
should determine what her main political interest currently is 
rebuilding the democratic party in the south sen albert gore 
dtenn for president southern senate races etc 
cranston should approach florida corporate chief executive 
officers the memo said because these are all companies that 
gave large amounts to grahams races for governor bob graham a 
democrat was governor of florida and now is one of the states 
senators 
the memo asked that cranston meet with a dano davis saying 
ceo of winndixie we asked graham to arrange this meeting 
because winndixie is one of the companies that has given to 
voteamerica our republican counterpart 
winndixie is a floridabased supermarket chain

the government and ford motor co are 
investigating reports of brake disc corrosion in all ford taurus 
and mercury sable models a problem that could cause brakes to 
fail 
the national highway traffic safety administration said thursday 
it had upgraded the probe from a preliminary evaluation an 
examination of paperwork to an engineering analysis in which 
engineers will study the possibly defective parts 
the investigation could result in a recall 
ford said it was conducting its own investigation of all its 
models that have the same brake rotor and hub assembly as the 
taurus and sable they include the lincoln continental ford 
thunderbird and mercury cougar 
agency spokesman tim hurd said there had been six complaints of 
front disc brake corrosion in the taurus and sable an estimated 
18 million of the vehicles are on the road 
the complaints allege that the discs deteriorate and fail the 
problem has been blamed for one accident and a minor injury 
the problem appears to be centered in northern climes where 
roads are heavily salted in the winter hurd said

young people may be drinking a fortified wine 
product containing 20 percent alcohol unaware it is far more 
potent than wine coolers the surgeon general says 
surgeon general antonia novello said thursday it scares me to 
death that people particularly young people may buy cisco 
without realizing its high alcohol content 
she said she is especially concerned that in some states the 
product can be sold in convenience stores and is often placed in 
stores next to wine coolers which have about 4 percent alcohol 
ordinary table wines have about 12 percent alcohol content 
others including the national council on alcoholism and drug 
dependence also have expressed concern about the product made by 
canandaigua wine co in canandaigua ny 
this poses a serious safety and health risk said christine 
lubinski a spokeswoman for the councils washington office 
a 100pound person who drinks two 375 milliliter bottles of 
cisco within an hour could die from acute alcohol poisoning she 
said a 150pound person who drinks one bottle within an hour would 
have a bloodalcohol content level of 011 which is more than the 
legal limit for driving in all states but georgia she said

the senate passed a bipartisan budget early 
friday aiming the sting of deficitreduction at virtually all 
americans raising taxes on gasoline alcohol and tobacco while 
paring medicare and other programs 
lawmakers adopted the measure 5446 paving the way for 
bargaining with the house and president bush over a compromise bill 
that could end the yearlong budget stalemate negotiations were 
set to begin later friday 
this is the first step we must take to reduce the staggering 
deficits that are essentially bleeding us dry said senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
the house has approved legislation relying heavily on tax hikes 
on the wealthy to close the federal deficit it contains no change 
in the current 9 cents a gallon gasoline tax which the senate 
would boost to 18 cents both versions slash spending on programs 
ranging from agriculture to veterans benefits 
the senate approved the bill shortly before 130 am ending a 
long day that saw lawmakers dump an attempt to scale back the gas 
tax increase and substitute a series of tax increases on the 
wealthy lets go and get it from those whove got it said 
sen barbara mikulski dmd but her plea was rejected 5545 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
president was prepared to sign separate legislation keeping the 
government in funds through next wednesday the house approved the 
measure 37937 and its expected quick approval by the senate would 
avert the threat of a second government shutdown in two weeks 
with the immediate crisis of a closeddown government solved a 
new nonfiscal problem emerged the famous capitol dome sprung a 
leak during a rainstorm forcing workers to cover statues with 
plastic sheets and prompting metaphorical comparisons between 
congress home and its budget process 
lawmakers eyes were on the calendar with election day less 
than three weeks off to diffuse possible blame senate leaders 
crafted a broadly based collection of 250 billion worth of new 
taxes and spending reductions 
leading democrats promised to try to change the bill during 
negotiations with the house though senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine acknowledged we cant guarantee the result 
the president had said as recently as monday that he would not 
sign another emergency spendingauthorization extension but press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said late thursday that bush would sign 
a bill keeping the government going through next wednesday if 
satisfactory progress was being made 
without such an extension the governments authority to spend 
money would expire friday night 
but the president also took the offensive trying to turn the 
tables on house democrats who have spent the last few weeks 
accusing him of protecting the rich 
he said most americans would be hurt by a house provision 
delaying annual inflation adjustments in incometax brackets and 
personal exemptions 
the opposition is trying to say favor the rich bush said 
im saying im favoring incentives investment and 
protecting the working men and women of this country 
as senators neared the end of debate they voted 6931 for items 
sought by airlines many local noise restrictions would be 
superseded by federal rules to be written later and limits on 
flights into and out of airports in new york and chicago would be 
slightly relaxed 
the tax increases and spending cuts were to be the lions share 
of 500 billion worth of deficit cuts over the next five years 
including 40 billion this year most of the rest of the savings 
would come from defense cuts in separate legislation 
although that senatehouse bargaining was not expected to begin 
formally until thursday evening some lawmakers were already 
beginning to glimpse the shape of a final package 
house democrats meeting privately early in the day were told by 
leaders that some gasoline tax increase was virtually inevitable 
said one lawmaker who demanded anonymity but they said they would 
demand some form of higher taxes on the rich in return 
the house approved no gasoline tax increase in its budget but 
democrats at the meeting seemed to agree that if the 
9centagallon gasoline tax was boosted by 6 cents most of us 
wouldnt go crazy the lawmaker said 
the major issue with us in the house is hanging onto some 
notion of progressivity said rep byron dorgan dnd a member 
of the taxwriting ways and means committee 
house budget committee chirman leon panetta dcalif said he 
believed the house would also drop its provision halting for one 
year the annual inflation adjustment made in incometax brackets 
and the personal exemption 
several senate republicans said they were not immovably opposed 
to boosting the tax rate on the richest americans to 31 percent 
from its current 28 percent depending on what tradeoff they 
received 
the real question is whether 31 percent is ok with the 
president said sen robert kasten rwis weve just been told 
31 percent is not ok but weve also seen the president change his 
mind before 
just a week ago bush repeatedly shifted his position on whether 
he would accept higher taxes on the rich 
the president also had earlier said he would close the 
government unless a deficitreduction deal was completed by friday 
night a deadline congress seems all but certain to miss but the 
white house softened that wednesday saying the requirement was for 
substantial progress in the right direction 
the senate measure limits deductions for people earning more 
than 100000 imposes the 145 percent medicare tax on the 
paychecks of many uppermiddle class people for the first time and 
boosts levies on yachts and furs 
it also raises the 9centagallon federal gasoline tax to 18 
cents by 1992 increases levies on alcohol and tobacco products 
and makes medicare benefits a bit less generous for 33 million 
elderly and handicapped people 
in contrast majority democrats pushed their own bill through 
the house tuesday that leans much more heavily on the countrys 
wealthy a theme they hope will improve the partys election 
prospects 
the house bill raises the incometax rate on the richest 
americans from 28 percent to 33 percent and adds a 10 percent tax 
on people earning 1 million annually it guarantees that no matter 
how many deductions are claimed a wealthy person would pay income 
taxes of no less than 25 percent an increase from the current 21 
percent 
the house measure reduces medicare benefits by less than the 
senate would and contains similar tax increases on alcohol 
tobacco and luxury items but it gives a modest tax break to 
middleclass people who sell property

all you need to know to get into the chicago 
blues ensemble is how to pluck out a couple of chords and sing in 
the shower 
by the end of an eightweek course students are transformed 
into toetapping hardplaying blues performers with dark glasses 
and a new attitude theyre ready for their final exam in a local 
bar 
blues is the peoples music said jon spiegel one of the 
ensembles directors if you can plant the seed of obsession 
then its really great after that you just stand back and 
steer 
the training is open to all instruments and some students bring 
in violins or dulcimers but most favor guitars pianos basses and 
harmonicas everybody has to sing a solo before theyre through 
and the lessons teach more than music spiegel said 
you can see the change in the students he said they 
first come in wearing oxford shirts and by the end of the eight 
weeks theyre wearing sharkskin suits and wide ties 
the program is offered by the old town school of folk music 
typically about 45 students of varying experience levels separate 
to work in small groups most take music lessons during the week 
and meet each wednesday to apply the theories theyve learned 
you get a lot out of playing with other people of all levels 
and from all walks of life said george minkel of bridgeview 
ive been a closet player for years so this is wonderful 
directors help students develop the best group sound while 
focusing on the emotional extremes that are the root of the blues 
spiegel said 
play an angry note spiegel told a bass player during one of 
the wednesday night sessions the student answered with a 
screeching sound that bounced off the walls and echoed through the 
room 
now play one thats real sublime spiegel said the 
responding tone wafted mellowly around the room 
the group then played a rendition of the blues standard 
crossroads with rich yeater a mildmannered computer 
consultant pounding the piano keys and belting out the lyrics 
its the first time ive done this he said after his solo 
singing debut its exciting very different and a lot of fun 
playing with a group forces you to be more disciplined 
final exams take place in a local bar where the groups take the 
stage during an open microphone night 
the best thing about this class is that while they probably 
wont be the best group up there they definitely wont be the 
worse spiegel said 
some of the ensemble groups go on to perform regularly but few 
are willing to quit their day jobs for life in chicagos smoky 
blues clubs 
well the options always open said kevin hauser a 
35yearold train conductor and guitar player from suburban 
elmhurst ill wait to see if the audience wants an encore after 
our first session

a 15 billion child care bill including 
grants to states and a tax credit for poor families was approved 
by the senate today as part of a deficitreducing tax package 
senate leaders reached agreement with the bush administration 
earlier in the week on a scaleddown version of a bill providing 
assistance to working families with children 
they put the package into the budget bill and sent it back to 
the house in an effort to break a yearlong stalemate and bypass a 
conference committee that has been unable to resolve differences 
rep gus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education and 
labor committee called the senate version disappointing and said 
he would seek changes 
the central element of the bill 13 billion over five years is 
an expansion of the earnedincome tax credit for lowincome working 
families with children the cost would be offset by a continuation 
of the 3 percent telephone excise tax which otherwise would expire 
at yearend 
the other major element is a new program of grants to the states 
for child care assistance states could pass along the money 
directly to families to offset part of their child care costs or 
the money could go as a subsidy to day care centers 
the senate bill would provide 25 billion over three years for 
those grants with money in the final two years to be negotiated 
later that is less than what house sponsors sought 
churchrun child care centers would be eligible for the money 
to reach agreement with the white house senate democrats 
accepted reduced federal safety and quality standards for child 
care providers from previous versions of the bill and removed 
provisions expanding money for the head start childdevelopment 
program 
also eliminated is a provision passed by the house to provide 
money for local governments to establish afterschool child care 
programs based in the public schools 
another key difference is in the structure of the grant program 
house sponsors wanted the program established under the social 
security act which would make it an entitlement program that is 
automatically in the budget the senates version would require the 
program to compete for appropriations each year 
federal child care assistance was backed by both presidential 
candidates in 1988 but the issue has been stuck in conference 
committee since clearing the house and senate

fear of inflight clashes between 
militant smokers and nonsmokers has prompted lufthansa to drop 
plans to ban smoking on domestic flights the airline says 
the national german carrier had planned to ban smoking on the 
flights with the start of its winter schedule on oct 28 
but lufthansa said thursday that passenger reaction to its plans 
had been extremely divided although a majority of smokers had 
indicated their willingness to accept the ban 
but since federal lawmakers had decided not to pass nosmoking 
legislation barring smoking on flights could lead to 
polarization and confrontations among passengers the airline 
said 
it said it could not allow passengers and cabin crews to be 
involved in such situations 
smoking is banned on us domestic flights

of course you film fans are familiar with the 
classic killers of sheep or the unforgettable primary how 
about the evergreen meshes of the afternoon 
ok so maybe not 
those three headscratchers were among 25 films selected to join 
the national film registry of the library of congress 
the registrys second list announced thursday in washington 
tilted heavily toward the often neglected documentary which 
comprised 20 percent of the selections 
included were the admirable harlan county usa barbara 
kopples 1977 oscarwinning study of a kentucky coal miners 
strike and the river pare lorentzs lyrical plea for soil 
reclamation made for the government in 1937 
the other three documentaries selected may be worthy of 
treasure status also but are they more deserving than city 
lights stagecoach or rear window which didnt make the 
list in 1989 or this year 
james h billington the librarian of congress explained that 
films on the list were chosen because they impressively display 
the depth and variety of the american creative spirit in 
filmmaking 
this is not academy awards night billington said these 
are not annual lists of the best american films 
the new list shows a healthy regard for the comedy howard 
hawks wacky bringing up baby from 1938 harold lloyds best 
silent the freshman from 1925 greta garbos only comedy 
ninotchka a 1939 film directed by ernst lubitsch and the 
madcap 1933 marx brothers feature duck soup 
the musical was recognized with the best of fred astaire and 
ginger rogers top hat from 1935 the maurice chevalier 
romance love me tonight produced and directed by rouben 
mamoulian in 1932 and walt disneys fantasia from 1940 
coincidentally fantasia is in rerelease and winning far 
more praise and patronage 11 million in 10 days than when it was 
first shown 
some choices were unassailable all about eve all quiet 
on the western front dodsworth the godfather raging 
bull red river rebel without a cause sullivans 
travels the treasure of the sierra madre 
john cassavetes 1974 a woman under the influence was a more 
idiosyncratic selection cassavetes was a pacesetter of the new 
realism but his films including this one were often overlong and 
selfindulgent 
last years list produced only one headscratcher the 
learning tree gordon parks 1969 reminiscence of his kansas 
childhood admirable but hardly a classic 
charles burnett made killers of sheep in 1977 meshes of 
the afternoon is an 18minute film directed by maya deren in 1943 
and primary is a time inc film made in 1960 
all about eve was made in 1950 by director joseph l 
mankiewicz all quiet on the western front was directed by 
lewis milestone in 1930 dodsworth was a 1936 film directed by 
william wyler francis ford coppola made the godfather in 1972 
martin scorsese directed raging bull in 1980 nicholas ray 
directed james dean in rebel without a cause in 1955 hawks 
made red river in 1948 sullivans travels is a preston 
sturges film made in 1941 john huston directed the treasure of 
the sierra madre in 1948 
also named to the 1990 list were edwin s porters the great 
train robbery a 12minute classic made in 1903 john fords 
how green was my valley from 1941 and frank capras its a 
wonderful life from 1946 
the 1988 law that established the national film registry called 
for 25 registry listings each year for three successive years it 
requires companies to label videocassettes of films on the list 
that have been colorized or otherwise tampered with 
this years list was based on 1500 nominations from the public 
it was narrowed by a 14member national film preservation board 
representing the academy of motion picture arts and sciences the 
american film institute movie and television producers directors 
broadcasters screen writers the screen actors guild of america 
film critics and scholars 
the final choices were made by billington a cultural historian 
and movie buff based on consultations with advisers including the 
staff of the librarys division of motion picture broadcasting and 
recorded sound 
films are eligible for the registry 10 years after their first 
theatrical release they need not necessarily be american films 
the library said but the first 50 movies in the registry all were 
made in the united states

a new poll indicates 70 percent of the people in 
britain germany france italy and spain support the use of 
military force to drive iraq from kuwait 
the survey commissioned by british kuwaitis also says 69 
percent approve of president bushs decision to send armed forces 
to saudi arabia and the persian gulf 
britons are the most hawkish of the europeans 86 percent 
percent back military action to free kuwait and 80 percent support 
bushs action according to the poll released thursday by gallup a 
leading british poll company 
in a corresponding us poll 70 percent of americans said they 
supported bushs decision to move troops into the gulf 
it seems george bush would do better in this country than his 
own gordon heald gallup managing director told a news 
conference 
heald said british public opinion had hardened since a gallup 
poll in september when only 75 percent supported the use of force 
to free kuwait 
an average of 67 percent across the five countries said they 
support the use of military action to protect the wests oil 
supplies the survey found 
sixtyone percent overall favor military action to defend saudi 
arabia and the gulf states fiftyeight percent overall support the 
use of military force to topple iraqi president saddam hussein 
researchers found 
youssef alyoussef a spokesman for britains kuwaiti community 
said we have always viewed britain and the united states as 
being the world leaders in the gulf crisis it is very pleasing to 
see this is reflected in public opinion 
britain france italy and spain have contributed to the 
usled international force which has been deployed in the persian 
gulf since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 germanys constitution 
prevents it from doing the same 
gallup questioned 500 people in each of the five countries for 
the poll commissioned by the londonbased association for free 
kuwait the margin of error is 5 percent 
heald said 86 percent of britons support military action to free 
westerners prevented from leaving kuwait and iraq sixtythree 
percent support military action even if it means putting hostages 
lives at risk he said 
i find this staggering because britain has by far the most 
hostages heald said the foreign office says 1400 britons are 
still trapped in iraq and kuwait 
in france the survey found 75 percent support military action 
to free kuwait and 82 percent back military action to free the 
hostages but only 49 percent support military action if it means 
putting hostages at risk 
seventythree percent are firmly behind bushs response to the 
iraqi invasion 
in germany 63 percent favor the use of force to free kuwait 70 
percent back military action to free the hostages and 75 percent 
support bushs decision 
heald said spain and italy were the least supportive only 59 
percent of italians and 66 percent of spaniards back military 
action to free kuwait 
only 59 percent of italians and 53 percent of spaniards approve 
of bushs decision to move troops into the gulf

the soviet union soon will be watching big 
brother 
the movie version of george orwells bleak classic 1984 
depicting the terrifying world of an omnipresent government will 
have its soviet premiere in the next few months its executive 
producer said 
marvin j rosenblum a chicago lawyer who bought the rights for 
the movie in 1980 from orwells widow said the film will be shown 
in moscow in conjunction with a conference sponsored by the 
cinemacentre on art politics and freedom of expression 
its like breaking down the berlin wall rosenblum said 
thursday night 
orwell wrote his fictional account of total conformity thought 
control and constant surveillance in 1948 and published it in 1949 
the soviet government didnt even acknowledge its existence until 
1984 when it published a review 
excerpts from the novel including the omnipresent warning of 
orwells imaginary regime that big brother is watching you 
first were published in soviet newspapers in 1988 as tight 
restrictions on information eased under soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev 
but soviet people had read copies smuggled into the country 
rosenblum said ive talked to a lot of russians and theres 
always been a lot of interest in it all the intellectuals are 
aware of it 
while a date for the showing has not been set rosenblum said he 
expects it will come in early december or january he is about to 
begin negotiations with soviet distributors for nationwide showings 
of the film made in 1984 and starring john hurt and richard burton 
in his last movie before his death that year 
no political problems exist in negotiating a distribution 
contract rosenblum said previously only one agency had permission 
to import films but that has changed 
now just about anybody can do it rosenblum said adding 
that a person must be sure whom hes dealing with to make sure he 
gets paid 
im willing to take payment in rubles he said im just 
going to look for a reputable distributor whos going to do a good 
job getting it out to the russian people 
the film has been shown in at least 20 countries but not in 
most of the soviet bloc 
rosenblum bought the rights to distribute the film in the soviet 
union for an undisclosed amount from the british company virgin 
vision whose parent company had put up the 8 million to film the 
story 
orwell wrote 1984 in 1948 as the cold war between the united 
states and the soviet union was turning into a deep freeze orwell 
said the novel was meant to depict any totalitarian government 
left or right and not the soviet union in particular 
but the book was often read as an indictment of the soviet 
system and became required reading in many american high schools a 
generation of students learned of the world of doublespeak where 
war means peace the ministry of truth disburses lies and the 
thought police can set straight anyone who doesnt love big 
brother 
an earlier movie version of 1984 came out in 1955 and was 
received so poorly orwells widow vowed never to let it be filmed 
again

the senate early today approved 23 of 
president bushs nominees for diplomatic posts but only after 
republican leaders threatened to hold gop opponents of the 
nominations on duty for an allnight session 
among the nominees approved on a block vote after the senate 
completed action on a deficitreduction bill was george fleming 
jones as ambassador to the tiny south american state of guyana 
sen jesse helms of north carolina the top republican on the 
senate foreign relations committee and a frequent thorn in the side 
of state department officials had vehemently opposed jones 
nomination 
however holds that any single senator can put on a nominee 
to block or delay senate confirmation were removed from the 23 
nominees thursday after republican leader bob dole of kansas 
suggested keeping the senate in session through the night to act on 
them 
these people have families and have made plans dole said 
its unfair to keep them twisting in the wind 
under the senates complex parliamentary rues continuing to 
block their confirmation would have required opponents but hardly 
anyone else to remain on the senate floor 
helms according to sources who asked not to be identified has 
suspected jones a career foreign service officer of being 
involved in the 1986 leak of a secret chilean report about the 
death of an american during a violent protest in santiago the 
senator was infuriated when his own office was blamed for the leak 
among the other nominations of career foreign service officers 
confirmed to ambassadorial posts today were eugene scassa for 
belize richard c brown for uruguay michael martin skol for 
venezuela stephen rogers for swaziland and gordon l streeb for

george washington has been found innocent of 
treason against the british crown in a mock trial which featured 
real british and american judges and lawyers and actors playing 
historical figures 
the participants playing washington thomas jefferson benjamin 
franklin and lord north the british prime minister during the 
american revolution testified at the trial set in 1779 which was 
filmed thursday for television 
the american statesmen in 18th century dress were played by 
members of the philadelphiabased royal pickwickians a troupe 
which combines acting with historical research north was played by 
prof bruce collins also in period costume 
washington speaking through bill sommerfield who played him 
said he was elated by the unanimous ruling of the three judges 
justice has been done he said weve been vindicated and 
now i must go back and pursue the war with vigor and bring it to a 
just conclusion 
the armistice ending the revolutionary war was not announced 
until 1783 
the team of american defense attorneys argued that washington 
acted in selfdefense since the british had declared war in effect 
with their litany of abuses hurting the colonists economically and 
depriving them of liberties 
we have a right to defend ourselves to resist those acts of 
tyranny james figliulo another chicago lawyer told the court 
we ask only to be free we ask only to govern ourselves we tried 
time and time again to address our grievances and make our point 
those petitions remonstrances and requests were repeatedly 
rejected by the parliament and the king 
the defense argued that lord north and king george iii had 
treated the colonists like slaves 
prosecuting washington under the treason act of 1351 was sydney 
kentridge the human rights lawyer who defended steven biko in 
south africa he argued that the conditions in the colonies could 
not have been so bad since 221000 people had migrated to america 
between 176075 
the moral pretensions of this case are illfounded 
kentridge said what is this slavery that the colonies say they 
have which thousands of people cross the atlantic to be part of 
in his summing up kentridge called on the three judges hearing 
the case not to find washington guilty of treason which is 
punishable by hanging but to make a declaration that washington 
was guilty of treason and allow him to return to america 
the three judges lord bridge of harwich a senior law lord 
sir patrick neill a british appellate judge and us federal 
judge a sherman christensen from utah ruled that the way britain 
governed the colonies forced the americans to react 
the colonists only as a last resort were driven to the 
declaration of independence lord bridge said 
the defense attorneys wives and other americans in the 
audience of 280 which paid 34 to watch the trial waved tiny 
colonial american flags as the verdict was announced 
the international scholarships for young lawyers will receive 
the proceeds from the trial which will be shown at a later date on 
british and us television 
the trial came about after lord goff a member of the house of 
lords made the treason charge at a june meeting of the american 
inns of court foundation 
lawyers from chicago and new jersey took up the gauntlet and 
traveled to the historyladen lincolns inn for the trial 
the inn an oasis of georgian office buildings and tidy gardens 
in central london was founded in the 14th century it is the 
oldest of four inns of court which train and admit barristers 
lawyers who argue cases in britains senior courts 
barristersintraining must spend 18 months following senior 
barristers through the courts and the inns socalled because many 
barristers used to work and live there

benazir bhuttos political opponents 
have found a potent response to growing sympathy for the ousted 
prime minister americabashing 
president ghulam ishaq khan ousted ms bhutto accusing her of 
corruption and mismanagement on aug 6 she is running in next 
weeks general election despite facing a court battle 
khans handpicked caretaker government is pressing an 
aggressive campaign against her it has filed charge after charge 
against her her fatherinlaw and a halfdozen former cabinet 
ministers alleging they used their power to get rich fast it 
jailed her husband on charges of kidnapping and extortion 
the government also branded ms bhutto an unbeliever an enemy 
of islam and a traitor 
but the initial onslaught only damaged the credibility of the 
president and the caretaker government making both appear 
vindictive and generating sympathy for ms bhutto and her populist 
centerleft pakistan peoples party 
it seemed nothing could stop her unexpected rebound 
then us ambassador robert oakley in a speech in washington 
noted that ms bhuttos opponents are not above reproach 
pakistanis have voiced similar views but many were outraged by 
oakleys comments 
newspapers wrote numerous editorials accusing washington of 
blatant interference and suggested us influence over this country 
of 110 million people should be greatly curtailed some caretaker 
ministers called oakleys statements undiplomatic one demanded 
that washington replace him 
pakistan is the thirdlargest recipient of american aid after 
egypt and israel it also has been conduit for an estimated 300 
million in assistance to the moslem resistance during the 
12yearold war in afghanistan 
the oakley fire subsided briefly then 53 us senators 
reportedly wrote a letter to president bush warning that economic 
and military aid would be cut off if ms bhutto were disqualified 
from the election 
fortyfour pakistani senators wrote a blistering response 
saying that was a matter for the court not the us congress to 
decide 
in the rhetoric of the peoples party ms bhutto became the 
american puppet someone willing to give away her countrys 
sovereignty said one western diplomat insisting on anonymity 
it played nicely into her opponents hands the diplomat 
said they parlayed it nicely into an election issue and dampened 
the ppp now the momentum may be swinging the other way 
ms bhutto who was educated in the united states is considered 
by many in the west especially the united states as a symbol of 
democracy in south asia she has capitalized on that image and 
cemented strong ties to washington 
an undercurrent of antiamericanism always runs through 
pakistan which tends to blame the united states for all its 
problems during times of crises 
it surfaced again on oct 1 when washington suspended a 573 
million aid package demanding greater assurances that pakistan 
neither possesses nor wants to possess nuclear weapons 
the caretaker government blamed ms bhutto for the aid 
suspension a charge she dismissed 
ms bhutto her mother and the ppp have been lobbying in the 
united states to get our aid stopped caretaker prime minister 
ghulam mustafa jatoi charged thursday referring to the pakistan 
peoples party 
they have been working against the national interest for the 
sake of their petty benefit to pressure the government of pakistan 
and to win in the election he said 
even though he mentioned no one by name pakistans most 
powerful soldier army chiefofstaff gen mirza aslam beg issued 
his own warning to the americans and to pakistans next prime 
minister military sources said it was the first time he has made 
such comments 
in an hourlong speech to his troops earlier this week beg vowed 
pakistan would not compromise its principles he warned leaders not 
to look for outside direction or guidance 
and those looking for such political guidance and support for 
promoting their political ambitions are certain to be frustrated 
he said 
theres a lot of nationalism now in pakistan said one 
commonwealth diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
theres a growing feeling that pakistan needs to be more aligned 
with the islamic world and less with the western world

a scientist dismissed from an environmental 
protection agency panel on secondhand cigarette smoke after 
vigorous tobacco industry lobbying says he will fight to be 
reinstated 
the industry charged that the scientists long and intense 
involvement with the antismoking movement makes him biased but 
colleagues said his credentials are impeccable 
dr david burns of the university of california san diego 
learned thursday he had been removed from the epas scientific 
advisory board studying the dangers of secondhand cigarette smoke 
the dismissal damages my credibility and the credibility of 
the panel and as a matter of public policy i feel compelled to try 
to reverse the decision he said it is a substantial insult to 
my professional status and i cant let that go unanswered 
stephen bayard manager of the epa project to assess passive 
smokings health risks said ive never seen anything like this 
in 12 years at the agency 
im disturbed about this he said i think it was lousy i 
think it shows undue pressure personally from the tobacco 
companies and the congress 
burns said he had been told in an aug 10 letter he was on the 
epa panel the same day the tobacco institute an industry group 
wrote epa administrator william reilly protesting burns selection 
frankly we are mystified how an individual with dr burnss 
long and intense involvement with the antismoking movement can be 
expected to contribute to a reasonable objective examination of 
the epa reports the letter said 
burns has worked on the surgeon generals smoking reports since 
the 1970s he was editor of the 1986 report that said passive 
smoking can cause disease including lung cancer in healthy 
nonsmokers 
brennan dawson a tobacco institute spokeswoman said we want 
a fair panel that will look at it objectively our concern is that 
mr burns is unable to do that 
on sept 18 rep thomas bliley rva wrote the epa without 
mentioning burns by name but urging the panel consist of 
qualified individuals who have not already prejudged this issue in 
any manner 
bliley is a strong tobacco industry ally philip morris is the 
largest private employer in his congressional district bayard said 
blileys letter was factor was a factor in burns dismissal 
burns said i am surprised that an epa review would be swayed 
by pressure from the tobacco industry on an issue of science when 
the tobacco industry is on record as disputing even the scientific 
evidence that cigarette smoking is related to lung cancer with 
active smokers 
robert flaak of the advisory panel who told burns he had been 
removed said he could not comment on the decision 
donald shopland coordinator of the national cancer institutes 
smoking control program defended burns his longtime colleague 
i dont know of anyone else you could point to that would have 
the degree of expertise he would possess on smoking in general and 
the whole issue of passive smoking in particular shopland said 
bayard said burns was among 16 or 17 researchers who already had 
submitted a preliminary review of the epas report on passive 
smokings health risks and burns comments were by far the best 
comments that i received 
bayard said he was concerned burns exclusion would compromise 
the final reports quality 
if i feel theres tampering with the committee am i going to 
get a good review out of it i have my concerns he said

an aids carrier was convicted of exposing an 
8yearold boy to the killer virus in a sexual assault case that 
was the first test of the states novel aids exposure law 
randall lee dempsey 34 was found guilty thursday of criminal 
transmission of hiv the organism that causes aids and aggravated 
sexual assault 
jurors deliberated more than 11 hours before convicting dempsey 
of forcing the boy to perform oral sex the boy had testified 
against dempsey 
dempsey could face up to 30 years in prison on the assault count 
and a maximum sevenyear term on the aids exposure count 
the illinois aids exposure law which took effect in september 
1989 requires only that offenders know they are infected when they 
engage in activities that could transmit the virus to others 
conviction does not require that the victim develop aids one of 
the main ways the disease is spread is through sexual contact 
dempsey of rural marion in southcentral illinois twice tested 
positive for hiv the aids virus the boy now 9 has not been 
tested to see if he carries the virus he was attacked in may and 
his mother said ultimately he will be tested 
the man who moved back to illinois from california after 
learning he carried the aids virus denied the charges and claimed 
the boy fabricated the tale with his mothers help 
the boy reported the sexual encounter the following morning 
after dempsey tried to silence him with promises of a pet turtle 
williamson county prosecutor charles garnati said 
 
defense lawyer larry broeking told jurors during closing 
arguments the defendant uncategorically denies that it 
happened

passage of convoys ensure the safety of relief personnel and fully 
support the relief program it said 
officials from the world food program and the un childrens 
fund have made safepassage arrangements with the government for 
the areas it controls and will meet shortly with unita 
representatives to make similar plans for rebelheld territory 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar will launch an 
international fund appeal for the program in november 
the first phase of the program from october 1990 through the 
end of march 1991 is expected to cost about 75 million mostly 
for food and logistics but with about 225 earmarked for nonfood 
supplies and services 
angola once one of southern africas more prosperous nations 
has been reduced to abject poverty by civil war since 1975 with 
jonas savimbis rebels who take their name unita from the 
portuguese acronym for the national union for the total liberation 
of angola 
perez de cuellar said he hoped that the relief operation will 
help to promote the peace process that is already under way 
savimbi and dos santos met for peace talks in june 1989 in 
gbadolite zaire to sign peace accords but the process broke down 
over misunderstandings over savimbis future political role and the 
war resumed 
cuban troops are withdrawing from angola however under the 
southern africa accords that led to namibias independence and the 
soviet union and united states are trying to help their proxies 
resolve the conflict

swastikas and a star of david will be deleted 
from two companies computer games after the antidefamation league 
of bnai brith complained the games makers said 
a spokeswoman for the new yorkbased adl said the league 
contacted nec technologies and nintendo of america earlier this 
year asking that the symbols be removed from two computer games and 
an instruction booklet 
in letters to adl both companies informed the league that 
they had taken action to have the offensive symbols removed 
spokeswoman barbara walden said thursday 
walden said necs syber corp game uses swastikas as weapons 
in action scenes the object of its neutopia game is to destroy 
bosses one of whom wears the sixpointed star of david on his 
chest 
she said nintendos legend of zelda has a swastika in its 
instruction booklet 
grant schneider a spokesman for wood dale illbased nec said 
the company was surprised by the adl request 
we have thirdparty software developers who develop the 
games schneider said somehow whoever programmed these things 
apparently put these in 
we notified the game developers and said they had to 
remove these from the games he said 
he said if any consumer who purchased one of the games is 
offended nec will replace the game with another of the consumers 
choosing 
schneider also said nec would beef up the screening process to 
make sure offensive images dont appear in games in the future 
richard lindner a spokesman for the redmond washbased 
nintendo said the symbol in the legend of zelda instruction 
booklet is not technically a swastika 
its something called a manji lindner said its a 
reversed swastika symbol that has significance in the hindu 
religions and other asian religions 
but lindner said nintendo will remove the symbol and further 
has invited the adl to conduct a sensitivity training session for 
its game developers 
nintendo has a pretty stringent software development 
standard lindner said things that are offensive to any 
particular religious group are not supposed to be in games

tractor pulls can produce not only noise and 
skidmarks but potentially hazardous levels of carbon monoxide 
federal health officials say 
tractor pulls typically feature a dozen or so truck rigs 
outfitted with superpowerful engines competing in pulling 50ton 
sleds across a dirt floor 
carbon monoxide levels during two tractor pulls in a winnipeg 
manitoba hockey arena represented a potential health hazard to 
both participants and observers the us centers for disease 
control reported thursday 
carbon monoxide a colorless odorless gas in all exhaust and 
smoke can cause headache dizziness cardiac problems and even 
death 
the problems may not occur at other tractor pulls us health 
officials arent sure whether the problem was peculiar to winnipeg 
arena where attempts to decrease carbon monoxide levels didnt 
work 
i wish i knew said dr ruth etzel a researcher with the 
center for environmental health at the atlantabased cdc we 
would certainly like to see some data so we would know if this is a 
problem 
we were quite surprised at the levels of carbon monoxide that 
can build up in these things 
the findings from the 1988 events at winnipeg arena prompted the 
cancellation of a february 1989 tractor pull in the building 
constructed in the early 1950s 
health officials didnt report any incidents of carbon monoxide 
poisoning during either winnipeg event although some members of 
the ambulance crew did report severe headaches etzel said 
but the officials urged arena officials not to allow future 
tractor pulls and the arena management agreed said rod thiessen 
director of operations for winnipeg arena theyve never come 
back and made them safe enough he said 
at the start of a february 1988 pull at winnipeg health 
inspectors measured airborne carbon monoxide levels averaging 62 
parts per million nearly twice the winnipeg health departments 
recommended indoor onehour guideline of 33 parts per million by 
the events end the level had increased to 262 parts per million 
for a november 1988 event there roof louvers were opened the 
time of the event was extended and one fewer pull was run still 
according to the cdc carbon monoxide levels then went from 78 
parts per million to 436 
adverse health effects have been reported in people breathing a 
constant 15 parts per million the cdc said 
mike weber a spokesman for tnt one of the largest tractorpull 
promoters said his group has never had any problems like those 
at the winnipeg arena 
we present motor sports events in all the major arenas across 
the country and we take every precaution we do constantly monitor 
our emitted fumes its worked very well for us said weber 
director of public relations for the united states hot rod 
association sanctioning body for tnt events tnt was not involved 
in the winnipeg pulls he said

opponents of the us military buildup 
in the middle east are resurrecting 1960sstyle peace activism for 
nationwide protests saturday among the demonstrators will be labor 
unions and veterans groups 
rallies scheduled for at least 15 major us cities will cap a 
week of smaller protests and the debut of a televised peace message 
starring ron kovic the hero crippled in the vietnam war who became 
a staunch antiwar activist and wrote his story in born on the 
fourth of july 
a wideranging coalition of groups is sponsoring the weekend 
protests demonstrators staged a 60sstyle teachin rally at 
harvard university on thursday and other protests elsewhere earlier 
in the week 
organizers hope the mass protests will sap support for the 
persian gulf military buildup arising after iraqs conquest of 
kuwait in early august 
once people see thousands out in the street we can build on 
that said charles twist spokesman for the new york coalition to 
stop us intervention in the middle east 
the 30second tv spot starring kovic debuted thursday and was 
set for broadcast in 50 us cities in it kovic says american 
troops are risking their lives not to defend democracy but to 
protect the big oil companies 
money for the tv message was raised from veterans and peace 
groups kovic also is scheduled to address a rally in los angeles 
on saturday titled stop the us war for oil bring back our 
sons and daughters 
the governments doing a good job at a media blitz for the war 
in the middle east but very little information is getting out 
about how this crisis was created or what the underlying motives 
are said eric larsen a marine reserve noncommissioned officer 
who says he will refuse to go to saudi arabia if called there 
once they have the facts people will turn against this 
policy he said 
at least one counterdemonstration was planned for saturday by 
atlantaarea families of soldiers stationed in the middle east 
the cost of the us troop deployment will figure prominently in 
protesters rhetoric organizers said 
the front pages are full of the budget crisis twist said 
it doesnt take much to make the connection that were spending 
billions to keep our troops there at the same time were cutting 
social security 
that has helped draw labor unions to the movement 
youve got inflation budget cuts joblessness and now the 
war said nan genger a united auto workers official helping 
stage a rally saturday in boston right now working people are 
under attack 
veterans groups also have joined the coalition 
the days of us veterans blindly supporting their government 
are over since vietnam said winston warfield president of the 
400member smedley d butler brigade of veterans for peace 
besides los angeles and boston rallies were planned in 
albuquerque nm birmingham ala chicago cleveland honolulu 
houston minneapolis new york olympia wash portland ore san

italys no 1 police official says secret service 
agents covered up evidence that would show a domestic airliner that 
blew up over the mediterranean ten years ago was shot down news 
reports said 
the dc9 jetliner of now defunct itavia airlines was flying 
from bologna to palermo sicily on june 27 1980 when it blew 
apart all 81 people aboard were killed 
italy at the time was wracked by terrorist attacks from both the 
left and the right and a bomb was first suspected but 
investigation over the years especially after the retrieval of 
the undersea wreckage seven years later pointed to the 
possibility of a missile 
vincenzo parisi chief of the national police force told a 
parliamentary committee wednesday that he believes a missile shot 
down the plane newspapers reported 
he was also quoted as saying that while elements in the italian 
secret services acted to cover up the downing they werent 
involved in the missilefiring 
he did not elaborate on the alleged coverup investigators have 
complained that the secret services were not fully cooperating in 
the probe and that key radar tapes were missing 
the head of the military branch of the secret services at the 
time of the plane crash was a general who was later identified as a 
member of propanganda due p2 a masonic lodge that sought to 
destabilize the italian government 
parisi who became assistant director of the civilian secret 
service a few weeks after the plane went down didnt identify the 
nationality of the missile however he ruled out us involvement 
the reports said 
none of the past investigating commissions has identified the 
nationality of the missile if there were one although italy 
france the united states and libya have been named in media 
reports as the chief possibilities 
a libyan connection was raised with the discovery reported in 
july 1980 of a libyan mig jetfighter which had crashed in southern 
italy some reports contended that us fighter planes were chasing 
a libyan jet over the mediterranean and fired a heatseeking 
missile that mistakenly hit the passenger aircraft 
france was implicated in some reports because of the presence of 
an aircraft carrier in the mediterranean the evening of the 
tragedy 
french us and nato officials have denied there was any 
military activity in the skies that night 
parisi in his testimony before the commission discounted the 
theory that the aircraft was accidentally hit by a missile 
the case must be inserted in the national and international 
terroristic panorama of the last 20 years la stampa a national 
daily quoted him as saying 
parisis testimony was the first by a high government official 
to link the missilefiring theory to terrorism 
the plane tragedy known as the ustica case from the name of 
the tiny island near where the craft went down has been one of the 
more sensational unsolved cases among several italian tragedies 
parisis account seemed to raise more questions than provide 
answers 
i cant give the origin nor the nationality of the missile 
another account by il messaggero quoted parisi as saying i 
accuse no one because i havent the elements to do so

a device that takes over the function of the 
heart pumping oxygenated blood throughout the body could more 
than double the number of people who survive sudden cardiac arrest 
researchers say 
in its first human test the pump kept blood flowing through one 
woman for 15 hours until doctors got her heart working properly 
again 
had they not gotten approval to use this machine i can 
question whether id be alive said sharon wilczynski 29 who 
survived her heart attack although she was clinically dead several 
times during the ordeal 
what else could they have done she asked 
about 10 percent of people who suffer sudden heart attacks 
survive the pumping device could save an additional 10 percent to 
15 percent dr samuel tisherman of the university of pittsburgh 
medical school said thursday 
this is just the beginning in new vistas in resuscitation 
tisherman said 
the device adds oxygen and heats the blood outside the body 
before pumping it back inside it is called an emergency 
closedchest cardiopulmonary bypass it is designed for use after 
the failure of manual resuscitation methods commonly known as cpr 
if cpr doesnt work within a few minutes we normally are 
dealing with a hopeless situation said dr peter safar who 
developed cpr and directs the universitys international 
resuscitation research center 
the equipment assembled by pitt researchers is a smaller version 
of heartlung machines that sustain patients during open heart 
surgery safar said it consists of an oxygenator oxygen tank 
pump heat exchanger battery pack and several feet of tubing 
two plastic tubes are inserted into a patients femoral artery 
and vein at the groin area blood flow is maintained so the brain 
and other vital organs are not damaged while attempts are made to 
restart and stabilize the heart 
although paramedics reached miss wilczynski within five minutes 
of her attack on july 26 and administered cpr her heart beat only 
intermittently and stopped before she reached presbyterian 
university hospitals emergency room 
she was hooked to the bypass machine within 50 minutes 
after two hours her heart was beating but unstable so doctors 
let her sleep while the machine maintained blood flow the next day 
her rested heart stabilized 
tests indicate she suffered no brain damage 
we went to my sisters recently and passed a funeral 
procession miss wilczynski said from her home in coraopolis 
it was an odd feeling like there but for the grace of god go

a court has confirmed the ouster of 
benazir bhuttos government handing the former prime minister her 
second legal setback in less than a week 
acting chief justice saeeduzzaman sadiqqi on thursday also 
upheld the dismissal of the sindh provincial legislature controlled 
by ms bhuttos populist pakistan peoples party 
ms bhutto is not expected to challenge either ruling fearing 
an appeal could delay the oct 24 parliamentary elections a party 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
the sindh high courts decisions mirrored a ruling by the lahore 
high court last week in pakistans prosperous punjab province a 
stronghold of ms bhuttos political opponents 
the lahore court upheld her dismissal ruling corruption and 
mismanagement had paralyzed her government 
both rulings are expected to help ms bhuttos political 
opponents stem the momentum her party has gained in recent weeks 
three lawyers all members of ms bhuttos party filed lawsuits 
asking the court to rule her dismissal unconstitutional and to 
restore her government and the provincial government 
but sadiqqi told the packed courtroom it was too late to put the 
brakes on the election with less than a week to go 
it is difficult to reverse the election process the judge 
said 
ms bhutto joined with two smaller liberal parties to form the 
peoples democratic alliance her key opponent is a coalition of 
nine parties espousing ideologies ranging from rightwing to 
religious fundamentalism 
president ghulam ishaq khan dismissed her government aug 6 and 
in a scathing critique of her 20 months in power accused her of 
corruption and power abuse that crippled the national assembly the 
lawmaking lower house of parliament 
kahn also criticized the 37yearold former prime ministers 
inability to stem the growing tide of violence in sindh her home 
province where at least 500 people had been killed since last may 
sadiqqi said the president was justified in his decision 
ms bhuttos party and a small indian immigrant party have been 
blamed for much of the violence 
the mohajir qami movement or refugee peoples party 
representing indians who immigrated to pakistan after partition of 
the subcontinent are bitter opponents of sindhi nationalists who 
want greater autonomy or independence from pakistan

on thursday dealers said

floor under the dollar at 1500 german marks and 12600 yen 
however they said the room for increases above those levels was 
also limited 
the dollar has been declining on expectations of a cut in the 
us federal funds interest rate the protracted and unsuccessful 
attempts to cut the us budget and a belief by some traders that 
the united states is on the verge of recession dealers said

the owners of a houston gallery fear 
antisemitism may be behind the theft of three drawings depicting 
scenes from the holocaust and three other works by the same artist 
officials of hooksepstein galleries said thursday more costly 
works were ignored as six sketches by respected artist jerome 
witkin valued at 5850 were removed early wednesday 
was it just plain art theft or was it antisomething art 
theft gallery owner charles hooks said its a puzzlement 
its just maddening 
hooks said the thief singled out renderings of the crematorium 
floor at auschwitz and the womens barracks and a latrine area in 
the birkenau concentration camp then removed a nude and two 
drawings of women from another wall 
we think it was an antisemitic act said hooks wife geri 
this is the first show we have had here in 20 years that has any 
religious significance 
maybe they were trying to throw us off by taking the women 
mrs hooks said 
police report no progress in the burglary which hooks said 
occurred about 4 am when the glass front door was shattered 
police responded to an alarm within minutes but the burglar or 
burglars had disappeared 
the owners said they do not believe the thief felt rushed the 
slender brass rods that held the pictures were still in place and 
nothing else in the gallery was disturbed 
the three holocaust sketches hanging on a wall facing the 
entrance were carefully lifted from their places in a row of four 
pictures 
hooks said the thief had to brazenly walk by a wallsize window 
facing the street to remove the three other pictures

with little apparent controversy the city 
health department has begun dispensing birth control pills and 
condoms at seven middle and high schools 
the clinics began distributing the contraceptives last month to 
reduce the risk of pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases 
said elias dorsey acting city health commissioner 
health clinics at selected schools have counseled sexually 
active city students and prescribed contraceptives since 1985 as 
part of a broad range of medical care offered to youngsters who 
might not otherwise get it middle school begins with sixth grade 
with kids 14 or 15 years old you have to do it right now 
dorsey said 
the distribution of condoms has become the subject of a major 
policy debate this fall for school boards in talbot county md 
and new york but the baltimore school board did not consider the 
issue because it was a health department matter board president 
joseph l smith said 
a survey of parents this spring found overwhelming support for 
dispensing contraceptives at the clinics said dr john santelli 
the health department official who runs the program both he and 
school officials said the policy change had not been controversial 
abstinence from sex is an option discussed with students at the 
clinics and in health classes santelli said 
about 5000 students around twothirds of the total at the 
seven selected schools are enrolled in the clinics santelli said 
baltimore led the nations big cities in the percentage of 
babies born to teenagers in 1988 the most recent year for which 
figures are available and teenagers accounted for 30 percent of 
the citys gonorrhea cases last year according to the citys 
health department 
parents must sign a consent form before their children are 
enrolled in the clinics for most types of medical care except 
treatment for sexually transmitted diseases pregnancy alcoholism 
drug abuse and dispersal of contraceptives

yugoslavias parliament today moved 
to defuse mounting ethnic and political tension and warnings of 
impending civil war by naming a croatian reformer to the countrys 
collective presidency 
a crucial parliamentary debate on whether yugoslavia remains a 
federation or becomes a looser alliance was then postponed until at 
least november 
the two moves indicated that the countrys quarrelling political 
leaders had decided to put off at least for now a showdown in their 
power struggle over yugoslavias future 
deputies loudly applauded a conciliatory speech by outgoing 
president borisav jovic a serb who holds the annually rotating 
chairmanship of the collective ruling body 
all bridges have not been burned there are still 
possibilities for the crisis to be overcome jovic said after the 
croatian stjepan mesic was named to the presidency 
we are obliged not only to offer hope to the upset and 
frightened citizens but i believe strongly we can justify the 
trust they laid in us in these hard times jovic added 
communistruled serbia staunchly opposes the confederacy plan 
pushed by slovenia and croatia 
under it yugoslavia would become a loose alliance of sovereign 
states there would be no central rule or national capital and 
each state would decide how it would deal with each other on an 
individual basis 
serbia calls for a modern federation that would keep central 
rule in belgrade the capital of the country and serbia 
deputies from serbia the largest republic and croatias 
traditional rival had earlier blocked the election of stjepan 
mesic charging he was a croatian nationalist who seeks 
independence for his republic 
but those objections apparently were dropped following moves 
within the eightmember presidency to ease tension 
the presidency contains representatives from each of 
yugoslavias six republics and two provinces croatia had 
officially been without a representative in a dispute over mesics 
nomination he was proclaimed a member to the applause of hundreds 
of deputies 
in the growing split between the countrys communist and 
noncommunist republics croatia on thursday ordered its militia 
reserves to mobilize 
the order was reported by the republics television on thursday 
and rebroadcast by serbian television in belgrade it said only 
that croatia was conducting a routine check of reserve units 
the national news agency tanjug said it had learned that arms 
had been distributed to some reserve forces 
leading yugoslav politicians warned hours before the 
mobilization that ethnic and political struggles could lead to 
civil war 
croatian president franjo tudjman said if necessary the 
entire croatian people at home and abroad will fight to protect the 
democracy it won 
croatia would not tolerate any solutions that have proved 
fatal for the economic and democratic development he said 
croatia and slovenia elected centerright governments this year 
and are seeking greater independence belgrade is in serbia which 
is still controlled by communists 
in recent months members of the serbian minority in croatia 
have staged demonstrations and seized arms from police and serbia 
has talked of absorbing areas of croatia where there are large 
numbers of serbs 
slovenias delegate in the collective presidency janez 
drnovsek said that serbias communist leaders were forcing the 
federal concept that could only lead to the breakup of the 
country 
but he added at this moment it would be extremely risky to 
stop a dialogue between republics that would lead to the final 
breakup

in a stunning defeat for prime 
minister margaret thatcher the centrist liberal democratic party 
today won this conservative party stronghold in a special 
parliamentary election 
the liberal democrats took eastbourne a prosperous south 
england coastal town in a huge 205 percent swing against the 
government balloting was to replace a legislator slain by the ira 
the tory trouncing was among the worst electoral setbacks 
suffered by mrs thatcher since she came to power in 1979 it 
prompted speculation she might feel forced to shelve any plan to 
call a general election next year a year before her third 
fiveyear term expires 
still the result had scant impact on mrs thatchers control of 
the 650member house of commons where the conservatives have 373 
seats labor 226 and the liberal democrats now have 20 
the rest are split among minority regional parties 
the victory by liberal democrat david bellotti 47 appeared in 
part a backlash to the tory campaign theme that a vote for the 
opposition would be a moral victory for terrorism 
it marked a revolt against government economic policies of 
trying to squeeze 109 percent inflation with nearly two years of 
high interest rates and an unpopular new local tax imposed in the 
spring critics also pointed to what they have said is 
underfunding of the health education and welfare services 
it is a very poor result for us there are no bones about 
it conservative party chairman kenneth baker acknowledged when 
the result of thursdays ballot was declared early today 
bellotti scooping 51 percent of the vote overturned a near 
17000vote conservative majority in eastbourne to in by a 
comfortable 4550vote margin 
the conservatives richard hickmet went down with 18865 votes 
the vote for the socialist labor party with a yearlong lead in 
national opinion polls but no hope in eastbourne collapsed to just 
2308 or 5 percent 
eastbourne had been tory territory for more than 70 years and 
ranked among the dozen safest conservative party seats in the 
country 
this is a fine result for us and a disastrous one for the 
conservative party said bellotti 47 a local authority 
counselor and director of the young mens christian association 
ian gow the previous legislator and a close aide to mrs 
thatcher was killed july 30 when the outlawed irish republican 
army blew up his car he was an outspoken opponent of the iras 
violent campaign against british rule in northern ireland 
the slaying of gow among the most audacious attacks in ira 
violence this year stunned this sedate 18thcentury resort 
community 
liberal democratic leaders hailed the victory as restoring the 
partys fortunes after internal feuds slashed the centrists 
support to single figures in poll ratings compared with a 
onefifth share in the 1987 general election 
labor leader neil kinnock said eastbourne shows that people 
will vote against the tories any time any where 
but observers said a modest revival of the centrists who helped 
mrs thatcher to victory in the past two elections by splitting the 
leftofcenter vote could benefit her again 
eastbourne epitomizes south england tory territory negligible 
unemployment a high proportion of retirees and an abundance of 
small businessmen and voters strong on law and order

a coal mine that has been burning for 
more than two days driving about 50 people from their homes will 
be sealed in an attempt to extinguish the smoky blaze a spokesman 
said this morning 
the decision to seal the mines seven openings was made after 
engineers drilled tubes 100 yards into the earth and concluded the 
fire had spread farther than they thought and had grown in 
intensity said robert toothman spokesman for national steel corp 
the steel company owns the mathies coal co mine near this 
western pennsylvania town 
the fire spewed thick smoke and invisible carbon monoxide 
fifteen to 20 families living within a mile of the mines 
northernmost portal were ordered out of their homes wednesday 
evening because of the fumes said washington county emergency 
services spokesman philip garrow most of them went to stay with 
relatives or friends 
it could take several days before the mine is sealed and the 
evacuation order is lifted and then several months before the fire 
is completely smothered toothman said 
were going to try to cut off all the air he said 
the fire began early wednesday at the mine southwest of 
pittsburgh near the juncture of two interstate highways 
the pittsburgh postgazette quoted unidentified mathies miners 
as saying the main fire was sparked by a highvoltage line that 
collapsed in a primary tunnel toothman said he was unable to 
confirm those reports 
dark smoke filled the valley near the portal but authorities 
were more worried about the amount of invisible odorless toxic 
carbon monoxide in the atmosphere garrow said 
as long as the fire is burning youll get carbon monoxide 
he said 
a separate fire in the mines maintenance shop was contained by 
cutting off air to the area toothman said the blast that started 
that fire wednesday slightly injured 11 firefighters

for the new york philharmonic it was supposed 
to be a night of beethoven and shostakovich the fates made it a 
night of leonard bernstein 
the official catalog of his works says bernstein led 74 
orchestras but this was his orchestra and the musicians came to 
pay tribute to their laureate conductor who led them through 1244 
concerts during his 47year association with the philharmonic 
they let his music do the talking 
tonights concert is not an evening in which we want to dwell 
on the passing of a giant but rather what he has left us guest 
conductor leonard slatkin told the audience at avery fisher hall on 
thursday night 
so four nights after bernsteins death at age 72 beethovens 
violin concerto became bernsteins serenade for solo violin 
string orchestra harp and percussion 1954 shostakovichs 
symphony no 4 became bernsteins symphony no 1 
jeremiah written in 1942 
also added were his chichester psalms 1965 and his 
overture to candide 1956 the substitute bernstein program 
was being repeated friday night saturday and tuesday 
it was an extraordinary concert 
there werent many smiling faces among the audience or 
musicians slatkins brief introductory comments followed by the 
whimsical candide broke some of the tension 
then came the eclectic serenade which bernsteins program 
notes says is supposed to be based on platos symposium it 
begins with a lyrical praise of the eros the god of love the 
piece is sometimes jocular sometimes melancholy sometimes 
assaulting and sometimes hedonistic it ends in drunken revelry an 
intrusion of jazz as if bernstein was looking down from heaven 
and telling the audience its ok to smile tonight 
the soloist concertmaster glenn dicterow played with much 
agility especially through the difficult double stops and 
especially considering the lack of preparation time 
the mourning returned after intermission but not without 
optimism 
jeremiah begins with suspenseful strings followed by a 
cantorial french horn a melodic return to the strings and then a 
prophetic blaring of brass the second movement continues the 
pointcounterpoint of brass versus strings jeremiah versus the 
corrupt priests with nebuchadnezzar looming on the horizon in 
the third movement jerusalem has fallen to the babylonian king 
judea is exiled jeremiah weeps 
how she sits desolate 
the city once so full of people 
she is become as a widow 
during her chanting of the prophets lamentations 
mezzosoprano wendy white had to wipe a tear from her eye s did 
members of the audience 
last on the program was another hebraic elegy chichester 
psalms the new york choral artists and a boy soloist joined the 
orchestra 
two harpists dominated the center of the crowded stage 
awake psaltery and harp the choir begins in hebrew 
i will rouse the dawn 
in the second movement an angelic 8thgrader evan weber sings 
king davids 23rd psalm the lord is my shepherd i shall not 
want 
after he finishes the mens chorus bellows why do the 
nations rage 
the piece however ends in a mahlerian motif and chorus 
declaring a message bernstein had sought for society 
behold how good 
and how pleasant it is 
for brethren to dwell 
together in unity 
to emphasize the point after the final note slatkin suspended 
his hands for several long moments of silence then came the 
cascade of applause for leonard bernstein

american and british hostages held by 
proiranian extremists have been moved from beiruts southern slums 
to eastern lebanons bekaa valley lebanese military intelligence 
sources said today 
the hostages were moved last week before saturdays attack by 
government troops and the syrian army that crushed gen michel 
aouns rebellion in the christian heartland northeast of beirut 
the sources said 
we have accurate information the captors whisked the captives 
out from south beirut a few days before the attack one source 
said 
the syrians are certainly aware of the transer they control 
all roads from beirut to the bekaa but we do not know whether they 
had any role in it said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
another army intelligence source who also spoke on condition he 
not be named confirmed that the hostages were moved to the bekaa 
but we dont know whether they were tipped off about the 
attack and asked to make the transfer or they took the move for 
other considerations that we are not aware of he said 
the tankled attack on aoun was mounted from three directions 
one of which was the densely populated shiite moslem southern 
slums a major power base of the iranianbacked fundamentalist 
hezbollah 
hezbollah or party of god is believed to be the umbrella of 
shiite extremists holding most of the western hostages in lebanon 
the western hostages are six americans four britons two west 
germans and an italian the longest held is terry a anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
abducted march 16 1985 
both intelligence sources said the hostages spirited to the 
bekaa were the six americans and two of the britons anglican 
church envoy terry waite and journalist john mccarthy 
we believe they are now held in sheik abdulla barracks in 
baalbek and in the nearby village of nabi sheet one source said 
but we do not know who or how many are held in either place 
sheik abdulla barracks a former lebanese army garrison is the 
command post of about 3000 iranian revolutionary guards who were 
stationed in the bekaa after israels 1982 invasion of lebanon 
nabi sheet is a hezbollah base 12 miles southeast of baalbek 
which is about 40 miles east of the lebanese capital 
the syrians who maintain 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 
arab league peacekeeping mandate have often skirmished with 
hezbollah militiamen in beirut and the bekaa but have carefully 
avoided confrontation with the iranian guards 
syria was the only active arab ally of iran during its 
eightyear war with iraq syria and iraq are governed by rival 
wings of the arab socialist baath party the syrians were 
instrumental in arranging the release of two american hostages and 
two swiss captives of the red cross this year

hurricane nana moved northwest over the open 
atlantic toward bermuda early today with top winds of 75 mph 
forecasters said 
a hurricane warning for the island was expected to be posted 
later today according to the national hurricane center in suburban 
coral gables

of bermuda 
the eighth hurricane of the atlantic hurricane season was headed 
northwest at near 10 mph and a turn to the north was expected later 
today according to robert case a hurricane specialist at the 
center 
it appears as though the center of the hurricane is going to 
come pretty close to the island in the next 24 to 36 hours case 
said but because its such a small hurricane it could pass by 
the island entirely 
hurricane force winds extended only 25 miles to the east of 
nanas center case said he said early today that there was only a 
30 percent chance nanas center would pass within 65 miles of 
bermuda when it reaches the area early saturday

depression and achieved hurricane strength thursday

sen alfonse damato took to the senate floor 
this week scolding his colleagues for spending beyond their means 
what about some fiscal discipline what about a freeze the 
new york republican demanded what about maybe a cut what about 
eliminating some programs 
hours later damatos press secretary was on the phone giving 
reporters what has become the senators nightly pork report ie 
a list of millions of dollars for new york projects won by 
damatos legendary tenacity on the appropriations committee 
damato had taken credit for a 17 million appropriation to help 
build a road bypassing the town of corning 100 million over six 
years to help clean up two polluted lakes and the long island 
sound 11 million to build a second railroad track between the tip 
of manhattan and penn station and 145 million to buy land for a 
veterans cemetery somewhere around albany 
is congress trying to cut spending or bring home the bacon 
the answer is both 
on the floors of the house and senate congress has been 
debating proposals to reduce thebudget deficit by 500 billion 
over the next five years meanwhile conference committees have 
been meeting to craft appropriations bills that will spend the 
governments money 
the timing could hardly look worse 
just this week one of the 13 senate appropriations 
subcommittees received a wish list of 2800 special projects from 
various senators said sen dale bumpers dark 
those same senators then come in here with unctuous 
pontificating statements about how if we could just freeze this or 
that we could get the deficit under control bumpers said on the 
senate floor wednesday 
and with elections less than a month away members need to look 
fiscally tough at the same time as theyre taking credit for this 
bridge or that veterans hospital 
take rep doug barnard jr a georgia democrat locked in a tense 
reelection race on tuesday barnard issued a press release saying 
he had voted against the house budget package because it would have 
increased taxes by 149 billion over five years 
if the rest of the congress had followed my lead and voted for 
acrosstheboard cuts and freezes to spending bills all year we 
wouldnt be faced with trying to find massive cuts here at the 11th 
hour he said 
the next day barnard issued another release bragging that fort 
gordon in his district will get 106 million from federal 
coffers for a soldier support center that would consolidate all 
administrative offices 
the army originally requested the money for fiscal 1992 barnard 
noted but he petitioned the house appropriations committee to fund 
the center a year sooner 
everybody wants to reduce the deficit but nobody wants to 
contribute to the reduction senate minority leader bob dole said 
earlier this week 
yet the kansas republican recently took credit for helping win 
28 million for military projects back home as well as 1 million 
to relocate a soup kitchen 
of course only the politically naive would expect a senator or 
congressman to give up money for a pet project right 
well maybe not 
last week rep carl pursell rmich walked into the energy 
and water development appropriations conference and asked that 3 
million to clean up the rouge river near detroit be stricken from 
the bill the money returned to the treasury 
as far as i know it was an unprecedented move removing a 
project from a bill purcell said afterward on the house floor 
if each member of this body followed suit and would give up any 
of their projects the numbers would begin to become significant

governing party officials postponed a planned 
mission to washington today after a us congressional committee 
decided not to demand the resignation of a japanese cabinet 
minister for his remarks about american blacks 
the us house foreign affairs committee voted thursday to 
condemn justice minister seiroku kajiyamas remarks but amended 
its resolution at the last minute to remove a call for his 
resignation 
japans governing liberal democratic party immediately postponed 
the trip by a delegation of lawmakers who had planned to try to 
soothe the anger of members of congress over the remarks 
on sept 21 after a police roundup of foreign prostitutes in a 
redlight district in tokyo kajiyama compared the arrival of the 
prostitutes to blacks moving into neighborhoods in the united 
states and forcing whites out 
his remarks were immediately condemned in the united states and 
kajiyama retracted the comments four days later and apologized 
now that the resolution has been modified it may be better to 
find a more appropriate time to consult with members of congress 
rather than go there hastily ichiro ozawa secretary general of 
the governing party told reporters today 
kyodo news service reported that kajiyama expressed relief when 
he learned that the resolution did not include a call for his 
resignation 
i am aware of the passage of the bill but i cant comment on 
it because i have not heard about the details kyodo quoted him 
as saying 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said it was 
regrettable that the resolution was approved when asked to 
assess the affect the remarks had on bilateral relations he 
acknowledged that it is a serious incident 
watanabe urged americans not to conclude that japanese are 
racists it is wrong to assume that all the japanese are sharing 
that view represented in the statement made by mr kajiyama he 
said 
meanwhile opposition party leaders attacked kajiyama and 
demanded that prime minister toshiki kaifu dismiss him but kaifu 
said he had no intention of doing so 
kaifu has repeatedly called the remarks inappropriate and 
rebuked kajiyama but protests continued to grow both inside and 
outside of japan 
in the united states the congressional black caucus prepared a 
resolution demanding kajiyamas resignation and some black groups 
called for a boycott of japanese products 
in hopes of stopping the passage of the resolution the justice 
minister sent a letter of apology wednesday to rep ronald dellums 
who chairs the 24member caucus but the group refused to withdraw 
the resolution 
kajiyama is the latest of a series of japanese politicians who 
offended minorities with public racial remarks 
in 1986 then prime minister yasuhiro nakasone said americans 
have a lower intelligence level than japanese because the 
population includes a considerable number of blacks puerto ricans 
and mexicans 
in 1988 former finance minister michio watanabe said american 
blacks have few qualms about going bankrupt and implied that they 
walk away from debts

a nearly 3monthold baby was released 
from the hospital after recovering from serious heart defects that 
once made him a transplant candidate 
weston kilpatrick left loma linda university medical center in 
good condition wednesday but still faces the prospect of future 
surgery to repair remaining defects hospital spokesman dick 
schaefer said 
were very excited and cautiously optimistic as we take weston 
home said his father layne kilpatrick a 31yearold 
pharmacist hes doing well although the future is uncertain for 
weston he has amazed us 
everyones really excited that weston can get home in this 
sort of shape without a transplant said dr steven gundry who 
performed surgery to repair some of the defects that didnt heal 
weston was born july 27 he suffered several congenital cardiac 
defects including underdevelopment of the left side of his heart 
underdeveloped heart valves an open duct between two arteries and 
a narrowed aorta which is the main artery carrying blood from the 
heart to the rest of the body 
layne and janet kilpatrick and their 4yearold daughter 
danielle moved from the central california community of lompoc to 
redlands in order to be near their son while he waited for a donor 
heart 
gundry repaired the duct and artery problem oct 7 after the 
usually fatal underdevelopment of the hearts left pumping chamber 
got better on its own the valves also showed some improvement 
that recovery which doctors called virtually miraculous 
eliminated the need for a heart transplant to save westons life 
weston has continued to improve gundry said wednesday he 
still has problems with one of the valves in his heart and a few 
small holes in his heart but right now hes really amazed all of 
us 
schaefer said the holes allow a small amount of blood to flow 
between chambers of the heart in an unwanted manner and may require 
corrective surgery later 
loma linda has become a leading center for newborn human heart 
transplants since 1984 when dr leonard bailey implanted a 
baboons heart in the infant known as baby fae in an attempt to 
save her life she suffered a more severe underdevelopment of the 
left side of her heart

two sons of the late crime boss carlo gambino 
were arrested on charges of monopolizing trucking in the citys 
garment district with threats extortion and violence 
state indictments accuse thomas and joseph gambino along with 
five other trucking executives of dividing the district into 
zones each run by a specific mobcontrolled trucking company that 
agreed not to compete in anothers territory 
with competition eliminated mob truckers could charge 
extortionate rates and extract millions of dollars more in profits 
than a legitimate trucking concern would have earned district 
attorney robert morgenthau said thursday 
that caused a mob tax on every garment shipped in new york 
city which is ultimately passed along to the consumer 
morgenthau said 
if a garment shipper used an independent trucker morgenthau 
said the mob truckers would make the shipper pay them anyway 
the suspects used their reputations as gangland figures to scare 
dozens of manufacturers and contractors into cooperating he said 
during the twoyear investigation undercover police ran a dress 
shop morgenthau said the officers also ran a small trucking 
company 
one indictment charges thomas gambino 61 brother joseph 54 
and their employees john disalvo 39 and raymond buccafusco 61 
with enterprise corruption and 52 other counts of larceny by 
extortion coercion and restraint of trade 
thomas gambino was the head of the criminal enterprise while his 
brother and disalvo were his principal operating officers 
morgenthau said 
the millionaire gambino brothers are sons of the late boss of 
all bosses carlo gambino who ran the gang that bears his name 
and is now allegedly controlled by john gotti 
if convicted they face up to 25 years in prison and loss of 
their trucking companies the companies also charged in the 
indictment are consolidated carriers clothing carriers 
greenbergs express and grg delivery corp

black plumes rising five miles above 
neptunes moon triton may be swirling funnels called dust 
devils instead of volcanolike geysers as many researchers 
believe a study published today says 
the majority theory is still that theyre geysers but were 
having a lively debate said planetary scientist andrew ingersoll 
of the california institute of technology in pasadena 
at least four plumes were discovered in photographs taken by the 
voyager 2 space probe when it zoomed past neptune and triton in 
august 1989 the plumes of nitrogen ice nitrogen gas and carbon 
dust rise five miles high then flatten into clouds that drift 90 
miles downwind 
because they are so tall a lay person would call them 
volcanoes but the proper technical term is geysers if thats 
what they are said edward stone voyagers chief scientist and 
directordesignate of nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena 
in a study published today in the journal science ingersoll and 
caltech graduate student kimberly tryka argue the plumes are 
fivemiletall dust devils similar to those on mars and on earths 
windy deserts 
a dust devil forms when the floor of the desert gets much 
hotter than the air right above it ingersoll said thursday 
the air near the ground is very buoyant and just rises if 
theres a little breeze blowing it can get spinning you get this 
narrow column that extends up to 2000 feet on mars they extend 
up 3 miles 
ingersoll said he thinks the plumes are dust devils because they 
remain narrow as they rise off bare spots on tritons icy surface 
volcanoes and geysers usually form umbrellashaped plumes he said 
a study by laurence soderblom and randolph kirk of the us 
geological survey in flagstaff ariz and robert h brown of jet 
propulsion laboratory says nitrogen and methane ices that cover 
much of tritons surface act like a greenhouse trapping heat from 
the sun 
they say the heat vaporizes underground ice which then erupts 
through overlying ice to form geysers 
the debate is important for understanding the solar system in 
which we live said roger yelle a planetary scientist and geyser 
advocate at the university of arizona tucson 
ingersoll said the main problem with the dustdevil theory is 
that tritons atmosphere is so thin wind shouldnt be able to whip 
up dust and nitrogen ice for dust devils to form tritons dust 
and ice would have to be 1000 to 10000 times less sticky than 
similar materials on earth ingersoll said 
the flight past neptune and triton capped an 865 million 
exploration of four planets and more than 50 moons by the national 
aeronautics and space administrations voyager 1 and 2 space 
probes 
the twin craft were launched in 1977 both visited jupiter and 
saturn voyager 2 went on to uranus and neptune the voyagers now 
are zipping toward the edge of the solar system 
neptune is usually the eighth planet from the sun but because 
of plutos elongated orbit neptune now is temporarily the ninth 
and outermost planet

a judge today cleared a company and seven of its 
former employees of manslaughter charges in the sinking of a ferry 
off belgium three years ago that left 193 people dead 
the justice sir michael john turner told the jury on the 27th 
day of the trial to find p and o european ferries dover ltd 
three former directors and two seamen not guilty 
he said the prosecution had failed to legally prove 
manslaughter 
turner also ordered the jury to acquit two other seamen when the 
prosecution said it would drop its case against them 
relatives of the victims fought for more than three years to 
bring what is believed only the second charge of corporate 
manslaughter against a company in the first case a construction 
company was acquitted in 1965 
the judge told the jury that evidence already called is such 
that you properly directed could not properly convict the company 
and the five most senior defendants 
all defendants had denied a single charge of manslaughter only 
one person who died in the sinking of the herald of free enterprise 
ferry was named in a test case to simplify the charges 
they were the ferry company chief marine superintendent jeffrey 
develin deputy chief marine superintendent john alcindor 
technical director wallace ayres senior master john kirby master 
of the herald david lewry chief officer leslie sabel and 
assistant boatswain mark stanley 
the prosecution dropped its case against sael and stanley 
they had been accused of unlawfully killing alison gaillard 27 
a passenger aboard the herald of free enterprise when it capsized 
outside belgiums zeebrugge harbor on march 6 1987 
the ferry set sail with her bow doors open the man responsible 
for closing them stanley had been asleep in his cabin and sabel 
the officer responsible for ensuring they were closed admitted he 
had not fulfilled his duty 
the charges alleged there was an obvious and serious risk that 
because of the failure by the defendants to do their duties the 
herald would sail with open doors capsize and cause death the 
defendents allegedly either gave no thought to the risk or if they 
recognized it still took it 
but the judge said there was no direct evidence that a 
reasonably prudent person occupying the position of any of the five 
senior defendents would have perceived that the risk was obvious or 
serious 
victims families were very disappointed and saddened by the 
outcome said maurice de rohan chairman of the herald families 
association and the father of mrs gaillard the one victim named 
in the manslaughter charge 
the company which was covered by insurers has settled 
piecemeal most claims by survivors and relatives

mayor marion barry today withdrew his request 
for a new trial on a misdemeanor cocaine possession 
i have spoken with my client and he has decided to withdraw 
that motion for a mistrial defense lawyer l kenneth mundy told 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson during a 
presentencing hearing 
barry scheduled to be sentenced oct 26 faces up to a year in 
prison and a maximum fine of 100000 he did not attend todays 
court session 
law enforcement officials had said us attorney jay b stephens 
might consider retrying the mayor on a dozen charges the jury could 
not resolve if barry pushed ahead with his request for another 
trial stephens had said earlier that he would not conduct another 
trial 
mundy said today that the decision to withdraw the request was 
reached before the government filed papers opposing the motion 
on thursday mundy had asked that the sentencing be delayed 
because he hadnt had enough time to respond to a presentencing 
report prepared by the mayors parole officer 
we disagree wholeheartedly with the presentencing report 
mundy said 
the report was not released in open court but mundy said his 
chief objection was its apparent conclusion that barry has neither 
shown remorse nor taken responsibility for his actions by admitting 
to prior drug use 
there is an ongoing probe of mr barry and some of the 
questions being asked of witnesses involve drug use by mr 
barry mundy said it would have been very perilous for him to 
make any presentencing statement to the parole officer until we 
know that there will be no other trial 
the judge denied the request to delay sentencing 
according to assistant us attorney richard roberts the report 
said barry affirmatively denied using drugs 
if a defendant admits guilt in a presentencing report he often 
is given a lighter sentence than if he denies culpability 
in his motion for retrial mundy had argued that barry should 
receive a new trial because some of the jurors witnessed a drug 
sting at the hotel where they were sequestered 
a jury convicted barry on aug 10 of one misdemeanor cocaine 
possession count acquitted him of another and deadlocked on a 
dozen other counts including a charge resulting from his jan 18 
arrest in an fbi sting operation at a downtown washington hotel 
barry chose not to seek a fourth mayoral term next month but is 
running for the city council

weary from a bruising battle over the federal 
budget the senate is wading into another fight over whether to 
renew strict antiobscenity restrictions on the national endowment 
for the arts 
the debate pits sen jesse helms rnc and his conservative 
allies against supporters of a bipartisan compromise proposal 
which would have the courts decide whether federally supported arts 
projects are obscene 
at issue before the senate was an 117 billion appropriations 
bill for the interior department and several other federal agencies 
in the 1991 fiscal year which began oct 1 the senate measure 
contains 170 million for the nea and the same antiobscenity curbs 
that congress imposed a year ago 
acton on the bill was delayed until late tonight or saturday so 
the senate can tackle more pressing endofsession legislation 
including a stopgap resolution extending government spending 
authority through wednesday 
the senate bill ignores a houseapproved compromise that would 
omit any explicit obscenity ban the house bill would require the 
nea to recoup its money from grant recipients who later are 
convicted of violating obscenity laws 
a similar judicial approach to the obscene art issue had 
been approved on a bipartisan 151 vote by the senate labor and 
human resources committee but helms effectively blocked floor 
action on that measure 
in a move apparently aimed at placating helms the senate 
appropriations committee voted to keep the nea alive for one more 
year trim its proposed 175 million budget and reinstate the 
strict helmsinspired obscenity ban for another year 
the bill also would allow nea chairman john e frohnmayer to 
continue to require grant recipients to sign a nonobscenity pledge 
before they can receive federal funds the pledge which the house 
voted to scrap has caused widespread protests in the arts 
community and is the target of three federal lawsuits 
current law forbids the endowment to finance any works that 
may be considered obscene including depictions of homosexual 
and sadomasochistic activities the sexual exploitation of children 
and individuals engaged in sex acts 
the house voted to scrap the obscenity restrictions and extend 
the neas statutory authority for three years with a firstyear 
budget of 180 million compared with 171 million last year the 
house bill said only that obscenity lacks artistic merit is not 
protected speech and shall not be funded by the endowment 
last year the nea awarded 153 million in grant money to nearly 
4500 artists and arts institutions from opera and ballet 
companies to painters and poets most of the grants required 
matching funds from private sources 
whatever the outcome of the senate debate it will remain for 
negotiators to reconcile differences between house and senate 
versions before a final bill is ready for enactment 
the senate compromise bottled up by helms was drafted by 
liberals claiborne pell dri and edward m kennedy dmass 
and conservatives orrin hatch rutah and nancy l kassebaum

a familyrun shipping business with a history of 
accidents and illegal operations was ordered to pull its barges out 
of the spillplagued new york harbor 
the action by the state department of environmental conservation 
was the first time it has exercised its authority to ground an 
entire fleet of barges since the department was created in 1970 
commissioner thomas c jorling said the companies and 
individuals named in his order have a record so bad that their 
continued operation presents an imminent danger to public health 
and irreparable damage to the environment 
one of the companys barges operating illegally sank sept 27 
at the first marine shipyard on staten island spilling 50000 
gallons of oil into a waterway known as the kill van kull 
that was only the latest in a series of unrelated spills that 
have dumped more than 1 million gallons of petroleum products into 
the harbor during the past year 
the three companies named in the order are among the 45 or so 
owned by the family of former city ports and terminals commissioner 
susan frank as well as her mother brother and sister 
they control at least 19 barges about 10 percent of all 
commercial barges operating in the harbor jorling said 
the companies are berman enterprises inc of new york city and 
general marine transport corp and standard marine services inc 
both of bayonne nj 
also named were 72yearold evelyn berman frank who heads 
general marine peter frank president of general marine and jane 
frank kresch secretary of berman enterprises 
telephoe messages left at their offices were not immediately 
returned 
the barges are to remain docked at least until a hearing oct 
30 at which time the company will be allowed to present its case 
after that the environmental conservation department will 
determine whether to lift the shutdown order or allow the companies 
to operate under restrictions 
the companies are also the subject of an ongoing criminal 
investigation jorling said 
in addition to the sinking of the sarah frank last month the 
companies have been responsible since 1983 for nine known oil 
spills three groundings two collisions and 21 other cases in 
which the coast guard assessed penalties jorlings order said 
they have also been involved in fires and explosions that have 
resulted in the deaths of two people and serious injuries to 
others it said

a third death was confirmed in an 
outbreak of st louis encephalitis a mosquitocarried disease that 
has spread to 18 florida counties health officials said 
a 69yearold orange county man who died oct 13 was a victim of 
encephalitis bringing to three the total deaths in the outbreak 
said department of health and rehabilitative services spokesman 
ernie durfee on thursday 
his identity wasnt immediately released 
tests also were performed thursday to determine whether a 
91yearold man who died monday in martin county was a victim of 
the disease but durfee said they were incomplete local health 
officials said he had suffered flulike symptoms that closely 
matched those of encephalitis 
three cases were confirmed thursday in central florida bringing 
to 46 confirmed cases statewide an additional 23 people have 
passed the first of two confirmation tests 
were still classifying it as an outbreak not an epidemic 
durfee said 
so far the outbreak was confined to central and southern 
florida 
in 1977 the last major outbreak 110 cases were reported and 
eight people died

the renamed east german communist party to seek clues in an alleged 
65 million fraud case 
a berlin prosecutor said however that the raid shortly before 
midnight on thursday at the offices of the party of democratic 
socialism turned up no such information the prosecutor spoke on 
condition of anonymity

check on suspicions that the former communists may have illegally 
transferred 65 million to the soviet union

their rights and would only radicalize former communists trying to 
fit into the new society 
im exhausted with this daily struggle to destroy us he 
said

union to cover living expenses for german students the party had 
sponsored there

from the former communist party 
gysis office was among those searched by 150 police officers 
wearing bulletproof vests the party headquarters is near 
alexanderplatz the central square of former east berlin 
also searched was the office of hans modrow former premier of

elections in march

millions of marks in property and cash because of their position of 
privilege during the old regime

danger of delay 
germany has been struggling with how to deal with the remains of 
the old stalinist order that ruled the nation with an iron fist 
lawmakers are debating whether to grant amnesty to the thousands 
who worked for eastern germanys secret police and government more

other charges

oustside berlin 
but they have been unable to make sufficient progress in their 
criminal probe to arrest the deposed east german leader officials 
said today 
berlin justice department chief jutta limbach said various 
factors including a lack of a sufficient number of prosecutors 
has slowed the investigation

a tour operator has told an 
investigator that he witnessed texas democratic gubernatorial 
candidate ann richards using cocane 13 years ago a newspaper 
reported today 
the richards campaign denied the allegation 
the albuquerque journal said tour operator jd arnold of santa 
fe nm told a bexar county texas sheriffs investigator that 
he saw richards use cocaine in a foyer outside a restroom at the 
stoneleigh p bar in dallas he said the incident occurred during 
the early morning hours of dec 7 1977 after a fundraising 
banquet for thencongressman jim mattox 
richards staff said arnold is a former aide to mattox whom 
richards defeated in a bitter democratic primary runoff this 
spring 
after richards refused to say yes or no when asked during a 
debate whether she had ever abused illegal drugs mattox sought to 
make that question a primary campaign issue 
the richards campaign said arnold is an unreliable source 
because of his past runins with the law and that arnolds charge 
is a tactic by richards opponent republican clayton williams 
judy powers of los alamos nm said she was at the gathering 
that night and said richards never was there 
i dont know why hed want to help clayton williams ms 
powers said hes been a lifelong democrat but i do know that 
ann richards was not there 
jim delesdernier chief of the criminal investigation division 
for the bexar county sheriffs office said he flew to santa fe on 
monday to talk to arnold as part of an investigation into drug 
trafficking in the san antonio area he said the trip was not 
politically motivated and refused to say whether there had been an 
allegation of cocaine use by richards 
delesdernier said sheriff harlan copeland authorized the trip to 
interview arnold he said that although arnolds charges involve 
events past texas fiveyear statute of limitations he believes 
they could lead to more recent incidents 
dont you think that on the surface it stinks monte 
williams a spokesman for richards told the newspaper after the 
story was published today the richards campaign scheduled an 
afternoon news conference 
williams called it laughable that the bexar county sheriff 
would spend tax money to research an allegation of an incident from 
1977 adding that it was a sign of how desperate the clayton 
williams campaign has become 
reggie bashur a spokesman for williams said today that the gop 
campaign had nothing to do with arnold or his charges

the first democratically elected hungarian 
leader to visit the white house in four decades is taking home a 
packet of bush administration pledges to help his ailing economy 
our visit here has opened a new era in ushungarian 
relations prime minister jozsef antall said at a farewell news 
conference 
among antalls worries as he tries to steer the central european 
country toward political democracy and a free market system is 
spillover from a faltering soviet economy 
bush said thursday the united states would provide 475 million 
in agricultural credits and loan guarantees to help hungary recover 
from a droughtinflicted grain shortage 
bush also announced he would push for international lending 
concessions for hungary czechoslovakia and poland and that us 
travel restrictions on hungarys diplomats would be lifted in 
addition hungary will establish a consulate in los angeles 
antall stressed bushs promise to encourage american firms to do 
business in hungary it is very important to us to see american 
investments in hungary and we would like to see them strengthened 
in the future he said speaking through an interpreter 
antall said his delegation had discussed with us officials how 
to insulate hungary from economic chaos should the already 
faltering soviet economic go into a deeper tailspin 
despite hungarys break from communism its ties to moscow are 
still strong 
besides his meeting with bush the hungarian leader visited 
secretary of state james a baker iii and commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher before being honored at a white house state dinner 
thursday night 
in his welcoming remarks to antall bush answered hungarys 
request for what one administration official referred to as a 
strong signal to foreign investors i encourage more american 
businesses to find out what hungary has to offer the president 
said 
hungary is no longer an emerging democracy hungary is a 
democracy he said 
to help hungary stabilize its economy as it moves from communism 
to a freemarket system bush called on the international monetary 
fund to make lending concessions to it and other eastern european 
countries 
he said the lending organization should make 5 billion 
available to compensate the new democracies for the burden they are 
suffering by supporting united nations sanctions against iraq 
we understand that the loss of export markets and rising 
energy costs complicate your historic effort to transform a 
centrally planned economic system to a freemarket economy bush 
told antall 
hungary plans to send a military medical unit to saudi arabia 
where the bulk of the us troops are stationed in opposition to 
iraqs president saddam hussein said deputy assistant secretary of 
state curtis kamman 
bush told the hungarian he was pleased with antalls support for 
the usled opposition to iraq 
he also said he would seek acceleration by the wold bank of aid 
in the energy field drawing on 9 billion already committed to 
central and eastern europe 
antall said the president had granted us everything that we 
could have enumerated as our request or as our complaints 
in fact he said in a toast at the state dinner that bush is so 
popular in hungary that he probably could find a good political job 
there when he is through being president of the united states 
im sure the hungarian nation would surely elect you as 
president antall told bush

the family of a woman who has suffered two 
strokes is asking a county court to remove the feeding tubes that 
keep her alive 
joseph m ragona filed suit thursday the day after orphans 
court judge frank p eagen declared ragonas wife ruth 
incompetent and appointed him as her guardian the couples four 
children filed affidavits supporting their fathers request 
named as defendants are the hospital and state attorney general 
ernest d preate jr whose responsibilities include representing 
the states interest in the preservation of life prevention of 
suicide and maintenance of the ethical integrity of the health care 
profession according to the suit filed in lackawanna county 
court 
the petition said that mrs ragona stated in unequivocal terms 
to her family member that she did not want her life to be 
prolonged by artificial means or other mechanical lifesustaining 
procedures 
mrs ragona 63 suffered a stroke in 1984 and has remained 
hospitalized at moses taylor hospital since a second stroke feb 8 
the womans physician dr vithalbhai d dhaduk said in a 
letter that mrs ragona does not understand or react to questions 
and that there is no chance that she will improve 
the petition argues that mrs ragona has the right to be removed 
from the tubes because of pennsylvanias doctrine of informed 
consent prohibiting a physician from instituting any medical 
procedures without a patients express consent 
hospital spokeswoman tricia pahoski said the hospital would not 
comment on the case the attorney generals office also said there 
would be no immediate response 
last june the us supreme court ruled 54 in a missouri case 
that under that states laws the state could keep a patient on 
life support in the absence of clear and convincing proof that 
the person would want to die

the governing national party 
agreed to open its membership to all races friday when the last of 
four provincial congresses voted to support the proposal of 
president fw de klerk 
our goals are beyond reproach and we can say with elation that 
the national party is on course de klerk told 1000 congress 
delegates meeting in pretoria 
all four provincial congresses easily passed the measure which 
called for eliminating racial qualification for membership 
approval by the congresses permits the party hierarchy to make the 
change 
the move represented a sharp reversal for the national party 
which implemented the apartheid system of racial segregation and 
white dominance after gaining power in 1948 
the party has traditionally been the political domain of 
afrikaners the dutchdescended whites who domiate the government 
despite the move it was not clear if many blacks would join the 
national party african national congress leader nelson mandela has 
said any prominent black would be commiting political suicide if he 
joined the governing party 
even if blacks were to join the national party south africas 
constitution prohibits them from voting in national elections 
de klerk has pledged to end apartheid and negotiate 
powersharing with the black majority he also has sought the 
lifting of international economic sanctions imposed against south 
africa to protest apartheid 
foreign affairs minister pik botha told the congress south 
africa had emerged from international isolation since de klerk 
became president just over a year ago he noted that world leaders 
who previously rejected south african leaders now receive them

east germanys former communists claimed friday 
their democratic rights were trampled when a small army of police 
raided their headquarters in a fruitless hunt for criminal 
evidence 
about 150 armed lawmen burst into the headquarters shortly 
before midnight thursday to search for clues to allegations that 
the party had recently funneled 65 million into the soviet union 
however a berlin prosecutor speaking on condition of 
anyonymity said the raid at the partys berlin offices turned up 
no such information 
the former communists have renamed their organization the party 
of democratic socialism 
the raid was the latest action by the united german government 
in its effort to sift through the remains of the authoritarian 
government that ruled east germany for 40 years 
there is widespread belief that communists in the often corrupt 
former government squirreled away billions in property cash and 
valuables in the waning days of their rule 
the raid came on he first anniversary of erich honeckers 
ouster as communist leader of the hardline government 
gregor gysi the current party leader who also holds a 
parliament seat in the united germany denounced the raids as 
illegal and an infringement on the democratic rights of party 
members 
he claimed that persecution of former communist party members 
whose current party now professes a form of democratic socialism 
would only serve to radicalize them 
im exhausted with this daily struggle to destroy us he 
said 
the raid also drew criticism from the leftleaning social 
democrats germanys main opposition party and the free democrats 
who are part of chancellor helmut kohls governing coaliton 
martin hirsch a former supreme court judge and social democrat 
said the raid was tantamount to attacking gnats with iron bars 
the party of former communists is in fact a political 
opposition but it is not outlawed burkhard hirsch spokesman on 
law enforcement matters for the free democrats said in an 
interview released before publication of the cologne express 
newspaper 
berlin interior senator erich paetzold said authorities received 
a tip on thursday that the party was making a big money transfer to 
the soviet union 
a police spokesman said the raid was necessary because of the 
danger of delay 
gysi said the money was transferred to the soviet union to cover 
living expenses for german students the party had sponsored in that 
country 
he said such payments were an old financial burden inherited 
from the former communist party

secretary of state james a baker iii today 
proposed extending ussoviet cooperation to virtually daytoday 
exchanges on issues such as military doctrine arms proliferation 
in the persian gulf and other regions and economic reform in 
europe 
cooperation can become the norm not the exception baker 
said in a speech to a private group that promotes superpower 
understanding 
common problems can best be solved mutually not 
unilaterally 
the largely philosophical proposal which baker described as 
new pathways of cooperation marked a growing attempt by the 
bush administration to expand on joint efforts to contain iraq in 
the persian gulf 
with the two powers moving to complete new treaties limiting 
their forces in europe as well as longrange nuclear weapons baker 
said he would propose to soviet foreign minister eduard 
schevardnadze setting up a working group to exchange information 
about military doctrine and strategy 
also he said the us and soviet officials should meet 
regularly on converting weapons and military facilities to peaceful 
uses and also on how to contain the proliferation of arms around 
the world 
we both see proliferation as perhaps the greatest security 
challenge of the 1990s baker said in accepting the george f 
kennan award from the american committee on ussoviet relations 
having cooperated to try to deny weapons to iraq baker said 
working together we may be able to inspire a more comprehensive 
approach to nuclear chemical biological and missile 
proliferation 
the award named for an american diplomat who played a leading

china has bought an additional 449370 metric 
tons of us wheat under a price subsidy program the second 
purchase this week the agriculture department said friday 
officials said the subsidies for wheat sold to china have 
doubled from what they were a few months ago 
f paul dickerson general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said eight private exporting 
companies made the deals under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep 
delivery of the wheat is scheduled for the first three months of 
1991 he said on thursday the department announced sales totaling 
299740 tons the first to china under eep since aug 1 
the sales were part of 2 million tons authorized china under eep 
on may 2 dickerson said china has only about 10000 tons remaining 
in its current allocation 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the latest sales would be about 165 million bushels at 
current prices estimated by usda at around 242 per bushel the 
wheat would have a farm value of around 40 million 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in 
selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged 4387 per ton or 
about 120 per bushel 
that was double the bonuses paid on chinas wheat purchase on 
aug 1 which averaged 2040 per ton or 56 cents per bushel huge 
crops in many countries have pressured world prices and triggered 
competition among exporting countries 
the subsidized sales were handled by cargill inc 75000 tons 
continental grain co 59520 j aron and co 90000 garnac 
grain co inc 45000 mitsubishi international 30000 ferruzzi 
usa inc 75000 tradigrain inc 29850 and woodhouse corp 
45000 
with the latest sales china has bought about 32 milion tons 
of us wheat for delivery in the 199091 wheat marketing year that 
began june 1 compared with 56 million tons in 198990

senior house democrats today indicated a 
willingness to negotiate a deficitreduction plan that includes 
some increase in the gasoline tax but insisted president bush must 
accept a higher burden on the rich 
obviously compromises are required house speaker thomas s 
foley told reporters after a party caucus the insistence of the 
president in having no income tax changes affecting the rich 
seems to be inexplicable and inflexible 
at the white house bush said the senate bill offers some real 
hope for getting the budget deficit matter under control but 
would not discuss what he thinks the final version should contain 
i for the first time feel optimistic that we can get this 
job done for the american people bush said 
the senate meanwhile approved a bill to extend temporary 
funding for government operations past tonights midnight deadline 
and white house press secretary marlin fitzwater indicated bush was 
likely to sign it 
bush fitzwater said wants to satisfy himself that 
satisfactory progress is being made on the budget before signing 
the measure 
foley said democrats will insist house and senate negotiators 
moderate a senate proposal to increase the gasoline tax by 9 cents 
and raise medicare premiums 
the conferees began working on a compromise measure after the 
senate passed its deficit plan on a 5446 vote this morning 
one more big hurdle and then well have the job done said 
majority leader george j mitchell dmaine 
congressional leaders had hoped to work out differences in time 
to get an agreement to bush before midnight but they indicated 
today that a final bill is unlikely before next week 
the house measure vastly different from the senate bill would 
take threefifths of its revenue from higher income taxpayers the 
senate wants to raise money by increasing the tax on gasoline 
alcohol cigarettes and luxury items 
rep vic fazio dcalif said another area thats likely to 
be negotiated is a house provision forgoing next years inflation 
adjustment in parts of the tax system something bush has 
criticized 
that provision vigorously opposed by the senate would raise 
taxes on all lower and middleincome taxpayers 
as the senate completed work on the bill many republicans still 
werent forgiving bush for abandoning his pledge to oppose tax 
increases 
raising taxes in the face of a recession is a harebrained 
idea said sen bill armstrong rcolo who voted against the 
measure 
the senate deficit plan would raise the 9cent gasoline tax to 
18 cents a gallon limit itemized deductions of those with incomes 
over 100000 a year boost the medicare tax for people earning 
over 51300 and make permanent the expiring 3 percent tax on 
telephone service 
the house version which bush has promised to veto would get 
most of its revenue from higherincome people but it also would 
hit lower and middleincome people across the board by blocking 
next years scheduled inflation adjustments in tax brackets and 
personal exemptions 
despite stark differences that have prompted cries of class 
warfare from critics the bills agree on many points 
either would raise consumer taxes on tobacco alcoholic 
beverages airplane tickets and expensive cars boats furs and 
jewels medicare beneficiaries would have to pay higher premiums 
for part b coverage and more out of pocket for doctors bills 
before medicare starts paying 
both bills include changes in scores of federal fees and benefit 
programs all designed to save money and reduce the budget deficit 
these range from 135 billion of cuts in farm programs to higher 
penalties on businesses where safety violations are found to 
tightening eligibility requirements for student loans 
the mixture of tax increases user fees and benefit reductions 
would provide about half the 500 billion fiveyear deficit 
reduction on which congress and the bush administration have been 
trying to find agreement for five months 
the other half also is making its way through congress these 
savings will be made by slowing the growth of spending for the 
military and hundreds of other government programs that are subject 
to annual appropriations about 70 billion in interest will be 
saved by reduced borrowing 
most of the attention is focused on the tax and medicare 
provisions 
senators defeated three major amendments thursday that were 
aimed at reshaping the senate version more in the mold of the house 
bill mitchell cautioned that such changes would doom the whole 
bill 
two of the amendments included provisions raising the 28 percent 
top income tax rate paid by the nations 700000 wealthiest people 
to 33 percent as the house bill would do the money would have 
been used to moderate increases in medicare costs and to scale down 
the boost in gasoline tax 
the president has said he will veto any legislation that 
includes a 33 percent rate on the highestincome individuals 
mitchell said i dont agree with the president but that is 
the reality 
bush also opposes the house provision that would require 
taxpayers to forgo next years scheduled bracket creep 
adjustment in tax brackets and personal exemptions that would mean 
higher income taxes for all but the wealthiest americans 
senators apparently fearing that any significant change in the 
tax bill could destroy the coalition that held it together even 
rejected a proposed millionairesformedicare swap that 
amendment would have imposed an 18 percent surtax in millionaires 
in order to reduce medicare patients outofpocket expenses

the family of gen michel aoun drove to 
beiruts airport today to board a flight for paris but france and 
lebanon remained locked in a dispute over the fate of the defeated 
rebel commander 
witnesses said a convoy of six french embassy cars accompanied 
by four lebanese military police jeeps left the embassy compound in 
the eastern suburb of hazmiyeh and drove to the airport in 
syriancontrolled south beirut 
two air france executive jets had flown in earlier to evacuate 
aouns wife nadia and their three daughters mireille 22 
claudine 19 and chantal 17 and transport them to france where 
they will live in exile 
aoun remained in the french embassy where he has been granted 
asylum 
the lebanese government has refused to allow aoun to leave the 
country insisting that he face trial for a variety of crimes and 
the alleged theft of at least 75 million from the ailing state 
treasury 
earlier today president elias hrawi accused aoun who took 
refuge in the french embassy with his family on saturday of 
ordering his troops to continue fighting even after he broadcast 
his message of surrender 
im in the french embassy the outcome of the battle will be 
favorable to us go on go on fighting hrawi quoted aoun as 
telling his forces last week in a radio message 
these were the orders aoun radioed to his forces even after 
his message of surrender was broadcast hrawi said in remarks 
released by his office 
hrawis government also denied press reports that scores of 
aouns defeated soldiers were massacred after surrendering to the 
lebanese and syrian forces who ended aouns 11month mutiny on 
saturday 
prime minister salim hoss said frances call for a united 
nations investigation of reports of such killings was based on 
biased rumors 
the defense ministry said in a communique that reports that 
aouns troops were massacred after surrendering were absolutely 
baseless the communique said aouns troops who died fell in 
the military operation 
the eighthour airandground assault killed 350 people and 
wounded 1200 by police count police said the fatalities included 
at least 100 syrian soldiers but the new york times citing 
doctors at east beirut hospitals and syrian officers said in 
todays editions that the death toll was at least 750 
military sources speaking on condition of anonymity described 
ferocious handtohand fighting between the advancing syrian 
troops and aouns forces on the eastern edge of his 80squaremile 
enclave in the christian heartland 
one source said that after aouns address was broadcast one of 
his officers told the syrians he was surrendering but then opened 
fire when the syrians came forward the syrians responsed by 
pounding the aoun forces position with rocket launchers and tank 
cannons then stormed it with tankled forces according to the 
source 
the defense ministrys communique came a few hours after france 
urged un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to investigate 
reports of summary executions of aouns vanquished troops in the 
enclave northeast of beirut 
french and british press reports said about 100 of aouns 15000 
troops were killed after surrendering the french foreign ministry 
said france was trying to obtain information about the reports but 
also wanted a un probe 
french opposition leaders today demanded tougher french action 
in response to the allegations one of them alain juppe 
secretarygeneral of the conservative rally for the republic party 
said the government should demand an emergency session of the 
un security council in order to force the withdrawal of syrian 
troops from lebanon 
a police spokesman in lebanon said on thursday that by the time 
police examined the bodies of the slain troops they found no 
solid evidence that the soldiers were liquidated 
none of the corpses we examined had hands tied behind the back 
and very few of the dead soldiers were hit in the skulls with 
bullets said the spokesman who could be named in line with 
regulations 
associated press photographer ahmed azakir who visited the 
government hospital in suburuban baabda on tuesday reported seeing 
more than 50 bodies of aouns troops in the morgue he said none 
had their hands tied 
most of aouns troops declared allegiance to hrawis army under 
gen emile lahoud a maronite catholic like both the president and 
the defeated general 
the leftist newspaper assafir in a frontpage eightcolumn 
headline said the call for a un investigation was part of a 
french effort to distort the operation of unifying beirut

the white house opened the door today to the 
possibility of a lastminute compromise to avert a threatened 
presidential veto of the civil rights act of 1990 
but presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater suggested the 
prospect was a long shot he said bush might decide by days end go 
ahead with a veto and staple to it a legislative proposal more to 
his liking 
the only way that a veto can be avoided fitzwater said would 
be if congress agreed to pass a separate measure that would in 
effect rewrite the civil rights bill to meet the administrations 
objections 
meanwhile civil rights leaders demonstrated in front of the 
white house and sought a meeting with bush in their efforts to 
persuade him to sign the bill 
we are asking that before he makes a decision to veto it 
that he would meet with the civil rights leadership said 
benjamin hooks executive director of the naacp 
hooks said that bush had told him in a telephone conversation 
that he was exploring possible ways to avoid a veto including 
passage of followup legislation 
there is room for hope that bush might reverse himself 
hooks said 
fitzwater said that any such followup legislation would have to 
make it clear that the civil rights legislation would not result in 
hiring quotas for minorities 
the spokesman said he was skeptiocal however that congress 
would go along with such an approach just two days after they 
passed the initial measure 
he said it seemed doubtful that the president would agree to the 
civil rights leaders requests for a meeting since theres no 
doubt in our minds about their views they want us to sign the 
bill 
the bill passed by congress earlier this week would make it 
easier for minorities to bring discrimination cases against their 
employers the administration has claimed the measure would 
virtually force companies into establishing hiring quotas in order 
to defend themselves against such suits 
hooks was among several hundred chanting demonstrators who 
gathered outside the white house 
white house congressional liaison frederick mcclure greeted them 
at the gate then escorted a small delegation onto the grounds 
where he accepted the demonstrators written request for a meeting 
with bush 
hooks said the demonstrators represented civil rights 
organizations from all over the nation womens groups hispanic 
groups from the jewish community from the black community and 
from the liberal republican groups 
the consequences of a veto is that president bush will not be 
living up to his promise of representing all the people and that 
gentler kinder nation that we were looking for will not come to 
pass hooks said 
the legislation seeks to reverse a series of supreme court 
rulings that sponsors of the measure claim have weakened 
antidiscrimination protections in the workplace

a large bear with a penchant for trendy 
california kiwi fruit sent a farmworker up a tree then took a nap 
in a walnut nursery while a throng of officials decided to let a 
sleeping bear lie 
black bears are common in the sierra nevada and foothills but 
rarely venture into flat inhabited areas such as southern butte 
county in the middle of the sacramento valley 
in talking to the ranchers out there its the first time 
anyone in that area has seen a bear in 20 or more years said 
earl young butte county rabies control director 
young didnt see the bear but found evidence the animal was 
snacking on kiwi fruit before it encountered humans 
these animals enjoy the kiwi judging from the prints the 
bear appeared to be about 250 pounds young said 
john kusic said one of his farmworkers spotted the bear 
wednesday morning trotting through a kiwi vineyard

health department the state department of fish and game and us 
fish and wildlife service were called in 
the officials found the bear that afternoon curled up for a nap 
in a walnut nursery nearby after checking to see if the animal 
appeared healthy they decided to back off and leave him be 
he hadnt really caused any damage and the feeling at the 
scene was that nobody wanted to see the bear hurt apparently 
he was just asleep and wanted to be left alone to enjoy his nap 
state warden terry hodges said

jurors in the 2 live crew obscenity 
trial listened intently today as the defenses first witness a 
duke university professor told them that vulgar rhymes and angry 
expressions have long been used in black art and music 
they were told that blacks have used such vulgar expressions to 
express anger at black stereotypes and oppression for centuries 
they embrace the stereotype over and over again that you can 
have no reaction but to bust out laughing said henry louis gates 
jr a black professor of english literature who is a literary 
critic of black art and culture 
gates explained the centuriesold black art of signifying a 
verbal form of mockery that can be used to compliment or to insult 
someone he said the practice exemplified by a needling jibe such 
as your mama wears army boots dates back to slavery times 
its a way the black people could fight against the oppression 
of their white masters they would mock each other to release anger 
and tension gates said 
rap is an old tradition in afroamerican culture gates 
said noting that soul singers james brown and isaac hayes often 
spoke during their songs he said the early form of scat singing 
also was a predecessor of rap 
group leader luther campbell and members chris kid ice 
wongwon and mark brother marquis ross were arrested on 
misdemeanor obscenity charges after a june 10 adultsonly concert 
in hollywood 
the three face up to a year in prison and 1000 in fines if 
convicted 
campbell said thursday that state prosecutors so far have failed 
to prove that a concert by 2 live crew was any more obscene than 
what is seen in nearby adult clubs and bookstores 
we sing about oral sex but the bookstore just down the street 
from the broward county sheriffs office has pictures of oral 
sex campbell leader of the miamibased group said during a 
break in thursdays trial 
referring to a nude dancing club in fort lauderdale he added 
solid gold is getting buttnaked and all you have to do is pay to 
go there 
on thursday defense attorney bruce rogow grilled broward 
sheriffs detective eugene mccloud a vice squad investigator 
rogow demanded to know why bookstores could sell obscene magazines 
and videotapes and yet black rappers could not perform songs with 
sexual and vulgar lyrics 
is it illegal to say f you gov bob martinez 
rogow asked 
no mccloud responded 
is it illegal to say f you broward sheriff nick 
navarro he asked again 
again mccloud responded no 
under the states obscenity statute the prosecutors must prove 
that 2 live crews concert as a whole not just the lyrics 
lacked serious literary artistic political or scientific value 
the disputed concert came four days after a federal judge in 
fort lauderdale ruled the groups sexually explicit album as 
nasty as they wanna be was obscene songs on the millionselling 
album refer to oral and anal sex and violence against women 
two weeks ago record store owner charles freeman of fort 
lauderdale was convicted of peddling obscenity for selling the 
album 
the band members trial is set to continue through the weekend

soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
emissary to iraq met with president bush today and stressed hopes 
that the persian gulf crisis can be settled without war bush 
agreed but made clear there can be no compromise rewarding iraq 
and that military force remains an alternative 
i believe we should not rule out the possibilities of peaceful 
solution util we have exhausted all options yevgeny primakov 
told reporters as he left the white house 
before the meeting bush vowed anew that iraqs aggression and 
takeover of kuwait will not be rewarded by some compromise 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said he emphasized during the 
session that the international focus is the use of sanctions and 
diplomacy to accomplish the peaceful withdrawal of iraq from 
kuwait but that the international community is prepared to 
consider alternative options 
primakov who visited baghdad two weeks ago conferred with bush 
in the oval office the president was joined by secretary of state 
james a baker iii national security adviser brent scowcroft and 
scowcrofts deputy robert gates 
the soviet official said it would be assuming too much to 
think that todays meeting had brought the crisis closer to an end 
primakov said he agreed with bush that the nations of the world 
should not relax their insistence on an iraqi withdrawal from 
kuwait 
one cannot allow a situation where actions which are 
incompatible with a civilized society would be in order primakov 
said through a translator 
he said that bush also believes and thinks that all the 
objectives that have been set must be accomplished through 
complying and implementing united nations resolutions in this our 
positions are the same 
asked if he were hopeful that a peaceful settlement could be 
achieved primakov replied i cannot say that i have become less 
moderately optimistic that i used to be before 
primakov was asked earlier if he were bringing a message from 
saddam about possible steps to defuse the persian gulf crisis 
no message from saddam hussein because i am not a messenger 
primakov said asked if he were carrying a message from gorbachev 
primakov replied curtly best regards 
bush turned aside questions about the session however in a 
meeting earlier with italianamerican leaders bush said he sees no 
chance for compromise in the gulf crisis as has been suggested in 
some diplomatic quarters 
i am as determined as i was the day the first troop left that 
saddam husseins aggression not be rewarded by some compromise not 
be rewarded by failing to get him totally out of kuwait or restore 
the legitimate rulers the bottom line is he cant prevail 
primakov came to the white house with assurances of solid 
kremlin support for tougher international sanctions aimed at 
forcing iraq out of kuwait 
us officials said primakov stressed that moscow wants to keep 
working through the united nations to reverse the aug 2 invasion 
with political and diplomatic measures primakov stopped in rome 
and paris this week on his way to washington 
among the new steps under consideration are demanding 
reparations from iraq for what baker calls the rape of kuwait 
and possibly an international trial of president saddam hussein as 
a war criminal 
the un security council has banned virtually all trade with 
iraq but after more than two months of occupying kuwait the iraqi 
leader has not bowed to the pressure 
primakov gave no indication in his talks with italian and french 
officials or in his meeting thursday with baker that gorbachev 
has an alternative formula to end the persian gulf standoff the 
us officials said before todays white house meeting 
primakov presented nothing new to baker and dennis b ross head 
of the state departments policy planning staff nothing they had 
not heard before said an official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
i havent heard about an iraqi plan or a gorbachev plan the 
official told the associated press there is nothing here that 
sent people down the aisles saying this is something new 
the official referred to published reports that primakov was 
carrying a gorbachev plan or one from baghdad where he met with 
iraqi leaders two weeks ago 
after seeing baker on thursday the soviet envoy ruled out any 
deal with saddam that would reward the iraqi leader for pulling 
troops out of kuwait 
we should look for some possibilities to avoid from my point 
of view the military clashes but not reward iraq of course with 
its actions primakov said in halting english before climbing 
into a waiting black limousine

the liberal democratic party derided by prime 
minister margaret thatcher just last week as a dead parrot is 
back in business after a stunning election upset over the 
conservative party 
the parrot has twitched conservative party chairman kenneth 
baker said friday of the liberal democrats victory in a special 
parliamentary election in the prosperous south england town of 
eastbourne 
the town has been tory territory for more than 70 years 
some dead parrot its given her a nasty nip said the 
liberal democrats leader paddy ashdown 
the centrist party whose most famous member is john cleese of 
monty python fame posted a huge 205 percent swing against the 
government in thursdays election to replace a tory legislator 
killed by the ira 
the conservatives were burdened by voters unhappiness over high 
interest rates health and welfare cuts and an unpopular new tax 
and their candidate didnt help himself by claiming that a vote 
for the opposition was a vote for the irish republican army 
the defeat ranked among the biggest electoral humiliations of 
mrs thatchers 11 years in office and may force her to rethink any 
plans to call an election next year she has until late 1992 to 
call elections 
for the liberal democrats eastbourne was pure gold 
resuscitation for a party in such bad shape that after four years 
of splits name changes name calling and new emblems most voters 
dont know its name 
sweeter still the victory came a week after mrs thatcher got 
the big laugh at her partys annual conference by borrowing a monty 
python sketch to spoof the liberal democrats latest emblem a 
yellow bird in full flight 
this is an exparrot mrs thatcher intoned 
it is not merely stunned it has ceased to be expired and 
gone to meet its maker it has rung down the curtain and joined 
the choir invisible this is a late parrot 
and that led her neatly into the wonders of thatcherism and 
now for something completely different 
the joking didnt seem so funny on friday when eastbournes 
near 17000vote tory majority crumbled to a 4500vote liberal 
democrat win 
it shows the liberal democrats are now establishing themselves 
as a decisive force in the defeat of thatcherism ashdown 
declared 
with 20 members in the 650seat house of commons where the 
conservatives have 100 seats more than labor the liberal democrats 
have been more of a derisive force in recent years support slipped 
from about 20 percent in the 1987 election to 10 percent in opinion 
polls now compared with 47 percent for labor and 37 percent for 
the conservatives 
the liberal democrats fought the 1987 national election in an 
alliance with the social democratic party led by former labor 
foreign secretary david owen 
owen then spurned ashdown and soldiered on with the remainder of 
his party until the final humiliation his partys candidate 
finished behind the nominee of screaming lord sutchs monster 
raving loony party in the town of bootles byelection in the 
spring 
meanwhile the merged centrists tried one name after another to 
accommodate social democratic and liberal sensitivities 
a gallup poll during the liberal democrats conference last 
month when they adopted the bird showed that 75 percent of 
voters didnt know the partys name and 80 percent of the 900 
people questioned had no idea what the party stands for 
the centrists generally an earnest lot who are hot on issues at 
the neighborhood and town levels traditionally do well in local 
elections 
it wasnt all bad news for the tories observers noted that a 
revival of the center would as in the past two general elections 
help the conservatives by splitting the leftofcenter vote

opera star beverly sills says she doesnt like 
violence and explicit sex in the arts but you cant legislate 
taste 
we have laws today that tell us we cant smoke on airplanes 
but you can freely sing if youll pardon the expression about 
the joys of violating a womans body in monstrous detail on 
commercial recordings because its a constitutional right sills 
told about 1000 people thursday night at the 45th annual alfred e 
smith memorial dinner 
the 500aplate dinner run by the roman catholic archdiocese 
of new york benefits health care causes 
we do not need selfappointed vigilantes to insist upon 
legislating artistic work because you cant legislate taste ms 
sills said you cant criminalize imagination you shouldnt 
throw artists in jail 
instead she said higher moral standards are needed 
now im all for artistic freedom i used to be a performing 
artist myself but we as a society are growing dangerously out of 
touch with our conscience she said 
ms sills spoke at the waldorfastoria at what has been called 
the citys most important nonpolitical political event among 
guests were mayor david dinkins former mayor ed koch and 
syndicated columnist william f buckley 
ms sills 61 is a soprano who directed the new york city opera

los angeles ap barry levinson one of the most bankable of 
directors with credits like rain man and good morning 
vietnam says movie makers power over the world outside 
hollywood is overrated 
i dont think filmmakers can influence or affect anything 
he said during a recent interview while promoting his newest movie 
avalon 
i think sometimes we can make a ripple levinson said 
but i mean were just a teaspoon in the ocean 
levinson got his break in hollywood writing comedy scripts for 
the tim conway show and the carol burnett show 20 years 
ago he takes a rather dim view of television but says its hard 
to overstate its influence 
i dont think its the culprit its not the only thing thats 
wrong with our society he said 
but if you had to ask me what was one of the main things 
that has been influential over the last half of the 20th century 
id have to say its television i dont think we know its 
ramifications psychologically sociologically but its 
frightening 
playing in limited release levinsons autobiographical

of 28796 according to figures released monday by exhibitor 
relations co inc avalon opened nationwide on friday

on the morning edition program

benefit the npr affiliate wfsu 
this will be a little easier for me because im a little hard 
of hearing and now i can read your lips said barber 82 
and im making no campaign promises joked edwards 
the 3minute show which began in 1981 is by far the most 
popular segment on npr generating thousands of telephone calls and 
letters edwards said 
i think its because red is a real person hes not plastic 
he said hes the kind of person you want to meet and talk with 
over the fence in the back yard

the oncemighty red army has fallen on hard times 
in the new germany its military mission is over its presence is 
resented by many germans and its soldiers are deserting in droves 
to avoid going home 
once they were crack frontline troops in the cold war now the 
soviet soldiers stationed in what was east germany find themselves 
a relic of a bygone era 
final withdrawal of the 600000 troops and dependents is not 
scheduled until 1994 already the strain is showing 
the soviet forces are a heavy financial burden for newly unified 
germany now saddled with enormous costs of the merger 
the bonn government agreed to pay upwards of 800 million this 
year to maintain the soviets germany will also pay billions to 
retrain and build new housing for the troops 
a nightmare is how heinrich vogel head of the federal 
institute for soviet and international studies describes the 
problems associated with the presence of the soviet troops 
the soldiers face uncertain futures in the soviet union where 
jobs housing and food are scarce the temptation is great to stay 
in newly reunited germany where life is easier and consumer goods 
abundant 
some soviet soldiers are resigned to going home but want to buy 
as much as possible to take with them 
the entry to the soviet base at wuensdorf south of berlin is a 
cross between a usedcar lot and a central asian bazaar soldiers 
are snapping up everything from leather coats to used bmws 
others are deserting to try to stay in germany the interior 
ministry said friday that 53 soviet soldiers had registered for 
asylum in the last two months the figure is almost certainly 
higher as it takes weeks to register the cases 
authorities in berlin said 10 soviet soldiers a day were seeking 
asylum before unity on oct 3 the number fell when the soviet 
military introduced harsher punishment for deserters the maximum 
penalty is death 
a german foreign ministry spokesman acknowledges the problem is 
delicate the bonn government he said is trying to work with 
the soviet government on the desertion problem 
german government officials do not know how many soviet troops 
will try to avoid returning home but they agree that unity and 
germanys liberal asylum laws make it easier to consider staying 
desertion was almost impossible while the berlin wall stood 
east german police were required by treaty to turn deserters over 
to the soviet military 
once the wall fell a soviet soldier could cross into west 
germany and apply for asylum 
police in unified germany are not required to return deserters 
to soviets military authorities who have now stepped up patrols to 
curb desertions 
although there is resentment of the soviet presence there is 
sympathy for the plight of individual soldiers a week ago soviet 
military authorities were unnerved by an outpouring of civic 
support in weimar for oleg luchak a young soviet deserter on 
trial 
a group of young germans sheltered the family and lawyer of the 
young soldier who said he left his unit because of extreme 
necessity townspeople lit candles on a fence in front of the 
courtroom 
a week later the soviets reversed a longstanding policy of no 
fraternizing between the soldiers and local residents they invited 
the town to visit the base a similar invitation has been extended 
to the residents of franfkurt an der oder a town on the polish 
border 
even before the new open door policy the barrier between 
germans and soviet soldiers had begun to collapse soviet soldiers 
began receiving german currency on july 1 
but they found themselves secondclass citizens in a land of 
plenty a privates monthly wage is only 16 
violence theft and corruption are on the rise among troops 
desperate for money 
police report that hardpressed soviet soldiers are selling 
weapons including machine guns and grenades as well as uniforms 
one officer reportedly rented out the men from his unit to help on 
a local collective farm

an array of imported food can be seen in 
baghdad grocery stores these days despite the united nations trade 
embargo imposed on iraq in retaliation for its invasion of kuwait 
but many of the items on store shelves are from what iraqis call 
their 19th province kuwait which was stripped of consumer goods 
after iraq took over on aug 2 
buyers in baghdad can find mackerel from china sardines tuna 
and pineapples from asia olives from morocco butter cookies from 
denmark and grape juice from austria they can even get american 
hot sauce 
but whether they can afford the items is another question 
prices are rising beyond the reach of the common man in this city 
of 45 million 
at baghdads popular riverside fish restaurants almost all the 
tables are full and diners have a choice of roast chicken baked 
fish or beef but a chicken lunch in an average restaurant costs 
15 
motorists at baghdads open market pack their cars with whatever 
food is available 
before i used to buy food for the whole month now i buy all 
the food i can get a taxi driver said 
the basics wheat milk sugar and tea are not available and 
this is hurting many average iraqis said a european diplomat 
who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity 
the government has rationed these items along with cooking oil 
soap detergent and rice 
the milk situation is pretty grim said an iraqi official 
who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
he would not give any figures but said i would say that 
pretty soon we will be in a serious crisis 
our assessment is that without any external help iraqis can 
last four to five months said an asian diplomat and by that 
time their winter wheat crops will be ready 
he noted that iraqi farmland is very fertile and abundantly 
irrigated by rivers 
like any other developing society farming had been neglected 
in iraq but now it appears that the government is serious he 
said 
before the aug 2 invasion of kuwait brought on the un 
embargo iraq had imported most of its food 
now in an effort to fight the blockade the government has 
asked farmers to triple wheat cultivation by devoting all farmland 
into the crop 
financial incentives have been offered and orders issued that no 
land should go to waste 
we expect big response and big success said deputy prime 
minister sadoun hamadi 
these objectives center on the main issue of selfsufficiency 
in grains at least at a minimum level although some say that we 
are able to go beyond that hamadi said 
state television runs programs on how to raise poultry an iraqi 
staple and cultivate the ubiquitous date palm 
there is tremendous enthusiasm said jihada samran abedhi a 
50yearold mother of seven children who heads a collective farm 
at sholei 16 miles west of baghdad 
about 200 men and women work on the farm 
we are planting wheat on 80 percent of our land this season 
she told a group of reporters we are also planting barley beans 
and potatoes 
we know about efforts by imperialist america to starve us but 
this is not going to work mrs abedhi said as she drove off to 
instruct a group of farmers 
availability of fertilizers is uncertain and spare parts and 
lubricants for agricultural equipment as well as imported seed 
may run out because of the trade embargo diplomats said 
if the government succeeds in promoting agriculture the way it 
is doing now it will suddenly be a big plus point in fighting the 
blockade said the european diplomat 
but then you just cannot survive on wheat he said they 
need cooking oil sugar and beans 
while there appear to be no critical food shortages yet the 
un blockade is reportedly hitting iraqi industry hard 
at least 60 percent of the industry is either closed or about 
to close down the asian diplomat said many are running below 
25 percent capacity 
time will come when iraqis will need cement steel or plastic 
where are they going to get it from

president bush promised friday that iraqs 
aggression will not be rewarded by some compromise and said 
that american forces in the persian gulf are ready for military 
action if necessary 
bush met for more than an hour with senior soviet official 
yevgeny m primakov who was sent to iraq two weeks ago by 
president mikhail s gorbachev in search of a political settlement 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush 
emphasized that the international community is prepared to 
consider alternative options if sanctions and diplomacy fail to 
drive iraqs army out of kuwait 
fitzwater said the presidents resolve was firm and firmly 
expressed 
the united states has provided the bulk of troops more than 
200000 and naval units to defend saudi arabia and the gulf the 
soviet union while solidly backing economic pressures against 
iraq has made only a minimal contribution to the multinational 
force in the gulf 
emerging from the meeting primakov expressed hopes for a 
peaceful outcome but said the soviet union strongly supports united 
nations resolutions and sanctions against iraq 
i believe we should not rule out the possibilities of a 
peaceful solution until we have exhausted all options the soviet 
official told reporters in the white house driveway 
at the same time he said iraqs aggression was unacceptable 
one cannot allow a situation where actions which are incompatible 
with the civilized society would be applauded he said 
primakov said he was not carrying any message from iraqi 
president saddam hussein because i am not a messenger 
similarly white house officials said there were no new proposals 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler asked if there 
were any signs that iraq was willing to compromise said not 
that im aware of 
even before primakov arrived at the white house bush emphasized 
us unwillingness to make any concessions to saddam 
im determined as i was the day that the first troop left that 
saddam husseins aggression not be rewarded by some compromise 
the president said not be rewarded by our failing to get him 
totally out of kuwait or restore the legitimate rulers 
in remarks to italianamerican leaders bush said the bottom 
line is he cant prevail 
in his private talks with primakov bush said ussoviet 
cooperation has been an important factor in isolating saddam 
fitzwater said bush told primakov there is no interest either 
on the part of the united states or the international community 
for any partial solution to the blatant aggression that iraq has 
perpetrated against kuwait 
fitzwater said bush had told gorbachev at their september 
summit in helsinki that us forces in the gulf are available 
should their use be necessary and that point was made again 
today 
primakov outlined his personal impressions of iraqi leaders 
whom he knows well and discussed the situation in the gulf and the 
prospects for a diplomatic solution fitzwater did not characterize 
primakovs remarks 
the soviet official replied guardedly when reporters asked if he 
were optimistic about chances for a peaceful settlement i cannot 
say that i have become less moderately optimistic than i used to be 
before primakov said 
meanwhile fitzwater said there was an urgent need for steps to 
be taken at the un to help the handful of american officials who 
are keeping the us embassy in kuwait open in defiance of iraqi 
occupying forces 
clearly some kind of action will need to be taken in the not 
too distant future to either resupply the embassy or to remove or 
otherwise ensure the safety of our citizens there he said so 
it is an imminent question that we need to deal with and we think 
the un is the appropriate forum to do that

clayton williams own words in a new attack ad aimed at her 
opponent in the texas governors race 
the ad repeats williams controversial joke about rape plus a 
more recent comment that he hoped richards a recovering alcoholic

williams

rape made last march when he likened bad weather to rape and said 
if it were inevitable relax and enjoy it 
williams quickly apologized saying he didnt mean to offend

liberal washington insiders out to raise taxes

sales of homestead properties

look on how to make a services tax fairer than the repealed 
version 
martinez has signed the biggest tax increases in florida 
history his popularity plummeted after the services tax 
controversy

taxcutter 
i want to find out what the hell weve done with the 38 
billion that weve raised over the last four years chiles said

a judge on friday acquitted a company and seven of 
its former employees of manslaughter charges in the sinking of a 
ferry off the coast of belgium three years ago 
the disaster on the herald of free enterprise left 193 people 
dead 
the justice sir michael john turner told the jury to find p 
and o european ferries dover ltd three former directors and two 
former seamen not guilty on the trials 27th day he said the 
preosecution had failed to prove manslaughter 
he also ordered the jury to acquit two other former seamen when 
prosecutors said they would drop their case against them 
if convicted the company would have faced an unlimited fine and 
the seven men could have received a maximum sentence of life 
imprisonment 
relatives of the victims fought for more than three years to 
bring what was believed to be only the second charge of corporate 
manslaughter against a company in the first case a construction 
company was acquitted in 1965 
in explaining the acquittal the judge told jurors the 
evidence already called is such that you properly directed 
could not properly convict the company and the five most senior 
defendants 
the herald of free enterprise a car and passenger ferry 
overturned off the belgian port of zeebrugge carrying 454 
passengers and 80 crew members on march 6 1987 
headed for the southern english port of dover it had set sail 
just six minutes earlier with its bow doors open 
all the defendants had denied the manslaughter charge only one 
person who died in the sinking of the ferry was named in the test 
case to simplify the charges 
the defendants were accused of unlawfully killing alison 
gaillard 27 a passenger who was on a day trip aboard the ferry 
besides the company the defendants were the chief marine 
superintendent jeffrey develin deputy chief marine superintendent 
john alcindor technical director wallace ayres senior master john 
kirby and master of the herald david lewry 
chief officer leslie sabel and assistant boatswain mark stanley 
were the two defendants whose cases were dropped by prosecutors 
they said it was not in the public interest to proceed 
stanley the man responsible for closing the bow doors was 
asleep in his cabin and sabel the officer responsible for 
ensuring they were closed has admitted he did not fulfill his 
duty 
turner said there was no direct evidence that a reasonable 
person occupying the position of any of the five senior defendants 
would have perceived the risk as obvious or serious 
families of the victims were very disappointed and saddened 
by the outcome said maurice de rohan chairman of the herald 
families association and the father of mrs gaillard 
but he said the fact that it came to court and that corporate 
responsibility was accepted as a possible verdict was important 
society progresses in steps we believe that we have progressed 
the company has settled piecemeal most of the claims by 
survivors and relatives 
another judge who headed a 1987 inquiry into the disaster blamed 
the tragedy on sloppy management at the company formerly called 
townsend thoresen but he ruled that no statutory offense had been 
committed by the ferry operator 
an inquest earlier had returned a verdict of unlawful killing

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and his main 
political rival russian president boris n yeltsin are deadlocked 
over the economic and political future of the soviet union 
after yeltsin quit the communist party last july gorbachev 
sought to compromise with him over how to shift the country from a 
centrally planned to a marketdriven economy 
those efforts broke down a month ago and the dispute 
intensified on tuesday after gorbachev disclosed his latest reform 
package 
gorbachevs plan overwhelming approved friday by the 
legislature stops far short of the more radical one adopted last 
month by the russian federation parliament which yeltsin heads as 
president of the republic 
thus gorbachev is trying to carry out moderate reform against 
opposition from the largest of the 15 soviet republics russia has 
more than half the soviet unions population and the lions share 
of its natural resources including oil coal gas timber gold 
and diamonds 
gorbachev took yeltsin to task on friday in a speech to 
lawmakers 
comrade yeltsins assertions are strange to say the least 
he said im under the impression that the russian leadership is 
afraid of difficulties and wants to pass on responsibility for 
possible difficulties and consequences onto central organs of 
power 
yeltsin for his part derided gorbachevs program hours after 
it was disclosed on tuesday calling it another endeavor to 
perpetuate the system hated by the people 
yeltsin predicted it will take less than six months to realize 
that the chosen road is another blunder adding if we 
procrastinate and put off further there will be nothing to reform 
because the economy will simply fall to pieces 
the government seems already in pieces and that will hamper any 
reforms gorbachev puts forward says ed hewett an economist at the 
brookings institution in washington 
what is important is confidence in the government and that is 
falling he said even if you produced a very detailed plan 
that was very radical but gave it to a government that has a 
reputation of doing nothing little could happen 
beyond the question of confidence and rivalry the heart of the 
dispute between gorbachev and yeltsin concerns the political 
structure of the soviet union 
gorbachev seeks in his program to preserve the integrity of 
the union as a federation 
yeltsin says the republics should take control of their own 
economies then negotiate new forms of cooperation among 
themselves not unlike the east european nations that broke from 
moscow last year 
besides a rebellious russia gorbachev faces a growing 
separatist movement in the secondmost populist republic the 
ukraine 
nearly all of the soviet republics have declared some form of 
economic and political sovereignty including the three baltic 
republics which have declared outright independence 
whether or not gorbachev the reformer believes in yeltsins 
radical prescription gorbachev the politician is chained to a 
topheavy government bureaucracy that perpetuates central rule 
the normally tame state news agency tass on thursday endorsed 
the plan supported by yeltsin it is named after its principal 
author economist stanislav shatalin 
gorbachev is unwilling to consider radically breaking the 
managerial structures amid increasing political instability an 
inevitable result of yeltsins plan the news agency said 
but tass said the plan is possibly the only form of surgery 
that can help the ailing soviet economy recover 
gorbachevs defenders who include many reformist economists 
said his program represented the speediest possible path to doing 
away with the heavily centralized system which has produced 
consumer shortages and a technologically moribund society 
abel aganbegyan a pioneer of soviet reform told lawmakers 
wednesday that yeltsin was motivated by ambition and not economics 
he made a political speech and would have spoken this way 
regardless of what we had proposed aganbegyan said 
the communist party daily pravda one of the most traditionalist 
publications defended gorbachev saying the nation has inherited 
a pitiful legacy from the central planning system 
pravda praised a number of gorbachevs proposed steps that would 
have seemed politically impossible a year ago but are now being 
criticized by yeltsin and others as halfway measures they 
include 
laying the foundations for a voluntary unification of 
sovereign republics within the framework of a federative and strong 
union 
establishing an internally convertible ruble to open up 
broad opportunities for the influx of foreign investments which 
the country badly needs a convertible currency is one that can 
be exchanged for other monies on the open market 
creating a central bank similar to the us federal reserve 
to regulate credit rates and monetary supply bold new steps in a 
soviet economy where credit has been all but unavailable and the 
government has printed rubles to meet its spending needs 
energetic measures for denationalizing and demonopolizing 
the economy for promoting entrepreneurship and elements of 
competition 
but those proposals dont meet the demands of russia and other 
republics if trends continue the central government could lose 
authority and it would fall to the republics to reconstitute the 
nation

mayor marion barrys attorney on friday 
withdrew his request for a retrial on the mayors misdemeanor 
cocaine possession conviction 
i have spoken with my client and he has decided to withdraw 
that motion for a mistrial defense lawyer l kenneth mundy told 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson during a 
presentencing hearing 
barry scheduled to be sentenced oct 26 faces up to a year in 
prison and a maximum fine of 100000 he did not attend fridays 
court session 
law enforcement officials had said us attorney jay b stephens 
might consider retrying the mayor on a dozen charges the jury could 
not resolve if barry pushed ahead with his request for another 
trial stephens had said earlier that he would not conduct another 
trial 
mundy said the decision to withdraw the request was reached 
before the government filed papers opposing the motion 
in the 10minute hearing friday mundy asked that the sentencing 
be delayed because he hadnt had enough time to respond to a 
presentencing report prepared by the mayors parole officer 
we disagree wholeheartedly with the presentencing report 
mundy said 
the report was not released in open court but mundy said his 
chief objection was its apparent conclusion that barry has neither 
shown remorse nor taken responsibility for his actions by admitting 
to prior drug use 
there is an ongoing probe of mr barry and some of the 
questions being asked of witnesses involve drug use by mr 
barry mundy said it would have been very perilous for him to 
make any presentencing statement to the parole officer until we 
know that there will be no other trial 
the judge denied the request to delay sentencing 
mundy originally asked for a retrial because he said some of the 
jurors were compromised when they witnessed a drug sting operation 
at the hotel where they were sequestered 
a jury convicted barry on aug 10 of one misdemeanor cocaine 
possession count acquitted him of another and deadlocked on a 
dozen other counts including a charge resulting from his jan 18 
arrest in an fbi sting operation at a downtown washington hotel 
barry said in advance of his trial that he would not seek 
reelection but announced his candidacy for the city council after 
the conclusion of his trial

helping set the stage for some rougher times ahead for farmers an 
agriculture department report said friday 
net cash income of farmers the difference between grosscash 
income and cash expenses is still expected to be at a record 
level in 1990 probably in the range of 59 billion to 63 billion 
that is unchanged from previous forecasts by the departments 
economic research service 
however abundant crops lackluster commodity prices the oil 
shock and a weaker global economic outlook are putting downward 
pressure on farmers receipts and boosting expenses for this 
quarter and into next year the report said 
farmers have undergone a major financial restructuring since 
the previous oil shock and recession in the early 1980s it said 
total farm debt has dropped about onethird from the 1983 peak of 
193 billion 
with a lighter debt burden and record income this year us 
farmers are in a stronger position to withstand a drop in income 
the report said 
the agency did not make a prediction of 1991 farm income 
however that forecast is expected to be announced during the 
departments annual outlook conference here nov 2729

amnesty international on friday called on the 
lebanese government to launch an independent investigation into 
reports syrian forces executed at least 30 supporters of gen 
michel aoun 
the lebanese government has denied that scores of soldiers loyal 
to aoun were massacred after surrendering to syrian and lebanese 
forces who crushed his 11month rebellion 
president elias hrawi said aoun ordered his troops to keep 
fighting even after he had broadcast a surrender message and taken 
refuge in the french embassy in beirut on oct 13 
amnesty also called on syrian authorities to investigate the 
role of their troops in the incidents which it alleged took place 
during aouns defeat on oct 1314 
although the full circumstances are not clear the killings of 
prisoners are said to have been carried out by syrian troops in 
retaliation for shootings of their soldiers by aoun supporters 
amnesty said in an urgent appeal 
earlier this week journalists in beirut reported seeing a 
number of corpses in the mortuary at baabda hospital in beirut 
amnesty said it did not have any names of the victims but 
they are mostly reported to have been young men who were partially 
stripped and had their hands tied behind their backs before being 
shot in the head at close range 
the londonbased human rights organization said it was concerned 
about the safety of prisoners reportedly held by the lebanese and 
syrian armies amnesty said some of the prisoners had reportedly 
been taken from lebanon to undisclosed places of imprisonment in 
syria 
amnesty international has previously received reports of 
extrajudicial executions and torture of prisoners by syrian forces 
in lebanon torture of prisoners is widespread in syria the 
rights organization said

for reuters to provide upi with pictures from other countries the 
agreement was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985 
reuters later sued to void the agreement upi filed a 
counterclaim saying reuters had negotiated in bad faith 
the news organization said the settlement does not call for any 
compensation or monetary damages upi will have the option of 
ending the exchange agreement by giving reuters 30 days notice it 
said 
otherwise the londonbased agency will supply upi with foreign 
news photos withut charge until september 1992 after that upi

moslem guerrillas and government 
troops battled a sixth day friday for control of the provincial 
capital of zabul in southern afghanistan diplomatic and rebel 
sources said 
no casualty figures were known for either side 
the guerrillas known as mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
have fired a steady barrage of mortars into the besieged garrison 
overlooking zabuls capital city of qalat about 220 miles 
southwest of kabul the afghan capital the sources said 
about 500 soldiers barricaded in the fort were blasting 
resistance positions around qalat with heavy aerial and artillery 
attacks according to the sources who insisted on anonymity 
afghan warplanes airlifted arms ammunition and food to the troops 
they said 
hundreds of government soldiers surrendered to the mujahedeen 
earlier this week they said 
on oct 4 the guerrillas captured tarin kot the capital of 
uruzgan province which shares a border with zabul it was the 
guerrillas biggest success since soviet troops withdrew from 
afghanistan in february 1989 
qalat is considered strategically more important because its 
highway links eight afghan provinces with kabul 
diplomatic sources said qalats fall would not dramatically 
alter the military balance between the guerrillas and forces loyal 
to president najibullah but they said it would step up pressure on 
najibullah and his soviet backers to reach a settlement to the 
12yearold war the bloodiest and costliest conflict of the 
decade 
after the last of the 115000 soviet red army troops left 
afghanistan washington and moscow intensified discussions on how 
to end the war 
the two superpowers have agreed that elections should be held to 
decide the political future of the country but they still disagree 
on what role najibullah would play in an interim government 
washington insists he must relinquish control over the military 
and intelligence agencies a demand that najibullah and moscow 
reject 
moscow continues to send an estimated 500 million in weapons 
and supplies to kabul every month the united states provides about 
300 million to the resistance annually

iraq on friday ordered all foreigners in occupied kuwait to 
report to authorities or face punishment and announced it would 
ration gasoline to save imported chemicals used in refining fuel 
the gasoline rationing was the latest indication that 
international trade sanctions against iraq are having an impact 
the un embargo was imposed two months ago to force iraq out of 
kuwait which it invaded aug 2 
in new york there was good news about oil prices were down 
200 a barrel in early afternoon trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange to 3470 traders said prices eased after 
conciliatory remarks by an iraqi official 
iraqs deputy prime minister taha yassin ramadan said thursday 
in amman jordan that he thought both sides in the crisis were 
reassessing their positions and that peace talks could be in the 
offing 
but in washington president bush said he saw no chance for 
compromise in the persian gulf crisis 
i am as determined as i was the day the first troop left that 
saddam husseins aggression not be rewarded by some compromise 
bush said in a meeting with italianamerican leaders 
bush met later with a soviet envoy yevgeny primakov who said 
he agreed that the world should not relax its insistence on an 
unconditional iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
one cannot allow a situation where actions that are 
incompatible with a civilized society would be in order primakov 
said after the meeting 
a report published in iraqi newspapers friday said all 
foreigners in kuwait must register with local authorities before 
nov 5 
those who fail to do so will be responsible before the law 
and their residency cards will be canceled the report said

has squeezed baghdads supply of imported chemicals used in 
refining oil 
there is nothing to get worried about the rationing is 
just a precaution said oil minister issam abdulrahim 
alchalabithere is a lot of waste and by introducing the 
rationing we are going to cut that waste 
iraq is already rationing food staples such as milk meat and 
bread baghdad says there are shortages of all such products and 
many more 
car owners were ordered to pick up ration coupons at special 
centers although the minister did not say how much gasoline would 
be allocated to each person or how long the rationing would last

friday and long lines formed outside gas stations 
in moscow us defense secretary richard cheney praised soviet 
cooperation in bringing diplomatic and economic pressure to bear on 
iraq and said we have not given up on that policy 
i have also made it clear that we have not ruled out other 
options said cheney he declined to speculate on possible us 
military steps 
cheney later traveled to paris for three days of talks with the 
french government on cooperation in the gulf crisis france has 
deployed 13000 troops in the gulf the secondlargest western 
contingent after the united states

i think its probably very valuable for the jurors said

i think it helps keep them alert and attentive 
the aerobics break was intended to let jurors exercise more than 
their civic duty 
sitting and listening can be very fatiguing wharton said 
i saw no reason why exercise couldnt be beneficial to jurors who 
are forced to be inactive for long periods of time 
the session thursday was the third aerobics break during the 
trial 
ok you guys spread out aerobics instructor jan voellinger 
said as the jury stood and stretched the length of one wall in the 
small courtroom 
they began with simple inhaling and exhaling followed by neck 
movements looking to the right center and left 
the jurors then rolled their shoulders punched the air and 
bobbed their hips 
it does help relieve a little tension hamilton told the

secretary of state james a baker iii on 
friday proposed new cooperation with the soviet union to punish 
nations that spread nuclear technology and to prevent regional 
conflicts like the one that now threatens the persian gulf 
our search for points of mutual advantage has been 
productive baker said in a major foreign policy speech and 
the search must continue in new ambitious ways we now need to 
pursue our hopes for the postcold war future 
specifically baker called for cooperation in a regular 
almost daybyday fashion over a wide range of world problems 
including threats to the environment and uncertain access to vital 
resources 
these paths should cross at all levels among persons 
groups firms institutions cities and states baker said 
baker sounded a note of caution in an otherwise optimistic 
assessment of the chances of moving beyond an easing of cold war 
tensions to cooperation on several levels 
while hailing the growth of political democracy and the 
decentralization of economic power in the soviet union baker said 
the process was marked unfortunately by a deterioration in soviet 
life 
standards of living are falling shortages are spreading and this 
falls harvest is rotting baker noted moreover he said 
freedom has unleashed ageold ethnic animosities that often shout 
down the voices of tolerance 
calling for understanding of the hardships a great people is 
now enduring baker said this other darker side of the soviet 
revolution concerns all of us 
however he said he stands on the side of hope hope for a new 
soviet union built on democratic values 
baker delivered the speech to the american committee on 
ussoviet relations a predominantly liberal private group that 
urged cooperation with moscow long before it became us policy in 
the last years of the reagan administration 
the committee presented baker with its george f kennan award 
named for the american diplomat who helped originate the postworld 
war ii policy of containing the soviet union and who later 
advocated superpower cooperation 
eduard a shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister is the 
corecipient he received his award earlier in the month in new 
york 
bakers proposal for joint management of problems by washington 
and moscow began on the military level since a central concern of 
cooperation up to now has been how to cope with huge arsenals of 
nuclear and conventional weapons 
with new treaties to reduce arms nearing completion baker 
called for exchanges with moscow that would enable the united 
states to learn more about the doctrine and strategy soviet 
leaders follow for use of those weapons 
in this vein he said he would propose to shevardnadze the 
establishment of a ussoviet working group on ways the two sides 
could deter attack and on the conversion of weapons to peaceful 
uses 
turning to other topics baker said iraqs brutal subjugation 
of kuwait leaves no doubt that even though the danger of 
ussoviet confrontation has eased the world remains a dangerous 
place 
therefore he said the united states and the soviet union 
should collaborate to try to anticipate regional conflicts and try 
to resolve them before they lead to war 
also baker said the incipient nuclear programs of iraq and 
north korea are the best argument that our nonproliferation 
effort needs a new impetus to cope with a new danger 
consequently he proposed the united states and the soviet union 
agree that stopping the spread of nuclear chemical and biological 
weapons and missiles must be a central part of our agenda 
baker said the bush administration therefore would work with 
the soviet union to explore sanctions imposed by the two 
superpowers on nations that amass weapons of mass destruction

israeli troops shot and wounded at least 10 
palestinians in the occupied gaza strip friday during a violent 
protest of the killings on jerusalems temple mount earlier this 
month 
the clash was sparked by hundreds of worshipers in the khan 
yunis refugee camp who marched out of mosques and paraded with 
outlawed palestinian flags chanting our blood for al aqsa for 
saddam arab witnesses said 
they were referring to the al aqsa mosque on the temple mount 
where at least 19 palestinians were killed on oct 8 
iraqi president saddam hussein is viewed by most palestinians as 
a hero because he has tried to link the israeliarab conflict to 
the gulf crisis 
arab reports said soldiers fired live ammunition tear gas and 
rubber bullets to disperse the gaza demonstraters hospital 
officials said 10 people were admitted with live bullet wounds and 
over 50 were treated for injuries from rubber bullets 
the army said its troops opened fire after coming under a hail 
of stones and that 13 palestinians were slightly wounded from 
live ammunition and rubber bullets 
in jerusalem meanwhile police used water cannons to disperse 
hundreds of moslem youths who were protesting at being barred from 
prayer services at al aqsa mosque for a second consecutive week 
police blocked all residents of the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip from attending the services as well as all men from 
jerusalem under age 45 as a result fewer than 2000 moslems were 
at the service 
before the 34month palestinian uprising on a normal friday 
the moslem sabbath more than 10000 moslems would pray at al aqsa 
and the dome of the rock mosques on the temple mount 
moslem religious leaders charged friday that israel was 
interfering with their freedom of religion and demanded that all 
moslems be admitted to the mount for worship 
in a sermon at al aqsa moslem preacher mohammed hussein said 
the police step was an action of hate 
i say to the occupation authorities that you are preventing 
worshipers from getting into the house of god this is not in the 
religion of moses or jesus hussein said 
the temple mount known as haram essharif in arabic is one of 
the holiest sites in both islam and judaism the oct 8 clash in 
which 140 palestinians were also wounded was prompted when 
palestinians threw stones at jews worshiping at the western wall 
below 
jews revere the wall also known as the wailing wall as the 
last remnant of their ancient temple palestinians said the stoning 
began when rumors spread that jewish zealots planned to march on 
the temple mount 
in the occupied territories moslems were blocked from attending 
friday prayers by army curfews in scattered areas curfews kept 
145000 people in their homes in nablus the west banks largest 
city and in nearby refugee camps 
also friday a jerusalem magistrates court ordered two 
prominent palestinians kept in jail while police continue an 
investigation into whether they incited the oct 8 violence 
faisal husseini the leading plo activist in the occupied 
territories was ordered held seven more days and sheik mohammed 
jamal deputy moslem leader of jerusalem was remanded for five 
additional days both deny the allegations 
in his remand ruling judge david cheshin said there was more 
than sufficient grounds to support suspicions that the two incited 
worshipers on the temple mount to throw stones the itim news 
agency said 
the temple mount killings were condemned in a resolution passed 
unanimously by the un security council last week israel has 
refused to cooperate with a un probe into the incident but has 
launched its own investigation into the deaths

us defense secretary dick cheney on friday cited 
soviet cooperation in the persian gulf as helping end his 
skepticism toward the kremlin and fostering a belief that moscow is 
no longer an adversary 
i think that while i did in fact begin as a skeptic based on 
past experience i have been persuaded by the events of the last 18 
months that indeed we have entered a new era of ussoviet 
relations cheney said at a joint news conference with soviet 
defense minister marshal dmitri t yazov 
during his fourday soviet trip which ended friday cheney met 
with president mikhail s gorbachev yazov and other leaders 
visited an elite soviet airborne unit and toured an underground 
airdefense post and a mig29 factory he departed for paris after 
the news conference 
president gorbachev in his conversations with me reiterated 
the strong support of the soviet government for the international 
effort that has been mounted through the united nations and the 
support of the soviet people for the position of forcing saddam 
hussein to halt his aggression and to withdraw from kuwait 
cheney said 
the united states is undertaking a fundamental revision of its 
military strategy as a result of the significant improvements we 
have seen in us soviet relations he said he had told soviet 
officials 
i am very positive about the changes we have seen to date i 
think that the evidence is overwhelming that there is indeed change 
underway in soviet foreign and military policy cheney said 
he cited proposed treaties to slash conventional and strategic 
forces along with soviet withdrawal from eastern europe 
reunification of germany and cooperation in the un security 
council in opposing saddam husseins aggression in the gulf 
cheney while praising soviet help in bringing economic and 
diplomatic pressure to persuade hussein to withdraw from kuwait 
said i have also made it clear as have other officials of our 
government that we have not ruled out other options 
the soviet defense minister emphasized that we should look 
for political options to revolve the problem of the gulf 
i believe that if we succeed in resolving this conflict by 
political means it would be a good warning to those who people 
who try to disrupt peace in the future yazov said 
yazov hailed the superpower military talks saying we have 
never had such frank talks about deep cuts in our forces 
he also said that with completion of a proposed treaty to slash 
superpower strategic nuclear arsenals by up to half the soviet 
union might reduce its production of rockets by 50 percent as well 
but until such weapons are eliminated altogether he said the 
soviet union would continue to replace about 10 percent of its 
strategic rocket force every year to assure that they were in a 
state of readiness 
cheney in remarks wednesday to the soviet lawmakers said he 
was worried because the soviet union was conducting tests on four 
new ballistic missiles to replace the latest generation of weapons 
responding to questions about the turbulent soviet political 
situation yazov repeated his denials of rumors of a possible 
military coup at the kremlin to restore a hardline stance toward 
ethnic and regional unrest 
the armed forces of the soviet union are part and parcel of 
our people of this country and they will never raise arms against 
their people yazov said 
yazov declined to clarify conflicting reports about whether 
nuclear weapons had been removed from some areas such as the baltic 
and caucasian republics but he did say that longrange nuclear 
forces were stationed only in russia byelorussia and the ukraine 
his remark did not appear to cover shorterrange nuclear weapons 
that might be stationed or might have been removed from other 
republics 
yazov also said the military would hold its customary parade on 
red square this nov 7 the 73rd anniversary of the bolshevik 
revolution but he said similar parades might be restricted to 
military bases in cities where local authorities chose not to 
celebrate the holiday

a county judge skipped his usual opening 
prayer for the court friday after a federal judge ruled the 
blessing unconstitutional 
us district judge james mcmillan ruled thursday that judge 
bill constangys prayer was tantamount to government establishing 
religion 
the ruling decided a lawsuit against the mecklenburg district 
judge by the american civil liberties union and five charlotte 
lawyers who objected to constangys morning invocation 
with all due respect for judge constangys sincerity i must 
conclude that his prayer in the courtroom is contrary to the law of 
the land mcmillan wrote 
judge constangys prayer uttered in good faith to an audience 
that may include people of different faiths or no admitted faith 
at all is an obvious violation of the first amendment he wrote 
constangy said he will appeal the ruling 
i do not want anybody to be disappointed said constangy 
who was appointed to the bench in 1989 this is just the first 
round 
each day since taking office constangy has recited a 67word 
prayer he composed 
oh lord our god our father in heaven we pray this morning 
that you will place your divine guiding hand on this courtroom and 
that with your mighty outstretched arm you will protect the 
innocent give justice to those who have been harmed and mercy to 
us all let truth be heard and wisdom be reflected in the light of 
your presence here with us today amen 
constangy a roman catholic said he intended the prayer to be 
very nonsectarian nonproselytizing 
there are three reasons why i open with prayer constangy 
said they are to express a reverence for god to set proper tone 
for the court and to continue the american tradition of opening 
deliberative bodies with prayer 
constangy said that before the lawsuit he heard complaints from 
only two attorneys one of them joined the lawsuit

while troops conduct maneuvers in 
the desert and pilots fly training missions naval interceptions to 
enforce the embargo against iraq are the only truly operational 
element of desert shield 
us military officials said friday there have been about 2500 
interceptions and 240 boardings the past two months 
us warships had a role in 191 of the boardings the officials 
said the british australian and spanish navies have participated 
jointly in some 
in 11 cases commercial ships were diverted to ports other than 
their destination after being suspected of carrying cargo bound to 
or from iraq the officials said in a report 
the embargo was imposed on iraq following its aug 2 takeover of 
kuwait navies from about a dozen nations are taking part in the 
gulf efforts 
the un security council imposed a trade embargo on iraq 
following its takeover of kuwait later the same month the council 
voted to back the sanctions with military might 
navies from about a dozen nations are taking part in the gulf 
efforts 
on a handful of visits to vessels in the persian gulf region 
reporters have heard radio traffic exchanges between naval ships 
and commercial vessels and have seen demonstrations of how the 
boarding teams operate 
but none of the journalists covering operation desert shield 
have been present in instances in which warships fired warning 
shots to force merchant ships to stop nor have they seen any 
boarding by inspection teams 
after questioning ships as to their cargo and destination the 
warships may send boarding teams to determine whether the cargo is 
bound to or from iraq in violation of the un restrictions 
ships whose cargo or documents are suspect are then directed to 
ports other than their intended destination 
us officials have offered little to explain why the media have 
not been allowed to visit american warships performing embargo 
duty or why details have been provided by the navy in only a 
handful of cases 
navy cmdr mike doubleday a spokesman for the us command in 
riyadh blamed logistical problems especially transportation for 
journalists

two sections of the transalaska oil 
pipeline will be dug up to check claims that corrosion flaws were 
covered up earlier this year 
alyeska pipeline service co will begin the work next week if 
the company can quickly find a contractor agreeable to the state 
and to federal agencies said marnie isaacs a company spokeswoman 
the decision to dig comes a week after ed thompson a former 
employee of thorpe technical services inc claimed his employer 
an alyeska contractor falsified corrosion detection tests and 
tolerated widespread drug use among employees while working on the 
pipeline 
david vickery of the us bureau of land management said his 
agency the interior department and other federal agencies agreed 
thursday to dig at two sites thompson mentioned in his letter after 
interviews with others involved in the original inspections 
the two small sections of line to be dug up are at atigun pass 
171 miles south of prudhoe bay and near delta junction from 80 to 
160 feet of line will be dug up for the inspections 
vickery said the agencies will meet again next week to decide 
about more digs in other areas 
doug mertz a state assistant attorney general working on the 
investigation said it is clear that a substantial number of 
pipe sections will have to be dug up and reinspected he said he 
does not know exactly how many or where 
isaacs said the company agreed to reinspect the two sections at 
the informal request of the federal agencies and would not favor 
more digging until results are known from the first digs and after 
an investigation and audit of the original inspection project is 
complete 
she said the digs and reinspections will cost less than 100000 
for both but did not have a precise figure 
the inspections will not impact the flow of oil through the 
pipeline alyeska said 
the persian gulf crisis has prompted increased oil production on 
alaskas north slope 
since last summer alyeska has increased flow by about 300000 
barrels a day to its current level of 195 million barrels daily 
isaacs said 
state and federal officials say they wont agree to increase the 
pressure of oil in the pipeline a factor in increasing the flow 
until the inspection issues are settled officials are concerned 
that increased pressure on a weakened section of the line could 
cause a leak 
by using chemicals that reduce the friction of oil flowing 
through the line alyeska could pump 2 million barrels a day and 
still honor the pressure limits we currently operate under 
isaacs said 
alyeska runs the transalaska pipeline for the seven major oil 
companies that on it the 800mile line provides onefourth of 
us oil production 
isaacs said that while alyeska has no worries about the 
integrity of the pipeline it is concerned about the alleged 
mismanagement of the inspectors 
dale thorpe president of thorpe technical services said he 
welcomes the inspections as a chance to vindicate the quality of 
the companys work 
i think its great he said we know the exact results of 
whats going to happen

a government prosecutor friday 
challenged a local judges decision to postpone until february the 
trial of winnie mandela and seven of her former bodyguards on 
charges of kidnapping and assault 
mrs mandela wife of african national congress leader nelson 
mandela has denied any wrongdoing she and the others are accused 
of abducting and beating four young men at her house in the soweto 
black township 
the leader of her bodyguards jerry richardson earlier was 
convicted of murdering one of the four and was sentenced to death 
the eight defendants appeared sept 24 in magistrates court in 
soweto where her attorney argued that the original oct 30 trial 
date left mrs mandela insufficient time to prepare 
magistrate tf veldman postponed the supreme court trial until 
feb 4 
transvaal attorney general klaus von lieres on friday asked the 
supreme court to rule that a magistrate lacks the power to change 
the supreme court trial date von lieres set 
the delay in challenging the postponement was not immediately 
explained 
the supreme court reserved judgment 
the charges stem from a december 1988 incident that killed 
14yearold stompei seipei 
during richardsons trial the three other alleged victims 
testified they were abducted by members of the mandela united 
football club mrs mandelas bodyguards and taken to her home 
they said mrs mandela whipped them and that the others also 
assaulted them 
if convicted of the charges against them the defendants could 
receive punishment ranging from a suspended sentence to the death 
penalty lawyers said the death sentence has never been imposed for 
kidnapping in south africa 
white and black leaders fear mrs mandelas trial could strain 
relations between the anc and the government as they try to start 
talks on ending apartheid 
youths on the soccer club mrs mandela formed played few matches 
and were accused of terrorizing the soweto neighborhood where she 
lived 
according to testimony at richardsons trial the bodyguards 
accused seipei of being a police informer and the other three of 
having homosexual relations with the white minister at their church 
home 
no evidence was presented that seipei a wellknown 
antiapartheid activist was a police spy the methodist church 
cleared the minister of any misconduct

ousted prime minister benazir bhutto 
spoke to a campaign rally friday that attracted 100000 people and 
predicted her party would wash away the opposition if theres 
no fraud in next weeks elections 
after arriving three hours late ms bhutto spoke to the 
supporters from a 10foot high stage surrounded by barbed wire to 
hold back the surging screaming crowd 
huge posters of ms bhutto kneeling with her covered head bowed 
in prayer towered over the crowd in liaqat park the site where 
pakistans first prime minister liaqat ali khan was assassinated 
39 years ago 
president ghulam ishaq khan used his constitutional power to 
oust ms bhutto aug 6 and replace her with a caretaker government 
he charged her administration had plundered the national treasury 
and engaged in corruption and nepotism 
ms bhutto claims the charges were a false pretext for a 
politically motivated action 
a court thursday upheld the legality of her dismissal but ms 
bhuttos pakistan peoples party ppp has gained momentum in 
recent weeks heading into wednesdays election presumably due to 
the perception that she is being persecuted 
the 37yearold ms bhutto was joined on the rawalpindi stage by 
her partners in a threeparty coalition that faces a rightwing 
alliance of nine parties 
she warned the candidates to be wary of rigging by the 
armybacked caretaker government and predicted attempts would be 
made to control the voting 
if there is no rigging a ppp flood will wash away my 
opponents she said 
she also said only her return to power would ensure a 
restoration of the 573 million us aid package to pakistan 
america stopped its aid because democracy ended when my 
government was dismissed she told the rally 
the united states technically suspended aid to pakistan on oct 
1 after president bush failed to guarantee to congress that 
islamabad was not developing nuclear weapons 
a decision on whether to renew the aid would come some time 
after a new pakistani governmient was elected officials in 
washington have said 
western diplomats said the 37yearold former prime minister has 
a strong lobby in the us congress 
there is still that image of benazir bhutto as the shining 
example of democracy in south asia said one diplomat who 
insisted he not be identified further

an international panel said friday it would 
include in a list of chemicals to be reviewed in 1992 a 
controversial drug that could induce cows to give more milk 
the drug bovine somatotropin or bst is still under review by 
the food and drug administration for possible use by us dairy 
farmers tests indicate the synthetic hormone could increase a 
cows milk production by 10 percent to 25 percent 
the codex committee on residues of veterinary drugs in foods met 
in closed session here this week the agenda included the setting 
of priorities for future reviews 
the committee was established in 1985 to create standards for 
safety of veterinary drug residues in foodproducing animals 
although it has no regulatory authority 
its parent the codex alimentarius commission was founded in 
1962 by the united nations to develop food standards and guidelines 
to protect consumers and defend fair trade 
the committees priority for 1991 included several groups of 
tranquilizers antiparasitic drugs and antibiotics 
for its 1992 review the committee selected several more groups 
including bovine somatotropin also known as bgh or bovine growth 
hormone 
the committee reported after the meeting that porcine 
somatotropin or pst which is being developed for swine would not 
be scheduled for review at this time 
one criterion for review is that the product be currently 
marketed in at least one country the committee said in its 
statement pst is not currently marketed 
an important part of the committees job is to designate 
reliable test methodology for detecting drug residues in food 
which is essential to national residue monitoring programs 
the panel said it agreed on validated test methods for 
albendazole and ivermectin antiparasitic drugs used in cattle and 
sheep and carbadox which is used to treat diarrhea diseases in 
swine 
thirtyfour countries and seven international organizations were 
said to have been represented at the conference

the us ambassador got hearty cheers 
instead of angry jeers when he showed up for the unification bash 
in berlin what a difference a year makes 
german grumbling about the us military had reached new peaks 
before the east bloc started crumbling the two germanys began 
marching to unity and washington decided to start cutting back on 
its troop levels 
some germans are still dissatisfied with the disarmament plans 
announced so far but antiamerican sentiments have significantly 
quieted 
the us embassy in bonn is no longer besieged by german 
journalists who ask why the american military seems insensitive to 
germans wishes 
us ambassador vernon a walters made a lot of german friends 
last year when he voiced his support for unity and germans greeted 
him with cheers when they spotted him at berlins unity party 
his predecessor richard burt was often heckled and booed 
because he was the symbol of the us military presence at a time 
of growing german impatience with nato troops 
german officials have welcomed the pending us troop pullouts 
and are eager for the military property that will become available 
to them 
us defense secretary dick cheney said last month that 30000 
soldiers would be withdrawn from germany 
across the former west germany officials are drawing up plans 
for the property which is sorely needed in a country with a severe 
housing shortage 
but at the same time there is worry about thousands of civilian 
jobs that will be lost because of the troop reductions 
there have been estimates that across germany about 108000 jobs 
are threatened by the us cutbacks 
american officials say germany gets an annual infusion of about 
875 billion because of the us troop presence alone 
some experts have said a total pullout of all nato troops from 
germany could bring economic disaster 
i think that many germans are now starting to realize what an 
economic boon it is to have the americans here says harry 
spittler owner of harrys gift shop in kaiserslautern like many 
businesses in the area spittlers store relies heavily on the 
business of american gis 
germans may be having kinder thoughts about their american 
guests now that many of them are about to leave but the upcoming 
cutbacks have also caused some new friction some state and local 
officials had hoped to get their hands on properties that arent 
being immediately abandoned 
the troop reduction plans have also caused disputes among 
germans 
in some areas people have been arguing over whether military 
air bases should become commercial airports many citizens ask why 
the noise of military aircraft should be replaced with that of 
commercial planes

spiral binders concerning honecker 
toppled from power a year ago honecker is being investigated 
for corruption and murder and causing bodily harm for the 
shoottokill orders for wouldbe escapees from east germany about 
200 people were killed trying to flee east germany 
investigators are seeking enough evidence to arrest and jail the 
78yearold deposed party boss before trial 
honecker has been quoted as saying he wants to stay in germany 
but he has previously noted his wish to visit chile where his 
daughter erika lives with her husband and child there is also 
speculation he could head to the soviet union where some of his 
top spies reportedly have found refuge 
as a prosecutor i am strictly bound to the provisions of the 
criminal law and i can only hinder freedom of travel when the 
conditions have been met said schaefgen 
honecker reportedly is suffering from cancer but looked fit in 
recently shot tv news footage taken outside the soviet military 
hospital where he is staying 
berlin justice officials heightened interest in the case by 
announcing a news conference friday to give an interim report on 
the criminal probes into honecker and others 
some people had expected the announcement of his pending arrest 
instead schaefgen said a heavy workload so far has hindered 
progress in the honecker case 
schaefgen said under german law prosecutors must turn their 
attention to the cases of two members of honeckers former regime 
who are already jailed erich mielke the former east german 
secret police chief and former government trade union boss harry 
tisch 
this means that we have not been able to devote ourselves to 
the honecker probe with as much intensity as you would have 
expected the prosecutor said 
he said the steppedup probe against honecker would begin as 
soon as possible 
both miekle and tisch are charged with corruption and mielke is 
also being investigated for complicity in murders of east germans 
after they had abandoned their country 
berlin justice department chief jutta limbach said a lack of a 
sufficient number of prosecutors also has slowed the probe against 
honecker 
this takes time and patience said ms limbach who urged 
prosecutors from other parts of germany to come to berlin to help 
relieve the workload 
ms limbach said using former east german prosecutors would be 
difficult until a full review of their past

democratic gubernatorial candidate ann richards on 
friday denounced a new mexico mans allegation that he saw her use 
cocaine 13 years ago and called it a smear by gop candidate 
clayton williams 
this stinks to high heaven richards told reporters 
richards a recovering alcoholic has been dogged by drug 
questions since february during a televised debate she refused to 
say whether she had ever used illegal drugs 
my political opponents cannot resist using my illness when all 
else is failing in their campaigns richards said 
reggie bashur a williams consultant said the republicans 
campaign had nothing to do with the charge we are not involved 
and ann richards knows it he said 
as far as were concerned this comes totally out of left 
field its unfortunate that ms richards is so shrill and so 
panicked bashur said 
the allegation was contained in a story published friday by the 
albuquerque nm journal it was reiterated later in the day at a 
san antonio news conference held by bexar county sheriff harlon 
copeland 
that story and the actions of the republican sheriff of bexar 
county have taken the clayton williams smear campaign to new 
lows richards said 
the newspaper and the sheriff cited interviews with jd arnold 
a santa fe nm tour operator arnold also was a press secretary 
to former rep jim mattox now state attorney general who lost the 
gubernatorial nomination to richards in april 
copeland said arnold gave a sworn statement that he saw richards 
use cocaine at the stoneleigh p bar in dallas on dec 7 1977 
following a mattox fundraiser 
i just cant understand why anyone who is a drug user would 
try to get into high office copeland said ann richards did 
you use drugs or did you not use drugs 
he denied he had a political motive in making the allegation 
public saying arnolds name surfaced during a san antonio drug 
trafficking investigation 
this is a dangerous and unpardonable subversion of the police 
function of bexar county by a campaign that has not only lost its 
momentum it has lost its moral compass richards said the 
actions of the bexar county sheriff represent an abuse of power 
arnold told the albuquerque newspaper he made the allegation 
public because i cant stand ann richards 
im so sick of her he said im sick of everything shes 
done it all goes back to the comments she made about mattox 
like hes like a chickenkilling dog 
the affidavit described in the article of jd arnold is not 
true richards said 
richards introduced to reporters two women who said she hadnt 
attended the 1977 party her longtime friend betty mckool of 
dallas and martha harris of austin mckool said richards was with 
her that night harris said she attended the party and richards 
wasnt there 
richards accused williams of trying to divert attention from an 
investigation into his claydesta national bank and its practices of 
giving car loans to highrisk customers 
williams has denied any wrongdoing

a bill presented to zambias parliament 
friday would rewrite the constitution to allow opposition parties 
for the first time in 17 years 
the bill signed by attorneygeneral frederick chomba repeals 
article iv of the constitution which made president kenneth 
kaundas united national independence party the only legal 
political party 
zambias rubberstamp parliament routinely passes any initiative 
that is passed to it by the executive 
kaunda 66 led the british colony to independence in 1964 and 
imposed a oneparty state in 1973 
the onetime missionary teacher has often argued that democracy 
in africa unleashes tribal conflicts and hinders development 
but faced by dwindling popularity due to widespread corruption 
mismanagement inflation and unemployment he promised multiparty 
elections next year 
in june at least 27 zambians were killed by security forces 
during nationwide demonstrations against increased food prices the 
bloodiest urban violence since independence 
at the height of the rioting jeering crowds called for kaundas 
resignation one of the first public expressions of opposition to 
his leadership 
kaundas main challenge springs from the fledgling movement for 
multiparty democracy a congress of opposition groups planning to 
establish one rival political party 
the movements chairman former cabinet minister arthur wina 
and its secretary businessman akashambatwa mbikusitalewanika 
have been appointed by kaunda to a 22member commission that is 
redrafting the constitution

the pentagon said friday it is shipping 
several hundred of its best tanks from storage depots in europe to 
saudi arabia to join us forces arrayed against iraq 
the transfer of m1a1 main battle tanks to armored units in the 
saudi desert is the latest indication of a declining us emphasis 
on defending against a soviet ground attack in europe 
the pentagon also said the bush administration is in the final 
stages of approving the sale of 220 older m60 tanks in europe to 
saudi arabia oman and bahrain it said the sale would contribute 
to the security in the persian gulf area 
the announcement did not say exactly how many m1a1 tanks were 
being transferred to us forces in saudi arabia but it appeared 
the total was 300 to 400 
the m1a1 is the latest model produced in the united states it 
has better protection against chemical and biological weapons 
attack and its germandesigned 120mm gun is more capable than the 
105mm gun on the older m1 tanks the m1a1 also has better armor 
the m1a1 also has better armor and it is the first american tank 
with a microclimatic cooling system designed to combat the 
effects of excessive heat on the tanks engine and weapons system 
it also has a thermal sighting system that gives the tank an added 
capability to fight at night and in low visibility 
about 600 m1 and m1a1 tanks already are deployed to saudi arabia 
with the 3rd armored cavalry regiment and other armored units so 
the addition of m1a1s from europe would bring the total us tank 
strength to nearly 1000 that compares with the 3500 iraqi tanks 
that the pentagon says are deployed in kuwait and southern iraq 
in its announcement the pentagon said the tanks being 
transferred to saudi arabia wont be needed in europe once the 
conventional forces in europe treaty is completed which could come 
by the end of the year the cfe treaty requires the nato countries 
to reduce their tank inventory to 20000 meaning that about 4000 
tanks will have to be destroyed 
the pentagon said that the administration has proposed to the 
nato allies that the m1a1 tanks being sent to saudi arabia be 
counted against the nato total under cfe meaning the m1a1s would 
not have to be destroyed even if returned to europe

deficitreduction bills passed by the house 
and senate would cut taxes for many of the 70 million couples and 
individuals with incomes under 20000 a year 
although the aim of the bills is to raise taxes the legislation 
would reduce the burden on that large class of taxpayers by 
boosting the earnedincome credit for poor working families with 
children the increase is designed to offset higher consumer taxes 
in both bills 
the joint committee on taxation estimates the senate bill would 
raise the tax burden on people in the 20000to50000 income 
range by about 28 percent three times as much as would the house 
bill 
people making between 50000 and 75000 would pay 19 percent 
more under the senate bill and 14 percent more under the house 
bill those between 75000 and 100000 would see a 25 percent 
tax increase under the senate measure and 15 percent in the house 
bill 
the senate would boost the tax burden of people with incomes 
between 100000 and 200000 by 35 percent five times as much 
as would the house bill the over200000 group would pay 37 
percent more in the senate bill and 74 percent more under the 
house version 
here is how the bills compare 
gasoline the senate would raise the 9cent gasoline tax to 18 
cents a gallon by 1992 and the 15cent diesel tax to 24 cents no 
increase in the house bill neither bill affects heating oil 
indexing the house would forgo for one year the annual 
adjustments to income tax brackets and personal exemptions which 
are designed to protect against inflationcaused tax increases 
known as bracket creep as a result all except the wealthiest 
people would pay higher taxes every year in the future the senate 
has no such provision 
alcohol house raise the 1250agallon tax on 100proof 
liquor by 1 or 20 cents a fifth double the beer tax to 32 cents 
a sixpack raise taxes on most wines including for example 
table wine which would go from 3 cents a 750milliliter bottle to 
25 cents senate raise liquor 120 double beer raise table wine 
to 21 cents 
tobacco both raise the 16cent cigarette tax by 4 cents in 1991 
and another 4 cents in 1993 snuff cigars and other tobacco would 
face 25 percent tax increases each year 
air travel the 8 percent tax on airline tickets scheduled to 
drop to 4 percent at yearend would rise instead to 10 percent 
telephones the senate but not the house would make permanent 
the 3 percent tax on local and longdistance phone service which 
is due to expire dec 31 
luxuries either would impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of 
the price of cars above 30000 boats above 100000 jewelry 
above 5000 furs above 10000 house or 5000 senate and 
private planes 100000 house or 250000 senate 
tax rates the house bill would raise the top rate paid by the 
wealthiest people now 28 percent to 33 percent it would impose a 
10 percent surtax on those with taxable incomes over 1 million 
the senate bill would do neither the house but not the senate 
would raise to 25 percent the 21 percent alternative minimum tax 
paid by some highincome people with large amounts of deductions 
that otherwise could reduce tax liability to near zero 
itemized deductions the senate would limit itemized deductions 
except those for medical expense casualty losses and investment 
interest of people with adjusted gross income over 100000 only 
95 percent of deductions would be allowed against the portion of 
income above 100000 
capital gains the house would allow a person to avoid tax on 
half of up to 200000 of capital gains earned in a lifetime the 
gains could come from most investments other than stocks or 
collectibles a person with annual income under 100000 could 
avoid tax on another 1000 a year of gains including those from 
the sale of stock no capital gain would be taxed at a rate above 
28 percent the senate bill has no capital gains provisions 
lowincome both bills would increase the earnedincome tax 
credit which benefits lowincome working families with children 
as a way of offsetting some of the increased excise taxes the 
senate plan expands child care benefits 
medicare taxes the house would increase to 100000 and the 
senate to 89000 the 51300 maximum annual wage to which the 145 
percent medicare tax applies the tax is withheld as part of the 
social security tax the senate would require all state and local 
government workers and their employers to pay the tax the house 
would continue exempting workers hired before april 1 1986 
medicare premiums house would raise the 2860 monthly premium 
for medicare part b insurance to 4620 by 1995 senate 47 
medicare deductible house would raise to 100 through 1995 the 
present 75 deductible which beneficiaries must pay before 
medicare starts paying for doctor bills senate 150 
social security both would require all state and local 
government workers not covered by a public pension to pay social 
security taxes 
energy initiatives the senate bill earmarks 35 billion worth 
of incentives for increasing us oil and gas exploration and 
production the house does not 
expiring provisions the senate but not the house would extend 
through 1991 at a fiveyear cost of 55 billion 11 targeted tax

who receive tuition aid or group legal services from employers 
businesses that hire the poor investors in lowincome rental 
housing selfemployed who buy their own health insurance

people buying a first home 
contributions the senate but not the house would permit 
upperincome people subject to the alternative minimum tax to 
deduct the current value of artwork donated to a museum present 
law allows them to write off only the purchase price

the citys suspended police chief 
maintained his innocence friday on charges of siphoning 58000 in 
special investigation funds 
our day in court will come and well have a chance to prove 
our innocence gordon urlacher said after a brief federal court 
hearing 
urlacher 47 was arrested thursday in the mayors office and 
charged with embezzlement and misapplying public funds he was 
released on 50000 bail 
the chief and four other police department employees were 
suspended with pay the others were not arrested 
urlacher posted the deed to his parents home in penfield a 
rochester suburb as bail security his mother marion urlacher 
signed the document and kissed her son before us magistrate 
kenneth fisher 
fisher scheduled a nov 6 preliminary hearing 
the criminal complaint accuses the police chief of stealing at 
least 58000 from department special investigation funds since 
1989 
the fbi was contacted earlier this month by an informant who 
worked in urlachers office and claimed to have helped urlacher 
take the money some of it set aside to buy drugs in undercover 
investigations 
the arrest and suspensions stunned department employees 
were all real devastated by it said police union president 
ronald evangelista if i had to pick four or five more honest 
cops i probably couldnt were going to support these people 
until theyre proven to hav done something wrong 
deputy chief terrence rickard one of those suspended said he 
worried about the departments reputation he also denied any 
personal wrongdoing 
i hurt for every one of these guys ive got out there with a

a city council committee seeking to ensure that 
houston laws governing sexuallyoriented businesses are legal 
brought in an expert to talk about the difference between male and 
female breasts 
the panel held a hearing thursday on a proposal to toughen the 
ordinance governing adult entertainment and related businesses 
i tell you it was difficult to keep a straight face said 
councilwoman christin hartung who chairs the committee addressed 
by gayle beck a university of houston professor and sex therapist 
she did not give us any anatomy lessons nor did we ask for 
them assistant city attorney paul bibler said 
councilman dale gorczynski summarized what the committee 
learned exposed male breasts are not arousing to women in our 
culture but exposed female breasts are arousing to men 
the proposed ordinance would regulate such businesses as strip 
clubs and adultvideo stores city officials want the law to 
withstand potential sex discrimination claims from people who may 
question why women must cover their breasts and men dont 
they look to the experience of fort worth where it is illegal 
for women to publically expose their breasts 
a fort worth topless club called sinbads won a challenge to the 
city ordinance last year complaining that police harassed the 
business and bothered customers last week the texas supreme court 
decided not to review the case letting the earlier decision stand 
houston restricts the location of strip clubs modeling studios 
and massage parlors the council wants to further restrict them 
the proposed ordinance will get a council hearing next month

stanford university scientists have 
found a chemical off switch that stops the replication of dna 
a discovery they believe could improve understanding of cancer 
aids and other diseases 
the researchers said in the october issue of cell they 
identified a protein that inhibits replication of dna in e coli a 
common bacterium stopping the dna keeps the cell from dividing 
while the bacterium is a relatively simple organism dna works 
essentially the same way in bacteria as in plants animals and 
humans researchers said dna or deoxyribonucleic acid is the 
genetic code found in all cells 
theres a universal use of basic biochemical patterns 
throughout nature that warrants our confidence that regulation of 
these processes when understood in one system will become easier 
to understand in all systems said arthur kornberg a 
biochemistry professor at stanford 
kornberg who won the 1959 nobel prize in medicine for earlier 
research in dna replication was coauthor of the report written 
after nine years of experiments 
we now believe we have most of the molecules that operate the 
switch of replication in pure form kornberg said 
if you know the anatomy of the switch if you have the hood 
off ad can see how the motor works you can then determine what 
factors provoke it to get started replicating or keep it in 
check he said 
kornbergs team also led by deog su hwang a stanford 
postdoctoral fellow found that the off switch for dna 
replication is a protein called 33kda the protein prevents the 
twin spiraled strands of dna molecules from replicating 
the team found the on switch a tiny segment on each 
chromosome activated by enzymes in 1981 chromosomes are formed of 
dna 
kornberg emphasized that the new discovery was only a tool for 
further research into the code that tells cells when and how to 
start and stop duplicating 
john minna a researcher at the national cancer institute 
called the stanford finding very exciting 
clearly this is a major new finding about the biochemistry of 
dna replication by dr kornberg the founding father of the whole 
field he said 
there are many diseases in which the cells ability to control 
dna replication is impaired minna said 
it could have profound implications for cancer and aids he 
said

the beam was discovered oct 3 when the shuttle was lifted into 
an upright position in an assembly room said jb kump a 
spokesma for lockheed space operations co of titusville the 
company is nasas primary shuttle contractor 
the beam part of a work platform banged around inside the 
compartment and caused about 25 dents and dings the damage was not 
expected to delay a secret military flight by atlantis set for 
around nov 10 
a ninemember lockheed team blamed human error and not worker 
fatigue experience or scheduling kump said the team based its 
finding on employee interviews 
the beam has since been removed 
kump said appropriate disciplinary actions would be taken 
against the employees involved he refused to elaborate

democrats pushed president bush to accept 
higher taxes on the richest americans friday as congress began a 
final drive to craft a compromise deficitreduction bill 
republicans warned that pressing bush too hard would merely 
invite a veto 
bush meanwhile signed a stopgap spending bill to keep the 
government functioning through next wednesday to give congress more 
time to work on a final budget compromise 
he signed the legislation shortly before leaving the white house 
for a weekend at the presidential retreat in camp david md 
gop lawmakers mustered around a bipartisan budget the senate 
adopted early friday imposing only modest tax increases on the 
wealthy and doubling the gasoline levy democrats preferred a 
housepassed version leaning heavily on the rich leaving the 
gasoline tax alone and easing cost increases on medicare 
recipients 
we believe in tax fairness and progressivity and thats what 
were going to fight for said house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo 
you can bet your life if a package is going to pass in this 
house its going to include the rich said rep charles rangel 
dny of the taxwriting ways and means committee 
but as house and senate budgetwriters began bargaining over a 
250 billion fiveyear package of taxes and spending cuts 
republicans warned that democrats could not go too far without 
risking a veto by bush 
i dont know why we have to go through a process of producing 
a bill that will not be signed said sen pete domenici of new 
mexico ranking republican on the budget committee 
bush reiterated his preference for the senate version and said 
i for the first time feel optimistic that we can get this job 
done for the american people 
the president visited the capitol for about an hour urging 
lawmakers to quickly fashion a compromise plan 
he said nobody is going to get all he wants senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan said afterward 
but with election day barely two weeks off senators who just 
hours earlier were united behind their compromise budget exhibited 
some of the same partisan strains that have divided house democrats 
and republicans for weeks 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said he 
did not feel obliged to fight for his chambers deficitcutting 
package i much prefer the house package with regard to revenues 
it puts a heavier burden on the wealthiest americans to pay their 
fair share 
responded domenici i dont think any good purpose is served 
by chairman sasser choosing sides frankly the house bill isnt 
that great 
although the pressure of another threatened governmental closure 
was lifted budget writers planned to work through the weekend in 
hopes of allowing congress to adjourn for the year by midweek 
lawmakers and staffs met throughout the capitol tackling a task 
whose complexity was symbolized by the legislation itself a 
halffoot stack of paper weighing 13 pounds 
the legislation is the major part of a plan to cut the deficit 
by 500 billion over the next five years including 40 billion 
this year the rest of the savings would come from cuts in the 
defense budget and savings on interest payments on the debt 
house speaker thomas foley said democrats would insist that the 
senate moderate its doubling of the 9centpergallon gasoline tax 
and its steeper increases in outofpocket medicare costs for 
beneficiaries 
he also noted that democrats remain behind the house plans 
higher taxes on the rich that package increases the incometax 
rate the richest people pay from its current 28 percent to 33 
percent and puts a 10 percent surtax on people earning 1 million 
annually 
obviously compromises are required foley dwash told 
reporters after a party caucus the insistence of the president 
in having no income tax changes affecting the rich seems to be 
inexplicable and inflexible 
lawmakers have talked for days about a possible compromise 
boosting the top tax rate to 31 percent 
bush has said he would accept that increase only in return for 
deep cuts in the capital gains tax a trade democrats are unwilling 
to make but republicans would not flatly rule out that higher tax 
rates on the rich would emerge 
i cant support an increase in the tax rates said sen bob 
packwood rore ranking republican on the senate finance 
committee but he added i may get rolled during housesenate 
negotiations 
bush strongly opposes a house provision that would in effect 
cause slight incometax increases on most americans it would delay 
for one year the inflation adjustment made in tax brackets and the 
personal exemption democrats have said that provision is likely to 
be altered or eliminated 
both the house and senate bills would increase taxes on tobacco 
alcohol airline tickets and luxury items such as private planes 
both would enlarge tax credits for lowincome people

the patent on what is billed as the 
worlds most advanced superconductor has been snared for the 
university of arkansas by two researchers 
zhengzhi sheng a physics researcher at the university and 
allen hermann then a professor developed a thaliumbased 
superconductor in 1988 that produced temperatures above 120 degrees 
kelvin or minus 234 degrees farenheit 
the us patent and trademark office granted the school the 
patent last week a university spokesman said it will protect the 
rights to a material that holds the world record as the 
highesttemperature superconductor 
the patent was featured in the oct 15 cover story of 
superconductor week published in washington the article said 
the award gives the university the dominant patent in the 
field 
sheng and hermann have been among leaders in a worldwide race to 
develop superconductors that can operate at temperatures high 
enough to make their use practical 
a superconductors generates electricity without resistance when 
cooled 
scientists say a practical superconductor would significantly 
reduce the energy required to power manufacturing operations 
transportation networks and households 
the inventors and the university will split the first 200000 
of profits the patent generates sheng and hermann will receive 35 
percent of all other proceeds the university will get the rest

throwing the legislature of this small andean nation into crisis 
theyll have to take me out in a coffin said averroes 
bucaram a populist politician elected to head the congress two 
months ago 
the crisis arose after three congressmen who supported bucaram 
switched votes this week to a group backing president rodrigo 
borja that gave borjas coalition a 38to34 seat edge in the 
single house of congress 
borjas coalition voted late thursday to remove bucaram social 
democrat edelberto bonillo was then elected in his place 
but bucaram refused to leave he said in a radio interview 
friday he slept in his office thursday night and still tends to 
congressional business 
bucaram said the noconfidence vote was linked to his attacks on 
borjas cabinet in the two months bucaram has presided over 
congress legislators have censured and forced two borja ministers 
to resign 
this country of 105 million people returned to civilian 
government in 1979 congress has been a political battlefield since 
then coalitions formed by the 16 political parties shift 
constantly and many congressmen have little party or ideological 
loyalty 
congressional officials said friday they replaced heavy crystal 
ashtrays on the floor of congress with smaller ones made of 
aluminum after a congressman was severely cut above the eye by an 
ashtray hurled by an opponent last week

the voted friday to spend more than 41 
billion on dams highways airports and various military and 
university projects as other lawmakers began struggling to reach a 
final accord on reducing the federal deficit 
in a rush to finish its work next week and avoid having to 
return after the november elections house members voted 
overwhelmingly in favor of a transportation spending bill and 
another energy and water spending bill together amounting to 33 
billion 
also passed by voice vote was an 84 billion appropriations 
bill for military construction projects including 33 billion to 
build new housing for families of servicemen and women and nearly 
1 billion as the second installment in closing more than 80 
military bases over the next few years 
the bills were produced by housesenate conference committees 
that reconciled separate versions passed earlier by each chamber 
house members hope their votes on the socalled conference bills 
reflecting compromises with the senate will be the last they have 
to cast however if senators balk later at the deals their 
negotiators struck the house could be required to consider them 
again 
rep robert walker rpa a member of the house science and 
technology committee griped that members of senate and house 
appropriations committees had included some 90 million in projects 
paid for by the energy department for homestate universities 
eight of those 10 projects happen to be in states or districts 
of people who happen to be on the conference committee he 
complained were allocating money not based on anything other 
than whos in the room divvying up the money 
but his motion to eliminate the projects was defeated 308108 as 
the chairman and top republican on the house appropriations 
committees energy and water subcommittee said all the projects are 
justified 
theres nothing unusual about this said the panels 
chairman rep tom bevill dala we need more labs we need more 
scientists we need more emphasis put on these programs 
rep john myers of indiana the top republican on the panel 
said all of the projects had been examined in either house or 
senate hearings before appropriations subcommittees 
among the 10 recipients of the funds are research centers at the 
university of alabama and the university of indiana 
among the projects hurt in the deficitcutting effort was one of 
president bushs favorites the proposed 8 billion super collider 
atom smasher in texas 
bushs request of 318 million to begin actual construction of 
the giant particle accelerator had been approved earlier by both 
the house and senate but it was slashed to 243 billion by their 
negotiators last week 
the housesenate negotiators also dropped provisions from the 
senates transportation money bill that would have required testing 
of a mass transit workers for illegal drug use and prohibited truck 
bus drivers from using radar detectors 
but they retained a measure in the house bill that would require 
states to suspend the drivers licenses of convicted drug offenders 
this is going to send a message to our young people that if 
they want that allimportant symbol of adulthood the drivers 
license theyd better say no to drugs said the measures 
sponsor rep gerald solomon rny

president bush was confronted by a lastminute 
appeal and demonstration by civil rights leaders friday as he 
weighed whether to carry through on his threat to veto the civil 
rights minorityhiring bill 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said there was a 
longshot possibility that a compromise could be reached but he 
also indicated bush might simply veto the bill 
we will staple our new bill to the veto message and send it 
right back up fitzwater suggested 
however another admininistration official said friday that the 
administration was preparing new proposals for congress to consider 
that offers a compromise on the sticky question of whether the bill 
would result in hiring quotas for minorities 
this official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
white house could have a draft ready this weekend to send to 
capitol hill where congress members will be meeting on the federal 
budget 
the civil rights bill had not been sent to the white house from 
congress by the time bush left to spend the weekend at the 
presidential retreat at camp david md 
meanwhile sen james m jeffords rvt one of five 
republicans who met thursday with bush to discuss the bill said he 
remained optimistic that congress could draft followup legislation 
that would satisfy the presidents objections 
i talked to the president again this afternoon jeffords 
said we are optimistic there has been movement on both sides 
he said bush set no deadline 
the measure passed earlier this week would make it easier for 
women and minority workers to bring discrimination suits against 
their employers the white house contends the bill would force 
employers to establish hiring quotas something that sponsors 
dispute 
the bill which is the top legislative goal of national civil 
rights groups would reverse a series of supreme court rulings that 
sponsors of the measure say have weakened antidiscrimination 
protections in the workplace 
fitzwater said the only hope of heading off a veto was 
congressional action on separate legislation that would in effect 
modify the civil rights bill to meet the administrations 
objections 
meanwhile civil rights leaders demonstrated in front of the 
white house and sought a meeting with bush in a lastditch effort 
to persuade him to sign the bill 
we are asking that before he makes a decision to veto it 
that he would meet with the civil rights leadership said 
benjamin hooks executive director of the naacp 
he said that bush had told him in a telephone conversation 
thursday that he was exploring possible ways to avoid a veto 
including passage of followup legislation to soften his objections 
to the main bill 
hooks suggested that civil rights leaders were not willing to 
endorse any compromise that would water down the legislation but 
he said there is room for hope that bush might reverse himself 
and sign the bill 
fitzwater said the president certainly wants a strong civil 
rights bill he is committed to it lets erase this legal question 
and make it a true civil rights bill 
he hinted that democratic sponsors of the civil rights bill that 
passed congress were more interested in playing politics with the 
issue than in ironing out differences with the administration 
theres been nothing to change our belief that its a quota 
bill the only issue is is there any way to get it changed at this 
late date in a way that will be satisfactory fitzwater said 
hooks was among several hundred chanting demonstrators who 
gathered outside the white house 
white house congressional liaison frederick mcclure greeted them 
at the gate then escorted a small delegation onto the grounds 
where he accepted the demonstrators written request for a meeting 
with bush 
demonstrators held aloft a large banner that said mr 
president sign the civil rights bill 
hooks said the demonstrators represented civil rights 
organizations from all over the nation womens groups hispanic 
groups from the jewish community from the black community and 
from the liberal republican groups 
the consequences of a veto is that president bush will not be 
living up to his promise of representing all the people and that 
gentler kinder nation that we were looking for will not come to 
pass hooks said

the university of california at berkeley 
class of 1970 carried signs and burned flags to protest the vietnam 
war saturday theyll return to formally graduate 20 years late 
ive always felt that i was denied some right of passage 
because we didnt have a graduation ceremony ken sherman a 
beverly hills literary agent said friday 
they were afraid we would use it as a forum for protest and 
agitation and im sure we would have 
in may 1970 tensions were high on the campus as students 
stepped up their antiwar protests when president nixon sent troops 
into cambodia 
earlier that month on may 4 four students were killed by 
national guardsmen during a war protest at kent state university in 
ohio 
california gov ronald reagan reacted to the ohio killings by 
ordering the berkeley campus shut down for two days with 
graduation only weeks away students and faculty began to plan 
protests they intended to stage at graduation to protest violence 
against activists 
there was a very tense and unusual atmosphere on the campus at 
that time it was like it was under siege said ray colvig a 
spokesman for the university now and then there was a threat 
that commencement might be boycotted or that there would be a large 
demonstration 
hoping to avert trouble chancellor roger heyns canceled 
commencement exercises at berkeleys memorial stadium where 3300 
students were to graduate instead the schools academic 
departments held their own small ceremonies a tradition that 
continues today 
i didnt know about the small ceremonies we were supposed to 
have so i missed out said sherman who will speak at saturdays 
ceremony i have always felt that i had unfinished business 
taking part in commencement will be a closure of sorts an ending 
of part of my life 
the ceremony was the idea of class of 70 member carol orsborn 
who suggested it to the alumni association last year the 
association organized the event more than 200 people from the 
class are expected to attend 
our generation went to sleep for a while said orsborn who 
once gave up her phi beta kappa key in a protest 
but i dont think idealism is dead but maybe its been 
dormant in a lot of us she said somehow i think that this 
graduation ceremony will give us back some of that feeling 
orsborn has a san francisco public relations company and a 
family her two children will attend commencement with her 
orsborn is author of enough is enough exploding the myth of 
having it all the 1985 book shot down the notion that women with 
careers and families needed to be superwomen working at the top of 
their fields while performing as perfect mother and wife

house and senate negotiators approved a 
compromise bill friday protecting additional acres from timber 
cutting in the massive tongass national forest in alaska 
but the agreement which is expected to be approved by the two 
chambers didnt go as far as environmentalists had wanted 
the tongass stretching across nearly 17 million acres of the 
alaska panhandle is the worlds only remaining temperate zone rain 
forest and home to a rich array of wildlife including grizzly bears 
and bald eagles it also is a major source of timber 
half a rain forest is better than no rain forest at all 
said george frampton jr president of the wilderness society 
adding that he would have preferred a bill much more restrictive to 
timber interests 
with the congress about to adjourn we were forced to take it 
or leave it said frampton 
the legislation declares about 1 million acres offlimits to 
timber harvesting and creates offlimits buffers 100 feet wide 
along rivers and streams important to fishing the house 
legislation would have protected nearly twice as many acres from 
timber cutting 
the legislation made a number of changes in the management of 
the forest and timber sales by the us forest service 
environmental groups for years have criticized practices 
required by 1980 legislation and have argued that in some years 
the forest service netted only 2 cents from timber sales for every 
1 of expenditures 
the bill requires the forest service to prepare only enough 
timber for sale to meet market demand instead of the automatic 
450 million board feet annually specified in existing law it also 
eliminates the automatic appropriation of 40 million for timber 
management requiring that the forest compete with others federal 
forests each year for funds in the normal budget process 
in juneau meanwhile alaska gov steve cowper welcomed the 
agreement calling it a compromise so that alaskas timber 
industry can remain healthy while the environment and other uses of 
the forest can be protected 
he said under the forest management program and modifications in 
timber contracts abuses of the past will be minimized and 
management of the forest will be improved 
southeast alaskans who are directly affected can finally 
breathe a sigh of relief that this issue is behind us after so many 
years said cowper in a statement 
mike francis a forestry expert for the wilderness society said 
that while the changes are welcome they will not necessarily reduce 
the amount of timber cut in the tongass

salvadoran guerrillas have 
begun a diplomatic offensive and increased their military activity 
hoping the mixture will bring progress in stalemated peace talks 
with the government 
the farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln began 
meetings thursday with latin american and european governments the 
night before rebels attacked the base of el salvadors air force 
on the eastern edge of the capital damaging several helicopters 
rebel spokesmen said the actions were intended to bring movement 
in peace talks with the government of president alfredo cristiani 
monthly talks began last spring but have not progressed 
significantly toward ending the decadeold civil war that has 
claimed about 72000 lives 
salvador samayoa a member of the fmlns diplomatic policy 
commission said in germany on thursday that the military activity 
is part of a strategy to push along the negotiations process 
the next round is to begin nov 4 in mexico city 
each side accuses the other of inflexibility and negotiating in 
bad faith 
a key sticking point is a rebel demand that the army be reduced 
and that officers responsible for human rights abuses be purged 
the army has agreed in principle to clean its ranks but says it 
will do it itself without outside participation 
at the un general assembly this month cristiani offered a 
unilateral ceasefire if the fmln would do the same 
the rebels said they would not lay down their arms without 
resolving the causes of the war social injustice and military 
impunity 
the rebel radio venceremos commenting friday on the air force 
attack said the operations of the last hours also are a clear 
signal to the american government and to some congressmen who want 
to referee the conflict using the blackmail of military aid 
the senate voted friday to halve el salvadors expected 85 
million military aid but stipulated the aid would be restored if 
the rebels walk away from the peace talks 
if the salvadoran and us governments really want to end the 
war then we say its up to them at the negotiating table the 
rebels said lets talk about the causes of the war and arrive at 
agreements then we can achieve not only a ceasefire but a 
definitive peace 
the government hopes the fmln will be weakened politically by 
the collapse of patron governments in eastern europe the left 
holds out hope that the end of the cold war will allow 
anticommunist governments to see that el salvadors often brutal 
armed forces are to blame for the countrys woes 
defense minister col rene emilio ponce attributed the increase 
in activity to internal divisions within the fmln which 
incorporates five rebel armies 
within the fmln there are people who agree to solving the 
conflict through dialogue and negotiations but there is another 
group possible the largest that is for a military solution he 
said 
the guerrillas deny they are divided over strategy

im not aware of any evidence that was ever suppressed by the 
government or any evidence that was kept from the defense to which 
they were lawfully entitled blackburn said

martha sunny von bulows children 
say they are outraged by reversal of fortune the movie that 
portrays their mother as a sloppy drunk obsessed with drugs before 
she slipped into a coma 
our mother is unable to respond to an assault on her 
character and reputation ala isham and alexander auersperg said 
in a statement isham and auersperg havent seen the movie but 
read an early copy of the screenplay their spokeswoman maureen 
connelly said friday from new york 
the heiress has been in an irreversible coma in new york since 
1980 her husband claus von bulow was convicted then retried and 
acquitted of twice trying to murder his wife at their newport 
mansion 
the movie starring glenn close as mrs von bulow focuses on 
von bulows successful appeal after the first trial it is based on 
a book of the same name by harvard law professor alan dershowitz 
who masterminded the appeal 
the film portrays mrs von bulow who serves as the narrator as 
a heavy drinker and a drug user who would resort to hiding her 
drugs so those around her couldnt destroy them 
isham and auersperg said their mother was shown as pathetic 
and self destructive 
we reject this injurious and erroneous portrayal and ask the 
public to do the same in the knowledge that our now defenseless 
mother was warm and caring and devoted to her family they said 
isham and auersperg who believed in their stepfathers guilt 
filed a 56 million civil lawsuit against von bulow after his 
acquittal claiming he tried to kill their mother to inherit her 
money 
the lawsuit was settled outofcourt in 1987 with von bulow 
agreeing to divorce his wife and renounce all claims to her vast 
fortune his share of her estate was estimated at 25 million 
the divorce has not been finalized connelly said because von 
bulow has not filed as he agreed he would in 1987 connelly said 
it would require a series of complex legal maneuvers for sunnys 
guardians to dissolve the marriage on her behalf 
von bulow also agreed to give up any rights to book or movie 
deals about the family infighting 
von bulow could not be reached for comment friday at his london 
apartment 
as part of the settlement cosima von bulow the only child the 
couple had together agreed to drop two countersuits she received 
an equal share 35 million of her maternal grandmothers estate 
in return 
jeremy irons plays von bulow in the movie ron silver plays 
dershowitz reversal of fortune opened in new york on wednesday 
and will open elsewhere in november

percent signs of what the official news agency called a 
deepening crisis 
tass reported the statistics friday the same day the national 
legislature approved a plan to move to a more marketoriented 
economy over the next few years

hubert de givenchys summer readytowear show 
friday burst out with lovely and wearable styles this past master 
of couture made the luxury clothes look very expensive which they 
are 
it was a gilded collection featuring gold threads in the first 
knit items right through gilt nailheads all over plus gold lame 
shining through the colorful silk print dinner dresses at the end 
on a new youth kick the man who invented audrey hepburns best 
gamine styles for her films more than 30 years ago gives his 
latest styles modern updates among the youngest a strapless 
cableknit top with a shortie black tulipwrap skirt rimmed in gold 
button details 
his ballooning silky harem pants looked refreshing this week 
everybody else is showing pants that look as though theyd been 
molded on the model 
givenchy showed many wellcut straight trousers with good 
cardigan and cableknit tops or jackets cut long and straight or 
rather full the fine poplins linens and plenty of gold buttons 
should please the rich set of a certain age 
younger fans will like his airy organza dresses and 
offtheshoulder minis in harlequin or bold fruit and flower 
prints 
the serpent theme gliding through a few collections here looks 
gailycolored on bright leather belts narrow skirts sleeve 
details 
karl lagerfeld also aims for younger looks continuing his leggy 
themes with good jackets and loose tops he started last year 
some of the best of this slimleg look topped by flowing jackets 
or cape effects came out in silky jersey fabrics in colors ranging 
from subtle linden green or beige to salmon 
lagerfelds pants are cigaretteslim or simply cotton tights 
the young but not very flattering favorite style is to cut off 
the dark tights at various lengths along the leg showing bootees 
below 
lots of ideas popped up from little apron outfits with shirred 
waists right through to plaid jackets of all lengths and cuts worn 
over the tights with matching plaid small boots 
bright piping on asymmetrical little dresses or sleeveless white 
jackets had a certain young charm along with the buttoned plastron

this designer has a raft of summer ideas ranging from laceup 
safari styles to neonstriped graphics and bodymolding leather 
outfits in hot shades of vermilion bright blue and cyclamen 
his luscious sheer white embroidered blouses with tight sequined 
black pants and gold belts evoked a brassy pirate set to swing at 
the disco 
thierry mugler put on a show worthy of a striptease nightclub 
but not all went smoothly 
danielle mitterrand wife of the french president and culture 
minister jack lang were among those who waited nearly two hours in 
saunatype heat waiting for the show to begin 
before mugler wound up with a nearly nude diana ross with 
chunky glass just decently covering the strategic points and a 
fuchsia tulle cape hed brought out several other imam and other 
famous models clothed in outrageous costumes 
it was mainly lycra and skin plus a few little bunnies in 
bloomerplaysuits and even a chineselantern outfit in acid shades 
of pink and green 
the rare true dress or suit was applauded in one case a 
pleasantly draped white sheath as worn by famed model of the 1970s 
lauren htton 
another audience came back later to see madonna swan down the 
catwalk but most observers agreed mugler should either make 
clothes and show them as such or take up showbiz as his real 
profession

the government trying to defuse a 
hindumoslem dispute that has claimed scores of lives proposed 
friday to allow hindus to build a temple at a sacred site without 
destroying a mosque already there 
but hindu traditionalists rejected the plan which was unveiled 
at the end of a frantic day of meetings and two sessions of prime 
minister vp singhs cabinet 
singhs government is under threat of collapse if no solution to 
the conflict is found by the end of the month 
the dispute concerns a 16th century mosque in the holy town of 
ayodhya hindus say it was built on the foundations of a temple 
over the traditional birthplace of the hindu god rama 
a fundamentalist group the hindu world council has vowed to 
begin rebuilding the temple on oct 30 moslems have said they 
wont let that happen 
officials fear a bloodbath unless a settlement is found riots 
between the two religious communities have claimed thousands of 
lives over the decades and violence over ayodhya left more than 80 
people dead earlier in the month 
the secretary of the hindu group ashok singhal said the 
government plan was unacceptable because it left the mosque in 
place 
the government has said it will not allow the mosque to be 
displaced and has urged all sides to await the decision of the 
courts on dozens of petitions 
police and paramilitary forces have sealed off ayodhya 300 
miles east of new delhi and about 5000 hindu politicians and 
activists have been detained 
information minister parvatheneni upendra said the prime 
ministers plan calls for the government to acquire properties 
around the disputed site land would be made available for the 
construction of a temple while cases pending before a local court 
could be transfered to the supreme court for quick handling 
meanwhile the mosque would stay 
upendra said the bharatiya janata a rightwing hindu party that 
is a key government ally had indicated it might support the prime 
ministers plan but a bharatiya janata leader denied that 
it seems the government is more keen to assuage the sentiments 
and protect the interests of the moslem community with disregard to 
the sentiments of tens of millions of the overwhelming majority 
said party secretary jp mathur 
lal krishna advani head of bharatiya janata has been leading a 
6000mile pilgrimage to rally public opinion for the temple army 
troops were deployed along the route of his caravan 
hindus comprise 82 percent of indias 880 million people while 
moslems make up 12 percent of the population

the president of brazils giant 
state oil company petrobras resigned friday and accused the 
government of keeping oil prices artificially low 
petrobras president luis octavio da motta veiga announced his 
resignation at an afternoon press conference in the companys 
headquarters in rio 
i turned in my resignation because ofthe bad conduct inside 
the government regarding the pricing system for oil products 
motta said 
he said the government was squeezing the company to keep 
fuel prices low and avoid a renewed burst of inflation 
this is a policy followed by this government and past 
governmanets and it has never succeeded motta said the 
government is using petrobras as a smokescreen to cover up for 
economic problems 
domestic fuel prices have been raised five times since the 
persian gulf crisis broke out beginning aug 2 with the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait the government last raised fuel costs by 20 
percent on oct 9 
economists say the jump in oil prices poses a serious threat to 
president fernando collor de mellos mar 15 austerity plan to curb 
fourdigit inflation 
higher oil prices has helped push inflation up from 33 percent 
in april to 96 percent in june 105 percent in august and nearly 
13 percent in september 
motta said petrobras needed at least a 40 percent increase in 
fuel prices to offset an internal deficit of 12 billion 
he said the companys debt was rapidly mounting because 
petrobras was selling oil domestically for the equivalent of 20 a 
barrel and paying 32 a barrel for lowgrade imported oil 
brazil produces an average of 665000 barrels of oil daily and 
imports about 450000 barrels a day 
on monday economy minister cardoso de mello told a senate 
committee in brasilia the capital that petrobras was inefficient 
overpaid its workers and withheld information about its costs in 
order to win internal price increases 
motta was replaced early friday evening by eduardo teixeira the 
no 2 official in the economy ministry and a close friend and aide 
of cardoso de mello according to presidential spokesman pedro luiz 
rodrigues

for the first time the film version of george 
orwells antitotalitarian novel 1984 will be shown in the 
soviet union 
its like breaking down the berlin wall said chicago lawyer 
marvin j rosenblum executive producer of the 1983 movie starring 
john hurt and richard burton who died a few months later 
orwells bleak classic depicting the world of big brother was 
aimed at any totalitarian regime left or right but it was often 
read as an indictment of the soviet system 
until last year the book was banned in the soviet union 
but people have read it under the covers rosenblum said 
ive talked to a lot of russians and theres always been a lot 
of interest in it all the intellectuals are aware of it 
rosenblum bought the rights to make the film from orwells widow 
in 1980 it was shown in a score or more countries but was 
forbidden in what used to be the eastern bloc 
the movie will premiere in moscow in early december or january 
in conjunction with a conference on art and freedom of expression 
rosenblum said thursday his next step is negotiating distribution 
of the film throughout the soviet union 
rosenblum paid an undisclosed sum for rights to distribute the 
film in the soviet union the rights were owned by the british 
company virgin vision whose parent company put up the 8 million 
to film the story 
i took a calculated risk and decided the amount of money i was 
paying for this was worth the milestone just to see the 
headlines 1984 premieres in moscow he said 
id like to make money on this but if all that really happens 
is that a significant number of russians see the film i would not 
be unhappy rosenblum said 
for the moscow showing rosenblum said actors may read the lines 
to the audience during the movie he said he didnt know if 
nationally distributed films would be dubbed or subtitled 
no political problems now exist in negotiating a distribution 
contract in the soviet union rosenblum said in the past only one 
agency had permission to import films 
now just about anybody can do it rosenblum said

an appeals court eliminated former 
dictator efrain rios montt from the nov 11 presidential election 
issuing a final ruling friday that rios montts past activities 
disqualified him 
the court of constitutionality said rios montt was ineligible 
under an article of the constitution that bars anyone who came to 
power in a coup from being elected president 
rios montt a retired general lead a military junta after the 
march 23 1982 coup that overthrew elected president fernando 
romeo lucas garcia 
on june 9 1982 he named himself president in august 1983 he 
was ousted in another military coup 
neither rios montt nor his supporters could be reached for 
comment friday night 
the decision left a field of 12 candidates most of them 
rightists running to replace president vinicio cerezo a christian 
democrat whose term expires jan 14 the constitution prohibits 
cerezo from running for another 5year term 
rios montts bid for the presidency was first refused when he 
tried to register aug 22 and the supreme electoral tribunal 
upheld that decision 
but he was registered provisionally under a temporary injunction 
issued while courts reviewed the case the supreme court later 
ruled him ineligible but the court of constitutionality was the 
final arbiter in the matter 
because the constitution links an entire ticket to its 
presidential candidate the decision also bars rios montts running 
mate harris whitbeck pinol and his threeparty coalitions 
congressional candidates 
rios montt is backed by the national unity front the 
institutional democratic party and the guatemalan republican front 
rios montts law and order image at a time of increasing crime 
and allegations of government corruption had given him a strong 
position in some polls 
while president the bornagain christian general addressed the 
nation in televised sunday sermons and ordered crackdowns on 
corruption 
he also sent more than a dozen people before firing squads for 
alleged involvement with leftist insurgents some were executed 
during a visit by pope john paul ii 
a bloody military campaign against leftist rebels in the 
northwest highlands under rios montts regime killed thousands of 
peasants most of them indians

this is not where a gubernatorial candidate 
should prepare for his first debate with a powerful incumbent gate 
76 lower level port authority bus terminal 
but there stood republican pierre rinfret clutching a 3955 
oneway ticket friday morning 
rinfret a millionaire economist running a cashstarved 
campaign gladhanded fellow passengers and the bus driver before 
boarding a greyhound bound for syracuse and a showdown with gov 
mario cuomo lack of party funds forced him to use mass transit he 
said 
is this a publicity stunt yeah in part but were out of 
money said rinfret three aides accompanied him on his excursion 
north 
so exactly how much money is left in the rinfret warchest 
we got a big check yesterday 1000 now weve got 1100 in 
our account rinfret joked 
rinfret got a lot of mileage out of the stunt even before the 
bus left four local television crews and a pair of radio reporters 
showed up 
his arrival in syracuse several hours later and 30 minutes 
behind schedule was less postitive striking greyhound workers 
greeted him with cries of scab and a sign reading wrong way 
rinfret 
the debate itself to also feature conservative party candidate 
herbert london and righttolife party candidate louis wein didnt 
seem to excite rinfret as much as his first bus ride since 1941 
its not a debate its a charade of a debate i dont 
consider wein or london candidates thats another charade he 
said cuomo is a ghost governor he only shows up where he wants 
to show up under certain conditions 
rinfret wearing a blue suit appeared out of place as he 
awaited the bus among the police passengers and occasional 
homeless person he perked up when another rider recognized him 
mr rinfret the woman said as he walked past 
you recognize me replied an exuberant rinfret 
i saw you on tv she responded 
the gubernatorial hopeful than shook hands with other 
passengers many of whom didnt seem to know who he was yet 
rinfret remained upbeat about his trip and his chances 
i think you might see the best political overturn in this 
century said rinfret we are neck and neck with cuomo in some 
heavy democratic areas 
recent polls indicate rinfret is more neck and neck with london 
than cuomo but he glossed over those numbers 
as with much of rinfrets campaign the greyhound caper didnt 
go off all that smoothly the candidate almost boarded the wrong 
bus the right bus left 13 minutes late 
but all ended well rinfret waved goodbye from a window seat 
after the debate rinfret said he was being flown back to new 
york city by jefferson county republican chairman ronald trickey 
aboard a private plane

an elks lodge faced with losing its liquor 
license because of an ordinance banning discrimination by private 
clubs is asking the allmale groups national leaders to admit 
women 
the annapolis elks lodge 622 voted 483 wednesday night to ask 
the elks national convention to change its bylaws to admit women 
if approved by the national convention next summer the change 
would mean that every elks lodge in the country could admit women 
said george bond exalted ruler of the annapolis lodge the issue 
came up at the national convention of the 2300lodge fraternal 
benevolent society two years ago and was defeated he said 
the new ordinance effective jan 1 will deny liquor licenses 
to private clubs with bylaws that discriminate on the basis of 
race gender or ethnic background 
if the annapolis lodge loses its liquor license it might sue to 
overturn the law or sell its building and move out of town bond 
said 
we like annapolis he said weve been here 90 years we 
need the liquor license to sustain the lodge and our charitable 
works 
another organization the eastport democratic club changed its 
bylaws to admit women after the new ordinance was approved earlier 
this year but later denied membership to three women who applied 
that prompted a city alderman to consider tightening the law 
the two clubs have no black members 
to give the elks lodge time to change its bylaws alderman wayne 
turner has proposed delaying implementation until august 1991 for 
clubs whose bylaws are set by natinnal memberships the councils 
rules committee is considering turners measure 
the ordinance was approved in february on a close vote 54 
some city alderman who supported the measure dont object to 
extending its implementation 
as long as theyre moving forward in good faith i have no 
problems with extending it said alderman ruth gray who voted 
for the ordinance 
alderman carl snowden who sponsored the antidiscrimination 
measure lauded the elks vote but said his support of the 
extension hinges on how seriously the club recruits black men 
i very much would like to see a compromise struck with the 
elks lodge if there is this goodfaith effort i wouldnt have any 
problem whatsoever in voting to amend the law he said 
alderman wayne turner who voted against the ordinance said the 
eastport club is proof the law wont work 
i dont believe anyone on the council believes in 
discrimination he said but its a state issue not a city 
issue anyone who had a problem with the club should have went 
through the state

investigators believe someone 
deliberately set a fire that swept through a san jose state 
university dormitory on friday injuring 21 people 
one student unable to breathe because of the thick smoke that 
filled andrew moulder hall jumped from a thirdfloor window and 
suffered a back fracture but was in stable condition authorities 
said 
other students trapped by the flames that erupted shortly before 
6 am leaned out the windows screaming for help as firefighters 
set up ladders to rescue them fire crews led other students still 
clad in robes and slippers down stairways to safety 
my roommate and i heard this crackling noise and we opened our 
door and smoke just gushed in our faces said anita rich one of 
the 178 residents of the brick building we couldnt see where we 
were running we just ran 
fire officials said they suspect arson is to blame for the blaze 
started on or near a couch on the third floor they would not 
discuss all the reasons for their suspicions but said one was that 
the couch was not in its usual place 
there appears to be a couch that was moved from one part of 
the dormitory to another on the third floor and according to arson 
investigators the couch was involved said campus police chief 
ric abeyta 
the state fire marshal was investigating the fire at the 
staterun university with 31000 students about 40 miles south of 
san francisco 
more than 30 firefighters put out the blaze in less than an hour 
as paramedics took 21 students to three hospitals near the downtown 
campus 
two male students were in critical condition with burns at santa 
clara valley medical center bryan young 20 had burns over 55 
percent of his body and thomas byrd 18 suffered burns over 40 
percent of his body according to a shift supervisor at the 
hospital 
the university moved moulder hall students to vacant rooms at 
nearby dormitories sent counselors to the hospitals and set up a 
hotline for families and friends to check on students 
in the afternoon they allowed moulder hall residents to return 
to their rooms to retrieve their belongings most fled the burning 
building in bathrobes without keys wallets or valuables 
you just get out of there you dont think said junior jana 
garrett who wore a blue robe and fuzzy slippers 
students most still groggy from sleep were further befuddled 
by thick smoke 
it was pretty freaky the hall was completely dark said 
karsten adam who grabbed a gas mask he had hung on his wall as a 
decoration before running down the hallway i was thinking of 
jumping out the window because there was so much smoke out there 
moulder hall was not equipped with sprinklers because it was 
built in 1958 before they were required but the dorms fire alarm 
system worked perfectly university officials said

republican gubernatorial candidate pierre 
rinfret came out firing friday in his first debate against 
democratic gov mario cuomo saying the incumbent deserves a 
double f in economics 
rinfrets comment set the tone of the debate which also 
included conservative candidate herbert london and righttolife 
candidate louis wein 
rinfret a millionaire manhattan economist and former teacher 
said if mario ever came into a class of economics of mine 
id give him a double f his numbers are the phoniest ive ever 
heard 
cuomo seeking a third fouryear term countered if ever i 
came to your economics class i shouldnt be flunked i should be 
committed 
the candidates were questioned by a panel of three reporters 
the debate which had no audience was taped for broadcast by 
stations around the state over the next several days 
rinfret and london repeatedly attacked cuomos handling of the 
state economy noting new yorks credit rating is at its lowest 
ever and residents have just been hit with a record 18 billion 
tax increase 
its not a bad idea for mario to resign before he gets thrown 
out in an election rinfret said 
london said the state had a budget out of control 
wein said if he couldnt be elected he would prefer to see 
cuomo reelected he called cuomo a man of decency and 
intelligence weins praise drew a sharp rebuke from rinfret who 
pointed at cuomo and said this man is the enemy 
cuomo accused the other candidates of using inaccurate 
statistics when they criticized his tenure as governor 
its easy to answer these questions if you just make up 
facts cuomo said 
cuomo has agreed to participate in only two debates the other 
is set for nov 4 two days before the election 
rinfret took a bus to get here from new york city to dramatize 
his campaigns lack of funds but he was to fly back in a private 
plane provided by a gop county leader 
rinfret had asked the syracuse television station hosting 
fridays debate wtvh to pay airplane fare for him and a 
halfdozen aides the station refused 
leading up to fridays debate cuomo has largely ignored his 
rivals and concentrated on public appearances that stress his 
record as governor 
cuomo said thursday that hes never been a fan of debates 
in a debate its a joke or who calls who a name he 
complained

house and senate negotiators reached agreement 
late friday on an intelligence bill that would provide for a 
suspension of covert lethal aid to rebels in angola if the marxist 
government agrees to elections sources said 
the bill agreed to after daylong talks between the two 
intelligence committees also would phase out a covert aid program 
to cambodian rebels and trim roughly 50 million from the 
administrations 300 million request for aid to rebels in 
afghanistan 
the changes reflect dwindling support on capitol hill for proxy 
wars in the third world that were a leading feature of president 
reagans anticommunist crusade with thawing relations between the 
united states and the soviet union and reduction of soviet support 
of client groups much of the rationale for us involvement in 
those conflicts has evaporated 
on angola the committees agreed to provide that military aid to 
the unita rebels about half the total 60 million annual support 
could be suspended if the president certifies that the luanda 
government schedules free elections in which the rebels are free to 
participate 
but members deleted key provisions passed by the house earlier 
this week that would have permitted congress to make the decision 
to suspend military aid if the president did not 
on cambodia the roughly 13 million aid program for 
noncommunist resistance factions fighting the communist phnom penh 
government would be ended early next year and converted to an open 
program of humanitarian aid the sources said 
and aid to the mujaheddin rebels fighting the sovietsupported 
afghan government would be cut by about 50 million said officials 
who spoke only on condition of anonymity the cut was a compromise 
between a senatepassed 100 million cut and the full 300 million 
the house adopted 
the negotiators also left in place a housepassed provision that 
would disburse the afghan rebel aid in two sixmonth installments 
providing a point where aid could be ended at midyear if 
ussoviet talks result in a withdrawal of aid by both 
superpowers 
also included in the compromise bill were changes that arose out 
of the irancontra scandal including a new requirement that 
presidential authorization for covert operations must be in 
writing 
money for various programs covered by the bill is provided in 
various parts some of them secret of the defense appropriations 
bill the sum spent for intelligence activities of all kinds is 
believed to be about 30 billion

biggest supplier of southeast asian marijuana to the united states 
was sentenced friday to 25 years in prison and fined a maximum 
625 million 
brian daniels 44 a new york native who lived in thailand for 
10 years had pleaded guilty to smuggling tons of marijuana into 
the united states from southeast asia between 1984 to 1988

california oregon nevada britis columbia and mexico according 
to court documents among them was a shipment of 72 tons of 
highgrade laotian marijuana seized in june 1988 aboard the 
encounter bay an oilsupply vessel off the washington coast 
marijuana regardless of what anyone feels about it is 
illegal and it makes you money us district judge john

in this country affected by marijuana and for whom the first step 
to drugs is marijuana

million in personal assets none of which has been recovered by the

daniels lawyer j williams beard said most of daniels assets 
were in thai real estate holdings and attempts to turn them over to 
the us government had failed beard said daniels first wife

national to hold property but the thai government has not 
cooperated in securing the assets beard said

paint companies scrambled to alleviate 
consumer fears friday over reports that mercury in interior latex 
paint can be harmful several of the companies said they have not 
used mercury for years 
the environmental protection agency barred manufacturers from 
adding mercury to paint after aug 20 paint made before then can 
still be sold however 
but the furor followed reports this week of a study that found 
relatively high levels of mercury in people whose homes were 
painted inside with latex paint containing mercury 
the study conducted in 1989 was published in thursdays issue 
of the new england journal of medicine concern about mercury in 
paint arose last year after a 4yearold michigan boy suffered 
mercury poisoning when his home was painted he suffered severe 
rashes itching sweating and a personality change 
the epas 24hour hotline for paint information the national 
pesticide telecommunications network at 18008587378 reported a 
record 900 calls thursday 
a trade group for 550 manufacturers including some of the 
nations largest noted that paint used in the study and to which 
the boy was exposed contained nearly three times as much mercury as 
the epa recommended at the time the paint was made by the mercury 
paint co of detroit mich 
it was almost certainly at the high end said marilyn 
ludwig spokeswoman for the national paint amp coatings association 
in washington 
vague directives led to the epa declaring mercury paints 
mercury levels to be an unenforceable action agency spokesman 
al heier said 
a telephone call friday to charles soberman president and owner 
of mercury paint was not immediately returned 
most uses of mercury were banned in the mid1970s except in 
paint manufacturers had convinced the epa they didnt have a good 
alternative to mercury heier said the element is used to preserve 
the paint in the can and prevent mildew after application 
the epa estimates that before the recent ban up to 30 percent 
of interior latex paint contained mercury but the industry 
association believes just 10 percent to 15 percent contained the 
element ms ludwig said 
consumers who own paint bought before the ban should call the 
manufacturer to determine if it contains mercury she said if it 
has more than 200 parts per million she recommended using it only 
outdoors 
health officials do not recommend removing latex paint from 
walls they believe the risk of mercury contamination is highest in 
the first weeks after application the mercury evaporates shortly 
after the paint dries 
several manufacturers also criticized news reports as 
misleading 
sherwinwilliams and benjamin moore two of the nations largest 
paint manufacturers said their products havent contained mercury 
since 1973 and 1969 respectively 
john oberle technical director for montvalebased benjamin 
moore said alternatives to mercury that were less harmful to 
people and the environment were employed in the mid1970s even 
though they werent as effective those alternative compounds have 
since been improved he said

an attorney told jurors friday they can 
send a message to the racists of the world by returning a 
multimilliondollar verdict in a wrongful death lawsuit against a 
white supremacist group and its leaders 
lawyer morris dees said in closing arguments that the evidence 
was overwhelming against white aryan resistance founder tom 
metzger who is representing himself in court as are his 
codefendants 
we want you to come back with a verdict to tell the tom 
metzgers of the world that this is not the way we run this 
country said dees whose clients are seeking 125 million in 
damages 
metzger 52 a television repairman from fallbrook calif is a 
former ku klux klan grand dragon the lawsuit also names war and 
metzgers son john 22 
the suit accuses the metzgers of inciting the november 1988 
beating death of mulugeta seraw 27 an ethiopian who planned to 
attend school in portland seraw was attacked by three racist 
skinheads as he returned home from a party his head was split open 
by a softball bat 
kenneth mieske kyle brewster and steven strasser pleaded guilty 
to killing seraw mieske and brewster also are defendants in the 
lawsuit 
seraws family filed the lawsuit being heard in multnomah county 
circuit court before judge ancer haggerty seraws young son and 
his father who came from ethiopia for the trial sat in the front 
row friday 
tom metzger was scheduled to give a closing statement monday 
after which the case was to go to the jury 
john metzger who heads the aryan youth movement a war spinoff 
told jurors the trial was a conspiracy between the plaintiffs and 
the government 
this whole thing is a joke he said in a brief closing 
statement they want to destroy us because were consistent 
i will continue what im doing because im right and im not 
liable like they say metzger said 
he complained to jurors that much of the testimony he and his 
father wanted to introduce was ruled irrelevant 
a lot of funny things went on in this courtroom that youll 
never know about and its too bad metzger said 
dees aims to bankrupt war he won a 7 million jury verdict 
against the united klans of america in 1987 after two klansmen from 
mobile ala killed a 19yearold black man 
dees built his case against the metzgers around the testimony of 
dave mazzella 21 a former leader in the aryan youth movement 
mazzella said the metzgers sent him to portland to organize 
skinheads here and to teach them how to commit violence against 
minorities

critics say rampant commercialism selfcensorship and shrinking 
domestic audiences have badly damaged the japanese industry and led 
to mediocrity 
but the biggest threat may be the popularity of american movies 
in japan which has prompted japanese investors to put their money 
in hollywood instead of local studios 
the world has looked up to us entertainment since the end of 
world war ii says bill ireton managing director of warner bros 
japan inc to the japanese american movies are hip and trendy 
and japanese audiences would rather be dead than unfashionable 
japan is the largest foreign market for us films american 
movies accounted for 61 percent of all pictures seen here in 1989 
according to ireton 
the two top boxoffice draws last year among japanese movies 
were animated films but even the no 1 japanese film kikis 
delivery service brought in less than half the 44 billion yen 
32 million earned by indiana jones and the last crusade 
akira shimizu a former critic who is generalsecretary of the 
japan film library council says mediocre films are the result of 
japanese studios emphasis on profit 
because quality movies cost more to make he said the old 
masters who want to depict social problems have no opportunity to 
make their films its a question of business 
there is more profit to be made targeting the largest 
ticketbuying audience in japan women aged 1825 with movies long 
on romance fuzzy animals and simplistic plots 
although japans four big movie studios are diversified and can 
rely on profits from other pursuits shimizu believes the money 
available to make quality movies wont increase 
such a golden age of japanese films like the 1950s will never 
happen again he says 
the film industry had its heyday in the 1950s and 60s when a 
young akira kurosawa was making such classics as rashomon and 
seven samurai with japanese backing 
with 113 billion movie tickets sold 1958 was the height of 
japans postwar movie renaissance but 10 years later the 
popularity of television had sent ticket sales slumping to 300 
million 
with the influx of videocassette recorders the domestic movie 
industry has been battered further with only 1435 million tickets 
sold last year 
for japanese movie studios there may soon be no business in 
show business 
instead of boosting their own weak film industry japanese 
investors have more faith in the made in america stamp of 
hollywood japanese investors want popular american programming for 
tv stations cable companies movie theaters and videocassette 
ventures 
last year sonycorp purchased columbia pictures entertainment 
for 5 billion in september matsushita electric industrial co 
confirmed it was conducting negotiations with entertainment giant 
mca which owns universal pictures in what reportedly would be a 
7 billion buyout 
nomura securities electronicsmanufacturer jvc corp and a 
subsidiary of pioneer electronics corp also have invested in joint 
ventures or us companies involved in film production 
an exception to this trend is a movie production and 
distribution company set up earlier this year with 20 million yen 
146000 by suntory ltd which wants to create highgrade 
japanese films 
a few directors such as kohei oguri who won the silver prize at 
the cannes film festival this year are making quality films with 
their own money from commercial projects or funding from a few 
large enlightened corporations such as sony and seibu 
according to japanese film expert donald richie 
and shochiku co ltd one of japans major studios has 
decided to back kurosawas next film rhapsody in august his 
first picture with japanese financing in two decades the movie is 
projected to cost about 10 million considered too costly and 
risky by most japanese studios 
kurosawa has criticized a lack of freedom of speech in japan 
suggesting selfcensorship among filmmakers 
japan is supposed to be a place where there is freedom of 
speech but if you try to deal with certain problems you will not 
get the money he says 
filmmaker noriko sekiguchi got most of the funding for senso 
daughters a new documentary about terror and starvation in 
japaneseoccupied papua new guinea during world war ii from the 
australian government 
when the film was shown in france fiji and australia 
japanese diplomats told me it was interesting but that it should 
only be shown in japan to the japanese they told me i shouldnt 
show the dirty side of japan to others sekiguchi said 
its very difficult to really be open and speak your mind in 
japan we have lots of movie technology but the ideas and 
philosophies behind good films are lacking

after 20 years japan is rediscovering a 
native son awardwinning film director akira kurosawa 
as he talks on the set of his next film rhapsody in august 
it is hard to imagine that this smiling softspoken man once 
slashed his wrists in despair over the boxoffice failure in japan 
of one of his movies 
i realize that japanese audiences compared to american 
audiences do not accept the kind of movies i am making but it is 
not because i am purposely making films for an american audience 
it is because of the level of the audience in japan kurosawa 
said 
kurosawa was accepted by japanese studios and audiences from his 
first film in 1941 until 1970 but since then he has been traveling 
the world seeking funding for his film projects despite winning 
countless international awards including two academy awards 
i think when i talk about the low level of japanese audiences 
what i really mean is that it is japanese movie studios that head 
the list of those incapable of appreciating good cinema he said 
in an interview 
his oscarwinning dersu uzala was funded and shot in the 
soviet union ran was made with french money and last years 
dreams was backed by friend steven spielberg 
then came kurosawas honorary academy award last march in 
hollywood where he was lauded on stage by directors george lucas 
and spielberg for lifetime achievement 
soon afterward money flowed from an investment group headed by 
shochiku co ltd one of japans major studios for his 29th 
movie rhapsody in august is about the effect on one family of 
the us atom bomb attack on nagasaki 
so at age 80 kurosawa has leaped into his next project instead 
of spending his usual 5year interlude combing the globe for 
financing 
the academy award showed very clearly how much the world 
respects kurosawa said toru okuyama cochairman and chief 
executive officer of shochiku 
as a japanese filmmaker i was bothered by the fact that he 
has had to make his films with foreign capital said okuyama the 
producer of rhapsody in august 
although a cooling rainstorm rages outside the traditional 
farmhouse kurosawa has built for his set in rural chichibu inside 
under hot lights kurosawas neon orange tshirt is stained with 
sweat perspiration runs down his face 
wearing a greek fishermans cap and dark glasses he wont say 
much about rhapsody in august he prefers that people see and 
experience it themselves but what most appealed to him about the 
novel on which he based his screenplay was a heartwarming exchange 
between an old woman and her four grandchildren 
kurosawa has added a japaneseamerican character who comes to 
japan to meet his relatives the part is played by richard gere 
although he tackled nuclear war in the 1955 i live in fear 
and in one of the vignettes in dreams kurosawa says he wanted 
to talk about the atom bomb again on a human level 
there are so many ways in which we should be closer to 
americans and the issue of the atom bomb and nuclear war is one of 
them after all we are all human beings he said

you wouldnt consider the discovery channel or 
the arts amp entertainment network havens for shows about things that 
go boom 
two of the nations biggest cable networks theyre places for 
the performing arts documentaries science nature and all that 
good stuff yes 
yes but guess what theyre also a military buffs paradise 
offering shows that draw a large mostly male audience series that 
one discovery official says have been locomotives for his 
networks schedule 
the video winds of war come in three categories 
grand old tv series about world war ii like crusade in 
europe or nbcs classic victory at sea the latter with its 
memorable score by richard rodgers was shown on aampe in 1988 and 
will return next year 
a rodgers score also is on winston churchill the valiant 
years a 26part abc series of the early 60s in which richard 
burton was the voice of britains wartime leader it started its 
second aampe run this month 
vietnam specifically vietnam the ten thousand day war 
now on its second discovery run and aampes the vietnam war with 
walter cronkite which starts repeats nov 14 as part of the 
networks our century series 
the cronkite series featuring cbs vietnam reports and footage 
was made in 1985 for the cbsfox video programs sold in stores and 
by mail 
military things in general typified by three series now on 
discovery wings largely about military aircraft 
firepower about weaponry new and old and carriers about 
the history of aircraft carriers 
the last two are spinoffs of wings begun last year next 
fall choppers a 13part history of helicopters will join the 
ranks says chuck gingold discoverys senior vice president for 
programs 
why so much history particularly military history on cable 
cost says former nbc news president reuven frank whose own 
historical work will appear on cable nov 2 when aampe shows the 
tunnel his emmywinning 1962 nbc documentary about an escape 
route dug beneath the thennew berlin wall 
its cheaper to run an old one than make a new one frank 
says secondly nobody in the united states is doing that kind of 
stuff anymore 
despite their supply of military history shows neither 
discovery nor aampe would qualify as the armageddon network 
the war fare is only a portion of their daily offerings which 
range from pasquales kitchen express on discovery to aampes 
cablecast next month of a video version of silas marner 
but they do very well for us says brooke johnson aampes 
programs vice president for a while they were inevitably among 
our highestrated programs theyre still unquestionably very 
successful programs for us 
theyve been locomotives for the schedule says gingold 
whose service is seen in 521 million homes theyve helped a 
lot the ratings are excellent 
and theres an odd thing he notes about the audience for 
wings a discoveryrepackaged series of documentaries from 
various sources 
the viewers arent just a bunch of old and middleaged fuds who 
still can remember when fighter planes and even airliners had 
propellers 
were getting the young male demographics gingold says 
its one of our youngestskewing shows 
theres no question that there is a core group out there that 
loves this stuff and will find it wherever it is says aampes 
johnson whose network is seen in more than 475 million homes 
military programs in fact were very helpful in getting aampe 
known to viewers in its early years she says because the 
historical stuff tends to appeal more to men who tend to be 
channel switchers 
will the shows popularity diminish in time 
i dont think so says johnson they have been very 
popular for a number of years i just dont see why they 
wouldnt continue to be popular through the millenium thats our 
hope anyway 
that may happen but frank although speaking partly in jest is 
dour about the effect on future viewers 
networks no longer make historical series he says and all 
youre going to get is recycled stuff so in the year 2511 the 
only history the kids will get is world war ii itll end there 
 
elsewhere in television 
rock and jazz meet in london and la cables showtime network 
tonight premieres a onehour rockandjazz special a twocity jam 
session hosted by jazzman herbie hancock who doubles as a player 
the specials london segment features the likes of pete townshend 
and bob geldof while the la crew features van morrison backed 
by a band that includes jazz trumpeter freddie hubbard the show is 
the brainchild of producerdirector ken ehrlich whose 
soundstage a popandjazz pbs series in the 70s was one of 
the best in the tricky art of televising music performances

js oberai still has his architectural 
engineering job and hes just bought a house in the suburbs but 
hes worried about the local economy so hes selling his porsche 
at least hes trying to 
ive had this car on the market for four months now said 
oberai whos asking nearly 11000 for his 1984 model its 
becoming rather difficult to sell right now it seems people are 
holding onto their money 
in the regions that are slipping toward recession worrying 
about selling a luxury car seems more whimsical than serious but 
in the washington area one of the wealthiest in america it is a 
sign of economic softness 
the capital region has long been regarded as recessionproof 
largely because the biggest employer the federal government isnt 
subject to the ups and downs that beset private companies unlike 
auto workers the areas 350000 federal workers dont have to 
worry about getting laid off in bad economic times 
but the federal governments role in local employment is 
shrinking less than 10 years ago almost 26 percent of area 
workers collected a federal paycheck today fewer than one in five 
do 
the makeup began to change during the economically robust 1980s 
when a number of private companies moved into the area or expanded 
their operations here capitalize on a glut in government contracts 
washington is not as recessionproof as it used to be because 
the mix of jobs has changed quite a bit said paul getman an 
analyst at regional financial associates a chester pa firm that 
monitors economic trends in different areas of the country 
it used to be only a government town but now youve had a 
boom in the construction service and retail industries all of 
which are suceptible to a downturn 
theres plenty of evidence of problems 
several prominent local developers declared bankruptcy over 
the summer and others are on the edge of insolvency 
garfinkels a venerable department store chain went bellyup 
over the summer ditto a chain of drug stores and the national bank 
of washington the citys secondlargest 
law firms are out recruiting bankruptcy specialists to fill 
sudden gaps in their firms talent roster 
housing sales in the region fell 14 percent earlier this year 
from the comparable period in 1989 condominium sales slumped 24 
percent 
the economy clearly has slowed down and the question of where 
it bottoms out is what we dont know said william harris 
presidentelect of the greater washington board of trade the 
regions largest business group 
to put things in perspective the area still has the nations 
highest median household income 38500 and while the national 
unemployment rate climbed last month to 54 percent the jobless 
rate here has been stuck for several months at 32 percent 
in the 1980s development in the area took off at a breathtakng 
pace fueled by retailers and builders seeking to take advantage of 
the steady influx of new residents 
but growth eventually outstripped demand and the first signs of 
trouble came early last year when developers revealed they couldnt 
fill their sparkling new office buildings 
weve got an overbuilt office space market and that filters 
down to residential housing and retailers too harris said 
what youre looking at is three or four years of glut that 
translates into about 45 million square feet of vacant office 
space 
retail sales also have slowed and job growth is off local 
governments are feeling the pinch and budget squeezes mean fewer 
new jobs 
while federal spending in the area has slowed since the 1987 
the last year of a sevenyear 170percent spending boom the 
concentration of hightechnology research and development 
companies located around washington may cushion the region from the 
effects of a further economic downturn 
youre going to get the same kind of recession in washington 
that we are expecting elsewhere in the country but it will come a 
little later and be a little milder getman said thats due to 
the government buffer

primetime television has discovered another 
personality to this steamy city with a seedy side 
its no longer the pastels art deco and flamingos that miami 
vice portrayed in an innovative way its la causa cuban 
coffee and a multicultural city that cbss new version of 
wiseguy hopes to bring to audiences on nov 17 
its the flip side of miami say the shows promoters 
theres more of miami to be seen they miami vice showed a 
large part of it and beautifully i miht add said wiseguy 
producer alex beaton but that isnt all there is to miami we 
are showing another side of miami because we have a great emphasis 
on the cuban community which is pretty important 
many of the shows stars are cubanamericans and an entire 
episode was cast with miami talent also the show is negotiating 
with cbs to simulcast in spanish which would be a first for 
primetime network television beaton said 
six episodes were shot in miami and the production will shoot 
seven more episodes in vancouver british columbia home for the 
shows producer stephen cannell productions 
the new episodes have some sharp differences with the original 
toprated show producers say 
im not sure wiseguy is an applicable name anymore 
wiseguy is a mafia term beaton said were not dealing with 
the mafia here we dont intend to its a new direction a new 
look 
the mafia motif is gutted for a cocaine cartel and freecuba 
theme instead of ken wahl the shows star is steve bauer who was 
born in cuba but raised in miami 
it feels great to come home this way i couldnt imagine a 
more ideal situation really because of my family and growing up 
here said bauer whose family still lives in miami they asked 
me to do the show and then they wrote the role as a 
cubanamerican it was tailormade 
bauer will play michael santana an assistant us attorney 
fired from his job and disbarred santana also has a fondness for 
rum and lives on his houseboat on the miami river 
ken wahl is not returning to the series his old character 
vinnie terranova will make several calls to santana prior to 
terranovas disappearance mcpike jonathan banks the nononsense 
point man will return 
the story will unfold with santana infiltrating an air cargo 
company owned by a good friend of his father rafael santana 
played by manolo villaverde the younger santana then discovers 
irregularities in the company and the drug smuggling scenario 
begins to unfold 
bauer said his character believes in honor justice and family 
but hes been knocked down in life 
hes a student in life but hes got his principles and hes 
out there trying to do good bauer said in a recent interview 
la causa or the cause to free cuba from fidel castros 
grip will be a secondary story line with the elder santana being a 
bay of pigs veteran who takes potshots at the cuban leader 
im going to get a piece of castro villaverde said its 
like a little revenge 
even though its fiction there are some streaks of reality in 
the show 
for example bauers real father esteban echevarria 59 is a 
pilot who flew 14 missions for the cia in 1961 including three 
during the failed bay of pigs assault the plight of the haitians 
will be mentioned during an episode in which a boat filled with 
citizens of the impoverished nation washes ashore at key biscayne 
both the writers and actors are painstakingly trying to erase 
any stereotypes 
of course we are dealing with the problems but theres a 
different way of showing the problems and solving the problems 
said villaverde who graduated from the university of havana in 
cuba if the writer knows what to project to the audience than 
we are all right some of the writers are doing excellent 
the quest to eradicate stereotypes has even reached emmyaward 
winning villaverdes underwear 
i dont think they wear those 100 percent nylon underwear 
said villaverde referring to a directors instruction that he wear 
nylon undershirts i only wear cotton so i said no not for 
me id rather change into cotton

as far as john lee hooker is concerned the 
blues wasnt born in the mississippi delta he dates blues back 
farther than that to the garden of eden 
when the world was born the blues was born he says simply 
there wasnt no problem til god put man and woman together then 
started love and heartache it turned into blues 
the 73yearold singer guitarist and songwriter had a hit with 
his first record boogie chillen in 1948 since then hes 
been up and hes been down opened for the rolling stones on one 
tour paid a lot of dues his latest record the healer has 
brought him more attention than any record hes ever had 
he was recently honored at a concert in madison square garden 
and talked about the tribute a few days before 
im glad to be here and alive he said im just proud and 
im overjoyed that the people are doing this for me its a long 
time coming but it got here 
i paid so many dues ive laid the path for so many other 
musicians to follow my footsteps im proud of that 
the concert part of a 10day benson amp hedges blues festival 
was a benefit for the 12yearold delta blues museum in hookers 
birthplace clarksdale miss 
a duet by hooker and bonnie raitt im in the mood won a 
grammy award this year a single now is out baby lee by 
hooker and robert cray raitt and cray are on hookers the 
healer so are carlos santana charlie musselwhite los lobos 
canned heat and george thorogood 
they wanted to do it because of the respect they had for me 
hooker says they didnt need the money its brought more 
attention to me than any album ever 
hooker estimates that he has made between 65 and 70 albums and 
wrote or cowrote all the songs on the healer 
about the title 
the blues is a healer its got a meaning to it you do things 
in your lifetime at the time you did it you really wanted to do 
it in the end sometimes you see it wasnt good for you and you 
say it served me right to suffer people hear that and say oh 
thats a true lyric and feel better 
i write songs people can relate to young or old 
he recites his think twice before you go a blues about 
getting mad storming out then wanting to come back but its too 
late 
people think you got to be poor and half starving to sing the 
blues rich people can sing the blues i aint poor and broke i 
sit and sing the blues im a human being i like women ive been 
brokenhearted 
you can have a room full of money if youre sad and lonely 
that money is no good you spend and spend and spend and it dont 
take away the loneliness you love a woman and you go out there and 
you party and drink and come back home by yourself youre lonely 
with a hangover the woman is still gone you got the blues 
i know it because i experienced it myself 
appreciation of blues music never dies hooker says it may 
reach a certain level then it stops it is in a big rise now rock 
n roll boomed way up and boomed down 
hookers stepfather taught him the guitar style he still uses 
nobody else plays this style he says adding that some try 
i dont use a lot of fancy chords just a solid driving 
moving soulful beat you hear the sound it gets right to you 
i never change i keep the musicians around me doing something 
different you got to move with the times but what they do fits 
into what im doing 
hooker lives in vallejo calif and tours two to four months a 
year 
i love to go in small nightclubs dirt on the floor or 
peanuts people drinking at the bar not dressed up theyre 
shocked thinking i shouldnt be in the funky little place with 
them theyre the ones put me where i am rich men dont buy 
records they aint got the time poor people is the ones that 
support you they work buy your records come out and see you when 
you got a concert 
he has had ideas for songs while performing you dont say it 
right then later on you think about it 
you dream some of your best songs if you dont put it down on 
tape it is gone from you he can reach the button that starts 
his tape rolling without getting out of bed 
if i never made another album people wont forget me 
hooker says long after im gone ill still be here my songs 
my blues in the minds of people

the nations second largest banking empire and 
the third biggest computer company a major insurance conglomerate 
and an airline with routes in 36 states 
so goes the honor roll of publicly held businesses that have 
slashed or eliminated dividends in the past few weeks amid 
deepening recession fears on wall street 
chase manhattan unisys travelers corp and usair group are by 
no means isolated cases through the first nine months of 1990 
corporations announced 278 dividend omissions or reductions 
according to standard amp poors corp 
it is shaping up as the biggest crop of adverse dividend actions 
since 1982 sampp says on the other side of the coin dividend 
increases are setting their slowest pace since 1971 
these statistics will likely get worse before they get better 
especially if a fullfledged recession develops says richard 
evans research director at dow theory forecasts an investment 
advisory firm in hammond ind 
all this has had a manifest impact in the stock market which 
has lately traded at its lowest levels since the spring of 1989 
dividend cuts and suspensions are distinctly unpopular in the world 
of bigtime money management 
but unsettling as these developments may be some analysts say 
investors should not necessarily take them as cause for despair 
about the future course of stock prices 
in fact maintains mark stumpp at the investment firm of pdi 
strategies it may even be a sign that stocks are due to take a 
turn for the better in the notsoremote future 
to reach that conclusion stumpp examined how stock prices 
performed since 1960 after years of varying degrees of dividend 
growth 
the peak dividend years averaging payout growth of 13 percent 
were followed in the ensuing sixmonth periods by returns on the 
standard amp poors 500stock composite index averaging a paltry 18 
percent 
within the threedecade sample stumpp found as the 
dividendgrowth rates diminished the stock markets performance 
over the following six months steadily improved 
at the other extreme after years in which dividends eked out a 
meager 03 percent increase stocks chalked up an average gain of 
101 percent 
abandoning stocks because dividend growth is low has a certain 
intuitive appeal but its a poor investment strategy stumpp 
concluded 
analysts say the reasons for this seeming anomaly arent hard to 
discern for one thing they say corporate directors tend to 
resist making dividend changes either up or down until the 
underlying forces that mandate them are clearly established 
if they act hastily they risk hurting their credibility and 
their companies image of stability among investors and the other 
constituencies including employees and customers with which they 
must deal 
so by the time a dividend is either raised or lowered the 
circumstances warranting the action tend to be well known among 
stock traders 
at any given time furthermore those traders are usually 
preoccupied not with the present but with trying to see as far 
into the future as they can always bearing in mind the business 
cycle 
periods of high dividend growth tend to be followed by periods 
of slower growth said stumpp the investment implication is 
that skyrocketing dividends signal that its time to worry because 
growth is likely to slow in the future 
our interpretation last year was the time to have been 
worried about dividends

dont worry about whether a recession has begun 
in the us economy get busy figuring out how where and when its 
going to end 
thats the watchword right now among traders seeking an edge on 
rivals in the perennial guessthefuture competition that goes on 
in the stock market 
with the drop of better than 20 percent that took place in stock 
prices from midsummer through early this month these investors 
reckon that a business slump is a foregone conclusion 
whether it eventually qualifies as a recession defined as two 
consecutives quarters of declines in the inflationadjusted gross 
national product is for them at least a question of academic 
interest 
but the prospective starting point and timing of an economic 
recovery is another matter since they stand to help determine when 
stocks might bottom out 
the economy is facing a mild recession not a collapse 
asserts erich heinemann chief economist at ladenburg thalmann amp 
co 
now is the time for portfolio managers to plan for economic 
recovery next year if our forecast of lower inflation in 1991 is 
correct then the bond market is poised for a major rally 
that could create a tide that will lift all of wall streets 
boats remember the name of the game is to buy low and sell 
high 
or as rao chalasani analyst at prescott ball amp turben inc 
puts it we believe the deceleration in downward momentum of the 
stock market is visible we expect the economy to be on its way up 
starting in the second quarter of next year 
the big hazard now confronting the markets many observers 
believe is the chance that recovery might begin from a much lower 
and later starting point than is now generally foreseen 
though our numbers say mild recession we remain wary said 
maureen allyn chief economist at the money management firm of 
scudder stevens amp clark 
too much leverage has strained the financial system the debt 
overhang is outside the range of past experience so history is no 
guide to the troubles it might cause 
weve little doubt that the dynamics of dealing with debt will 
be intimately connected with what happens next in the economy 
visions of recovery stirred in the stock market during the past 
week helping the dow jones average of 30 industrials to mount a 
12277point rally to 252079 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 598 to 
17040 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 981 to 33737 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was off 26 at 29371 
volume on the big board averaged 18028 million shares a day up 
from 15619 million the week before 
what worries some analysts more than the recent woes of stocks 
and bonds is the ailing market for real estate 
falling real estate prices are driving bank balance sheets 
into preilous territory around the globe says robert barbera at 
shearson lehman brothers inc 
but before too much more time has passed barbera argues 
problems in real estate and banking are likely to prompt a shift in 
the credit policy of the federal reserve toward easier credit 
major declines for us short term interest rates will 
follow he argues and this fall will halt and then reverse the 
slide for asset prices 
his conclusion recession yes depression no

japanese companies are promising a new generation 
of laptop computers made smaller and lighter by new powersaving 
circuits and plugin memory cards that replace floppy disks 
even though laptop computers were called portable in the past 
they really were a burden for people who had to carry them around 
all day said isao hirano a spokesman for fujitsu ltd japans 
largest computer maker weve changed that now 
fujitsu on thursday introduced a thin new laptopsize personal 
computer the fm rcard which uses a fullsize keyboard but weighs 
only 22 pounds less than half the weight of many other laptops 
it uses powersaving technology developed by poqet computer a 
us company that sells a miniature 11pound computer in the 
united states fujitsu owns 58 percent of poqet and manufactures 
its computer which is about half the size of a normal laptop 
such technology which cuts electricity to circuits that are not 
being used is important for portable computers because it extends 
battery life and allows the use of smaller lighter batteries 
instead of the heavy battery packs used by most portable 
computers which must be recharged every few hours fujitsus fm 
rcard runs for eight hours on two regular alkaline penlight 
batteries 
the fm rcard going on sale in japan in january for 238000 
yen or about 1900 uses a unique fujitsu computing standard and 
is not directly compatible with computers made by international 
business machines corp officials said they dont plan to market 
the laptop overseas but wouldnt be surprised if poqet introduces 
a similar model that is ibmcompatible 
earlier this week japans nec corp announced a diarysize 
computer the pc98 ha which weighs 24 pounds because of its 
small keyboard nec officials said they expect it will be used 
mostly for data retrieval scheduling and light wordprocessing 
the nec model which also is not ibmcompatible goes on sale in 
japan next week at 198000 yen or about 1585 no plans have been 
made for overseas marketing officials said 
like the fujitsu the nec model uses plugin memory cards 
instead of floppy disks 
the cards which look like thick credit cards contain an array 
of memory chips and can be used to store both programs and data 
like floppy disks but they are smaller use much less electricity 
and are 100 times faster said yoshihiro satoh general manager of 
fujitsus personal computer systems engineering division in 
addition computers using them dont need a floppy disc drive 
saving weight 
the cards are expected to begin appearing on many other portable 
computers following an agreement last spring between us and 
japanese industry groups that established uniform standards for 
them 
spreadsheet and wordprocessing programs already are available 
on memory cards and japanese software makers plan to produce 
magazinelike cards containing lifestyle data such as 
restaurant listings and tourist guides 
but one obstacle will be price with program cards costing a 
minimum of about 10000 yen or 80 dollars to produce fujitsu 
officials said by contrast floppy disks cost less than a dollar 
to make 
it will take a while but memory cards will catch on said 
katsushi shiga an analyst for dataquest japan the japanese branch 
of a us computer industry research company experienced 
computer users will be slower to adapt because they tend to feel 
uneasy without floppy disks but new users are quickly accepting 
them 
also this week intel corp of the united states announced in 
japan a new powerful microprocessor the 386 sl that will allow 
laptop makers to increase performance while curbing electrical 
consumption like the fujitsu laptop it monitors the computers 
circuits and shuts off those not being used

donald trump has unveiled a new debt 
restructuring proposal for bondholders of his taj mahal casino 
and warned them that if they turn the plan down everyone could end 
up in bankruptcy court 
but if the developer meant to frighten bondholders thursday with 
the specter of a chapter 11 filing it didnt work a 
representative of the investors said bankruptcy court would be 
preferable to trumps plan 
the restructuring proposed by two trump subsidiaries trump taj 
mahal funding inc and trump taj mahal associated lp would give 
bondholders a nearly 20 percent equity stake in the atlantic city 
casino in return for changes in the terms of its 675 million in 
junk bonds 
the plan outlined in a filing with the securities and exchange 
commission calls for the interest rate on the bonds to be lowered 
to 9 percent from their current 14 percent and for a nov 15 
interest payment on the casinos 675 million in junk bonds to be 
met by issuing additional bonds 
some future interest payments would also be made with new bonds 
and the maturities of some issues would be extended under the plan 
in the filing trump said the restructuring proposals are 
the only alternative to bankruptcy 
the company and partnership believe that the terms of the 
amendments to the bond terms are more favorable than the 
treatment bondholders would receive in bankruptcy court trump said 
in the filing 
but wilbur ross a bondholder representative wasnt impressed 
by trumps statement ross said taj mahal investors would get a 
better deal through a chapter 11 filing than the 199 percent stake 
being offered by trump 
it doesnt make any sense for us to make hundreds of millions 
of dollars in economic concessions they want and let 80 percent go 
to the trump organization said ross who represents 10 
institutions that hold about onethird of the taj mahal bonds 
ross noted in a telephone interview that the investors hold the 
first mortgage on the casino which would place them at the front 
of the line of creditors in a bankruptcy court reorganization 
ross who is senior managing director of rothschild inc 
declined to discuss how large an equity stake the bondholders were 
seeking from trump and indicated that negotiations would continue 
stephen bollenbach chief financial officer for the trump 
organization did not return a reporters phone call seeking 
comment on ross statement 
both sides have already rejected restructuring proposals put 
forth by one another 
in the sec filing trump said bankruptcy court would have a 
negative impact on the taj mahals image the glitzy casino opened 
earlier this year amid much publicity and fanfare but like other 
atlantic city casinos it has been struggling in an uncertain 
economy 
trump has been forced to negotiate with bondholders because his 
three casinos which also include trump castle and trump plaza 
have been unable to generate enough cash to pay all their bills 
the wall street journal reported last week that trump also has 
been forced to restructure 100 million in bank loans to trump 
castle and the taj mahal 
and earlier this year the developer negotiated a 65 million 
bank bailout that was supposed to give him breathing room to repay 
his loans which together are believed to total more than 3 
billion

ual corp having removed its largest shareholder 
as a hostile takeover threat now faces another challenge possibly 
bitter negotiations with its three major unions 
the employees failed sevenmonth effort to buy the parent of 
united airlines has left behind resentment toward managers who 
rejected to lastminute buyout proposals that lacked firm financing 
commitments 
to make matters worse for employees theyve apparently lost a 
key supporter 
consiton partners uals largest shareholder thursday agreed 
not to take part in any attempt to take over ual for the next 2 
years in exchange the investment firm got two seats on the ual 
board 
coniston once an ally is now part of the establishment 
stephen dexter of kemper financial services inc said referring to 
conistons support for the employees buyout attempt 
coniston which owns 118 percent of ual common stock had 
threatened to oust ual directors unless a unionled buyout was 
approved the 44 billion buyout bid failed last week when the 
unions were not able to raise financing 
in november 1989 coniston bought 25 million shares of ual 
stock for an average disclosed price of 161 a share faced with 
paper losses of 100 million coniston this spring was threatening 
a proxy fight with the ual board 
chicagobased ual also agreed thursday to repurchases of up to 2 
million shares of its stock to improve shareholder value 
ual stock which peaked at 296 last year closed thursday on 
the new york stock exchange at 9475 up 5 
earlier thursday the three major unions at united airlines said 
they would band closer together so they can fight any company 
attempts to gain concessions 
more than 80 leaders of unions representing pilots flight 
attendants and mechanics met wednesday in chicago 
it was generally determined that in light of ual chairman 
stephen wolfs record of aggressive concessionary bargaining 
tactics labor at united must continue to mature their 
alliance the union statement said 
ual spokesman joe hopkins said the company had no comment on the 
union statement 
some observers say the company needs concessions from the unions 
to meet its expansion goals unions say they are looking for major 
improvements in wages and benefits and some think the potential 
exists for a major national labor dispute 
all of uniteds 47300 union employees comprising about 
twothirds of uals labor force are working under extended 
contracts 
no dates have been set for talks but theyre not expected to 
begin before november

after more than a month in jail charles h 
keating jr won a bail reduction and headed home to prepare his 
defense against the first criminal charges in one of the nations 
biggest savings and loan failures 
us district judge john g davies ruled thursday that the 5 
million bail set by a state judge for the 66yearold former thrift 
operator was excessively high in the investment fraud case 
davies lowered bail to 300000 and keatings family posted it 
by pledging their houses as security keating was released thursday 
night smiling as he walked out of jail 
davies had heard an impassioned plea by los angeles lawyer john 
jack quinn who has defended keating against a slew of civil 
charges stemming from the collapse of lincoln savings and loan 
association 
reimbursing the thrifts federally insured deposits could cost 
taxpayers as much as 2 billion it would be the nations costliest 
thrift bailout 
quinn said keating had wrongly become the most vilified man 
since richard nixon but would never skip bail after his family 
put up their homes as security 
ill tell you what would have an impact on charlie keating 
the thought of his children and grandchildren losing the places 
they live quinn said 
keating was not in court several family members were 
the savings and loan chief with powerful political connections 
came to symbolize the excesses of the thrift industry with his 
investments in risky real estate ventures and junk bonds 
he controlled the irvinebased lincoln savings through his 
american continental corp in phoenix ariz drawing huge salaries 
and maintaining a lavish personal lifestyle 
he contends he is being victimized by authorities who failed to 
prevent the nations sampl debacle and now seek to make him a 
scapegoat 
shirley lampel a bondholder who claims she was cheated by 
keating said he belongs in prison i hope hell be back there 
soon hes a con man 
his lawyers say he is broke they said that while jailed he 
could never defend himself adequately against the many cases 
stemming from lincolns collapse and american continentals filing 
for bankruptcy protection 
superior court judge gary klausner refused to lower keatings 
bail last month he noted that the 42count indictment against 
keating carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison giving 
keating ample reason to flee prosecution 
davies disagreed ruling klausner arbitrarily set keatings bail 
as much as 50 times higher than that of his three codefendants 
those three former top officials of keatings companies face 
identical charges and already have posted bail 
the bottom line is there was a violation of mr keatings 
eighth amendment rights against excessive bail davies said 
the judge ordered keating to surrender his passport restrict 
travel to the lower 48 states report to los angeles county 
authorities by phone every week and give them a detailed itinerary 
of any planned trips 
keating attorney jeffrey powell said keating would return to 
paradise valley ariz to prepare his defense against charges that 
he defrauded investors who bought nowworthless american 
continental junk bonds at lincoln branches powell said 
im extremely pleased powell said but i think its 
unfortunate it took us 33 days to get to this point 
deputy district attorney paul turley said prosecutors would not 
appeal the bail reduction 
the criminal case is separate from charges in civil suits that 
contend keating looted lincoln 
the bail decision came as the senate ethics committee 
investigated whether five senators who received campaign 
contributions from keating improperly intervened with banking 
regulators on his behalf 
the committee adjourned thursday without announcing a decision 
on whether to intensify its investigation of three senators alan 
cranston dcalif dennis deconcini dariz and donald w riegle 
jr dmich

squeezed by the un embargo that 
apparently cut off refinery materials the government today 
announced it will ration gasoline beginning next week 
it also ordered all foreigners hiding in occupied kuwait to 
report to authorities or face unspecified punishment 
the oil ministry ordered car owners to go to special centers set 
up by the ministry to obtiin ration coupons the order was carried 
today by all iraqi government newspapers 
the order did not say how much gasoline would be alloted under 
the restrictions that go into effect tuesday but long lines seen 
forming at gas stations in baghdad early today 
the rationing order covers cars buses and trucks but not 
kerosene and liquefied gas which is widely used for cooking and 
other domestic purposes 
the directive comes one day after iraq announced it would sell 
its oil at 21 a barrel the market price before its invasion of 
iraq and half the current rate on world markets 
sources in baghdad speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
decision may have been taken because iraq lacks imported materials 
used in refining oil as a result of the united nations trade 
embargo imposed after the invasion 
during its eightyear war with iran that ended in 1988 the 
iraqi government did not impose oil rationing 
the order applied to iraqs 18 provinces but not to kuwait 
which iraq invaded and annexed two months ago and now calls its 
19th province the oil ministrys order did not explain why kuwait 
was not included in the rationing 
another report published in iraqi newspapers friday said all 
foreigners in kuwait must register with local authorities before 
nov 5 
those who fail to do so will be responsible before the law 
and their residency cards will be canceled the report said it 
gave no other details 
under iraqi law foreigners who are found without residency 
cards are punished with fines and imprisonment 
the exceptions are citizens from arab cooperation council 
nations egypt jordan and yemen 
the iraqi military has seized western men and scattered them 
throughout iraq at strategic military sites to deter attack by the 
usled military forces in saudi arabia and nearby gulf regions 
about 400000 foreigners are believed to remain in kuwait 
including about 2000 westerners said by the us state department 
to be in hiding from iraqi soldiers 
an estimated 1 million foreigners were in kuwait before the 
invasion

if the coffee tastes a little better at ogilvy amp 
mather these days it may be because maxwell house is back on the 
agencys menu of us advertising assignments 
kraft general foods said thursday it has realigned assignments 
for its advertising agencies and said it will pay them more for 
advertising that works better 
the biggest shift in ad assignments gives the domestic maxwell 
house coffee account estimated at more than 70 million a year in 
billings back to ogilvy which lost it 16 months ago 
the changes were part of a series of new policies and practices 
that the huge food marketer said are designed to strengthen its 
ties to its ad agencies enabling them to develop expertise in a 
brand and apply it around the world 
glenview illbased kraft general foods is one of the nations 
biggest advertisers spending an estimated 900 million a year to 
promote products that include post cereals jello desserts oscar 
mayer meats and birds eye vegetables the company declined to say 
how much it spends on advertising 
as a major advertiser the moves being made by kraft general 
foods could influence relations between other companies and their 
ad agencies 
ogilvy a new yorkbased subsidiary of the british marketing 
company wpp group plc had created maxwell house ads for more than 
30 years but lost the us account in the summer of 1989 to the 
agency darcy masius benton amp bowles 
eric strobel senior vice presidentmarketing for kraft general 
foods said the switch back to ogilvy did not reflect 
dissatisfaction with darcys work 
he said ogilvy had continued to handle maxwell house in some 
other countries even after losing the us account 
this takes advantage of the worldwide capabilities of ogilvy amp 
mather strobel said 
darcy continues as one of krafts major agencies on brands such 
as entenmanns baked goods cool whip topping and crystal light 
beverages 
officials of the two ad agencies declined to discuss their 
reactions to the moves but clayton wilhite president of darcy 
masius benton amp bowles usa said the loss will have an impact on 
the agency that was being assessed 
in a pair of other major account moves kraft said it was giving 
the chicagobased leo burnett agency responsibility in the united 
states for kraft real mayonnaise advertising while j walter 
thompson of new york gets the miracle whip salad dressing account 
the kraft mayonnaise account had previously been handled by 
young amp rubicam in new york while foote cone amp belding 
communications in chicago had miracle whip the trade journal 
advertising age said kraft general foods spent about 51 million on 
the two accounts last year 
in addition to the account switches strobel said the new policy 
calls for agencies to be paid 16 percent of ad billings for 
superior work 14 percent for ads that meet agreedupon goals and 
13 percent for ads that fall short 
for years agencies have often paid ad agencies 15 percent of 
billings for their work in recent months however a number of 
advertisers and agencies have adopted compensation systems that 
reward work for improved sales and penalize campaigns failing to 
produce desired results 
julian clopet president of ogilvy amp mathernorth america 
applauded the new policies advanced by kraft general foods it is 
treating another person like a partner he said

the soviet parliament today gave preliminary 
approval to mikhail s gorbachevs economic reform plan after he 
accused his key rival of shirking responsibility for the 
transformation to a freemarket system 
the supreme soviet voted 356 to 12 in favor of the plan with 26 
abstentions and began debating possible amendments president gorbachev 
said his plan a compromise forged from a 
series of competing proposals was the only rational course of 
action 
he acknowledged that the huge russian federation wants faster 
more radical reforms but said its leaders including boris n 
yeltsin are afraid of the social and economic disruptions they 
would cause 
in a 50minute speech gorbachev also dismissed concerns that 
the switch from a centrally planned system was a retreat from 
socialism 
yeltsin president of the russian federation has lambasted 
gorbachevs program as a catastrophe that is doomed to fail 
within months after touching off inflation and unemployment 
he said russia the largest and richest of the 15 soviet 
republics may proceed with its own 500day plan as early as nov 
1 
gorbachev said he shared many of yeltsins concerns about the 
countrys worsening economy and his fears of inflation but he 
noted the russian parliament recently raised the wholesale prices 
of meat and said this touched off a wave of inflation 
comrade yeltsins assertions are strange to say the least 
gorbachev said im under the impression that the russian 
leadership is afraid of difficulties and wants to pass on 
responsibility for possible difficulties and consequences onto 
central organs of power 
gorbachev appealed to the soviet people and lawmakers at all 
levels of government to approve his plan stressing we cannot 
delay any longer 
leaders of the republics were invited to join the 542 national 
lawmakers in listening to gorbachevs speech in the supreme 
soviets beige marble hall but yeltsin was not present the speech 
received only five seconds of lukewarm applause 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov who drafted a conservative 
reform plan told the legislature that implementing tough changes 
would not bring glory to those who carry out the orders 
he called on opponents to discard political and other 
ambitions and warned if changes turn into chaos violence 
becomes very possible 
gorbachevs plan would transform the moribund soviet economy in 
four stages 
it sets no deadline for the switch from a centrally planned 
economy but says other countries have achieved similar goals in 18 
months to two years 
the plan begins by cutting the budget deficit and the nations 
money supply increasing production of consumer goods raising bank 
interest rates for savings and introducing land reform 
in the second stage prices on roughly 70 percent of all goods 
and services would be freed to respond to market forces and small 
private businesses would be encouraged 
the third stage calls for a free market for housing a modern 
banking system and entrepreneurship the final stage would end 
government monopolies in many industries and allow the ruble to be 
freely traded against other world currencies 
the plan would give the ethnically and geographically diverse 
republics more clout in running the economy they would have the 
right to control most of the resources in their territory override 
price increases approved by central authorities and decide whether 
to break up collective farms into private plots 
all but two republics have declared some form of autonomy from 
the kremlin russia the biggest and richest of them threatens to 
implement its own reform plan as early as nov 1 setting up a 
separate currency and customs system 
gorbachev tried to merge the radical 500day plan already 
adopted by the huge russian republic with several other proposals 
including a far more conservative plan drafted by ryzhkov 
the soviet people are unlikely to endure the inflation and 
unemployment expected to accompany any switch to a market economy 
unless it has confidence in the leader carrying out the reforms 
gorbachev facing a breakdown of the economic system realized 
this in late july when he set up a committee with yeltsin to forge 
a compromise but the two leaders quickly broke ranks and their 
rift is widening 
even tass traditionally loyal to the kremlin jumped on 
yeltsins bandwagon 
it said thursday in an unsigned commentary that yeltsins plan 
is possibly the only form of surgery that can help the ailing 
soviet economy recover 
the government now sets prices on nearly all products and 
subsidizes many unprofitable factories under a market system most 
prices would be decontrolled and unprofitable businesses would 
close forcing workers to seek new jobs 
everything will depend on who implements this program 
leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak said in an interview 
referring to ryzhkov he said if it is done by the current 
government nothing will come of it it could be a catastrophe

the mobil oil corp settled a city 
lawsuit against its refinery here by promising to get rid of deadly 
hydrogen fluoride and submit to outside safety inspections 
under the agreement mobil would be allowed to develop and use a 
derivative of hydrogen fluoride that would not form a toxic acid 
cloud the corporation also has seven years to phase out of 
hydrogen fluoride use 
the agreement thursday settles an action filed by the city 
alleging use of the lethal cloudforming acid threatened thousands 
of residents 
the case was set for trial nov 5 
a trial would have shown the world how dangerous hydrogen 
fluoride is and how poorly managed the plant was operated said 
councilman dan walker 
the lawsuit filed early this year stems from a november 1987 
explosion and fire sparked when hydrogen fluoride overflowed into a 
tank and mixed with another chemical 
the blast caused 17 million damage injuring four workers and 
six bystanders 
hydrogen fluoride is used to manufacture highoctane gasolines 
and forms a heavy cloud when exposed to air city officials feared 
a refinery accident or leak could send such a cloud over 
residential neighborhoods 
refinery manager joel maness said he expected the settlement to 
end several years of acrimony between torrance and mobil 
we feel strongly that we have a safe operation maness said 
but i never mind having another set of eyes take a look at our 
operations and our procedures 
an inspector will advise the plant on safety considerations the 
independent reviewer will be chosen by joint agreement between 
mobil and the city the bill will be paid by the company court 
documents said 
the inspector will report to retired superior court judge harry 
v peetris who will act as an arbitrator on future disputes over 
the phaseout program peetris also will be paid by mobil

airport to usair for approximately 68 million the deal includes

midway will still serve philadelphia but with connector flights 
to chicago according to david r hinson chairman and chief 
executive officer 
the unprecedented increases in the cost of aviation fuel since 
august have added more than 10 million to the companys monthly 
operating costs hinson said these additional costs have led 
to substantial operating losses 
midway president thomas schick said during a news conference in 
philadelphia the decision was a difficult one 
we would have preferred to stay in philadelphia but the 
economic reality forces us to leave schick said 
midway will retain two gates 
the cutbacks will be accomplished in stages hinson said the 
final cuts will occur next april schick said there will be layoffs 
from the staff of 810 who now work in philadelphia he did not say 
how many would lose their jobs and how many would be transferred 
midway moved into philadelphia in november of 1989 with the 
purchase of gates and space from the ailing eastern airlines 
midway currently offers 61 flights daily to 17 destinations

a former drexel burnham lambert inc junkbond 
salesman today described a climate of fear at the investment bank 
after client ivan boesky began cooperating with the government but 
he didnt back a bribery charge against michael milken 
terren peizer testifying with immunity said that as milken 
learned the news of boeskys november 1986 plea agreement for 
securities fraud from a financial news ticker drexels top junk 
bond financier lost his train of thought and concentration and 
started going uh uh 
boesky became milkens chief accuser in a traumatic financial 
scandal that eventually brought both drexel and milken down 
government witnesses testifying thursday offered vivid details 
of possible insider trading bribery and influencepeddling between 
drexel junkbond division employees and their customers 
but as in previous testimony during milkens presentencing 
hearing no direct evidence was established linking milken to a 
string of crimes alleged by the government 
the second of three transactions presented at the hearing by 
prosecutors involves allegations of bribery and misappropration for 
personal gain of securities in the drexelfinanced buyout of storer 
communications inc 
peizer also said milken ordered him to turn over a blue ledger 
book containing a list of trades between drexel and david solomon 
of solomon asset management who had a close relationship with 
milken and has been linked by the government to wrongdoing 
the witness said he handed the book over to a drexel executive 
lorraine spurge in a kitchenette at drexels beverly hills 
calif junk bond department after turning on a water faucet in 
case anyone was listening 
everyone was running faucets at drexel after boeskys plea 
deal peizer said 
but like other witnesses peizer did not link milken directly to 
a bribery scheme involving storer stock as alleged by prosecutors 
the hearing was called by us district judge kimba wood to gain 
insight into milkens character for sentencing the government says 
milken engaged in lawbreaking far beyond crimes to which he has 
pleaded guilty and therefore deserves a long prison term 
milken 44 pleaded guilty in april to six felony counts related 
to illegal trading and agreed to pay 600 million in penalties he 
faces up to 28 years imprisonment 
prosecutors charged that milken established a partnership known 
as macpherson partners largely to reward customers who bought 
hardtosell storer securities with company stock warrants sold 
below market value 
two government witnesses testified the stock warrants were 
offered to induce big investors to buy certain preferred securities 
in storer but neither could link milken to any such activity 
benalder bayse jr former manager of highyield bond funds for 
first investors management corp offered a picture of corrupt 
behavior by other drexel employees at the beverly hills division 
he said a drexel salesman roy johnson sought a guarantee he 
would funnel drexel first investors business after steering him to 
the job he said johnson claimed he had spoken with milken about 
negotiating his compensation at first investors 
he told me they wanted total control over the account if they 
were going to endorse me for the job bayse testified 
bayse admitted that johnson offered him and he bought a 
personal interest in macpherson after he committed about 10 
million in the preferred securities for first investors 
but he said he wasnt bribed to invest in storer for first 
investors and bought the preferred securities because milken 
assured him the storer deal was sound 
bayse said johnson told him that because i was a good 
customer he would receive other investment tips he said johnson 
told him one of his accounts was accumulating the equity of 
republic air but that you didnt hear that from me republic 
shortly thereafter received a takeover offer from northwest 
airlines 
thomas connors who headed drexels preferred stock group 
testified that the storer stock warrants were offered to some 
customers to induce participation 
he said one customer richard grassgreen bought a personal 
investment in macpherson after purchasing the warrants on behalf of 
kindercare inc a lawyer for grassgreen told wood on wednesday his 
client was being investigated by the government in connection with 
the trading grassgreen resigned thursday as chairman of enstar 
group inc 
in its presentencing memo prosecutors said five 
milkencontrolled partnerships bought 82 percent of the storer 
warrants and made 172 million they charge milken was guilty of 
fraud in the sale of the warrants controlling the market for the 
securities and using them as gratuities for customers 
the partnership was formed shortly after the 25 billion buyout 
of storer by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co drexel provided nearly 
15 billion in financing for the deal

it is generally considered a principle of good 
management in governmental and business affairs to maintain as many 
options as possible and in that way to protect yourself from 
others 
it applies equally to the president of the united states and his 
fiscal policies to the management of a corporation and to the way 
an individual automobile driver handles himself on the highway 
stated another way it means you should never get into a 
position that allows friend competitor or enemy to seize the 
initiative from you and make decisions affecting your life liberty 
or future 
it isnt practiced well these days and it isnt difficult to 
cite the examples 
you may begin with the price of oil its fluctuations in the 
past week have affected the value of the dollar the prices of 
stocks the potential level of inflation the balance of payments 
and the future of the economy 
all those factors involve the futures of americans from the 
president to the latest infant born but the influences on them are 
largely from without americans have lost their options they do 
not control their destiny 
neither do many corporations 
the fate of robert campeau a successful canadian builder is an 
example he mortgaged everything in order to become the worlds 
biggest merchant the head of allied and federated stores then his 
creditors took it from him 
donald trump can tell you what its like he sat on an imaginary 
throne of great wealth and believed it was real but now his 
creditors are disgruntled and some of them sound determined to 
reclaim throne tiara and robes 
individuals did it too when times were good they made good 
incomes and they traveled and bought nice cars big houses and 
lots of adult toys they spent and then they borrowed more then 
the economy turned down 
all this is a vast departure governmental corporate personal 
from the american ideals of half a century ago when people 
worked to pay off the home mortgage government balanced the budget 
and businesses watched their dimes 
traces of the old still may be found but those who hold to 
those ideals do so quietly as if they possessed a treasure they 
cared not to share all in all the old methods have disappeared 
replaced by creative management 
as a nation the united states owes a vast bill to other nations 
because it consumed so much japan and europe were eager to serve 
this american appetite and in doing so they accumulated billions 
of american dollars 
those dollars didnt just sit over there they helped finance 
productive enterprises that competed with the united states then 
some of the money was returned to america to purchase american 
stocks and real estate 
japanese and other foreign investments helped shove securities 
prices to unprecedented highs and americans cheered but then the 
foreigners began taking their money home again a major factor in 
the big stock market collapse 
in the 1960s americans were known as the greatest managers and 
their methods were studied and copied good business schools were 
rare in europe and japan and so their students came to america to 
learn how to do things 
americans also began sending their management authorities 
abroad not necessarily because they wanted to teach foreigners but 
because they no longer wished to listen to their homegrown 
experts 
soon after domestic production quality and efficiency seemed to 
go into a decline as it rose abroad and american companies soon 
were being beaten on their own turf by imports 
they had given away their options and delivered their fate into 
the hands of others one of the most basic management errors anyone 
can make but one that is being made over and over again

midway airlines announced friday it would 
sell off its unprofitable hub operations at the philadelphia 
international airport and end 61 daily flights by april 30 as it 
faces even greater losses due to fuel prices 
midway will start dropping flights in january and shift 
passengers to other airlines as the flights are phased out 
president thomas schick said at a news conference that midway 
would sell 11 gates a maintenance building baggage cargo and 
ticket facilities and canadian routes to toronto and montreal to 
usair for approximately 68 million 
midway whose main hub is at chicagos midway airport had 
obtained the philadelphia assets plus 16 dc9 planes and slots in 
washington and new york a year ago from eastern airlines for 
2056 million the selloff schick said would cost his airline 
about 30 million 
david hinson midway chairman and chief executive officer said 
in a statement that the sale was necessary to stabilize the 
airlines financial condition and return it to profitability 
we must close this usair transaction to obtain the cash 
resources we require he said hinson said the losses if left 
unchecked would threaten the companys continuing viability 
said schick we felt it was prudent to make this move now to 
make sure we could survive the fuel crunch caused by the persian 
gulf crisis the higher fuel prices are costing midway 10 million 
more in monthly operating costs which schick said is not being 
replaced through higher fares 
he said there will be some cuts from the 810member work force 
in philadelphia many will be offered jobs at other midway 
locations 
the sale is subject to federal approval 
effective jan 8 all nonstop service involving 41 flights 
will be discontinued between philadelphia and the following cities 
albany buffalo and rochester ny boston hartford conn 
columbus ohio las vegas new orleans providence ri and 
montreal 
service on 20 daily flights from philadelphia to chicago 
toronto and points in florida will continue through april 30 
schick said midway will continue service out of philadelphia 
after april 30 by renting at least two gates at the same time 
midway will accelerate development of its chicago hub starting jan 
8 with additional flights to 14 destinations the airline will use 
aircraft redeployed from philadelphia 
midway has offered service between philadelphia and chicago 
since 1981 it made philadelphia a hub a year ago when eastern 
moved out 
schick said midway had high hopes for its philadelphia hub and 
was looking forward to showing a profit in the last three months of 
1990 until iraq invaded kuwait 
the shock to the petroleum market more than doubled our fuel 
costs and we decided we didnt want that problem to manage us 
he told reporters in explaining why midway established 11 years 
ago was going to concentrate its business from chicago 
we feel this move back to our core business is the right way

executives of general motors corp and the united 
auto workers union signed a new threeyear labor contract friday 
guaranteeing the wages of about 300000 us workers 
gm chairman robert stempel and uaw president owen bieber signed 
the documents as more than three dozen members of both bargaining 
teams sat around the huge bargaining table in gm headquarters 
bieber is now expected to turn up the heat on chrysler corp 
when bargaining with the no 3 automaker intensifies next week but 
he would talk only of the contract with gm 
its clearly a document i think speaks well for the workers 
and the company all of us together to see to it we have a good 
successful operation here in the next three years and beyond 
bieber said i think its historic in many ways 
stempel said the contract would help gm become more competitive 
with japanses automakers operating in the united states 
the gmuaw agreement was reached sept 17 two days after the 
1987 contract expired it was ratified in union voting late last 
month by a 4to1 margin 
the contract includes three years of wage guarantees for workers 
laid off due to sales dips no changes in costofliving or health 
care provisions and a 3 percent increase in base wages in the 
first year along with 3 percent lumpsum payments in each of the 
next two years 
the agreement raises the base wage for a gm assembler the most 
common classification of worker by 42 cents an hour to 1444 
before costofliving adjustments 
the union used its contract with gm as a model for a threeyear 
agreement reached oct 7 with ford that agreement is expected to 
be ratified when rankandfile voting ends sunday for fords 
100000 workers 
next up is chrysler and its 50000 workers and the union 
intends to use the contracts reached with gm and ford as the base 
for negotiations even though chrysler is in worse financial shape 
the talks are expected to begin monday or tuesday at chrysler 
headquarters in highland park

senate backers of a bill to regulate cable tv 
prices said friday the compromise measure was dead for the year 
after they failed to move it to a floor vote 
the defeat marked the end of three weeks of private negotiations 
between sens albert gore dtenn and tim wirth dcolo to 
soften language in the bill that would have prevented cable 
programmers from making exclusive contracts with cable system 
operators 
it also culminated a twoyear effort to meld two dozen cable 
bills into a law that would address rising concerns about shoddy 
service and cable charges which have risen 43 percent in the last 
three years cable fees were deregulated by congress in 1987 
gore and wirth had reached a compromise they hoped would make 
the bill palatable to the white house which has threatened all 
along to veto the measure 
but white house chief of staff john sununu this week urged 
several republican senators to place a hold on the bill to 
prevent its coming up for a floor vote congressional and industry 
sources said 
in addition several amendments would have required hours of 
debate that couldnt be scheduled this late in the congressional 
session said the sources who requested anonymity 
gore speaking on the chambers floor friday said it had become 
painfully clear that the white house with anticonsumer 
ideology has successfully killed cable legislation for this 
congress by urging a number of our republican colleagues to put 
holds on the cable legislation 
he predicted a new round of rate increases for cable 
television all over the united states 
the cable industry was deadset against the contract exclusivity 
provisions the wirthgore amendment would have allowed some 
exclusive contracts 
gore claimed that proponents of regulating cable charges would 
propose a stronger bill next year when telephone companies which 
failed in a massively financed lobbying effort this year to be 
allowed into the cable tv business are expected to resume their 
campaign 
the wireless cable and back yard and directbroadcast 
satellite industries championed by gore also are expected to seek 
bigger gains against their wired cable competitors next year 
wirth whose district includes several major cable companies 
had almost singlehandedly stalled the bill three weeks ago he 
complained that legislation that had started out as a modest 
attempt to restrain prices and improve service had been loaded down 
like a flatbed truck with business restrictions 
the house and senate bills aimed at requiring cable systems to 
provide a basic tier of local broadcast and public tv channels 
and at requiring the fcc to monitor rates for cableowned 
programming such as mtv

european community agriculture ministers 
failed friday to break a deadlock over a plan to cut government 
payments to farmers casting doubt on the outcome of key world 
trade negotiations 
the ministers struggling with the proposal for the third time 
in two weeks gave up and asked their foreign ministers to try to 
settle the dispute on monday in luxembourg 
its a very sad day for the ec said british agriculture 
secretary john gummer who supported the plan for a 30 percent cut 
in key farm subsidies 
its very sad that some countries have put their own 
nationalist views ahead of our own interests and those of the whole 
world he said 
the communitys proposal was drawn up in attempts to end a 
bitter fight with the united states over farm supports in the 
uruguay round of world trade talks 
the united states backed by australia argentina and others 
wants the community to make deep cuts in its costly farm programs 
they contend resolution of the farm dispute is key to a successful 
outcome of the trade talks 
the four year negotiations involving 100 industrialized and 
developing nations are an ambitious effort to overhaul the world 
trading system and reduce protectionist barriers 
but the communitys inability to endorse a modest package of 
farm cuts throws a shadow over the talks due to end in december in 
brussels 
its not possible to have a trade agreement without an 
agriculture agreement said gummer for many poor countries 
agriculture is all theyve got 
italian agriculture minister vito saccemandi told reporters the 
ministers gave up after failing to get total solidarity for the 
proposal put forward by the european commission the communitys 
executive body 
germanys farm minister ignaz kiechle hardened his opposition 
to the package and demanded compensatory measures to make up for 
income losses to farmers officials said 
if there is no change in the position of the commission then 
there will also be no change in our position kiechle told 
reporters 
the germans clearly did not come for a solution said 
gummer 
ray macsharry the commissions top farm official defended the 
proposal as reasonable and realistic and said it was 
politically and socially possible to implement 
the proposal would snip farm subsidies on cereals rice sugar 
and livestock by 30 percent over a 10year period starting in 
1986 a 10 percent cut was proposed in fruits vegetables and 
tobacco 
no specific reductions were outlined for the communitys export 
subsidy program used to help pricey european products find buyers 
on the world market but there were hints the community was willing 
to discuss some cuts 
commission officials who drew up the original plan have so far 
been unwilling to tamper with the wording 
denmark britain and the netherlands supported the proposal from 
the outset italy and belgium were said to be leaning toward it at 
the end 
if the foreign ministers failed to act next week the issue 
could be added to the agenda of the leaders of the dozen nations at 
the european community summit oct 2728 in rome 
because of the deadlock the community was forced to miss last 
mondays deadline for presenting final offers in the uruguay round 
talks the community is the only major member of the negotiations 
which has not yet produced its proposal 
in its latest offer the united states asked trading partners to 
pare export subsidies by 90 percent and farm income supports by 75 
percent over a 10year period starting in 1991 
it also called for converting nontariff barriers to imported 
goods into tariffs giving a numerical value to barriers that 
restrict imports of foreign goods and then trimming the rates by 
an average of 75 percent again over 10 years 
in the uruguay round negotiators are trying to lower barriers 
to trade in 15 areas including not only agriculture but also 
textiles manufactured goods and services such as investment 
the talks are held under the auspices of the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade a forum and an agreement for promoting freer 
world trade 
community members are belgium britain denmark france 
germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands 
portugal and spain

the bank of new england corp reported a loss of 
1232 million or 178 a share in the third quarter due largely 
to a 100 million provision for possible credit losses company 
officials said friday 
the company blamed its losses on the slowdown of the new england 
economy worsened by rising oil prices and middle east 
uncertainties 
bnec also suffered a 48 million loss in operating earnings for 
the quarter the company said a 31 million gain due partly to 
reduced pension obligations because of a smaller work force helped 
offset the losses 
it just portrays a picture of how difficult it is for a weak 
bank to function in an economic environment that is still 
deteriorating said james moynihan a bank stocks specialist for 
advest a hartford connbased brokerage firm 
the company also presented an exchange offer friday to the heads 
of committees representing holders of the companys 706 million in 
debt 
the exchange if agreed upon would recapitalize the holding 
company officials said 
despite the loss bnec has made strides in its strategic 
recovery program company chairman lawrence k fish said in a 
statement 
nonperforming loans decreased 93 million for the quarter to 
2136 billion on september 30 fish said 
costs dropped from the 90 million a month operating level in 
january to 71 million a month at the end of september he said 
by september 30 the companys workforce had been reduced to 
12500 from over 17500 in january the holding company had planned 
to reduced its employees by 6000 by the first quarter of 1991 
i think theyre probably two to three months behind schedule 
but nevertheless they are making progress moynihan said 
bank of new england is a bostonbased bank holding company with 
assets of 23 billion it has offices in maine connecticut and 
rhode island

if only president bush had tried a little 
reverse psychology 
the nation stumbled into a budget crisis after the president and 
congressional leaders peddled a plan for tax increases and spending 
cuts that few constituencies were willing to buy 
the budgeteers might better have nursed their plan along with 
less fanfare rather than promote such a bitter pill as a miracle 
cure for the widening federal deficit 
the strategy is called lowering expectations and it worked 
wonders this past week on wall street where the stock market 
rallied even while digesting big doses of bad news 
lowest of all expectations were those for the repair of the 
illfated budget compromise itself investors were prepared for any 
disappointment after watching the messy collapse of the original 
deal 
the markets were likewise girded for disaster on the corporate 
and economic fronts 
how else to explain a 425 rise in digital equipment corp

percent plunge in quarterly profits but staved off a dividend cut

low expectations also cushioned the impact of the governments 
economic numbers 
inflation as measured by the consumer price index was up 08 
percent in september which computes to a 95 percent annual rate 
but the jump was mostly due to the runup in oil prices from the 
persian gulfcrisis socalled core inflation prices excluding 
food and energy was 03 percent for the month down from 05 
percent in august 
the pickup in inflation was good news to 40 million social 
security recipients who will be getting the biggest boost in 
benefits in 8 years based on the cpi report the government 
announced a 54 percent rise in benefits beginning in january 
among other bad numbers the merchandise trade deficit widened 
in august and housing starts extended their slide to eight months

southwestern bell corp hopes to trim 1600 
managementlevel employees from its telephone subsidiary by the end 
of the year with a voluntary incentive program company officials 
said friday 
thats kind of a target number if it goes above or falls 
short then thats what we get its not locked in concrete said 
bob dickemper vice president of human resources for the company 
changes in the way the company is run and improved technology 
have reduced the companys needs for managers he said 
southwestern bell like many other large corporations has tried 
for the past several years to give more responsibility to employees 
at all levels and decrease the layers of management 
the company conducted a similar jobreduction program in 1986 
and 2000 managers left their jobs dickemper said 
the telephone subsidiary which provides phone service to 95 
million homes and businesses in missouri kansas texas oklahoma 
and arkansas will limit by state the number of managers who take 
advantage of the program 
there should really be no widespread impact on any particular 
community he said 
incentives will vary by length of employment dickemper said 
with a maximum payout of oneyears salary to employees with more 
than 20 years of service 
about 17000 of the telephone subsidiarys 58000 workers have 
managerial positions 
on thursday the company reported a thirdquarter profit of 323 
million or 108 a share an increase of 95 percent from the same 
period a year ago

lawmakers who for more than a year have wanted 
to use trade to punish chinas repression of democracy said friday 
they have pretty much given up the idea in the waning days of the 
congressional session 
the house voted 247174 thursday to overrule president bushs 
decision in may to allow china to retain the low most favored 
nation tariffs on its 12 billion in annual exports to the united 
states through next year 
that effort died when the senate rather than break off debate 
on a deficit reduction bill did not act before a midnight deadline 
that congress established in august for passing the resolution 
i continue to believe that the presidents renewal of this 
special trade status is wrong senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine said today it is a signal to the chinese 
leadership that the united states views its brutal human rights 
violations with complacency 
but mitchell expressed no desire to bring before the senate its 
last few days in session a weaker version also approved by the 
house that to make future renewals of chinas mostfavorednation 
status more difficult 
that weaker version would condition the low tariffs on a 
requirement that beijing make substantial progress on meeting 
several human rights objectives 
even if mitchell brought the alternative to the senate floor 
lawmakers said supporters lacked the twothirds majorities needed 
in both houses to override what administration officials said would 
be a sure veto by bush 
the president was once the ambassador to china and hes got 
his mind made up on it said rep sam gibbons dfla chairman 
of the house ways and means committees trade subcommittee and 
we dont have the votes to override him 
bush the american envoy to china during the 1970s before the 
united states formally recognized its communist government has 
maintained that suspending mostfavorednation status would hurt 
the chinese people 
its no secret that the administration has been consistent in 
its strong opposition to passage of both the bills state 
department spokeswoman margarettutwiler said today 
she said either measure could seriously damage our goal in 
advancing us economic human rights and other foreign policy 
interests in china as well as our interest in reaching a peaceful 
settlement in the persian gulf and cambodia 
lifting the mostfavorednation trade status granted to china 
in 1980 would increase tariffs on its exports to the united 
states tenfold drastically reducing the 18 billion in twoway 
trade last year 
even though the measure was certain to be vetoed sponsors said 
its passage was needed nonetheless to send chinese leaders a 
message to end their repression of dissidents 
we have to play the good copbad cop routine so the 
president can tell the chinese that congress is tough and means 
business said rep gerald solomon rny 
before the senate missed the deadline the chinese foreign 
ministry said the house vote will exert destructive impacts on 
the economic and trade relations between the two countries and will 
surely result in a serious slide back of the bilateral relations

meredith corp said friday its earnings 
shot up more than six times in the first quarter of its fiscal 
year reflecting onetime gains from the sale of assets 
earnings from continuing operations nudged up just 13 percent 
for the diversified media company with interests in publishing 
broadcasting and real estate meredith is best known for its better 
homes and gardens and ladies home journal magazines 
it reported profit of 609 million or 362 a share in the 
first quarter ended sept 30 compared with 93 million or 50 
cents a share in the same period a year ago 
the latest results included gains of 493 million from 
merediths share of thesale of meredithburda printing business to 
rr donnelley and sons co and almost 36 million from the sale 
of sail magazine to cahners publishing 
revenue rose 36 percent to 1794 million from 1731 million a 
year earlier 
earnings from continued operations rose to almost 54 million 
or 32 cents a share from nearly 52 million or 28 cents a share 
jack rehm merediths president said the improvement in 
firstquarter earnings from continuing operations reflected 
increased profits from broadcast operations and higher interest 
income 
the interest income was associated with a note received from the 
sale of the printing operation that had been jointly owned with the 
burda family of germany 
the broadcasting group benefited from lower operations 
expenses the reduction was primarily due to lower programming 
costs that resulted from the fiscal 1990 write down of syndicated 
programming investments rehm said 
the broadcast writedown was just one of several factors that 
produced a 499 million loss in the fourth quarter and a loss of 
264 million for the full fiscal year that ended june 30 
rehm reported operating earnings were held down in the first 
quarter by a reduction in the number of advertising pages in 
magazines a drop in results from real estate operations and 
heavier returns of book club products 
a previously announced program to repurchase stock reduced the 
average outstanding shares to 168 million as of sept 30 from 187 
million a year earlier 
in trading friday on the new york stock exchange meredith stock 
gained 50 cents to close at 2175 per share

donald trump has offered investors in his taj 
mahal bonds nearly 20 percent of the hotel and casinos equity but 
a debtrating service says the bondholders are in a strong position 
to get up to half 
the way fitch investors service inc figures it the taj mahals 
cash flow can only cover half the interest expense on its 675 
million in junk bonds that pay 14 percent interest 
the bonds are worth half their par value based on the 
companys inability to service the debt on the books said wayne 
josephson one of the fitch analysts who prepared the report on 
trumps taj mahal one of the debtdogged developers most 
worrisome problems in restructuring we suggest bondholders would 
demand to be compensated for the loss in the value of their 
bonds 
however stephen bollenbach trumps new chief financial 
officer doesnt agree on thursday trump announced he had offered 
taj bondholders 199 percent of the casino in return for reducing 
the interest rate to 9 percent trump said in a securities and 
exchange commission filing that bankruptcy court may be the only 
resort if the offer is turned down 
the day before the sec filing bollenbach said the taj mahals 
longterm prospects are not as bad as the fitch calculations 
suggest 
theres plenty of public data out there that would indicate 
that on an ongoing basis the property could do much better than 
that bollenbach said 
its one of the ironies of the world we live in today heres 
the taj mahal thats a brand new business thats doing a terrific 
business but because of the way its financed its not currently 
covering its debt service 
that doesnt mean its a business thats permanently impaired 
i think the bondholders realize that 
wilbur ross adviser to bondholders and a senior managing 
partner at rothschild inc rejected the trump offer in a 
statement ross said he is pushing for majority interest in the 
atlantic city resort in exchange for an interestrate cut smaller 
than the 5 percent reduction suggested by trump 
were miles apart on just about every single issue ross 
said 
according to the trump filing the bondholders earlier this 
month sought 85 percent of the equity in the hotel and casino 
ross said the bondholders stood to get a better deal than 
trumps latest offer if the business filed for bankruptcy 
protection 
in addition to the interestrate cut trump also wants the 
bondholders to let him make a 473 million interest payment nov 
15 with more bonds allow some of the interest in the future to be 
paid with more bonds and extend the issues maturity two years to 
september 2000 
fitch concludes that bondholders are bearing most of the risk in 
trumps casino bonds since the developer has not guaranteed them 
with his own money and his 100 percent ownership in the taj mahal 
trump plaza and trump castle is pledged to his bank lenders 
the banks fitch says would be willing to relinquish their 
claim to some of the equity to keep the taj a going concern a taj 
failure could ripple throughout trumps empire making the banks 
potential losses extend far beyond atlantic city 
one thing on trumps side the bondholders who stand a good 
chance of getting the casino from a bankruptcy court dont have a 
license to operate the place the new jersey casino control 
commission would represent yet another hurdle for the bondholders 
trying to keep their investment alive 
without a license to operate a casino bondholders hold the 
first mortgage on an empty building without any operating 
business fitch said 
with a shortage of people looking to own an atlantic city 
casino selling the elaborate property could be tough 
casinos are historically thought of as recessionproof but 
arent getting that treatment this time around 
atlantic city casinos which depend on middleclass daytrippers 
from the economically slumping northeast are seen as particularly 
vulnerable 
while las vegas attracts higherincome gamblers who stay for 
days at a time the typical atlantic city visitor has less 
discretionary income and is likely to feel the pinch of a recession 
sooner 
also atlantic city casinos in general are deeper in debt than 
those in las vegas 
their cash flow is so tight to service the debt that even a 
mild slowdown could make the difference between having enough cash 
or not having enough cash josephson said

varity corp has reached an agreement with 
canada officials and the canadian auto workers union allowing the 
company to move its headquarters from toronto to buffalo next year 
officials said 
varity formerly masseyferguson ltd was saved from bankruptcy 
by a multimillion dollar bailout by the ontario and canadian 
federal governments in 1981 
the manufacturer of farm equipment and auto parts agreed to pay 
penalties of 21 million in canadian dollars 18 million us to 
the ontario and canadian governments as well as about 27 million 
in canadian dollars 23 million us to pay outstanding claims by 
workers who lost their jobs after a 1986 plant closing 
the agreement announced thursday by ontario premier bob rae and 
varity clears the way for varity to relocate about 50 workers here 
after the companys reincorporation in the united states the 
companys 1200 permanent manufacturing and processing jobs would 
remain in canada 
sheila copps a canadian parliament member criticized the 
settlement saying it offers peanuts and crumbs to about 450 
varity workers she said will lose their jobs at a plant in windsor 
ontario 
but neil d arnold the companys senior vice president and 
chief financial officer said varity was determined to reach a 
reasonable settlement remembering that the governments timely 
investment nearly 10 years ago helped us keep afloat and gave us 
the opportunity to undertake our strategic recovery plan 
varity with annual sales of 24 billion us would rank 
among the top 130 companies in the fortune 500 list of largest us 
public firms 
fifty percent of varitys sales are in the united states with 
canada accounting for just 4 percent of its worldwide business 
varity first announced the move to the united states in july 
but the plans had been threatened until thursdays agreement 
the agreement which has been approved by the two governments 
and varitys board of directors was designed to compensate the 
canadian government for its bailout and to excuse varity from its 
1986 promise to keep its headquarters in canada 
varity has purchased a mansion in buffalo that company officials 
said is the probable site for its headquarters 
the move to buffalo must first be approved by the companys 
board then submitted to its shareholders 82 percent of whom are 
americans 
a decision on the move could be made by late march said jack r 
nowling a varity spokesman

of lower oil prices which fell on perceptions that the iraqus 
standoff in the middle east is moving toward a peaceful settlement

federal reserve board may take action to lower bank lending rates

back in july thats when gold accelerated to the upside said 
bernard savaiko senior metals analyst for painewebber inc 
john jonat who trades precious metals for deak international

the consumer group public citizen admitted 
friday it made a mistake in putting the itt hartford insurance 
group on a list of five property and casualty insurance companies 
it said could fail in the event of a recession 
itt hartford said it was public citizen not the insurance 
company that flunked the test 
the consumer group affiliated with ralph nader issued a 
statement acknowledging the error but standing by its reports 
fundamental conclusion property and casualty companies should 
improve their business practices to avoid solvency problems in the 
future 
public citizen said monday that the hartford aetna american 
international group liberty mutual and united states fidelity amp 
guaranty each failed four of six tests that it used to measure 
vulnerability to insolvency 
the group said none of the companies was on the edge of 
insolvency but the underlying weakness in their financial 
condition is clearly evident 
all five companies along with the insurance information 
institute took issue with the report some described it as 
irresponsible 
one of the six tests used by public citizen was whether a 
companys surplus the available backup funds for use in cases of 
catastrophic or unexpected losses had declined since 1972 
it found that hartfords surplus measured in 1967 dollars had 
dropped from 11 billion in 1972 to 735 million in 1988 a 
decline of 33 percent 
jim westervelt vice president and group comptroller for the 
hartford said the figure used for 1972 represented the surpluses 
of all of the hartford companies 
the 1988 figure on the other hand represented only the 
consolidated surpluses of hartford fire insurance company and its 
property and casualty subsidiaries 
the company said and public citizen acknowledged that use of 
the correct figures would have shown that the hartfords 1988 
surplus was up 6 percent from 1972 
as a result the hartford should not have been included among 
the companies most financially vulnerable in the event of an 
economic downturn public citizen said 
its statement said that data in the industry publication bests 
aggregates and averages which it used to determine shrinkage of 
surpluses does not clearly indicate the pooling arrangements 
within the hartford in 1972 
using the correct figures it said itt hartford has failed 
three not four of the vulnerability tests 
the hartfords surplus has not deteriorated and the company 
should not have been listed as one of the five companies that were 
found to have failed this test the company said 
joel freedman a hartford vice president in washington said the 
hartford had not examined whether the figures for the other four 
companies were wrong 
itt said its independent auditors arthur andersen amp co had 
confirmed the error 
public citizen in fact has flunked the test itt hartford 
said in a news release 
freedman said the company had been damaged because of 
policyholders agents and shareholders becoming concerned about the 
public citizen report 
meanwhile usfampg issued a statement from its baltimore 
headquarters saying that in applying its six tests public citizen 
misapplied critical financial data relating to usfampg and 
overlooked other financial information 
usfampgs own analysis contradicts public citizens conclusions 
and establishes that usfampg falls safely within the group of other 
financially strong insurers analyzed in the report who were not 
singled out the statement said public citizens report was 
shallow and misdirected

german marks to 14970 in new york thursday but it rebounded

in the soviet unions most radical departure from 
communist economics in 70 years the legislature voted friday to 
transform the economy into the marketoriented system advocated by 
mikhail s gorbachev 
but a rift with the russian federation the countrys largest 
republic threatened to disrupt the effort 
the supreme soviet voted 33312 with nine abstentions in favor 
of gorbachevs plan to free most prices of government control end 
most government monopolies and encourage free enterprise in this 
nation of 285 million residents 
lawmakers had given the bill preliminary approval earlier before 
debating amendments 
it is an ambitious outline for ending chronic shortages of food 
and housing integrating the soviet union in the world market and 
encouraging people to work harder and enjoy the benefits 
the plan partially reverses decades of tight central control of 
the nations economy unleashing market forces to determine prices 
what products to make how to make them and where 
hours after the plan was approved the governments statistics 
agency released dismal figures for the economys first nine months 
of 1990 gross national product was down 15 percent and inflation 
was 9 percent tass reported 
the plan hopes to reverse those trends but its success rides on 
officials in the 15 soviet republics who must put it into effect 
through local legislation 
and the republics increasingly anxious to break away from 
central control because of decades of unfair treatment under 
kremlin economic policies may not cooperate as much as necessary 
the blueprint came under fire even before fridays vote from 
gorbachevs main political rival boris n yeltsin president of 
the russian federation on friday gorbachev launched a 
counterattack 
comrade yeltsins assertions are strange to say the least 
gorbachev told the 542member legislature 
im under the impression that the russian leadership is afraid 
of difficulties and wants to pass responsibility onto central 
organs of power he said 
gorbachev said he shared many of yeltsins concerns about 
deteriorating political and economic conditions and inflation but 
he accused the government of the russian republic of contributing 
to inflation with its recent decision to raise wholesale meat 
prices 
yeltsin has lambasted gorbachevs plan as a catastrophe that 
is doomed to fail within months he has said his own republic 
the largest and richest may proceed with its own 500day plan for 
switching to a market economy as early as nov 1 
in a 50minute speech friday gorbachev tried to persuade the 
republics to sign onto his plan supporters say it allows the 
republics wide latitude to tailor reforms to local conditions 
he called the plan the only rational course of action but 
his speech won only five seconds of lukewarm applause 
stanislav shatalin author of the 500day plan that russia 
adopted told a news conference that although the supreme soviet 
did not choose his plan he endorses gorbachevs outline 
and in a clear reference to yeltsin he said the programs 
success depends on political stabilization 
the republics survival will depend on whether they act in 
concert or not shatalin said 
another economist deputy soviet premier leonid abalkin said 
yeltsins actions could bring on chaos and disintegration and 
he called for people to express confidence in the president 
that confidence will be crucial to peoples willingness to 
endure the unemployment and inflation expected as the reforms 
proceed 
the reforms touch on the fundamentals of socialism including 
private ownership of businesses and of land the republics were 
left to decide who should be allowed to have private property and 
whether to allow private ownership of land 
gorbachev acknowledged that some people were asking whether the 
transition to a market economy was a departure from socialism 
we are striving not through declarations but in reality to 
strengthen socialism by maximizing potential he told the 
lawmakers 
gorbachevs plan would transform the moribund soviet economy in 
four stages it sets no deadline for the switch but says other 
countries have achieved similar goals in 18 months to two years 
the plan begins by cutting the budget deficit and the nations 
money supply increasing production of consumer goods raising bank 
interest rates for savings and introducing land reform

a federal appeals court on friday rejected a 
request that it halt the planned trial of 20 consolidated asbestos 
injury claim cases 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals denied a request by usx 
corp for a stay of mondays scheduled trial before us district 
judge thomas d lambros chief judge gilbert merritt said the court 
would give its reasons for the denial in a memo to be issued next 
week 
the pittsburghbased usx is a defendant in three of the 20 cases 
lambros consolidated in his cleveland court lambros and other 
judges have consolidated asbestos cases in an effort to get rid of 
backlogged cases 
still pending before the appeals court is usxs separate request 
for an order prohibiting lambros from proceeding with the 
consolidated cases and requiring assignment of the cases to other 
judges in northern ohio 
usx argued that the cases in which the company is a defendant 
are unsuitable for what would amount to classaction grouping with 
other dissimilar cases lambros a respondent in the usx petition 
has not filed a response to the request that the cases be 
reassigned court spokeswoman debra nagle said 
the appeals court gave him until tuesday to do so 
plaintiffs in the cases are gret lakes mariners who claim they 
may have contracted cancer or other ailments because they were 
exposed to asbestos or asbestoscontaining material while on board 
usx corp ships 
lambros and the other judges who consolidated the cases have 
said it appears the defendants do not have enough money to pay all 
the claims and costs in thousands of pending lawsuits 
defendants in some of the cases have objected to the judges 
efforts to consolidate their cases saying they prefer to go to 
trial and defend themselves independently of other plaintiffs

international sales of its readytoeat cereal overcame slow us 
sales growth for a 318 percent jump in thirdquarter profits 
exceeding analysts expectations 
the worlds largest cereal maker said its net income rose to 
1623 million or 134 for the three months ended sept 30 from 
1231 million or 102 a share for julyseptember 1989 
net sales reached 135 billion for the period up from 120

market down about two percentage points from a year earlier said

michael milken stammered and rose from his desk 
after learning speculator ivan boesky was cooperating with the 
governments insider trading investigation in late 1986 a milken 
subordinate testified friday 
another witness offered the first evidence milken may have 
misled an important client during the 25 billion buyout of storer 
communications inc in late 1985 then the biggest takeover deal 
ever 
former drexel burnham lambert inc junkbond salesman terren 
peizer described a climate of fear after the boesky deal in which 
workers speculated about government wiretaps and turned on water 
faucets to drown conversations 
milkens lawyers raised the possibility of the first public 
testimony by milken after four years at the center of the 
governments wall street probe defense lawyer arthur liman said he 
may call milken to the stand at the end of the special 
presentencing hearing in manhattan federal court 
the hearing before us district judge kimba wood focuses on 
alleged crimes by milken beyond those to which he has pleaded 
guilty prosecutors hope to convince wood that milken deserves a 
stiff punishment by depicting a pattern of systematic lawbreaking 
by the former head of drexels junkbond operation 
milken 44 pleaded guilty in april to six felony counts related 
to illegal trading and agreed to pay 600 million in penalties he 
faces a maximum 28 years imprisonment 
theodore ammon of kohlberg kravis roberts amp co an investment 
firm that was one of drexels biggest customers testified milken 
and associates received millions of dollars in equity in kkrs 
drexelfinanced takeover of storer without the firms knowledge 
the testimony was important because it suggested milken may have 
tried enrich himself associates and customers while misleading kkr 
about the reason ammon said milken had told him the equity was 
intended for third parties as an inducement to buy risky storer 
preferred securities 
prosecutors had charged earlier that milken created partnerships 
to reward customers who bought the risky storer securities with 
company stock the government said the stock constituted a bribe 
but the defense maintains that milken and his associates had 
acquired the equity because they had committed to purchasing more 
than half of the 261 million preferred stock offering 
peizer who sat beside milken on drexels xshaped trading desk 
said when news of boeskys november 1986 plea deal crossed the 
financial news ticker milken lost his train of thought and 
concentration and started going uh uh boesky became milkens 
chief accuser milken has admitted lawbreaking with boesky 
but liman questioned peizers version of the events peizer said 
after the boesky announcement milken walked into the office of his 
brother lowell liman said lowell milken was out sick that day 
while searching his desk for documents subpoenaed by the 
government peizer said milken said something to the effect that 
if you dont have them you cant provide them he said milken 
then opened one of his desk drawers which was empty 
but under questioning peizer said he did not assume milken was 
telling him to discard documents peizer said milken never asked 
him to dispose of any records and he never did 
on thursday two government witnesses testified that stock 
warrants were offered to induce big investors to buy risky storer 
preferred securities but neither could link milken to any bribery 
or misappropriation 
ammon testified milken called him late in the storer deal saying 
he needed to halve the purchase price of the warrants to 5 million 
to attract more interest in the preferred 
ammon said he learned about the milkenled partnerships almost 
two years later and argued with a drexel executive about the firm 
retaining so much equity but he said kkr probably would have done 
the deal regardless and he conceded kkr had given drexel broad 
latitude to constuct the terms 
peizer said he sold a large block of the preferred issue to 
david solomon of solomon asset management a longtime milken 
customer after milken suggested the equity sweetener peizer 
said he learned later that solomon had sold the preferred stock to 
his own clients but kept the warrants for himself 
it was unclear whether solomon took the warrants on his own or 
via an arrangement with drexel peizer said he did not believe the 
equity constituted a bribe 
solomon was involved in one of the transactions in milkens 
guilty plea and is cooperating with government prosecutors 
prosecutors said he will not be called as a witness on storer 
peizer also said milken ordered him to turn over a blue ledger 
book tallying possibly rigged trades between solomon and drexel 
peizer said the ledger was an accounting of how much money solomon 
owed the firm 
the witness said he handed the book to a drexel executive 
lorraine spurge in a kitchenette at the junk bond department after 
turning on a water faucet in case anyone was listening liman said 
spurge has denied peizer gave her the book 
everyone was running faucets at drexel after boeskys plea 
deal peizer said
