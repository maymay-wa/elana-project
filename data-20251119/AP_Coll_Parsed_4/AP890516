sri lankan and indian security forces 
are responsible for the disappearances of scores of opponents some 
of whom were tortured to death amnesty international said 
indian and sri lankan officials in colombo declined comment 
tuesday on the report dated may 1989 in new delhi indian foreign 
ministry officials said they were waiting to see a copy of the 
45page report before commenting 
in the report the londonbased human rights organization 
expresses concern about arbitrary arrests and detentions without 
charge or trial torture of suspected rebels deaths in custody and 
disappearances of suspects 
amnesty issued a similar report a year ago 
the report says 780 people have disappeared in sri lanka since 
emergency regulations were imposed in 1983 when militants from the 
tamil minority began fighting for a separate homeland eightythree 
of them vanished after india and sri lanka signed a 1987 peace 
agreement to end the insurgency it says 
amnesty international says both indian and sri lankan security 
forces deny knowledge of the arrests of those who disappeared in 
some cases it says security forces claim they released missing 
suspects 
several people have died in custody both in the north and the 
south amnesty international believes as a result of torture 
says the report 
indian soldiers were sent to northern and eastern sri lanka in 
july 1987 to enforce the peace accord but the biggest tamil rebel 
group the tamil tigers reneged and started attacking indian 
troopers 
the accord prompted a backlash among radicals in the sinhalese 
majority who began their own violent campaign primarily in the 
south where sri lankan forces operate 
according to amnesty international 49 of those who disappeared 
in the last two years were sinhalese militants taken into custody 
by sri lankan forces in the south in the same period indian 
troops in the north arranged the disappearances of 34 people the 
report says 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
militants claim they are discriminated against by the sinhalese 
majority more than 12500 people have died in the fighting mostly 
sinhalese civilians massacred by rebels 
this month the tamil tigers agreed to peace talks with the 
government

an opposition parliamentarian linked to the 
influencepeddling scandal that caused the downfall of prime 
minister noboru takeshita resigned on tuesday authorities summoned 
him for questioning on wednesday 
katsuya ikeda cited personal reasons for his resignation from 
parliament and from the komeito or clean government party the 
fourterm member of the house of representatives was the second 
opposition lawmaker to step down 
ikeda 51 and rep takao fujinami 56 a member of the 
governing liberal democratic party and a senior aide to former 
prime minister yasushiro nakasone arrived for questioning early 
wednesday at the tokyo district public prosecutors office 
they were the first elected officials to be questioned as 
suspects in the scandal which involves purchases of stock in the 
recruit co 
prosecutors are believed to have chosen questioning and not 
arrest due to legal difficulties involving the incarceration of a 
lawmaker particularly when parliament is in session the 
seriousness of the move is regarded as equivalent to arrest by 
japanese legal custom 
meanwhile komeito chairman junya yano told a news conference he 
was stepping down as party head to take responsibility for 
komeitos link to a series of scandals including recruit 
yano was the second opposition party leader to resign because of 
recruit saburo tsukamoto resigned as head of the democratic 
socialist party in february after it was revealed he profited from 
recruit share transactions 
prosecutors said they suspect ikeda and fujinami used their 
influence to the advantage of recruit and received bribes in the 
form of bargainpriced unlisted stocks 
ikeda has admitted his brother yuzuru bought 5000 shares in 
recruit and earned about 73530 in profit he denied his own link 
to the stock transaction but news reports said 51470 of the 
profit was deposited into ikedas bank account 
ikeda who also received 102940 in donations from recruit 
resigned from parliament to take responsibility for causing 
troubles for his buddhistaffiliated party the secondlargest 
opposition group after the socialists his resignation must be 
approved by the house speaker 
fujinami 56 has acknowledged his secretary eiji tokuda 
bought 12000 shares in recruit in october 1986 after a public 
listing about a month later share prices shot up quickly and 
tokuda netted 191000 in profit 
the liberal democrat has said the stock deal was tokudas 
business and denied personal involvement however news reports 
said fujinami used the profit to buy a luxury home in tokyo 
fujinami is also known to have received about 661000 in 
political donations from recruit 
fujinami who was nakasones top cabinet aide between 1984 and 
1987 is widely seen as holding a key to the link between recruit 
and nakasone critics say fujinamis testimony will determine 
whether further prosecution is possible for other senior 
politicians including nakasone 
on tuesday nakasone reportedly agreed to testify about his role 
in the scanda opposition parties have stalled parliamentary 
business to back demands that he testify 
nakasone who was prime minister at the time of the stock deals 
previously said he would testify in parliament only after 
prosecutors completed the recruit investigation 
this time in a meeting with ryutaro hashimoto the governing 
partys deputy secretary general nakasone did not set any 
conditions the kyodo news service said 
the recruit information conglomerate accused of trying to 
influence government policy sold such shares in a subsidiary to 
about 160 influential politicians bureaucrats and businessmen 
it also made large political contributions to politicians 
including takeshita who announced last month he would resign to 
take responsibility for the scandal 
the liberal democratic party still is searching for a candidate 
untainted by the scandal to succeed takeshita 
prosecutors have arrested 14 public officials and recruit 
executives on charges of bribery and securities law violations in 
the stock deals in addition three members of takeshitas cabinet 
have resigned because of links with recruit 
in november a member of the japan socialist party takumi ueda 
gave up his seat in parliament after news reports linked him with 
the scandal

the exxon valdez was on automatic pilot 
12 minutes before the tanker crashed into a reef and spilled oil 
the vessels third mate told federal investigators tuesday 
gregory t cousins who was in command of the 987foot tanker 
when it ran aground on march 24 testified that he took a bearing 
and a few minutes later tried to change the ships course back 
toward its designated shipping lane 
cousins said that when he determined the ships course had not 
changed significantly he attempted a sharper turn but the ship 
seemed to continue moving toward the charted reef 
its a source of trouble for me as to why the vessel did not 
track away from that track line cousins told a national 
transportation safety board panel as it began a fiveday hearing 
the exxon valdez leaked 109 million gallons of oil into 
wildliferich prince william sound polluting hundreds of miles of 
shoreline and killing countless birds fish and marine mammals in 
the nations worst oil spill 
the panel is trying to determine why the tanker strayed far from 
the shipping lane on a clear night whether capt joseph hazelwood 
was drunk and why cousins who was not certified to operate the 
vessel in those waters was in command 
the third mate said hazelwood left the bridge to send out 
messages after ordering the ship out of designated lanes to avoid 
floating ice cousins testified that hazelwood did not appear 
intoxicated hazelwood failed sobriety tests administered about 
nine hours after the crash 
four other exxon shipping co employees who testified tuesday 
agreed that hazelwood did not appear intoxicated that night 
however william e murphy an independent pilot who helped 
guide the exxon valdez through part of the sound said he smelled 
alcohol on hazelwoods breath murphy added that the captain did 
not act intoxiciated 
cousins said he could not explain why the vessel was on 
automatic pilot exxon policy limits use of the device to open 
waters 
cousins said that after trying to return the ship to a traffic 
lane he called hazelwood and told him it looked like we might 
get into the leading edge of the ice 
under questioning by coast guard commander darryle waldron of 
juneau cousins said there was never any discussion about reducing 
the ships speed operating at a slower speed would have made the 
ship harder to move through the sound cousins said the exxon 
valdez was traveling between half and full speed at the time of the 
accident 
the panel will question more than two dozen witnesses including 
coast guard personnel and exxon executives and try to determine 
whether the coast guard the oil industry and the state reacted as 
promptly as possible to the spill 
cousins said that just before the collision he told hazelwood 
i think were in serious trouble then the exxon valdez hit the 
reef cousins said it felt like a slight roll a very unusual 
sensation i knew we hit something 
several seconds passed and we experienced a series of jolts to 
the vessel by the time we came to a full stop id estimate we 
felt a series of six jolts cousins recalled 
there seemed to be a hesitation and i spun the wheel hard 
left by that time i believe we were hard aground 
cousins said he shined a light on the water but could not see 
oil because it was too dark but he said he could smell oil 
hazelwood came on the bridge ordered crew members to assess the 
damage then tried to rock the exxon valdez free without success 
cousins said hazelwood informed the coast guard of the grounding 
within 10 to 15 minutes cousins said 
cousins who was questioned by lead investigator william woody 
answered questions about his work history educational background 
and technical subjects the third mate was accompanied by a lawyer 
hazelwood will not testify in order to protect his rights in his 
upcoming criminal trial 
the panel of inquiry includes representatives from the state 
exxon the coast guard and alyeska pipeline service co a 
consortium of oil companies that runs the 800mile alaskan pipeline 
the public hearings were scheduled to run through saturday in a 
hotel ballroom 
the boards report on the cause of the accident will take up to 
a year to complete said ntsb spokeswoman drucella andersen 
the fired captain who is free on 50000 bail has been charged 
with operating a vessel while drunk and goes on trial june 20 he 
faces two years three months in jail and 11000 in fines if 
convicted

space shuttle atlantis is finally 
back at its launch site after a weatherinterrupted 2day odyssey 
across the south atop a nasa boeing 747 jetliner 
the jumbo jet landed here shortly before dark monday evening 
after making two unscheduled stops in texas and one in georgia on a 
trip from california that normally takes only a few hours 
atlantis and its five astronauts landed at edwards air force 
base calif on may 8 at the end of a fourday space mission that 
dispatched the magellan spacecraft on a 15month journey to venus 
to map the planet 
bolted atop the 747 the space shuttle left edwards on saturday 
but storms over central texas forced the 747 to stop at biggs army 
air field near el paso it sat on the ground there saturday and 
sunday nights waiting for the weather to clear 
the jet took off monday morning and landed at dallasfort worth 
international airport waiting for a few hours while forecasters 
assessed the weather between texas and florida 
with a threat of thunderstorms in central florida nasa decided 
to fly the 747 into warner robbins air force base near macon ga 
and again look at the weather 
officials had just about decided to stay overnight in georgia 
and complete the trip today when the florida clouds started to 
clear 
nasa sent a t38 jet out to survey the flight path and when the 
pilot gave the allclear the 747 took off on the final hourlong 
flight leg 
the darkening sky was clear here when the big jet and its 12 
billion shuttle passenger landed at 809 pm on a 15000foot 
runway just three miles from the launch pad where atlantis blasted 
into space on may 4 
the delayed trip could make the national aeronautics and space 
administration think about hastening the day when shuttles will end 
their space trips on the runway here all landings have been in 
california since a shuttle blew a tire here in april 1985 
officials have said they will continue to return orbiting shuttles 
to wideopen and safer edwards until new brake and steering systems 
have been throughly tested 
atlantis now will be readied for another planetary mission to 
propel the galileo spacecraft toward jupiter in october

european unity a subject that traditionally 
leaves the british cold is suddenly a hot issue 
the reason is a sustained attack by prime minister margaret 
thatcher on the unity concept and a ferocious counterblast from 
her predecessor edward heath 
the longterm source of the discord is 1992 when the 12 nations 
of the european economic community are to drop their tariff 
barriers and become a single trading bloc with complete freedom of 
movement for people and goods 
but where britain tends to see 1992 as an economic advance and 
little more most continental europeans see it as a major step 
toward political unity 
of more immediate import is next months european parliament 
election usually the british voter turnout at under 32 percent 
is by far the lowest in the eec but the heaththatcher conflict 
has injected excitement into this years election because it 
signals a split in the tory party as it vies for britains 81 seats 
in the 518seat parliament 
the times of london called it an astonishing public outbreak 
of internal discord 
for months mrs thatcher has been attacking the eecs vision of 
unity saying it means a superstate of faceless bureaucrats in 
brussels throwing all sorts of socialisttinged obstacles in the 
path of her freemarket revolution 
this in turn leads many continentals to call the british 
reluctant europeans an island race more loyal to the united 
states than europe a nation of shopkeepers who are only in the eec 
for the money 
mrs thatcher first raised the superstate specter at a 
speech in september and she returned to the theme friday in a 
speech to her conservative party saying she wanted our kind of 
europe not a socialist superstate in brussels which submerges our 
identity and snuffs out our sovereignty but a free europe 
this was too much for heath who took britain into the eec in 
1973 and has since been its ardent defender 
in a bbctv interview sunday heath called mrs thatchers views 
absolute nonsense misleading and aimed at turning the public 
against the eec 
he derided mrs thatchers claim that the eec was topheavy with 
bureaucrats saying it had 9200 employees administering 320 
million people compared with 11800 civil servants in scotland 
governing 55 million people 
he said there was no reason to fear a socialist eec when so many 
eec governments were nonsocialist and reminded mrs thatcher that 
she had signed the single european act which makes 1992 possible 
and broadly lays out the european future she is now so determined 
to resist 
mrs thatcher worries the eec wants to go beyond pure trading 
issues and set social standards like a paneuropean minimum wage 
worker participation in industrial management and harmonized 
welfare systems 
she calls this socialism through the back door at a time 
when she is cutting back trade union power and trying to trim 
welfare spending 
she also is hostile to eec proposals for monetary union and a 
european central bank fearing it will undermine her freedom to 
make economic policy 
some critics say heaths attacks on mrs thatcher stem from his 
resentment toward her for unseating him as conservative party 
leader in 1975 
tory lawmaker john carlisle said heath 72 should be put out 
to grass and not bother the nation any more 
but other tories worry that mrs thatchers combative stance 
will alienate the eec former defense secretary michael heseltine 
fears if britain stands aloof france and west germany will 
dominate the bloc every hostile speech breeds at best despair 
at worst contempt he wrote in a book published tuesday 
on monday mrs thatcher made no direct comment on heath but 
managed a subtle dig at the continentals by reminding them that 
they owed their liberation from nazi tyranny to britain and the 
united states 
europe she said would not have been liberated unless we 
stood and unless america joined us britain had fought to free 
europe of nazism she said and now it was fighting to keep it free 
of a bureaucracy of standardization and harmonization

their basketball team was trounced in 
nearly every outing and the schools firstever rock groups were 
dubbed the gentlemen callers and the outnumbered 
the first men to break the gender barrier at wheaton college 
thats 82 men on a campus of 1150 students say its been a 
turbulent year but theyll be back 
it was awkward at first walking into a class of say 40 
women you feel like a minority but by the end of the semester 
everyone was talking openly said jonathan hart a greenwich 
conn firstyear student and member of the outnumbered 
it was really a great experience to hear an opposite view that 
sort of has been hidden traditionally by society said hart 
this school has gone beyond what i expected said firstyear 
student mark sweet 
hart and sweet said the malefemale ratio didnt translate into 
the dating frenzy imagined by some of their high school friends 
the first thing anybody says is oh wow i hear the ratio is 
20to1 hart said although he is dating a wheaton woman hart 
said he and his male friends didnt pay the 17000plus annual 
tuition for a better social life 
the schools january 1987 decision to break with a 154year 
tradition and admit men outraged some alumnae and seniors who felt 
the school was abandoning its commitment to womens education in a 
settlement wheaton returned 127000 to 56 donors who wanted their 
money back 
still said sue alexander dean of students the overall 
response was encouraging while enrollment at other womens 
colleges is slipping applications rose 54 percent and annual 
giving climbed 18 percent 
about 400 men have applied for next years freshman class 
senior maura whelan who had reservations about the change said 
she now is pleased i think wheaton is now committed not to 
tradition in the traditional sense but to collaboration she 
said 
i think theyve just given a new perspective and theyve added 
a lot of excitement to the campus said firstyear student paula 
rea of danbury conn 
few physical changes were needed at the picturesque rural 
campus alexander said 
we did have to get longer beds she said we had two rock 
bands that emerged in the first semester and we never before had 
quite such stresses placed on our quiet space in dormitories 
and the men tended to spend more time outdoors playing frisbee 
or tossing footballs she said 
wheaton prides itself on academics rather than athletics and 
the 37 showing of the mens basketball team playing against 
bigger and older men at coed schools didnt seem to make any 
difference alexander said 
but she recalled one game at which wheaton women turned out in 
force deafening the opposition with their cheers 
another problem was news media attention to the transition 
students said 
they always seemed to catch women gawking at men said 
junior heather van holland of weston 
hart and sweet said they intend to graduate from wheaton and 
know of few men who wont be returning here i can hear both 
sides of the story hart said

israels 20point peace plan contains huge 
stumbling blocks to arab acceptance ranging from its omission of 
syria to relying on jordan as the key to an arabisraeli settlement 
the plan approved sunday by a 206 vote of the israeli cabinet 
centers on elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
where the palestinians have been engaged in a bloody uprising for 
17 months 
but it offers only half a loaf to the 17 million palestinians 
living in the territories limited selfrule not the independent 
state they and the arabs demand 
the plan also rules out talks with the palestine liberation 
organization and treats the proposed elections as a way of 
bypassing the plo and the estimated 3 million palestinians living 
outside the occupied lands 
many arabs have expressed interest in the proposed elections 
but most palestinians insist an israeli withdrawal must precede any 
balloting 
perhaps one of the biggest problem the israelis face in gaining 
arab acceptance is the omission of any reference to syria 
repeating the fatal flaw of americas 1982 plan to resolve the 
civil war in lebanon 
there is an arab saying you cant make war without egypt or 
peace without syria 
syria has a strong military force on israels border and 
extensive influence among radical palestinian groups it would 
never tolerate any plan that fails to address israels occupation 
of the golan heights 
the israelis captured the heights from syria in the 1967 war 
when they also overran the west bank and gaza strip and seized arab 
east jerusalem 
syrias influence among hardline palestinians will grow if the 
israeli plan gains momentum increasing its opportunities to fuel 
unrest among palestinians in the west bank and gaza and to punish 
any arabs who seem ready to accept the israeli offering 
the plan also ignores lebanon and the palestinian refugees there 
most arab leaders see israels occupation of a border strip in 
south lebanon as a major factor in that countrys civil war many 
believe israel intends to annex the occupied strip in order to 
seize water resources there 
a plan that fails to address that issue bodes continued conflict 
between israeli and syrian proxies in lebanon and a de facto 
partition of the country something few if any arab states would 
accept 
by calling for a peace treaty with jordan the plan violates the 
arab gospel that no arab state can make a separate settlement with 
israel that ignores the rights of other arab parties a rule that 
has helped keep jordan from making peace with israel for decades 
jordan seems less inclined than ever to take such a step 
the palestinian uprising led king hussein to renounce 
sovereignty over the west bank last year in favor of the plo with 
which he has since closely cooperated 
rioting over economic difficulties that swept jordan last month 
have turned the countrys concerns inward an unpopular settlement 
with israel would aggravate husseins problems by arousing the 
palestinian half of his population 
the plans reference to an additional palestinian state in 
the occupied lands hints at the hardline israeli position that a 
palestinian state already exists in jordan a stand that chills 
the blood of jordanian officials and their bedrock bedouin 
supporters 
the plo which has won worldwide support as the voice of 
palestinians would accept elections only if israel were to 
guarantee it a role in governing the occupied lands 
the israeli plan expresses opposition to any palestinian state 
although it says all the proposed options for the territories 
can be discussed after a 3year period of selfrule 
there is also no guarantee of full israeli withdrawal from the 
territories and no word on the status of jerusalem 
arabs see jerusalem as the most crucial piece of occupied 
territory and the plo has declared that the holy city will be the 
capital of the independent state it has proclaimed in an area 
roughly encompassing the occupied lands 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs plan also fails to address us 
and arab calls for international supervision of the elections and 
the participation of the 140000 arabs in east jerusalem 
for palestinians outside the occupied lands the plan appears to 
offer them nothing more than permanent refugee status and no say in 
any peace talks 
their opposition would make it extremely difficult for lebanon 
syria jordan kuwait or saudi arabia all of which host sizable 
palestinian populations to accept the israeli plan 
it would also create a large pool of desperate people witnessing 
the loss of their dream of returning home fertile territory for

mexico announced a sweeping liberalization of 
its rules on foreign investment monday in hopes of attracting badly 
needed capital to its debtcrippled economy 
the new rules will open areas previously closed to outsiders and 
raise the amount of foreign ownership permitted in others in some 
key areas such as tourism mexico will for the first time allow 
100 percent foreign ownership 
under mexicos 1973 foreign investment law foreign ownership 
has been limited to 49 percent in most industries 
the announcement came as negotiations on restructing the 1074 
billion foreign debt were to resume in new york mexicos pledge to 
modernize its protectionist economy are a crucial feature of the 
debt talks 
no country can modernize without attracting fresh 
investment commerce secretary jaime serra puche told a news 
conference the tendency in the world is moving toward 
interdependence 
the new regulations which take effect immediately open up 
previously closed areas such as telecommunications auto parts 
fishing and secondary petrochemicals to 49 percent foreign 
ownership 
in tourism a critical item on president carlos salinas de 
gortaris economic development agenda the 49 percent limit is 
being abolished outsiders will now be allowed 100 percent 
ownership 
the new rules will double to 60 years foreign leases on 
oceanfront property serra puche said foreign ownership of coastal 
real estate is prohibited by the mexican constitution 
serra puche declared it historic that investors will now be 
able to remit 100 percent of profits 
many areas deemed strategic such as banking petroleum mineral 
exploration electrical generation and broadcasting will remain 
offlimits to foreigners puche said 
mexicans are sensitive to even the suggestion of foreign 
ownership in the nations principal industries such as petroleum 
primary petrochemical production will remain offlimits while 
secondary production of byproducts such as polyester and nylon 
will open to foreign participation 
serra puche said the liberalization is aimed at generating 
employment and modernizing the mexican economy he also said the 
government plans to simplifying paperwork for investors 
the new law eliminates discretionary decisions with clear 
regulations as to the criteria for accepting new foreign 
investment he said it will bring a high degree of automatic 
acceptance in the decisions about foreign investment 
the new rules will consolidate regulations pertaining to the 
border maquiladora industry serra puche said but not change them 
under the maquiladora program foreignmade parts are imported 
dutyfree to mexico for final assembly when the finished product 
is exported to the united states for sale the united states taxes 
only the labor or the value added in mexico 
serra puche said the new regulations will steer foreign 
investment away from the overcrowded polluted industrial areas of 
mexico city monterrey and guadalajara 
the mexican economy has been battered by the debt and low oil 
prices to the point of near zerogrowth mexican officials say 
foreign capital is essential to stimulating growth 
the commerce department said that foreign investment totalled 
31 billion last year 
the new investment regulations follow other economic reforms 
such as a wage and price control program that cut inflation from a 
record 159 percent in 1987 to 517 percent last year joining the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade stimulation of 
nonpetroleum exports and the privatization or closure of some 
stateowned business and industries

chinese and soviet reformers led the movement in their countries 
that brought about the momentous declaration tuesday that the big 
communist powers agreed to normalize relations 
they had been feuding for 30 years over border and ideological 
disputes but the mistrust was rooted in centuries 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and chinas senior leader 
deng xiaoping used their beijing summit to declare a new beginning 
strained relations deteriorated further following the beijing 
summit in 1959 when nikita s khrushchev and mao tsetung both took 
hard lines 
years later khrushchev wrote in his memoirs you might say 
that china is both close to us and far from us its close in that 
its our nextdoor neighbor and shares a long border with our 
country at the same time china is far away in that the chinese 
have little in common with our people 
when the chinese communists defeated the nationalists in 1949 
there was apprehension in the west that china the worlds most 
populous nation would unite with the soviet union the strongest 
communist power and threaten the free world 
but the romance was brief in 1972 the united states and china 
began normalizing relations leaving the soviets in a backwash of 
hostility 
chinesesoviet mistrust dates to at least the 13th century when 
mongol forces invaded russia destroying towns slaughtering most 
residents and enslaving the suravivors 
soviet children still are taught of the brutality and of the 
victory of ivan the great who threw off the mongol yoke and 
established the russian state in 1480 
more recently suspicion was planted in the infancy of the 
international communist movement 
in 1927 a decade after the bolshevik revolution chiang 
kaishek began a purge of chinese communists with whom he 
ostensibly had been allied 
soviet dictator josef stalin remained silent apparently 
unwilling to alienate chiang and during world war ii the soviets 
aided chiangs nationalists fighting japan 
but when chiang and his nationalists fled to taiwan in 1949 the 
soviet union was first to recognize chinas new communist 
government 
mao traveled to moscow but spent much of the 10 weeks he was 
there impatiently waiting to see stalin they signed a 30year 
treaty of friendship 
the soviets wanted access to chinese resources but mao resisted 
mindful of the unequal treaties and trade concessions extracted by 
the english portuguese and others 
in 1954 khrushchev invited china to send a million laborers to 
siberia to help exploit the esources but when mao accepted the 
soviets became convinced he was trying to take over the siberian 
economy and absorb the vast sparsely populated territory 
in short they wanted to make siberia chinese rather than 
russian khrushchev wrote it was a clever maneuver but it 
didnt work 
the kremlin quickly ended the labor program 
relations were further exacerbated by khrushchevs denunciation 
of stalin who died in 1953 at a soviet party congress in 1956 
mao initially joined in criticizing stalin but then reversed 
his stand and began praising him according to khrhshchev 
i think that secretly he mao disapproved all along of our 
censuring stalin for his crimes khrushchev wrote why do i 
think so because i believe mao suffered from the same megalomania 
stalin had all his life he had the same diseased outlook on other 
people 
mistrust turned to animosity when the soviets reneged on an 
agreement to provide china with nuclearweapons technology 
khrushchev claimed mao was eager to use the bomb on his enemies 
despite the icy relations khrushchev made a secret trip to 
beijing in hopes of persuading mao to let the soviet navy build a 
communications base and refueling facilities on chinese territory 
mao resisted 
at the last summit in september 1959 in beijing the warmth 
had gone out of our relations with china and it had been replaced 
by a chill that i could sense as soon as i arrived khrushchev 
recalled 
soviet advisers and engineers assigned to projects in china 
became the target of antisoviet feelings and in the summer of 1960 
the kremlin withdrew all technical personnel leaving hundreds of 
projects unfinished 
maos rejection of what he considered soviet revisionism brought 
chinas 196676 cultural revolution intended to purify chinese 
communism that widened the gulf and soviet and chinese troops 
fought several border skirmishes in 1969 
as recently as 1979 the year the united states and china 
restored relations there was talk of war long the frontier 
soviet author victor louis predicted chinas ethnic minorities 
would rise up and seek unity with their cousins in prosoviet 
mongolia and soviet central asia 
louis widely believed to have ties to the kgb secret police 
said fighting could start at any moment and hundreds of thousands 
of soviet volunteers would rush to aid the oppressed minorities

a navajo tribal judge ruled monday 
that the tribal council acted within its authority in placing 
chairman peter macdonald and vice chairman johnny thompson on 
administrative leave 
the action was unprecedented in navajo law the 200000member 
tribe which has operated since the 1920s under a tribal code but 
without a written constitution never had tried to oust its chief 
executive 
the longawaited 50page ruling by district judge robert yazzie 
enjoins macdonald and thompson from attempting to assert official 
authority which has been declared withdrawn 
the councils 4913 vote against macdonald on feb 17 stemmed 
from us senate subcommittee testimony linking macdonald to 
kickbacks from contractors and personal profit from a 334 million 
tribal land purchase 
macdonald has denied any wrongdoing he has not been charged 
although a federal grand jury in phoenix is looking into 
allegations raised in the hearings 
the council placed thompson on leave march 10 
macdonald attorney thomas j hynes of farmington nm declined 
to comment on the ruling and said he wasnt sure if there would be 
an appeal to the tribes supreme court 
that would be up to the chairman he said 
neither macdonald nor thompson could not be reached for comment

the bush administration is mixing praise for 
mikhail s gorbachevs efforts to revamp soviet economics and 
politics with skepticism about the soviet leaders proposals to 
reduce nuclear weapons in europe 
what is going on in the soviet union is truly revolutionary 
when you consider the economic and political system they have had 
for the last 70 years secretary of state james a baker iii said 
monday 
just back from moscow and a 3hour meeting with gorbachev the 
us official said he favored normal trade with the soviet union 
which is now restricted by the 1974 jacksonvanik amendment and 
gave a positive appraisal of perestroika the economic 
restructuring gorbachev outlined at length in their meeting 
its light years away from where they were a few years ago 
baker said its important to recognize that what is going on is 
real 
talking to a group of constituents of sen christopher dodd 
dconn he said the soviets are unilaterally reducing their 
military forces as urged by the united states 
theyre saying that their economic and political system has 
failed baker said theyre having elections theyre trying to 
open up politically and economically clearly they are coming in 
our direction and we ought to welcome that 
in fact baker told the connecticut group they are singing 
out of our own hymn book 
but he also said the united states should not let its guard 
down and he described gorbachevs decision to withdraw 500 
shortrange nuclear missiles bombs and artillery shells from 
eastern europe as a very small step 
at the same time a state department spokesman denounced a 
statement by soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze that 
the soviets might retain 200 nuclear missiles banned in a 1987 
treaty with the united states if nato proceeds with a program to 
upgrade its shortrange missiles 
spokesman richard boucher said we think shevardnadzes 
remarks are an outlandish statement one day the soviets announce 
small unilateral reductions the next day they are talking about 
breaking a recently concluded treaty 
shevardnadze on a visit to bonn west germany last saturday 
said the soviets might retain their ss23s which have a range of 
310 miles just within the range of banned missiles or develop a 
new shortrange nuclear missile if nato more than triples the range 
of its lance missiles 
the program which west germany and several other nato allies 
are trying to delay would extend the range of the lance to about 
250 miles there are 88 lance launchers most of them in west 
germany with about 700 singlewarhead missiles 
boucher said the ss23s undoubtedly were covered by the 1987 inf 
treaty and shortrange missiles were not covered he said a look 
at the text would confirm the us position 
we find it especially ironic that the soviets threaten to 
break the inf treaty in an effort to pressure the west on 
shortrange systems which they have just finished modernizing and 
where they hold at least a 121 advantage over the west the 
spokesman said

the indian health service is allegedly taking 
money intended to help indians fight alcohol abuse and using it for 
staff conferences a senate panel has been told 
the incident is one among many in an agency that is understaffed 
and poorly managed witnesses told the special subcommittee looking 
at the way federal agencies and private businesses deal with 
indians 
larry morey deputy inspector general of the department of 
health and human services told the panel monday his office is 
investigating the ihs handling of 70000 that was earmarked for 
alcohol abuse programs 
instead morey testified the money was spent to send top 
officials of the ihs office in albuquerque nm to a retreat 
ken ballen chief counsel for the committee said panel 
investigators discovered the group went to a resort near santa fe 
nm and engaged in activities such as massage therapy 
dr everett rhoades ihs director later defended the use of the 
money telling reporters the event was a staff training program 
in order for the staff to help indians change their behavior 
toward alcohol they had to change how they regard themselves he 
said 
we have to be a proponent of wellness he said it is 
crucial to train them the staff how to be leaders to modify 
community behavior 
dr bruce nicholson former clinical director for ihs in pine 
ridge sd accused the ihs of misusing funds 
in my experience they were spending money on conferences and 
air travel when we were desperately asking for more nurse midwives 
and obgyn services to combat infant mortality rates of 30 to 40 
percent per 1000 live births he said 
he called ihs bureaucracy that has gotten out of control 
sen dennis deconcini dariz chairman of the senate select 
committee on indian affairs said ihs officials wont be questioned 
until the special investigating subcommittee has had time to study 
documents that were finally provided by the ihs 
the agency sent the documents to the panel friday deconcini 
said even though the papers had been requested march 2 
it was not until friday evening may 12 at 620 pm less 
than 72 hours before this hearing that the agency provided us with 
any of the documents we requested deconcini said 
he said that did not give the committee time to prepare 
questions 
we will not allow ihs to alter or compromise the quality and 
integrity of our investigative practices deconcini said 
rhoades agreed that the ihs should have been more forthcoming 
but said the amount of work involved in meeting the committees 
requests was astronomical 
he said the committees march 2 letter requesting documentation 
never came to my attention 
when he found out about the request he said he ordered that 
the subcommitee be provided all the information it wanted 
the material was out in the field rhoades said it took 
time to gather 
rhoades said his agency has always been cooperative and he 
directed his subordinates to be open with the committee as soon as 
he heard an investigation was underway 
deconcini said none of the other eight government agencies being 
investigated by his special committee has been as difficult as the 
ihs 
unlike every other federal agency we have examined the indian 
health service has been singularly uncooperative with our 
committees investigation he said 
sen thomas daschle dsd called it stonewalling

the nations prison inmates again find 
themselves in a legal position they have faced often in the 1980s 
losers in a supreme court decision 
the court continuing to limit rights behind bars gave prison 
officials broad power monday to decide what inmates may read and 
who may visit them 
in a pair of 63 rulings the court made it easier for officials 
to censor inmate reading materials and said inmates generally do 
not have to be told why they are prohibited from having visitors 
the court upheld the power of wardens to ban any publication at 
federal prisons the wardens believe is detrimental to the 
security good order or discipline of the institution or might 
facilitate criminal activity 
the justices ordered further hearings to determine whether 
inmates should be allowed to read any of 46 publications federal 
officials want to ban 
among the publications on the list for example was an issue of 
the call a leftwing newspaper that included an article charging 
inhumane treatment by racist guards in federal prisons 
government lawyers had told the justices that between sept 1 
1986 and aug 31 1987 some 1700 publications were withheld out 
of 18 million sent to federal inmates 
in the prison visits case kentucky officials had argued that 
regulations covering aspects of prison life from job assignments to 
telephone privileges could be jeopardized by giving inmates a 
dueprocess right to an explanation each time they are denied some 
privilege 
justice harry a blackmun wrote for the court in both rulings 
against the inmates justices thurgood marshall william j brennan 
and john paul stevens dissented in each one 
in both cases the court reversed rulings that had favored the 
inmates a result not uncommon during the past decade 
in a key 1984 ruling the court said inmates have absolutely no 
right of privacy the justices said inmates cannot depend on the 
constitution to protect them from allegedly unreasonable or even 
malicious searches of their cells and seizure of their property 
by prison guards 
in 1981 the court ruled it is not automatically 
unconstitutional to house two inmates in a cell designed for one 
a 1983 ruling allowed prison officials to put inmates in 
solitary confinement indefinitely after only an informal hearing 
even in states that have special laws to protect prisoners rights 
the court that year also ruled that state officials may transfer 
inmates to another state at their own discretion even if it means 
the inmates will be thousands of miles from home 
in 1985 the court ruled that officials do not immediately have 
to supply reasons when they bar inmates from calling witnesses at 
disciplinary hearings 
and in 1987 the court upheld a rule that prohibits 
correspondence between inmates in different prisons 
in other matters monday the court 
reinstated a charlotte nc mans lawsuit against five city 
police officers by ruling unanimously that people who sue over 
alleged police brutality must prove only that the officers acted 
unreasonably not maliciously and sadistically 
ruled unanimously in a case from new york city that civil fines 
heaped on top of criminal penalties sometimes amount to 
unconstitutional double jeopardy multiple punishment for the same 
crime 
agreed to decide in a pennsylvania case whether the bush 
administration may have to start giving supplemental security 
income benefits to potentially more than 250000 disabled 
children 
turned down the appeal of an oklahoma couple sentenced to two 
years in prison for their ill childs death because they relied on 
prayer and divine intervention rather than seek medical care 
let stand a massachusetts courts ruling that the public has no 
constitutional right of access to a court document sealed by a 
judge during a muchpublicized murder prosecution 
ruled by a 54 vote in a texas case that investors who allege 
they have been defrauded by their brokers must submit the dispute

the navy says it will continue to use 
chemicals that deplete the earths ozone layer despite americas 
role as a leader in the effort to protect the globes atmosphere 
the substances are crucial to navy vessels and airplanes and it 
will take two or three decades to replace them the service said 
monday 
forcing the navy to use other chemicals in the near future might 
hurt the services mission of national defense navy officials said 
in written testimony to a house energy and commerce 
subcommittee the navy said it uses four chlorofluorocarbons 
cfcs as refrigerants and cleaning agents and two related 
chemicals as firefighting agents 
these chemicals allow us to cool protect and clean vital 
electronics and weapons systems the navy told rep john d 
dingell chairman of the panels investigations subcommittee we 
cannot overemphasize the importance of these chemicals to our 
mission performance 
given the current absence of acceptable substitutes and the 
long lead times needed to change major shipboard systems we do not 
foresee complete elimination of these chemicals on navy ships for 
20 to 30years 
ozonedepleters are chemicals which are nontoxic when released 
into the atmosphere but which break apart into other chemical 
substances 10 to 100 years later as they slowly build up and rise 
15 to 20 miles into the stratosphere 
scientists say their chlorine atoms destroy ozone allowing more 
of the suns ultraviolet rays to reach earth causing more skin 
cancer and eye cataracts and suppressing human immune systems 
dingells panel heard testimony from bush administration 
witnesses to assess progress of the montreal protocol an 
international agreement that commits the united states and other 
signers to a 50 percent reduction in production and consumption of 
ozonedepleting chemicals by 1998 
president bush has said the united states prefers to negotiate 
with signatory countries for a total phaseout by the end of the 
century if safe alternatives are available 
an environmental protection agency official testified that the 
administration will strictly police industry testing of cfc 
substitutes to make sure proposed replacements are safe the 
position was a major policy change 
william rosenberg assistant administrator of air and radiation 
said epa will now require chemical firms to report results of 
health and safety tests of the substitutes and would not hesitate 
to order more tests if they are warranted 
dingell said he was worried the epa was rushing to approve 
alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons without ensuring their safety 
two months ago the general accounting office sharply rebuked 
epa saying the agency was relying too much on voluntary 
cooperation by the chemical industry to provide epa with test 
results on proposed substitutes 
it is a bit of shift said epa spokesman chris rice of 
rosenbergers statement it means were taking the affirmative 
step of requiring firms to report data on toxicity of cfc 
substitutes 
an epa source speaking only on condition he not be named said 
we were taking lot of grief we didnt think the grief was 
justified and were taking the path of least resistance

an isolation researcher thinks she has two 
months to go in her underground hideaway when in fact its only a 
matter of weeks that shell see her first daylight since 
midjanuary 
stefania follini a 27yearold interior decorator from italy 
has been in a tworoom 200squarefoot plexiglas house under the 
hills west of carlsbad since jan 13 without sunlight or other 
ways of measuring time 
the only sounds she hears are those of her own voice her 
guitar or an occasional buzzer sounded by researchers in a 
computerequipped trailer on the surface 50 feet above her 
the buzzer is just to get her attention said rita 
fraschini interpreter and spokeswoman for italian researchers who 
are sponsoring the experiment along with various us universities 
and the national aeronautics and space administration 
for about four months the computer terminals have been ms 
follinis only mode of communication as she simulates what it might 
be like for space travelers isolated for extended periods 
a team of researchers monitor her with three video cameras and 
microphones and they type in occasional messages to her computer 
they also track her temperature heart rate and blood pressure 
and test her blood composition for any hormonal and other chemical 
changes ms follini sends up samples daily by means of a cannister 
on a string 
questioned may 4 ms follini said she thought it was march 7 
however at the request of the associated press researcher andrea 
galvagno asked ms follini to guess how far off her estimate was 
she was not told the ap was asking or that anybody else was in the 
trailer 
she guessed she might be two weeks off 
asked if she meant march 21 she replied in italian on her 
keyboard about but ill celebrate spring a little later 
galvagno said ms follini will come out of the cave may 23 but 
will not be told until the afternoon of may 22 
ms follini wasnt able to keep track of the time by her 
menstrual cycle because it stopped after she went underground 
galvagno said 
galvagno and lead researcher maurizio montalbini have maintained 
a careful record of her sleeping patterns for the four months for 
april 2829 for example she was awake 25 hours and slept 12 
april 2930 she spent 25 hours awake and four asleep may 1 she was 
up 11 hours then slept 4 and may 2 she was up 17 and slept 
seven 
ms follini also has lost about 20 pounds she passes her time 
reading strumming humming writing messages on the computer and 
playing chess with herself 
for the first few months ms follini was kind of grouchy 
but in the last month she has become accustomed to her situation 
and is concentrating better ms fraschini said 
also she said ms follini spent more time exploring the cave 
outside the enclosure in the early going but seldom heads out any 
more except to deliver her blood samples 
ms follini said she doesnt think there would be much 
difference between being isolated in space and being confined in a 
cave 
she said it might be impossible to rescue her from space but if 
the cave collapsed it would be hard to save her here as well 
still she said there is some comfort knowing her colleagues 
are just 50 feet above 
i prefer to have my feet on the dear old earth or under 
it she said

federal reserve policy makers are likely to 
adopt a waitandsee attitude toward further interest rate hikes as 
they scrutinize the economy for signs inflation has abated 
economists say 
signs of slower economic growth abounded as members of the 
federal open market committee gathered for a closeddoor meeting 
today to set interest rate and monetary policy through june 
but many analysts said it remains unclear whether the slowdown 
has been sufficient to curb accelerating price increases and most 
said they expected the central bank to leave credit policies 
unchanged 
the 12member committee composed of federal reserve board 
members and regional fed bank presidents meets in secret eight 
times a year the decisions made at todays meeting wont be 
revealed until early july 
this will be a time when they can sit back and relax a bit and 
wait for further evidence predicted former fed member lyle 
gramley now chief economist at the mortgage bankers association of 
america they ought to be breathing a bit of a sigh of relief 
the fed has been walking a tightrope since march 1988 as it 
engineered a rise in shortterm interest rates of about 3 
percentage points 
its aim has been to cool the economy just enough to prevent 
inflation from spiraling out of control but not so much as to 
topple the country into a recession 
finally after months of increasingly tighter money it looks 
like the fed is getting what it wants slower but continued growth 
coupled with moderating price increases 
in april retail sales rose a lessthanexpected 04 percent 
the unemployment rate ticked up to 53 percent and industrial 
production rebounded only moderately from two weak months 
wholesaleprice inflation excluding a large spurt in gasoline 
prices actually dropped that report friday sent a wave of 
euphoria through financial markets and pushed stocks to a 
postcrash high 
however it was only a few months ago in january and february 
that wholesale prices showed backtoback surges of 1 percent 
and economists said the fed isnt likely to declare victory over 
inflation just yet 
you cant afford to jump to conclusions on one months 
report gramley said inflation is like a glacier once it gets 
started its awfully hard to stop 
there are signs wage inflation is starting to heat up 
agreed economist david wyss of data resources inc a lexington 
mass forecasting firm 
average hourly wages shot up 07 percent in april also 
bethlehem steel corp workers won an immediate 8 percent wage hike 
earlier this month and los angeles teachers are seeking a 21 
percent raise over two years 
if that sort of thing becomes common the fed is going to have 
to hit the brakes hard and thats almost certainly going to turn 
into a recession wyss said 
but economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer predicted fed officials would ever 
so subtly ease back a bit 
i think the way that they will do it is to go to a neutral 
stance meaning they will be just as willing to ease or tighten in 
previous meetings they have always been balanced toward restraint 
thats a subtle shift but it will be an important one jones 
said 
william c dunkelberg dean of the temple university business 
school said unchanged policy would permit interest rates which 
have edged down a bit over the last month to drift a little 
further if the market sees additional signs of slower growth or 
moderating price hikes 
if in fact the economy really is slowing down some that 
should reduce the demand for credit and that should put downward 
pressure on interest rates without fed action dunkelberg said 
one analyst economist paul w boltz of t rowe price associates 
in baltimore said the fed fearing that the sluggishness it 
induced could get out of hand may even lean explicitly toward 
easier money 
i think from their perspective a recession would be a 
calamity it would stop the process of reducing the budget 
deficit it would greatly exacerbate the sampl problem by causing 
widespread bankruptcies and it would create problems with third 
world debt boltz said 
indeed the bush administration which is counting on lower 
interest rates to help it pursue its economic agenda has changed 
the tenor of its comments about the fed from criticism to cautious 
praise 
it appears the federal reserve has paused to see what 
cumulative effect their tightening has had michael boskin 
president bushs chief economic adviser said in a speech last 
week that it seems to me is a sensible thing to do

saying the governments case was tainted 
oliver norths lawyers are renewing a motion made before his 
conviction to dismiss criminal charges against him because of his 
1987 congressional testimony 
north submits that it is impossible as a matter of law for the 
government to make the requisite showing that no use has been 
made of his congressional testimony given under a grant of 
immunity his lawyers asserted 
the government made the extraordinary decision to compel 
testimony from north to broadcast his testimony to tens of 
millions of people around the world and then to indict and try him 
for the matters as to which he had previously testified norths 
defense team said in a court filing monday 
north was convicted may 5 of aiding and abetting an obstruction 
of congress destroying government documents and of taking an 
illegal gratuity 
if the court doesnt dismiss the indictment a court hearing 
ought to be held in which the government would attempt to show the 
case was not tainted by his immunized testimony said norths 
lawyers 
in a 1972 case entitled kastigar v united states the supreme 
court held that any direct or indirect use against a defendant of 
testimony given under a grant of use immunity violates the fifth 
amendment 
norths lawyers submitted a 10page list of documents and 
information they said the prosecution must produce before any 
hearing they said any such inquiry includes a 
witnessbywitness itembyitem showing of the sources for all 
evidence presented by grand jury and trial witnesses 
north says the prosecution must produce all materials in its 
office referring to steps taken to comply with the requirement that 
no use be made of the immunized testimony 
norths lawyers said they want the prosecution to produce any 
information showing how news reports were censored in the office to 
eliminate information derived from the immunized testimony 
this is not limited to news stories but also includes for 
example political cartoons presidential press conferences talk 
shows and entertainment such as johnny carsons tonight show 
sesame street bob hopes specials or saturday night live 
said the court filing 
norths attorneys asked for all redacted or screened copies of 
every newspaper magazine periodical or other documentary 
material or any electronic transmission which any member of the 
ic staff read saw or heard after north was granted immunity

trying to seize panamanian leader gen 
manuel antonio noriega to face drug charges in the united states 
would be a mistake former president carter said 
the best thing we could do for noriega and the worst thing we 
could do for ourselves is to send marines into panama and try to 
catch this man carter told the arkansas bankers association on 
monday 
we shouldnt do anything in a belligerent way in panama 
because it would only lead to making noriega a hero and he doesnt 
deserve it 
it would play into his hands and would make us undertake a 
very bloody operation that might be unsuccessful carter said 
it would also alienate every other nation in this hemisphere if 
we invaded panama 
carter was among the international monitors in panama for the 
may 7 presidential elections the opposition claimed victory but 
the noriegabacked government nullified the presidential elections 
noriega is under indictment in the united states on drug charges

apple growers are halting use of alar in the 
wake of decreasing apple sales because of reports linking the 
controversial chemical to cancer 
the international apple institute said its members have decided 
to stop using alar which regulates growth and extends the shelf 
life of the fruit 
by september of this year the already low levels of alar will 
be reduced to virtually zero derl i derr president of the 
international apple institute based in nearby mclean va said 
monday in a news conference simply the us apple industry is 
not going to use alar 
this action is not taken because we believe there is a health 
risk associated with alar but because public confusion reigns 
supreme and consumer confidence in apples is faltering the 
industry spokesman said 
the food and drug administration estimated on march 16 that alar 
was used on 10 percent of the nations apple supply 
industry spokesmen say sales have been hurt severely by consumer 
reaction to news reports focusing on assertions that alar poses a 
risk of cancer particularly to children 
derrs prediction came as two new requests were made to the epa 
for an immediate ban on alar the requests came from the natural 
resources defense council and consumer activist ralph nader 
janet s hathaway an attorney for the nrdc said at a news 
conference that alar will be applied to this years crop in june if 
the epa does not take emergency action 
last weeekend the epa announced it has started a procedure that 
could lead to an alar ban in about 18 months but ms hathaway said 
that wasnt quick enough 
we believe that there is only one way to restore public 
confidence restore apple sales and protect public health ms 
hathaway said a total ban under epas suspension powers should 
occur as of today 
epa spokesman al heier said the data we now have available is 
preliminary data we will get the final data by early next year and 
at that time we hope to be able to take final cancellation action 
we do not believe eating apples or any food that has been 
treated with alar poses a grave risk we think there is some risk 
but we think the risk is small for the additional year before the 
epa ban takes effect he said 
on capitol hill nader told the senate subcommittee on toxic 
substances that congress should ban alar by name unilaterally 
and immediately 
nader said there is a convergence of interest between 
consumers who dont want alar on apples and apple growers hurt by 
plummeting sales he maintained the only opposition to an immediate 
ban comes from suppliers of alar or daminozide

an engineer at the rear of a 
runaway freight train that killed four people knew the brakes 
werent working on one of the engines but failed to notify the lead 
engineer investigators said 
engineer larry hill was interviewed by federal investigators 
monday along with his brakeman robert waterbury hill was in 
charge of guiding the brakes on the trains rear engines while the 
lead engineer frank holland who was injured in fridays crash 
watched the front ones 
the southern pacific freight train jumped the tracks at 90 mph 
friday on a curve trains are supposed to take at 30 mph cars 
slammed into six homes burying two boys who died and killing two 
crewmen 
the brakes were faulty on at least two of the trains six 
locomotives the national transportation safety board said sunday 
we learned that as the train crested the hill engineer 
holland radioed hill asking if he was giving all that he had all 
the dynamic braking that he had said james kolstad acting ntsb 
chairman 
hill answered yes even though he told investigators he was 
aware the dynamic brakes werent working kolstad said monday night 
we asked him why there was not more communication and he did 
not have an answer kolstad said the engineers also did not 
communicate in the moments before the train plunged through the 
homes kolstad said 
locomotives have two kinds of braking systems air brakes apply 
pressure to the wheels much like a car while dynamic braking uses 
the engine to slow the train similar to downshifting in a car 
investigators also interviewed workers who loaded the train with 
sandy sodium carbonate which is used to make potash in rosamond 
said ted lopatkiewicz an ntsb spokesman 
a shipping document indicated each of the hopper cars had 
about a twothirds load but we have witnesses that say some of the 
cars were loaded up to the edge he said 
crew members may not have known how heavy their train was and 
may have miscalculated the braking capability during their descent 
from 4109foot cajon pass into the los angeles basin said 
lopatkiewicz 
on sunday night investigators said two of the trains five 
crewman had previous safety violations tests to indicate if the 
crew was using alcohol or drugs on friday were incomplete 
authorities said 
holland was cited for driving a train too fast in march 1986 and 
for failing to connect brake lines properly between locomotives in 
february 1988 kolstad said holland was in fair condition monday 
with a collapsed lung in the intensivecare unit at st bernardine 
medical center 
brakeman allan r riess who was killed had been cited in 
october for failing to act when an engineer exceeded authorized 
speed kolstad said 
conductor everett s crown of bakersfield who also was killed 
had no violations on his record the records of waterbury 57 and 
hill 42 who escaped serious injury were unavailable 
ntsb officials examined crew members job records for any 
pattern of recklessness but lopatkiewicz said it is not unusual 
after a number of years on the line for trainmen to have violations 
on their record 
riess brotherinlaw dale jenkins said the 43yearold 
bakersfield man had failed to report the october incident because 
of tremendous pressure from superiors at work but he said allan 
was real conscientious 
southern pacific spokesman jerry pera declined to comment on 
crew safety violations saying the ntsb had asked the railroad not 
to talk about the investigation while it continued 
about 250 people remained at hotels monday because of the 
accident that wrecked their neighborhood authorities said

here is a transcript of president bushs 
speech monday unveiling his package of anticrime proposals at a 
police memorial service outside the capitol before a raindrenched 
crowd 
if it doesnt start clearing up were issuing snorkels to 
everybody out there 
i want to say how pleased i am that the secretary of the 
treasury is with me nick brady our attorney general the able 
dick thornburgh and our drug czar secretary bill bennett 
the fact that we four are here is intentional it sends a signal 
of our commitment and of our interest 
and i know members of congress are here as well 
i spotted my own senator senator phil gramm of texas and 
senator pete wilson 
but im going to be in trouble because i cant see over there 
who else is there but i know many are sitting right over here and 
we salute them 
i see senator ford and others and were just delighted that 
theyre here today applause 
last fall a retired new york police lieutenant gave me badge 
number 14072 and i have it with me here today the badge his son 
wore the day he was gunned down by a gang of cocaine cowards 
matt byrne asked me to keep eddies badge as a reminder of all 
the brave police officers who put their lives on the line for us 
every single day 
matt your sons badge as i have told you is kept in my desk 
at the oval office 
and during the debate on gunrelated violence that has raged in 
this country the past several months neither it nor what it 
represents has ever been far from my mind 
ive heard the many voices the courageous and the 
compassionate the wounded and the widowed 
and i salute the survivors who are here today 
we gather today to respond to those voices and to honor the 
fallen by launching a national strategy a partnership with 
americas cities and states to take back the streets 
it calls for a return to common sense and it begins with a 
cleareyed vision of the kind of problems we face the kind of 
people we are the kind of values that we hold and the kind of 
nation we intend to bequeath to our children 
the problem is violent crime and in particular the blood thats 
been shed by increasingly sophisticated guns in the hands of a new 
class of criminals 
usually but not always the deaths are tied to a cycle of 
dollars and drugs and dependency 
the principles are simple 
my generation will remember what some believe was fdrs finest 
speech the four freedoms an address to a joint session of the 
congress 
and the last often forgotten but arguably the most fundamental 
of those freedoms was simply this freedom from fear 
our sworn duty to ensure domestic tranquility is as old as the 
republic placed in the constitutions preamble even before the 
common defense and the general welfare 
and so when we ask what kind of society the american people 
deserve our goal must be a nation in which lawabiding citizens 
are safe and feel safe 
to achieve this goal people must be held accountable for their 
actions and thats common sense 
most americans are lawabiding 
and most believe that there is such a thing as right and wrong 
good and evil 
and whether its the brutalization of a young runner in a park 
or terrorizing a young man onto a crowded highway these are acts 
that cannot be excused or explained away 
a common sense approach to crime means that if were going to 
affect peoples behavior we must have a criminal justice system in 
which there is an expectation that if you commit a crime you will 
be caught and if caught you will be prosecuted and if convicted 
you will do time applause

for far too long a privileged class of violent and repeat 
offenders have calculated that crime really does pay that our 
criminal justice system is a crapshoot where the risks are worth 
the rewards 
well its time we changed the odds and upped the stakes 
enormously 
and we will lead the way 
well do our part and then some 
but no federal effort can succeed without the full partnership 
of the cities and the states that you so nobly represent 
unfortunately nowhere is your front line role more evident than 
in the honor roll that will be read today of 161 officers killed in 
the line of duty last year 152 were state or local cops and you 
are the first line of defense and your respective governments have 
an obligation to adopt tough legislation and provide the resources 
in police prosecutors and prisons to fully back you up 
at the trial of eddie byrnes executioners there was testimony 
that the hit was ordered from prison to send a message to the 
people behind the badge and one witness said that they hoped to 
see the attack on the television news at rikers island 
well today we have a message of our own 
were going to take back the streets by taking criminals off the 
streets 
and its an attack applause it is an attack on all four 
fronts new laws to punish them new agents to arrest them new 
prosecutors to convict them and new prisons to hold them 
applause 
i am announcing today and there is no more fitting place than 
right here a comprehensive new offensive for combatting violent 
crime for eddie byrne for every officer we honor here today and 
for america 
the first front of this campaign new laws starts with the 
semiautomatic and socalled assault weapons that criminals have 
taken as their gun of choice and again common sense has to play 
an important part in this discussion 
the fact of the matter is nearly half the households in this 
country have guns and guns are already out there 
and the overwhelming majority are legitimately owned for 
legitimate purposes 
but in contrast to legitimate gun ownership is the chilling fact 
that something like 80 percent of all firearms used by felons are 
stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained 
throughout our nations history the hard lesson weve learned 
is that criminals will get guns 
and so let me be very clear about our response

<TEXT>
the right to own a gun is not a license to harm others 
and so first i am calling on congress today to do for 
dangerous firearms what is wisely done for dangerous drugs to 
double the mandatory minimum penalties for the use of semiautomatic 
weapons in crimes involving violence or drugs 
and the math is simple 
anyone who uses a semiautomatic for crime or so much as has one 
on them during a crime will do an automatic 10 extra years in 
federal prison no probation applause no parole applause 
no matter which judge they get applause 
and secondly we just cant just plea bargain away the lives of 
your loved ones the lives of our cops and kids 
and im directing the attorney general to advise americas 
prosecutors to end plea bargaining for violent federal firearms 
offenses 
those who use guns will do time hard time applause 
and third when a criminal carries a gun and someone dies they 
must pay with their own lives applause 
we are calling on congress today to enact the steps necessary to 
implement the death penalty and to newly designate the use of a 
firearm as an aggravating factor for determining whether the death 
sentence should be imposed 
and i call on americas governors to match this federal 
initiative and propose these same three standards at home 
mandatory time no deals without cooperation and the death penalty 
where appropriate 
your states owe it to those here today and to the american 
people applause 
and fourth two months ago at my direction the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms suspended the importation of certain 
socalled assault weapons 
batf is continuing its examination to determine which if any 
of those weapons are not acceptable under standards in existing law 
and at the conclusion of this study and after careful 
consideration we will permanently ban any imports that dont 
measure up to these standards 
recently the us news cover story on guns summed up a related 
challenge the difficulty in drafting laws that will separate 
assault weapons used in crime from semiautomatics frequently used 
for legitimate hunting and sports 
and there is substantial controversy and debate on this point 
youre all well aware of that 
the one thing that we do know about these assault weapons is 
that they are invariably equipped with unjustifably large magazines 
the notorious aks47 for example comes with a magazine that 
pumps off 30 explosive bullets without reloading 
and that is why fifth we stand on the steps here in front of 
the capitol and ask its support for legislation prohibiting the 
importation manufacture sale or transfer of these insidious gun 
magazines of more than 15 rounds 
the current debate was first sparked when an unstable gunman in 
stockton calif purchased an aks47 over the counter and used it 
to lay waste to an elementary school playground 
patrick edward purdy had no business buying that gun 
he was arrested on his first weapons charge before his 15th 
birthday 
and by his fourth firearms arrest purdy had finally turned 18 
and with it chalked up the first of two adult convictions 
although for violent and weapons offenses both convictions were 
misdemeanors 
purdy crawled through the loophole that bars only felons from 
buying guns and got that deadly aks47 
that is outrageous 
and therefore we also propose that congress close this 
purdy loophole and others like it that allow deadly weapons to 
fall into deadly hands 
again thats just plain common sense 
we must not allow deadly weapons to fall into deadly hands

but we need to do more than just enact new laws 
and in a recent movie about the la gang wars a woman shouts 
encouragement to a cop on patrol telling him you get them off 
the streets 
and he answers lady were trying 
and the woman offers a fourword solution you need more 
help 
and believe me we know it 
our police need more help 
and im here today to tell you that were prepared to match 
rhetoric with resources and call on our cities and states to do the 
same 
the second front if you will of course new offensive calls 
for increased manpower and a new strategy on guns a strategy based 
on models of proven effectiveness 
i have directed the attorney general and the treasury secretary 
working together with state and local enforcement to launch a 
comprehensive coordinated offensive against our nations most 
violent criminals 
and i am requesting funding for hiring 825 new federal agents 
and staff 375 at atf 300 at the fbi and 150 deputy us 
marshals 
many of these hirings will permit experienced investigators from 
all three agencies to promptly combat violent crime in the field 
of course arresting these thugs doesnt help if we dont have 
the muscle to prosecute each criminal to the fullest extent of the 
law 
and thats why the third front of this campaign calls for 
congress to back up these new troops with 1600 new prosecutors and 
staff 
and now there probably isnt a police officer here who hasnt 
seen a case where a dangerous felon properly arrested fully 
prosecuted and sentenced to the maximum walks out of jail early 
sometimes years early because prisons are bursting at the seam 
that is not right 
part of our common sense approach is a simple recognition that 
it doesnt do any good to provide new federal agents new assistant 
us attorneys and new laws with longterm penalties if we dont 
have the prison cells to keep criminals where they belong 
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link and so as the 
fourth front in this comprehensive effort i am calling on the 
congress to authorize an additional 1 billion over and above the 
500 million already slated for 1990 for federal prison 
construction applause 
these 24000 new beds will boost federal prison capacity by 
nearly 80 percent 
not since lincoln has a president stood in front of the capitol 
and been just a few miles from the front lines of a war 
never was the toll more visible than in the faces of the brave 
men and women the families gathered here today 
and when i first stood here as president over there only 
moments after taking the office the oath of office i made a 
promise this scourge will stop 
and thats a promise that we intend to keep 
ladies and gentlemen i offer my condolences for your fallen 
loved ones and for your fellow officers 
and i salute your commitment and i salute your courage 
and as a citizen grateful for the protection you have provided 
for me and my family and my fellow countrymen i thank you and i 
wish you godspeed 
thank you all and god bless the united states of america 
thank you very much applause

new testing methods and improved farming 
practices have led government researchers to conclude that eggs 
have 22 percent less cholesterol than previously believed 
a study released monday by the us department of agriculture 
and the industrysupported egg nutrition center found the average 
large egg has 213 milligrams of dietary cholesterol 
the government has said since 1976 that eggs contained 274 
milligrams 
extra large eggs have about 230 milligrams of cholesterol and 
medium eggs about 180 milligrams 
the study was welcomed by the egg industry which has seen sales 
plummet 1 billion during the past five years after warnings about 
the risks of heart disease associated with the fatty substance 
the egg industry has been anxiously awaiting this report 
said cathy mccharen vice president of the egg nutrition center in 
washington dc it confirms what weve been saying all along 
that eggs are an important source of nutrients and should not be 
eliminated from diets 
the change is due to better testing methods and different feed 
husbandry and breeding practices according to gary beecher chief 
of the usdas nutrition information service the new figures will 
be included in updated versions of the usdas handbook on the 
nutrient composition of foods 
the fat content of the eggs also was slightly lower than 
previously reported with an average of 5 grams total fat per large 
egg 
the study also confirmed that eggs are a lowcalorie source of 
protein vitamin a riboflavin vitamin b12 iron zinc 
phosphorus calcium potassium and other nutrients the average 
large egg had 75 calories 
i think what it means is that the egg is still a very rich 
source of nutrients said beecher 
the egg has always been considered by the nutrition community 
to be an important part of the diet but cholesterol has given eggs 
a bad rap now it doesnt appear that the cholesterol level is so 
high 
the american heart association has recommended that the average 
adult each day consume no more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol 
a substance found especially in animal fats and helps block blood 
vessels 
people concerned about high cholesterol which have been 
associated with heart disease should discuss their diet with their 
doctor or nutritionist beecher said 
the study examined nearly 2500 eggs from producers around the 
country last summer and this winter 
on average it was representative of all eggs produced in the 
united states said beecher 
the study was jointly sponsored by the usda and the egg 
industry the industry paid for the analysis and provided the eggs 
but government researchers designed the tests and analyzed the 
results beecher said 
the industry has suffered in recent years from worries about 
cholesterol and other factors 
people arent eating breakfast as much and women are not home 
baking all the time said mccharen 
egg sales fell to 31 billion in 1988 from 41 billion in 
1984 egg production has been flat during that period 695 
billion eggs were produced in the united states last year while 
the cost of feed labor and other items has risen

two federal agencies say theyll work together 
to boost bicycle safety including increasing the use of helmets 
which officials say are worn by fewer than one in 10 riders 
officials of the consumer product safety commission also said 
monday they are evaluating several types of bicycle helmets to 
determine effectiveness in preventing injuries and will consider a 
proposal from safety groups to set uniform federal standards 
an engineer for the commission john preston said testing 
indicates that helmets without a hard shell may be just as 
effective in absorbing the energy of a fall or collision as those 
with a hard shell 
the comission and the national highway safety administration 
signed a memorandum monday that sets up communication between the 
two agencies on bicycle safety research and seeks to coordinate 
local and national efforts to increase public understanding of 
bicycle safety requirements 
a group of safety and consumer groups organized as the national 
safe kids campaign petitioned the safety commission on monday to 
set performance standards for both adult and childsize bicycle 
helmets the group said federal standards would help reduce the 
1000 deaths and halfmillion serious injuries each year in bicycle 
accidents

requiring wheelchair lifts on all new public 
buses would put a costly burden on transit agencies bush 
administration officials told a federal appeals court 
before mondays court hearing 13 disabled spectators were 
wheeled into the courtroom some spectators wore revolutionary 
warera hats 
this is the case that will mean independence for disabled 
people said stephen gold attorney for americans disabled for 
accessible public transportation or adapt which filed the lawsuit 
the government is appealing 
the nation should keep the current system of balancing special 
services for the disabled with the costs us transportation 
department lawyer jeffrey clair told the 3rd us circuit of 
appeals 
the case has attracted the attention of dozens of 
disabledrights groups many angered by the governments decision 
to ask the full appeals court to review a decision handed down by a 
threejudge panel feb 13 
in the 21 decision the panel ruled the department of 
transportation failed to provide the handicapped equal 
accessibility as intended by congress the judges invalidated a 
transportation department provision allowing communities to provide 
van service instead 
clair said requiring lifts on all new buses would be too rigid 
and overly burdensome

excessive drinking gridlock and 
trashed hotels are causing some residents to question whether the 
welcome mat to this spring break mecca should be rolled up 
when fort lauderdale more or less told students to go elsewhere 
for their weeks of unbridled partying daytona beach took over as 
the nations top spring break destination 
it attracted 500000 students during the four weeks that ended 
in early april according to georgia carter of the tourism 
promotion agency destination daytona 
although students spent 100 million here they left behind 
angry residents who complained about car stereos blaring throughout 
the nights on clogged streets and youths urinating on lawns and 
passing out in driveways 
its basically what happened here said carolyn michaels 
assistant director of tourism convention and business development 
for the fort lauderdale chamber of commerce 
fort lauderdale officials last year adopted plans to renovate 
the beachfront area into a familyoriented resort cracking down on 
public drinking and shelving marketing campaigns at college 
campuses 
more than 200 miles north of fort lauderdale daytona beachs 
success in attracting students has divided residents 
on one side are those who dread the hordes of drunken students 
and on the other are those who see dollar signs for the motels 
hotels restaurants bars and gift shops 
daytona beach likes to have the money but they dont want the 
problems said lt jimmy powell head of the daytona beach office 
of the state division of alcoholic beverages and tobacco 
daytona is going to have to decide if they are going to 
control it or get rid of the whole thing he said there are a 
lot of upset people in daytona beach 
many have said enough is enough 
this is a city election year and politicans are apt to be 
responsive to residents concerns 
a lot of citizens are saying well give you one more year to 
fix the problems of spring break or theyll seek to abolish the 
annual rites of spring in much the way that fort lauderdale has 
said dick moores immediate past president of the local motel 
association 
we are going to solve the spring break problem weve got 
to said moores who owns the daytona sands beach motel 
some attribute the problems to playboy magazine which featured 
a risque pictorial from daytona beach in its april issue and to 
mtv the popular music video channel which has broadcast live from 
the worlds most famous beach for the past two years 
mtv gave kids the impression that in daytona is where anything 
goes moores said we dont want them back 
allan cohen whose family owns the texan motel disagrees 
it could be devastating if they mtv dont show in daytona 
beach said cohen whose motel was used by mtv this spring 
for years he said tourism officials have worked to attract 
young people 
daytona beach didnt happen overnight weve been fighting and 
fighting to get the break here we got the break so big it was 
unbelievable cohen said everybody got caught with their pants 
down 
the daytona beach chamber of commerce recently established 
subcommittees to address the problems 
some of the solutions under consideration include setting up 
portable toilets preventing youngsters from entering residential 
neighborhoods near the beach restricting sales of beer and alcohol 
to certain times banning beach concerts and taxing beer 
the number one culprit in the whole thing was over consumption 
of alcohol moores said 
one of those who dealt daily with the alcohol problem was 
powell with the state alcoholic beverage division his office made 
1200 arrests during spring break but he said he could have made 
12000 arrests if he had enough officers 
despite the problems many are confident about reaching 
solutions before next years invasion 
everybody is ready to give spring break another shot cohen 
said but they want to see more control

ending years of strict protectionism the 
government today radically liberalized foreign investment 
regulations in a bid to attract capital to mexicos debtcrippled 
economy 
the new rules announced monday open to foreign investment 
sectors of the economy previously closed to outsiders and increase 
the amount of foreign ownership permitted in others 
in some key areas such as tourism mexico will allow 100 
percent foreign ownership a 1973 law had limited foreign ownership 
to 49 percent in most industries and prohibited it altogether from 
many others 
the new regulations take effect a day before negotiations on 
restructing mexicos 1074 billion foreign debt resume in new 
york mexicos pledge to move away from a protectionist economy is 
a crucial feature of the debt talks 
for technology modernization employment fresh resources and 
access to external markets there is a clear justification and 
rationale to permit increased flexibility to foreign investment in 
mexico commerce secretary jaime serra puche told a news 
conference monday 
many industries considered strategic including banking 
petroleum mineral exploration electrical generation and 
broadcasting will remain offlimits to foreigners he said 
the government is opening previously closed areas such as auto 
parts telecommunications fishing and petrochemicals production a 
maximum of 49 percent foreign investment will be allowed in these 
areas 
areas previously limited to 49 percent foreign ownership that 
will be expanded to make foreign majority ownership possible 
include glass cement iron steel and cellulose 
no country can modernize without attracting fresh 
investment serra puche said the tendency in the world is 
moving toward interdependence 
the new regulations follow other economic reforms including a 
wageandprice control program that cut inflation from a record 159 
percent in 1987 to 517 percent last year 
under president carlos salinas de gortari the government also 
has sold or closed some stateowned industries 
tourism mexicos secondlargest earner of foreign exchange had 
been limited to 49 percent foreign ownership now 100 percent 
foreign ownership will be allowed 
serra puche said that in contrast to the old the new 
regulations will simplify and clarify investment procedures he 
said approval for 100 percent outside ownership will be automatic 
in many cases 
there has been nearly no growth in the mexican economy because 
of the nations foreign debt and low oil prices 
mexican officials say foreign capital is essential to creating 
jobs importing high technology and stimulating exports and 
productivity the commerce department said foreign investment 
totalled 31 billion last year 
the new rules will consolidate regulations pertaining to the 
border maquiladora industry serra puche said but not change 
them 
under the maquiladora program foreignmade parts are imported 
dutyfree to mexico for final assembly when the finished product 
is exported to the united states the united states taxes only the 
labor or the value added in mexico 
speculation that foreign investment restrictions would be eased 
was sparked recently when tourism secretary carlos hank gonzalez 
returned from a visit to europe and announced several resort hotel 
projects involving spanish and west german firms 
much of mexicos tourism is along its coasts and the new rules 
will double the length of beachfront property leases from 30 years 
to 60 years serra puche said the constitution prohibits outright 
foreign ownership of coastal real estate

a witness who said he helped dispose of 
murder weapons implicated four people in the slaying of a producer 
but never mentioned former paramount production chief robert evans 
who won a battle not to testify 
the slaying has been linked to evans movie the cotton club 
and police reports have suggested that witnesses will implicate 
evans the producer invoked fifth amendment protection against self 
incrimination 
municipal judge patti jo mckay had threatened to jail evans who 
is not charged in the slaying of new york theatrical producer roy 
radin for contempt for refusing to testify 
but on monday mckay said she was swayed by arguments from 
evans attorney who cited a report in saturdays los angeles times 
that evans has been linked by two potential witnesses to the 
killing 
evans producer of such hits as the godfather 
chinatown and love story had been scheduled as the first 
witness in a preliminary hearing 
but on monday as he listened nervously mckay and supervising 
municipal court judge david horwitz excused him from testifying 
they based their rulings on the published reports evans lawyer 
has said in court evans is absolutely innocent of any 
involvement and would testify if granted immunity from 
prosecution 
at this point unless the people are prepared to offer mr 
evans immunity as a witness he cannot be forced to testify in the 
radin matter said mckay 
deputy district attorney david conn refused to give him immunity 
and told reporters he would not reconsider that decision 
the hearings first witness was carl plzak who worked as a 
security guard for defendant karen delayne laynie greenberger 
and for former hustler magazine publisher larry flynt who is not a 
defendant 
mrs greenberger also known as elaine jacobs is credited with 
having introduced evans and radin who negotiated financing of the 
cotton club she is charged with murder as are three former flynt 
security guards william molony mentzer alex lamota marti and 
william ulmer lowe lowe is fighting extradition in maryland 
the hearing is to determine if there is enough evidence for the 
defendants to stand trial 
plzak testified that all four defendants were involved in 
radins killing and that it was related to a theft of cocaine and 
money he said he helped the defendants get rid of the murder 
weapons 
evans was in the midst of negotiations with radin to raise funds 
for the cotton club in 1983 when the producer disappeared at 
the time a dispute had arisen about mrs greenbergers demand for 
part of the films profits 
radin was seen stepping into a limousine with mrs greenberger 
on may 13 1983 en route to dinner at the fashionable la scala 
restaurant in beverly hills his body was found a month later in a 
dry riverbed 65 miles north of los angeles he had been shot in the 
head

the young american in the lyrics is mark kilroy a 
university of texas student abducted while in matamoros during a 
spring break outing

at kgbtam in harlingen program director rogelio botello said 
tragedy in matamoros is the most popular corrido this week 
it is getting some play here in houston also in dallas fort 
worth and san antonio said albino garcia with sales promotion 
at ramex records the houstonbased company distributing the 
recording to stations 
were taking quite a few orders now garcia said 
here is a translation of the lyrics 
there the devil did fail them 
satanic murderers 
they say sarita aldrete 
and that cuban el padrino 
are the main ones responsible 
for everything that has happened 
in brownsville and matamoros 
they all started trembling 
because that satanic gang 
they are not afraid to kill 
thats how they prayed to the devil 
in order to triumph in all that they do 
the parents were very worried 
about their beloved son 
that young american 
well he had been lost 
on the 14th of march 
while he was out with some friends 
they say that some federales 
they caught a snitch 
we will protect you 
give us some good information 
the santa elena ranch 
it looks like a cemetery there 
now i say good goodbye from here 
from rancho santa elena 
here they found the gringo 
dead with another dozen 
for that satanic gang 
black will be their sentence

a us immigration official says he was acting 
out of compassion when he led a prayer that ferdinand marcos be 
allowed to return to the philippines 
harold ezell said monday he led the prayer during an aug 3 
party where he also danced with marcos wife imelda because the 
deposed philippine president had expressed a desire to return home 
to bury his mother 
it has nothing to do with us policy it has something to do 
with a human being who has feelings as i have said ezell 
western regional commissioner of the us immigration and 
naturalization service 
ezell said he now regrets attending the party at marcos mansion 
overlooking honolulu but doesnt regret offering the prayer 
i think i can express my personal views said ezell he said 
his father a minister also had died a year earlier and he 
sympathized with marcos about the death of the ousted philippines 
presidents mother 
if its wrong to pray for a person ill take the heat for 
that ezell said 
ezell answering questions following a news conference to 
promote the agencys amnesty program also said he didnt think 
there was anything wrong with asking immigration officials from 
several western states to join him in the prayer during the party 
americans are free to do what they want ezell said they 
dont have to join in im not the commander or dictator of the 
immigration service 
a videotape obtained by the honolulu advertiser shows ezell 
embracing marcos and dancing with marcos wife while ezells wife 
danced with the former president the newspaper did not reveal the 
source of the videotape 
eat your heart out ezell called out as he danced with mrs 
marcos to the beat of dont throw my love away 
ezell noted that the party was held before a new york grand jury 
indicted the marcoses on racketeering charges in october they are 
accused of looting more than 100 million from the philippines to 
buy art and real estate in new york 
the commissioner said too much was being made of the immigration 
officials attending the event 
to me its ridiculous its a social event ezell said 
but if i had to do it over again i would not 
us policy since marcos fled to exile in hawaii in 1986 has 
been to support philippine president corazon aquinos repeated 
refusals to allow marcos return home mrs aquino has cited 
national security in denying his requests

george bush outlined his anticrime package in 
a setting reminiscent of his presidential campaign but the 
president sounded very different from the candidate on gun control 
and he never mentioned prison furloughs 
once again when confronted with the realities and conflicting 
pressures of governing bush opted for compromise 
his speech monday from the steps of the us capitol included 
echoes from his campaign including his call for greater use of the 
death penalty tougher sentencing and increased prison construction 
but on the touchy question of gun control he sounded far 
different 
his calls for a ban on largecapacity cartridge magazines and 
for import restrictions on assaultstyle weapons were welcomed by 
gun control advocates but while taking that action the president 
declined to move against assaultstyle rifles manufactured 
domestically 
a month ago white house spokesman marlin fitzwater suggested 
and it was nothing more than a suggestion that a ban on 
domestically manufactured assaultstyle rifles could be part of the 
bush crime package 
the press secretary said was there was some unfairness 
because the ban on imported weapons would have no impact on sales 
of us made rapidfire rifles 
unfortunately it is not something we can do anything about 
said fitzwater to do anything about domestically manufactured 
weapons would require a change in the law 
that change was never requested 
what bush did request was a prohibition on manufacture and sale 
of magazines that carry more than 15 cartridges a position that 
puts him on the same side as democratic sen howard metzenbaum of 
ohio 
but metzenbaum also wants to ban sales of new assaultstyle 
weapons made in the united states the ohio senator argues that 
limiting imports only deals with about 25 percent of the weapons 
the day that bush delivered his speech the national rifle 
association ran a fullpage ad that attacked metzenbaums bill 
do you honestly believe that banning some or even all 
semiautos will stop drug dealers street gangs or any violent 
criminals from getting any gun illegally asked the nra ad 
some anticrime proposals such as mandatory gunrelated 
sentencing have a wide range of support 
the nra ad suggested alternatives that were identical to some of 
bushs key proposals including barring plea bargaining for any 
felony committed with a gun mandatory sentencing for crimes 
committed with a gun and increased prison construction 
metzenbaum also supports a 10year mandatory sentence and more 
money for new prisons 
but there was a distinct difference in tone between the speech 
bush gave to the national peace officers memorial service and his 
campaign rhetoric 
his audience on a rainy monday included relatives of the 161 
police killed in the line of duty last year as he did so often 
during his campaign bush recalled how he had been given the badge 
of 22yearold eddie byrne a new york police officer killed by 
what the president called a gang of cocaine cowards 
but during the campaign bush took a nocompromise position on 
gun control 
my opponent favors gun control and i do not he said in 
speech after speech i dont believe in new restrictions on the 
rights of citizens to own arms 
as a president faced with a growing wave of drugrelated 
violence bush is inching away from that hard line 
the right to own a gun is not a license to harm others he 
said monday using language unlike any he uttered during the 
campaign 
when he was attacking the massachusetts prison furlough program 
last year bush aides assured reporters that as president he would 
order a review of the federal prison furlough program 
a source in the bureau of prisons said no general review of the 
federal program has been done although wardens have been instructed 
to take a harder look at prisoners before they are granted 
furloughs

today and the dollar continued rising against the yen despite 
central bank intervention in support of the japanese currency 
the dollar closed at 13700 yen up 020 yen from mondays 
13680yen close it opened at an 18month high of 13730 yen and 
ranged between 13695 yen and 13765 yen 
the dollar has gained 256 yen over the past four trading days 
the bank of japan sold between 400 million and 500 million 
during the morning session to check the dollars increase traders 
said the bank of japan does not comment publicly on its market 
intervention 
ichiro ikeda a trader with chemical bank in tokyo said the 
dollars downward trend in the afternoon however was the result 
of profittaking and not of central bank intervention 
having bought all those dollars a majority of participants 
seemed to start collecting profits ikeda said 
on the stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 issues 
rebounded to 3392645 regaining 21016 points or 062 percent 
it had lost 15004 points monday 
new japan securities dealer kazuhiro murata attributed the 
indexs sharp rise in the afternoon session to strong performances 
by hitech issues 
investors turned their interest to hitech issues trying to 
take advantage of the yens recent weakness against the dollar 
he said the lower yen helps exports 
another dealer at a japanese brokerage speaking on condition of 
anonymity said institutional investors remained on the sidelines 
because of concern over possible interest rate hikes and continuing 
political uncertainty 
market sources have been speculating that the dollars sharp 
rise against the yen could lead to higher interest rates in japan 
meanwhile the governing liberal democratic party has not been 
able to find a successor for prime minister noboru takeshita who 
has announced he is resigning to take responsibility for an 
influencepeddling scandal 
the yens weakness on the foreign exchange market also 
discouraged stock investors the dealer said 
trading was thin with first section volume estimated at 600 
million shares up from mondays 400 million

the government warned washington today 
not to comment on its internal affairs and said remarks by a us 
official on the mysterious death of a radical student could harm 
relations 
the warning came as the seoul government put riot police on 
nationwide alert to prepare for possible protests this week over 
the students death and the ninth anniversary of a bloody 1980 
antigovernment uprising 
about 300 radical students calling for the overthrow of 
president roh taewoo battled riot police with firebombs and rocks 
at sungkyunkwan university in seoul troopers with interlocked 
shields blocked the schools main gate to stop students from 
marching into the streets 
a foreign ministry official who declined to be named in keeping 
with official practice said a us state department officials 
comments on the death of radical student lee cholkyu were 
unacceptable and incorrect 
unnecessary american comment on internal matters 
particularly on a situation in which it does not know the truth 
would not be of help to the uskorea alliance or friendly 
relations the official said 
south korean dissidents claim lee was tortured and killed by 
police and reject a government autopsy report that he drowned the 
body was found may 10 in a reservoir outside the southeastern city 
of kwangju 
south korea protested to washington after the state department 
official last week called lees death a deplorable event we do 
not know who may have committed this atrocious act 
the official noted that roh had called for a full investigation 
of the case and we hope the murderers will be exposed and 
severely punished 
south korea lodged a protest in washington over the statement 
contending it had not been proved that lee was murdered the state 
department said monday it did not intend to prejudge how lee was 
killed 
the foreign ministry said today that it accepted the state 
departments monday comment as a practical correction of the 
reference to murderers even though it was not specifically 
retracted by the department 
south korea and the united states are close allies and about 
43000 us troops are based in south korea under a mutual defense 
treaty 
thousands of people have held daily protests in kwangju to 
denounce police as being responsible for lees death clashes have 
broken out between protesters trying to march to provincial 
government headquarters and truncheonwielding troopers 
south korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests and labor 
strikes in recent months dissident groups are caling for the 
overthrow of roh but they lack public support because of their 
violent tactics and extreme views 
dissidents and radical students are trying to harness the 
growing furor over lees death to step up a campaign to topple the 
government dissidents call for the expulsion of us forces 
authorities fear the dispute over lees death could inflame 
protests this week to mark the anniversary of a 1980 uprising in 
kwangju in which at least 192 people were killed dissidents have 
called for nationwide demonstrations 
national police headquarters in seoul said riot police had been 
placed on nationwide alert to prevent violent protests security 
was being increased at government buildings to prevent possible 
student attacks officials said 
the oppositioncontrolled national assembly convened 16 
committees today to investigate lees death the kwangju uprising 
and other issues opposition parties contend the government is 
using radical violence as a pretext to crack down on all opposition 
groups 
president roh said today that the government was making every 
effort to find out how lee died he said the dissidents efforts to 
play up the incident were a threat to political stability and 
democracy 
at the time of lees deasth police had been hting for him 
because of his antigovernment activities including writing 
articles praising communist north korea authorities say police 
stopped lee in a taxi near kwangju but he escaped on foot 
police officials say lee probably fell into the reservoir while 
fleeing police and drowned 
dissident groups claim the government investigation into lees 
death was a coverup and are demanding an independent probe by 
amnesty international or the world christian council

a judge who dismissed weapons charges 
against a lawyer arrested as part of an undercover drug 
investigation said law enforcement officials may have committed 
perjury in the case 
the false charges were filed in la plata county court here 
against an undercover deputy to give the officer a reason to hire 
lawyer robin auld to defend him district court judge richard brown 
said monday 
this court is not aware of any case or statute which sanctions 
the filing of false and perjured documents in an official court 
proceeding as part of an undercover operation brown wrote 
the government plan had called for the undercover officer to pay 
auld in drugs for his legal services and then pressure auld to 
set up drug traffickers in southwest colorado according to 
testimony in previous hearings 
auld 43 refused to accept drugs but later took possession of 
an uzi machine gun according to testimony the prosecution charged 
he took the gun as payment auld contended he kept it as collateral 
the gun belonged to the durango police department on loan from 
the fbi according to court documents 
aulds trial was to have started may 22 in durango 
brown a visiting judge who heard the case after 6th judicial 
district judges in durango disqualified themselves said the 
public has a right to demand and to expect that the courts will do 
their utmost to remain impartial and to promote the publics 
confidence in the integrity of the courts 
filing the false affidavits was an impermissible taint upon 
the integrity and impartiality of the courts he wrote 
auld said he was very happy with the ruling but did not 
want to comment because the decision might be appealed 
it takes guts but its the right thing he brown wouldnt 
put up with the corruption of court records said hal haddon 
aulds lawyer 
a notice of claim seeking at least 1 million in civil damages 
on aulds behalf has been filed but the attorney has not brought a 
formal lawsuit 
keith cross the special prosecutor in the case said he will 
appeal 
if this decision stands it means the attorney never has to 
face a jury on fairly serious charges cross said 
cross said he considered the false affidavits before he filed 
the charges of theft by receiving and possession of a dangerous 
weapon against auld 
in my opinion there were no indictable offenses committed by 
the da or law enforcement officials cross said there is no 
question that two documents filed and sworn to werent true but i 
believe there is a difference in doing that and taking the stand 
and perjuring themselves

a jogger who was raped and beaten by a gang of 
youths in central park has taken her first shaky steps since last 
months attack and can now write her name a doctor said 
but dr robert s kurtz added that it remains unclear how much 
she will recover 
the more small neurologic improvements are registered the 
more clearly apparent it becomes how great a distance she has yet 
to travel said kurtz director of the surgical intensive care 
unit at metropolitan hospital 
she is now able to take a few walking steps although her gait 
is still broadbased and unsteady he said monday 
the woman also can now write her name in a shaky hand the 
doctor said 
the 28yearold woman an investment banker was accosted april 
19 as she took her nightly jog six teenagers have been indicted 
in the assault 
doctors say the woman who was in a coma for nearly two weeks 
suffered brain damage from the beating and from a lack of oxygen as 
she lay unconscious for several hours 
neurologically the patient is better oriented to her 
surroundings kurtz said but he added she is still not fully 
oriented to time and place 
during the weekend the woman twice developed fevers of 1015 
degrees which kurtz said may stem from infections and from 
inflammation of an arm vein used for intravenous treatment 
if the infections dont clear up kurtz said surgery scheduled 
for wednesday to repair facial bones may be postponed

down at the landmark tweed courthouse city 
officials posted plastic owls to try to scare away the 
perildropping pigeons but it isnt working 
the owls are turning into pussycats said ed barbini a 
spokesman for the general services department 
the exterior of the marble building behind city hall is in the 
throes of renovation in december officials strung up a dozen 
18inchhigh plastic owls hoping they would keep away the pigeons 
whose droppings contain a natural acid that harms stone 
they even moved the bogus birds around for the sake of realism 
but it didnt work for long these are streetwise pigeons 
theyre basically stupid animals but not that stupid said 
mike feller chief naturalist for the parks department 
when the 20 million renovation is done the city plans more 
permanent and proven measures to keep the pigeons from perching on 
the courthouse ledges 
birds get a mild shock for example when they run across city 
hall thanks to lowvoltage wiring and at brooklyn borough hall 
the inviting bronze statue of justice atop a cupola becomes less 
attractive when a pigeontroubling ultrasound device disturbs the 
sound waves

eight explorers who 
trekked 620 miles to the north pole to draw attention to humanitys 
assault on the fragile arctic environment began their journey home 
looking haggard but happy 
the team on monday flew to eureka and then to their base camp in 
resolute monday night 
the explorers from britain canada the united states the 
soviet union japan australia and west germany reached the north 
pole on sunday and planted a un flag they were to fly to ottawa 
today 
with their uncut hair and sunburned faces the team members 
appeared haggard and exhausted on monday night 
expedition leader robert swan of britain told a news conference 
that he hoped the trek called icewalk achieved its goal of 
bringing attention to the environment and would spur politicians to 
do more to protect nature 
weve got to work together as one world to take on the 
environment said swan who became the first person to walk to 
the north pole and south pole he had reached the south pole in 
1986 
the adventurers who walked and skied said temperatures were as 
low as 67 degrees below zero during the 56day trek 
all suffered some health problems from frostbite to influenza 
but the american darryl roberts 23 of new york suffered the 
worst 
severe frostbite on his feet made him limp much of the time but 
he never thought of quitting said roberts the first american to 
walk to the north pole 
with the moral support of the other team members i knew i was 
going to be able to make it he said 
the adventurers left cape aldrich on ellesmere island in 
canadas northwest territories on march 20 
they made their journey in an effort to spur political action on 
halting pollution and slowing down global warming the socalled 
greenhouse effect which is produced by the combustion of fossil 
fuels 
icewalk had a highpower public relations operation promoting it 
and corporate sponsorship supporting its 4 million budget 
it differed from other arctic expeditions because participants 
used only human power to travel and take supplies along in sledges 
that each carry about 250 pounds of cargo

the nation cannot afford the 90 million 
annual cost of requiring transit systems to equip new buses with 
wheelchair lifts a bush administration lawyer told a federal 
appeals court 
instead communities should stick with the current system of 
balancing special services for the disabled against the costs of 
those services us department of transportation attorney jeffrey 
clair told the 3rd circuit of appeals on monday 
the case has attracted the attention of dozens of 
disabledrights groups many angered by the governments decision 
to ask the full appeals court to review a feb 13 decision by a 
threejudge panel 
in the 21 ruling the panel said the department of 
transportation failed to provide the disabled equal accessibility 
as intended by congress 
the panel struck down regulations that transit systems need 
spend no more than 3 percent of their average annual operating 
costs on measures for the disabled so long as the government 
approves it also disallowed a provision allowing communities to 
meet obligations by providing special vans that must be reserved in 
advance 
before mondays hearing building security officials helped 
wheel 13 disabled spectators into the courtroom some observers 
wore hats reminiscent of the revolutionary war era 
this is the case that will mean independence for disabled 
people said stephen gold attorney for americans disabled for 
accessible public transportation or adapt which filed the lawsuit 
the government is appealing 
clair said requiring lifts on all new buses would be too rigid 
and overly burdensome he said lifts on 50 percent of buses was 
more acceptable 
he recited a quip attributed to the late sen everett dirksen 
a billion here and a billion there pretty soon youre talking 
about real money 
clair botched the quote substituting millions for billions and 
was corrected by one of the judges but he said the idea was an 
approach that allows communities to respond with a program 
tailored to local needs 
a wheelchair lift costs 10000 to 15000 while a bus costs up 
to 200000 in its petition the government said transit agencies 
across the country would pay a total of 90 million annually for 
the lifts 
adapt merely wants the court to require lifts on new buses 
meaning entire fleets probably will not be accessible until the 
year 2001 said timothy cook an adapt lawyer 
cook argued that van service denies the handicapped spontaneous 
use of mass transit by requiring the disabled to make reservations 
up to 24 hours in advance 
dont perpetuate forever a clearly inferior system because 
that would be contrary to the rule of congress cook said

helen suzman considered the 
countrys most steadfast antiapartheid politician announced today 
that she will retire in september after 36 years in parliament 
mrs suzman 71 is the longestserving member of parliament 
having represented the same johannesburg constituency since 1953 
from 1961 through 1974 she was the only legislator representing 
the antiapartheid opposition and often cast the sole vote against 
discriminatory or repressive laws 
she announced she would not seek reelection on sept 6 when a 
general election will be held for the white asian and mixedrace 
chambers of parliament she has campaigned consistently to extend 
political rights to the black majority which has no representation 
in parliament 
mrs suzman has represented four liberal parties the first 
three of which either merged with or were replaced by another 
starting in 1959 she represented the progressive party which 
later was broadened and renamed the progressive federal party 
in april that party joined with two other antiapartheid 
factions to form the democratic party 
harry oppenheimer the industrialist who has helped finance 
antiapartheid political parties wrote of mrs suzman last year 
our hope and our faith owe more than any of us can say to the 
career the personality and the example of helen suzman 
for 14 lonely years as the sole progressive in parliament she 
kept alive a proper respect for human dignity a deep sympathy for 
human suffering and a hatred of all cruelty and injustice 
probably more so than any other white elected official mrs 
suzman won the trust and good will of black activists she attended 
funerals of slain militants traveled frequently to black townships 
and in 1987 finished ninth in a poll asking black newspaper readers 
who they would like to see as president 
she also has met several times with imprisoned black nationalist 
leader nelson mandela and repeatedly has called for his release 
in 198586 at the height of political unrest in black 
townships mrs suzman refused to join militant antiapartheid 
leaders in calling for punitive economic sanctions aganst south 
africa she said such measures would make whites more resistant to 
change and prevent blacks from making economic gains that would 
help them acquire political leverage 
i absolutely understand the moral outrage against apartheid i 
share it she said in 1987 but i cannot support the practical 
results of this policy of sanctions 
she received the united nations award of the international 
league for human rights in 1978 and has twice been nominated for 
the nobel peace prize

we find it repugnant said michael wayne the oldest of john 
waynes seven children 
wayne is one of a host of relatives of dead celebrities who want 
the state of new york to give them exclusive rights to the names 
and images of famous family members the relatives testified monday 
at a legislative hearing 
a proposal before the legislature would require the commercial 
media artists and others who want to use the dead celebritys 
persona to get permission it would be up to the relative to decide 
how much the user would have to pay 
the exclusive rights would last 50 years after the celebritys 
death violations would be a misdemeanor 
nine other states including california have such laws but in 
the nations publishing and media center madison avenue has free 
rein when it comes to using dead celebrities as pitchmen 
the public that admired him has a right to have his public 
image protected and who better to protect it than his family 
wayne said of his oscarwinning father 
its not fair that just anybody can walk up and take your 
relatives name and twist it around and do any kind of thing they 
want to do added ilsis nicole holiday sister of jazz singer 
billie holiday 
holiday objected to what she considered a false portrayal of her 
sister in the diana ross movie lady sings the blues 
also at the hearing were robyn astaire fred astaires widow 
julia ruth stevens daughter of babe ruth and everett fields 
grandson of wc fields they brought out books posters and 
trinkets that contained their relatives images 
opponents of the proposal argued that it would impinge on first 
amendment rights to free expression one opponent charged that 
celebrity relatives were out to do some exploitation of their own 
the wrong that these bills appear to redress is that the heirs 
of celebrities evidently do not feel that they are getting enough 
money for the use of the persona of their famous ancestors said 
jerome wilson lawyer for time inc and the magazine publishers of 
america 
it is not enough that they inherit the celebritys mansion 
the bank account and whatever copyright and trademark benefits that 
may have been devised 
wilson added the dead dont have blood and bones theyre 
dead theyre dust thats why they dont have this kind of right

unless the 1989 economy grows more than twice as 
fast as now appears likely the decade of the 1980s will be the 
worst for economic growth since the 1930s 
that startling observation seems to contradict what almost every 
american knows so oft is it repeated that in the 1980s we have 
achieved what is said to be the longest peacetime expansion of the 
century 
the statements dont conflict the expansion now in its 77th 
month may be unmatched in persistence but not in accomplishment 
because so far in the 1980s the us economy has grown at an annual 
average of just 25 percent 
that message was delivered recently to the hartford society of 
financial analysts by john winthrop wright whose approach to 
investing might be called classical or fundamental but who in these 
odd times finds himself a contrarian 
an economic or investment contrarian is one who sees things 
differently and who seeks to use that different perspective to 
protect himself from the madness of the popular mind such as in 
extolling the great expansion 
a tenet of wrights philosophy and of the company he founded 
wright investors service bridgeport conn is to take the long 
perspective lest you be swept into the latest fad or phobia and 
thereby lose your perspective 
that is why he suggests we take a decadelong look at the 
economy rather than lose our minds to the latest figures he 
suggests that 77 straight monthly gains in gross national product 
figures may have created a false impression 
it is true he said that the 1982 recession depressed the 
decades figures and that since that time the economy has grown at 
a 4 percent rate but so what how many decades have escaped a 
recession none 
of course wright continuued the 1970s werent that great 
either after 30 years of economic growth averaging more than 4 
percent a year the country has been growing at just around 25 
percent a year for nearly 20 years 
furthermore he said weve had to work harder to get what 
meager growth weve gotten that is the country has had to put a 
greater proportion of its population to work in order to maintain 
standards to which were accustomed 
for example two of every three civilians are now in the labor 
force and a record 63 percent of civilians are working up from 59 
percent at the beginning of the decade most households have 
multiple breadwinners now 
in other words said wright real gross national product and per 
capita gnp have remained close to the trendline growth in recent 
years only as a result of putting an increasing percentage of the 
population to work 
real gnp per worker is still below the longterm trend line in 
real terms with inflation wrung out hourly earnings are no higher 
than they were 15 years ago 
little wonder said wright that like the red queen from alice 
in wonderland many families feel as if they have to run faster 
just to stay in place 
wrights purpose in describing his perspective was not to 
disparage the accomplishments of those who helped keep the economy 
exapnding but to ask a few questions about the manner in which it 
is now being led 
specifically why has the federal reserve pushed up interest 
rates 
our view he said is that the underlying trend of 
inflation is still under good control and that inflation is 
probably now close to its peak rate for the current business 
cycle 
we should be reminded he said that the united states has a 
long history of moderate inflation averaging just over 3 percent 
for the 20th century to date it is always around if not as a 
reality then as a threat 
slowing the us economy when it is hardly booming seems a 
strange way to deal with inflation caused by bad weather and the 
higher cost of both domestic capital and imported products he 
said 
sooner or later he concluded the federal reserve will see 
the error of its ways in trying to beat down the entire economy in 
order to offset price pressures which are beyond its control

a veteran sheriffs deputy once accused of 
killing three prostitutes walked out of jail with charges dropped 
after additional tests showed that a gun found in his car was not 
used in the killings 
rickey ross 40 broke into tears monday and repeatedly said 
praise the lord and thank god when told of his impending 
release according to don ingwersen ross courtappointed 
investigator 
but the 18year sheriffs veteran remains a suspect in the case 
because of other evidence uncovered during the investigation said 
deputy district attorney william hodgman 
we dont want to exclude mr ross until we investigate all 
possibilities hodgman said it may well result that we can 
dismiss him as a suspect in time at the moment we cant say 
that 
however hodgman said of the ballistics tests i think we can in 
all honesty say that is not the gun 
ross of rialto was arrested feb 23 during a routine traffic 
stop in the crimeridden south central los angeles area he 
allegedly was seated next to a prostitute and a 9mm semiautomatic 
pistol was found in the trunk 
authorities charged ross with three counts of murder feb 27 
after police department ballistics tests were said to have linked 
the gun to the killings of three prostitutes 
ross family and attorney strongly denied his guilt on 
saturday ross released a statement from jail saying i have 
never killed anyone and contending he had witnesses to vouch for 
his whereabouts during the killings 
he said he had put the gun his former service weapon in his 
trunk because it was water damaged and rusted 
by lapds own admission ross said the gun had to be 
forced open to be testfired 
on monday authorities announced that two subsequent ballistics 
tests conducted outside the police department found that the slugs 
that killed the women were fired from the same kind of gun but not 
the weapon found in ross car 
municipal court judge elva soper agreed to dismiss the charges 
which could have brought the death penalty if ross were convicted 
ross joined his wife at an undisclosed location after his 
release from jail 
ross was dismissed from the sheriffs department after his 
arrest sheriffs officials declined to say monday if he would be 
allowed to return to his job

president bushs anticrime proposals place 
him in a crossfire between gun lobbyists who say he went too far 
and lawmakers who say his plans wont stop the shooting on 
americas streets 
the skirmishing erupted monday after the president unveiled 
plans for a permanent ban on imports of many semiautomatic assault 
weapons and a ban on the manufacture of ammunition magazines for 
those guns containing more than 15 rounds 
the proposal is part of a 12 billion anticrime package that 
also calls for building new prisons hiring more federal agents 
widening the death penalty and toughening sentences for illegally 
using semiautomatic guns 
attorney general dick thornburgh defended the program today on 
cbs this morning saying i think it represents a very 
important tangible commitment to law enforcement the war on crime 
is no longer rhetorical in the street language if you cant do 
the time dont do the crime 
therell be a systemwide approach thornburgh said that 
means more agents to investigate crimes more prosecutors to 
prosecute them and most importantly the jails to accommodate 
those who have been convicted of serious violent crimes 
the national rifle association of america the nations largest 
gun lobby fired one of the first volleys at the presidents 
guncontrol plan 
we dont see a heck of a difference between a 15round 
magazine and three fiveround magazines other than about the two 
seconds it takes to change from one to another said james baker 
the nras chief lobbyist in washington thats not going to have 
an effect on criminals 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio sponsor of broader restrictions 
on semiautomatic weapons said he was disappointed that the 
president chose to limit his action to foreignmade guns which 
account for only about 25 percent of us sales 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee also questioned why bush did not propose to 
restrict domestically manufactured militarystyle assault weapons 
if it makes sense to ban the importation of assault weapons 
why doesnt it make sense to ban similar weapons made here in the 
united states biden asked 
sen paul simon dill said bushs assaultweapon proposals 
dont do enough to protect police officers who are going against 
these weapons in urban battle zones 
meanwhile the head of a gunowners group angrily denounced the 
proposal as a backdoor attempt to ban handguns in the name of 
curing the assault rifle problem 
if george bush thinks that american gun owners and other 
clearthinking americans will accept this public relations stunt 
and drop the pressure on him the president is sadly mistaken 
said larry pratt executive director of gun owners of america 
the 15round limit on ammunition magazines would also apply to 
semiautomatic handguns many of which are made overseas said a 
justice department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the proposal comes amid studies showing that semiautomatic 
rifles are being used more often in the commission of crimes 
public furor erupted in january after five children were killed in 
a stockton calif schoolyard by a gunman using a sovietstyle 
ak47 assault rifle 
speaking in the rain outside the us capitol to relatives of 
161 police officers killed last year bush vowed to take back the 
streets from violent criminals with tougher enforcement and 
stiffer penalties 
bush said he would make permanent his twomonthold temporary 
ban on importing semiautomatic assault weapons that are not used 
for sporting purposes 
bush said that most guns are legitimately owned for legitimate 
purposes but that the right to own guns is not a license to 
harm others 
there is substantial controversy and debate bush said 
but one thing that we do know about these assault weapons is that 
they invariably are equipped with unjustifiably large magazines 
he said explaining his proposal to limit magazines to 15 rounds 
bush also proposed doubling the mandatory sentence for using a 
semiautomatic firearm during commission of a violent crime or drug 
felony from five to 10 years 
the presidents plan also would revive the death penalty for 
espionage treason and a wide range of murders by amending existing 
federal laws to conform to supreme court standards for capital 
punishment 
besides reviving those death penalty provisions that have fallen 
into disuse since highcourt rulings of the 1970s the proposal 
would provide capital punishment for a number of other murders 
including killings committed for hire homicides by federal 
prisoners serving life sentences and by terrorists 
the president also sought an extra 1 billion to build an extra 
24000 beds in the nations federal prison system which now holds 
48000 inmates 
the plan also calls for spending an additional 503 million to 
hire 825 federal agents at the fbi the bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms and the us marshals service 
another 496 million would be spent to hire an additional 1600 
federal prosecutors 
civil libertarians are likely to oppose bushs other proposals 
to limit access to the federal courts for state prisoners 
challenging criminal convictions and for a goodfaith 
exception to the rule that excludes improperly seized evidence from 
court

the los angeles central library has reopened 
for business nearly three years after two arson fires destroyed or 
damaged more than 1 million books 
everybodys very excited central library director betty gay 
said on opening day monday its like show time the first day 
the reopening in temporary quarters marked the culmination of 
months of work by 300 librarians and hundreds of volunteers who 
restored the 700000 books damaged by fires in april and september 
of 1986 
much of the damage was caused by water and the books had to be 
freezedried and stored in a refrigerated warehouse to prevent mold 
and mildew 
the librarys temporary home is eight floors of the downtown 
title insurance building until workers complete renovation of the 
landmark library building probably in 1992 
they took so long to open three years said roger fuentes 
a 55yearold retiree and library patron i live nearby and i 
spend my days in the library it fills up my time and at the same 
time i always learn something new 
the first arson fire destroyed 375000 books and caused 22 
million in damage 
the second fire five months later destroyed 25000 books and 
caused another 2 million in damage 
many librarians said monday that working the checkout counter 
again was a lot better than restoring books 
three years of cleaning stacking and inventory said sherie 
sanford shaking her head 
the reopening also will make more books available to the citys 
63 branch libraries which borrow books from the central library 
today is a joyous day said library spokesman bob reagan 
not only for the general public but also for the library system 
itself 
no arrests were made for either fire

activists were freed today after being jailed without charge for 
nearly three years but they were placed under nighttime house 
arrest and barred from political activity 
henry fazzie 65 and mkhuseli jack 31 led community groups in 
port elizabeths black townships that were affiliated with the 
united democratic front a banned antiapartheid coalition they 
were principal organizers of a highly effective black consumer 
boycott of whiteowned stores in 198586 
the two were arrested along with several colleagues in august 
1986 two months after president pw botha declared a national 
state of emergency 
an estimated 30000 activists have been held without charge for 
varying periods during the emergency although all but a few dozen 
have been freed 
fazzie jack and four colleagues were released today from st 
albans prison in port elizabeth ending speculation that the 
government might lodge treason charges against them fazzies wife 
beauty and several other activists were freed last week 
during nationwide black unrest in 1985 port elizabeths 
townships were considered to have among the most militant and 
bestorganized opposition activity 
the consumer boycott which continued through mid1986 
inflicted heavy losses on many white businessmen and prompted the 
local chamber of commerce to engage in negotiations over the black 
communitys grievances 
restrictions imposed on the six men freed today bar them from 
attending any meetings restrict them to their homes between dusk 
and sunrise prohibit them from leaving the port elizabeth area 
and prohibit them from writing articles for publication or granting 
interviews 
human rights groups say restrictions have been imposed on a 
majority of the roughly 900 detainees freed since a wave of hunger 
strikes began in january 
the human rights commission an independent group founded by 
antiapartheid activists alleged monday that the government had 
transferred 10 hungerstriking detainees from johannesburg to 
bloemfontein about 240 miles away 
the government has said previously that detainees who stage 
hunger strikes might be moved to bloemfontein but law and order 
minister adriaan vlok said last week that no such protests were 
being conducted by any detainees 
the human rights commission said the 10 black detainees had gone 
without food or liquids since may 7 it described the transfer from 
johannesburg as an attempt to bully them into submission by 
isolating them

politburo member yegor k ligachev denied 
allegations of involvement in highlevel corruption the novosti 
press agency said today 
ligachev a conservative who is considered a rival of president 
mikhail s gorbachev resolutely denied the allegations made by 
a prosecutor in an election campaign the official news agency said 
ligachev issued the statement to the supreme soviet presidium 
the nations top executive body which already was investigating 
the prosecutor nikolai ivanov for abuses of power 
it was an extraordinary defense by a politburo member of his 
conduct and remarkable in that it was made public in a telex sent 
by novosti to the associated press bureau in moscow the personal 
lives of politburo members are usually shrouded in secrecy and are 
not reported by official soviet media 
ivanov and his boss telman gdlyan became nationally known 
investigating corruption among local officials in the republic of 
uzbekistan the investigation reulted in a 12year jail sentence 
for yuri churbanov the soninlaw of former president leonid i 
brezhnev 
on leningrad television friday night ivanov said their 
investigation turned up the names of ligachev and several other top 
government officials he did not go into details 
ivanov on sunday won a seat in the newly formed parliament the 
congress of peoples deputies 
yegor ligachev has resolutely denied these allegations and 
called the attention of the commission to the fact that the 
slanderous statement was intended as a political provocation 
novosti said 
he insists that the case be thoroughly considered and the 
results reported in the press novosti continued 
a presidium commission was formed to consider citizen complaints 
that the two prosecutors abused their power in investigating 
highlevel corruption the presidium is chaired by gorbachev 
the commission said in the communist party daily pravda on 
saturday that the two prosecutors made provocative statements 
about violations of law by some political leaders and accused 
them of trying to disorient people and interfere with the 
commission 
a separate probe by the supreme court already has determined 
that gdlyan helped convict an innocent man in 1983 in estonia the 
accused an eminent scientist died in jail the supreme court has 
asked the prosecutors office to consider dismissing gdlyan as a 
result of that case 
gdlyan also won election to the new parliament in an earlier 
round both prosecutors garnered overwhelming majorities of votes 
in their districts during the balloting which saw large numbers of 
party loyalists upset by reform candidates

a municipal judge has been given the maximum 
sentence of five years in federal prison for bribery and income tax 
evasion despite pleas by her attorney that her gambling habit made 
her a victim 
i have disgraced my family my profession my child detroit 
recorders court judge evelyn cooper said at mondays sentencing 
i hope that in the future i will be able to forgive myself 
cooper was one of three detroit judges indicted last year on 
bribery charges following a federal investigation 
cooper 47 pleaded guilty to the two charges in march in a plea 
bargain agreement in which extortion racketeering and other income 
tax evasion charges were dropped she could have faced 20 years in 
prison 
she admitted accepting 7000 in bribes to rule in favor of 
defendants and hand down lenient sentences 
defense attorney cornelius pitts called cooper a victim of 
human failing the disease of gambling 
im not going to have my head turned by your pretty little 
words us district judge george woods said saying cooper 
abused her high position of trust and betrayed her community that 
needed her skills so desperately 
us attorney stephen markman said the sentence reflects the 
serious assault on the integrity of the michigan criminal justice 
system and on the public trust 
woods allowed cooper to remain free on bond until june 12 
of the other two judges indicted one pleaded guilty and is 
serving a 10year sentence and the other was acquitted on four

two round sticks of wood connected by a chain possession of the 
weapon is illegal in california

hundreds of thousands of people converged on 
chinas central square today in the most serious challenge yet to a 
government reeling from a month of prodemocracy protests 
it was by far the largest gathering so far in tiananmen square 
where crowds stopped traffic on a sixlane avenue and nearly 
surrounded the adjacent great hall of the people which was 
protected by hundreds of troops and police 
embarrassing chinas communist leaders the protesters about 
3000 of them on a hunger strike since saturday have refused to 
leave the square during the first sinosoviet summit in 30 years 
the added attention from mikhail s gorbachevs visit seems to have 
encouraged them 
a scheduled meeting in the great hall between gorbachev and 
chinas premier li peng was hastily moved to the state guest house 
about 3 miles away as entrances to the hall were clogged with 
students and onlookers 
because of the student occupation officials already had to move 
the official welcoming ceremony for gorbachev from the 100acre 
square on monday and cancel a wreathlaying ceremony today 
government how long will you allow the students to starve 
read a banner carried by journalists of the conservative staterun 
guangming daily one of thousands of redandwhite banners lofted 
by marchers 
more than 350 hunger strikers had been hospitalized suffering 
from dehydration and exposure by late today although some later 
returned after treatment a steady stream of ambulances with 
flashing blue lights entered the square 
observers estimated todays crowd at more than 300000 by far 
the largest crowd since prodemocracy demonstrations broke out on 
april 15 
the students want democratic reform chiefly a free press but 
another condition for ending the hunger strike is a government 
apology for an april 26 newspaper editorial that accused them of 
plotting against the state 
a top party official yan mingfu addressed the students in a 
speech over loudspeakers and said that he supported their demands 
but he said the government needed more time to consider them and 
urged the students to leave fasting students took a hasty vote and 
decided to remain in the square 
protest groups from at least eight newspapers emboldened by the 
students demand for freedom of the press joined the march on the 
square another group of 800 from the chinese academy of social 
sciences was led by a trumpeteer 
we are giving the government a push toward a more democratic 
state said zhang yong who reads the nightly englishlanguage 
newscast on nationwide television 
zhang who wore sunglasses and handed out autographs said his 
colleagues were very very embarrassed by coverage of the 
protests censored by officials 
workers including factory laborers and coal miners were 
prominent in the crowds and employees of at least three government 
ministries also participated 
i saw them the students passing by and i knew i had to 
join them said one worker who refused to give his name 
we want the right to strike said song lou a teacher at the 
workers movement institute 
one group of 60 museum workers dramatically entered the square 
from underneath the huge portrait of mao tsetung that hangs above 
the gate to the adjacent forbidden city once home to chinas 
emperors 
they carried a huge yellow banner reading forbidden city 
workers and chanted democracy democracy 
at least 1000 students also took to the streets in shanghai 
today in support of the hunger strikers in beijing an american 
teacher in the city said 
on tiananmen square more than 1000 medical students and 
doctors set up an emergency tent amid the sprawled bodies of the 
hunger strikers and administered glucose and salt water 
intraveneously to fainting fasters 
we can handle 10 at a time said one medical student 
twelve students had decided last night to stop drinking water 
they are terrible they are lying on ice to keep them cool a 
doctor said two had fainted by late afternoon 
the number of hunger strikers also grew as more people 
including some teachers pledged abstinence until their demands for 
a dialogue with the government and democratic reforms are realized 
students said the strike could go on indefinitely if the numbers 
of participants continues to grow 
the citys emergency medical center sent aspirin and other 
medication for the students almost every hospital in the city was 
involved 
if they are wise the government will give way a doctor said 
one of the strikers mao shijing a philosophy graduate student 
at beijing normal univiersity said sometimes i have a little 
pain sometimes im dizzy yesterday i stood up too fast and i 
fainted by night its cold and by day its hot the worst thing of 
all is the sun beating down on us 
students who have been collecting contributions from 
sympathizers bought umbrellas and hats for the strikers 
the students are demanding recognition of their independently 
formed organizations and a dialogue with the government on such 
issues as press freedom and official corruption 
the government has agreed to talk to representatives of official 
student groups but maintains that the student activist groups are 
illegal

ministry spokesman as saying that the cia had alleged iran was 
involved in the bombing he said the allegations were mere lies 
shortly after the crash an anonynous caller purporting to speak 
for a proiranian group called guardians of the revolution 
telephoned major news organizations in london to claim 
responsibility for the disaster

faction the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command at the behest of iran 
the fronts leader ahmed jibril denied in a us television 
interview april 15 that his group carried out the pan am bombing

over the persian gulf after mistaking it for an iranian fighter 
jet all 290 people aboard were killed

over the scottish town of lockerbie all 259 people aboard were 
killed along with 11 people on the ground 
irna quoted the foreign ministry spokesman as saying that the 
west was using the pan am bombing as a pretext to confront iran 
particularly after the wests defeat in the salman rushdie 
affair 
irans revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in 
february issued a death sentence against the british writer for 
allegedly blaspheming islam in his novel the satanic verses 
that plunged iran into a major confrontation with the west 
tehran claimed that widespread backing for khomeinis action in the 
moslem world amounted to a defeat for the west 
the iranian spokesman accused the united states of being a 
founder and promoter of state terrorism irna said 
he branded the downing of the iran air airbus an act of state 
terrorism irna noted

at 1003 am today chinas senior leader deng 
xiaoping emerged from the eastern hall of the great hall of the 
people and walked slowly along a red carpet to meet his soviet 
guest 
heading toward him was president mikhail s gorbachev who had 
arrived in beijing a day earlier to bury 30 years of enmity between 
the two communist neighbors 
welcome comrade gorbachev i am happy we can meet each 
other deng smiled as he shook the soviet leaders hand for more 
than a minute 
the greeting was cordial if not quite brotherly 
although he called gorbachev comrade deng did not offer the 
bear hug he gives to some foreign dignitaries who are his personal 
friends or from countries close to china 
the two leaders chatted briefly outside the eastern hall with 
deng at one point turning toward a crowd of photographers and 
remarking that the world was interested in the historic meeting 
the two leaders gorbachev in a grey western suit and deng 
wearing a mao suit then entered the ornate room to get down to 
business each sat in a plush chair a table with an elaborate 
flower arrangement between them and two interpreters sitting just 
behind 
deng who at 84 is the grand old man of world communism did 
most of the talking at the beginning lecturing gorbachev a 
generation younger at 58 about problems brought about by the 
superpowers 
at times the soviet leader leaned forward with hands clasped as 
he listened 
although he stuttered and slurred some words as he often does 
dengs voice grew stronger as the conversation progressed 
to be frank the key political problems of the world come from 
relations between the united states and the soviet union said 
deng for many years the special characteristics of that 
situation were such that the arms race continued and did not 
abate 
deng then mentioned gorbachevs 1986 vladivostok speech in which 
he offered an olive branch to china 
i personally could see that your policy had a new content 
said deng 
thank you replied gorbachev 
deng noted that three years had passed since he first relayed 
through romanian president nicolae ceausescu an interest in meeting 
with gorbachev finally we succeeded in coming together he 
said 
you had three obstacles and that is why we needed three 
years replied gorbachev who added with a chuckle one year 
for each obstacle 
the three obstacles have been the soviet military presence in 
afghanistan soviet troop deployment on the chinese border and the 
kremlins support of vietnams invasion of cambodia 
just after authorities began to usher journalsts from the hall 
deng wanted one last word for the record 
because the journalists have not left us we can take this 
opportunity to publicly announce the normalization of relations 
between our two countries he said to applause of officials of 
both countries

george bush earned 156000 from a blind trust 
worth nearly 1 million in his final year as vice president and 
with his wife barbara accepted more than 21000 in gifts a 
financial disclosure form shows 
the gifts ranged from two 75 ties for bush from an official 
with the cocacola co to a gold watch valued at 7800 given to 
mrs bush by the ladies of the senate red cross chapter 
the form indicated the bushes have nonreal estate assets of 
109 million in addition their house in kennebunkport maine 
not required to be listed is estimated to be worth about 1 
million taking their likely net worth past 2 million 
it was the first time that the exact value of bushs trust 
998000 at years end had been disclosed the trust was set up 
in january 1981 when bush a former texas oil executive became 
vice president 
bush was not required to list specific amounts on his holdings 
and income but did so anyway 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
president has proposed in his new ethics package that more specific 
data be provided and he wanted to set an example 
the example was not followed by vice president dan quayle 
however who filed a far less detailed disclosure statement 
quayles filing showing assets held by him and his wife marilyn 
in 1988 when he was a senator representing indiana of no less 
than 440000 and up to 740000 or more 
during his campaign quayle valued his net worth at slightly 
under 1 million 
quayle reported income on holdings of from 18500 to 52000 
he also reported fees for speeches of 52797 of which he donated 
17304 to charities to keep within the federal limit on honoraria 
computing his worth is further complicated because quayles 
major asset his 99 shares and his wifes 40 shares in central 
newspapers inc have no set market value since the company is 
familyowned and the stock is not traded according to his press 
secretary david beckwith 
beckwith said quayle technically was not required to fill out a 
financial disclosure form for 1988 he was between jobs at years 
end but did so anyway beckwith said the one he files next year 
is likely to follow bushs lead in providing greater detail 
bushs report his first as president also showed that earlier 
this year he paid off 49000 in three loans he took out in 1979 
against life insurance policies 
bushs pay as president is 200000 a year quayles salary as 
vice president is 115000 
bush put the value of his share of a houston barge company 
which state documents filed in austin show is a joint business 
venture with secretary of state james a baker iii and commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher at 31000 
bush earned 11962 last year on the investment the financial 
document showed 
other assets listed by bush include 1000 in a white house 
savings account 3000 in an interestbearing checking account in 
kennebunkport 28000 in an individual retirement account for 
himself and 2300 in a companion ira for mrs bush 
the forms also show a life insurance policy on mrs bush with a 
cash value of 13000 
they show that as of dec 31 bush had about 6000 in a regular 
checking account in a washington bank and about 5000 in a 
checking account in houston 
he also listed an 18000 deferred compensation arrangement 
that he will get at age 65 this june from the zapata corp the 
offshore oil drilling company he set up in texas in the late 1950s 
the bushes reported gifts of 21009 in 1988 federal law 
requires that all gifts worth more than 100 be reported and that 
foreign gifts exceeding 180 be returned 
among gifts reported by bush and his wife were 10 country and 
western cassette tapes from mca records worth 100 a 425 pen set 
from peter bentley of parker pens janesville wis and two 
neckties worth 150 from roberto goizueta an executive of the 
cocacola co atlanta 
also a cowboy hat and jacket worth 124 from the houston 
livestock show two pairs of walking shoes from the rockport co

a majority of the elderly persons who are 
familiar with the new catastrophic illness provisions of medicare 
are unhappy with the program according to a survey commissioned by 
a group seeking reduction of the surtax that helps finance the plan 
the coalition for affordable health care a group formed to 
lobby against the law that took effect jan 1 released a poll 
monday which suggests only about 60 percent of the 33 million 
medicare beneficiaries covered by the program are familiar with it 
of that 60 percent the survey found 53 percent said they are 
disenchanted with the new program signed into law last year by 
thenpresident reagan after overwhelming congressional approval 
the program the first major medicare expansion in the programs 
history is designed to protect medicare beneficiaries against 
catastrophic medical expenses by limiting the amount they have to 
pay out of pocket for hospital bills and starting next year 
doctor bills as well 
the basic objections are that the program doesnt cover 
longterm nursing care and costs more than it is worth 
particularly for those with enough income to make them subject to a 
15 percent income tax surcharge to help pay for it 
for more than 60 percent of those eligible for medicare those 
with too little taxable income to have to pay federal income taxes 
the only additional expense this year is a 4a month flat 
premium but for the others the surtax can range up to 800 per 
person per year 
sen john mccain rariz who has introduced legislation to 
delay implementation of the surtax and major parts of the plan that 
have not taken effect said congress has been hit by a 
firestorm of protest from some of the millions who are subject 
to the surtax 
although congressional studies indicate no more than 5 percent 
of those eligible for medicare would be hit by the maximum 
surcharge members of the coalition said they also are receiving 
many complaints from those who would pay lesser amounts 
sponsors of the survey acknowledged that although 72 percent of 
those questioned reported overall incomes of less than 30000 and 
thus would not be subject to the maximum tax pollsters did not ask 
the 1008 people telephoned earlier this month if they knew how 
much of a surtax if any they would have to pay the poll 
conducted by the wirthlin group had a 31 percent margin of error 
tj kilcline a retired navy vice admiral and president of the 
retired officers association acknowledged that most people dont 
really know what theyre going to pay this year because the 1989 
surtax will not be calculated by most until they fill out their tax 
returns next year 
many elderly people who would pay tax if they were still working 
for a taxable wage have little or no federal income tax liability 
because most or all of their income is from taxfree social 
security benefits 
for example 48 percent of those questioned for the poll said 
they had gross incomes below 15000 making it unlikely they would 
be liable for any substantial surcharge if any at all 
for a couple with a taxable income of 10000 after taxfree 
social security benefits and other deductions have been subtracted 
from gross income the catastrophic coverage surcharge would be 
225 or 11250 each 
the maximum 1600 for such a couple 800 each would apply 
to those with a taxable income of at least 53000 such a couple 
already would be paying 10816 a year in income taxes

ministry has final say in the matter 
the rashid case is a major one and the decision on whether he 
should or should not be extradited to the united states will be 
taken by the government that will emerge from the june elections 
justice minister yiannis skoularikis said at a news conference 
the supreme court had put off making a decision three times in 
the sensitive case 
mohammed rashid 39 is accused of planting a bomb on a pan am 
jumbo jet in 1982 a japanese teenager was killed and 15 others 
were wounded in the blast over hawaii 
american officials have described the extradition as a test of 
greeces willingness to fight terrorism

convicted and sentenced on the weapons charge on march 28 after 
guards found a set of makeshift knives in his cell

combination with wpp represented the most attractive course for the 
future of our organization said ogilvys chairman kenneth roman 
but he said after intensive conversations he concluded the deal 
offered the best course for the company and its shareholders 
martin sorrell chief executive of wpp group said hes certain 
the combination will create the finest advertising and marketing 
services group in the world 
at a news conference this morning roman and sorrell said they 
would keep the ogilvy and thompson agencies autonomous roman said 
some ogilvy clients told him theyd like to discuss how the agency 
will be run under the wpp umbrella but none threatened to drop the 
agency as a result of the deal 
sorrell said he first thought about the possibility of acquiring 
ogilvy after meeting with roman in april 1988 but that it took 
nearly a year to decide to make a firm proposal 
sorrell began his pursuit of ogilvy only 2 weeks ago when he 
proposed a buyout at 45 a share 
roman said ogilvy preferred to remain independent and that its 
board would consider the offer in due course 
on may 8 wpp said it had proposed to pay 50 a share for ogilvy 
stock four days later ogilvy said it had entered into formal 
discussions with wpp after the latter indicated it would be willing 
to increase its offer from 50 a share in order to secure a 
friendly agreement 
the agreement would allow the new yorkbased ogilvy group to 
operate autonomously within wpp a fastgrowing conglomeration of 
advertising agencies public relations and marketing services 
concerns 
roman will continue to head the ogilvy operations within wpp 
in an added inducement wpp said it would appoint ogilvy founder 
david ogilvy chairman of wpp group the current wpp chairman john 
symonds will become deputy chairman 
only two years ago wpp stunned the advertising world with its 
uninvited but successful buyout of the parent of another us 
advertising giant j walter thompson that deal had cost 566 
million 
the combination of wpp and ogilvy will produce an advertising 
and marketing services giant that would have had combined billings 
in 1988 of about 135 billion 
that would put it only slightly behind the industry leader 
londonbased saatchi amp saatchi plc which had billings of just over 
135 billion in 1988 according to the trade magazine advertising 
age 
sorrell said he intended to pay for the acquisition by raising 
about 350 million through an issue of convertible preferred stock 
the rest would come from bank loans 
ogilvy founded in 1948 is one of the better known names in the 
advertising business its ogilvy amp mather ad agency has many 
bluechip clients including american express co american 
telephone amp telegraph co and sears roebuck and co

police today rounded up arabs from the gaza 
strip who work in israel and ordered them to return home the first 
such mass sweep during the 17month palestinian uprising 
on israel radio police commissioner david krauss called for 
israeli employers to send palestinian workers home to the coastal 
strip 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the orders were aimed at 
pressuring arabs to halt violence in the israelioccupied 
territories 
the intention is to warn the residents that permission for 
free travel and work in israel are not givens rabin told israel 
radio they depend on the behavior of those who leave for work 
about 50000 arabs from gaza and about 60000 from the west bank 
work in israel 
it was uncertain how many workers were being rounded up most 
were kept at home by a curfew declared monday night in gaza 
requiring all 700000 of the strips residents to stay at home no 
reason was given for the curfew but it was believed linked to the 
recent death of an israeli soldier allegedly at the hands of 
palestinian guerrillas 
under israeli law arabs from gaza and the west bank are not 
allowed to stay in israel overnight but the law is widely skirted 
by workers who sleep in dormitories or their work places 
in jerusalem witnesses reported seeing police checking the 
identities of palestinians at major intersection those from gaza 
were reportedly put in police vehicles for tranport back to the 
strip 
at the erez crossing into the gaza strip hundreds of 
palestinian workers sat on the ground under army guard a witness 
said he said most were brought to the area in israeli taxis and 
then taken by army truck back to gaza 
the uprising has been more violent in the gaza strip in recent 
weeks than in the west bank the smaller gaza strip with few roads 
leading into israel also can be more easily controlled by 
authorities 
also today a palestinian died of gunshot wounds sustained 
earlier in the week in a shootout with police the death of ali 
mahmoud muhammed jabber 23 raised to 476 the number of 
palestinians killed in the uprising twentyone israelis also have 
died 
in gaza city today three palestinians were shot and wounded in 
clashes with troops including a 20yearold who was shot in the 
back arab hospital officials said in the west bank a 22yearold 
man was reported shot by soldiers 
israeli officials meanwhile shrugged off the plos rejection 
of prime minister yitzhak shamirs plan for elections in the 
territories and urged palestinians to take part in the vote 
rabin told israel radio that it would be the only offer of peace 
by the government 
there must be patience rabin said they will understand 
that they have only one alternative and that is based on the 
government plan there is and will be no other alternative 
foreign minister moshe arens today flew to washington to discuss 
the 20point peace plan with secretary of state james a baker iii 
us state department envoy dennis ross was expected in israel 
this afternoon to brief prime minister yitzhak shamir on his 
discussions in egypt and jordan on the plan and to meet with 
palestinian leaders 
the united states has asked israel to clarify whether elections 
would include the 140000 arab residents of jerusalem the nations 
capital and if there would be international supervision of the 
balloting 
the plan overwhelmingly approved by israels cabinet on sunday 
calls for palestinians to elect representatives to negotiate with 
israel on a fiveyear period of limited autonomy with talks in the 
third year on the final status of the territories 
however israel would not negotiate with the plo it also 
opposes formation of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza 
and wants the negotiations to lead to a peace treaty with jordan

with its principal competitor the detroit news says it will 
reduce its staff without layoffs to cut costs 
free press publisher david lawrence jr said monday the staff

tight defense budgets will aggravate such 
current problems plaguing us technology as stiff foreign 
competition overregulation and delays in research an official of 
a congressional agency said today 
alan shaw manager of the office of technology assessments 
international security and commerce program said the oncelarge 
us advantage in a variety of defense technologies has been 
reduced 
the defense technology base is not in crisis shaw told the 
senate armed services subcommittee on defense industry and 
technology but it does face major problems 
among those problems cited in a report released today by the 
office of technology assessment are an increase in the number of 
foreign competitors a vast number of rules and regulations that 
slow the acquisition process and delays in translating research 
into practical use 
in addition these problems will worsen in the face of 
declining defense budgets and the erosion of high technology 
industry in the united states shaw said 
sen jeff bingaman dnm chairman of the subcommittee said 
the united states in this century has convincingly demonstrated 
our superior science and engineering capabilities 
maintaining that lead will require us to change our thinking 
and approach in some key areas we cannot legislate this change 
but we may have to change the legislation to achieve our goals 
bingaman said 
the pentagon now spends about 9 billion a year on a variety of 
technology programs including research exploratory development 
and advanced demonstration 
the laboratories where some of the research is conducted are 
governmentowned and there has been a continuing and in recent 
years rising concern that they are inefficient ineffective 
selfserving and duplicative of industry work and increasingly 
hampered in doing their jobs by the conditions of being part of the 
government the report said 
specifically the report found it takes the pentagon longer to 
translate lab advances in the laboratory into fielded military 
systems that conclusion echoes previous findings by other studies 
of how the pentagon builds weapons 
the report also found that a large amount of technology often 
comes from industries that sell to both military and civilian 
customers 
in many instances these dualuse industries are 
international a situation that creates tough competition for us 
companies and makes the united states more dependent on foreign 
supplies the study found 
us leadership in hightechnology industries that are vital 
to defense is eroding in the face of strong international 
competition the report said 
another problem is the myriad of government rules and laws 
limiting the ability of the pentagon to develop technology the 
report said congress enacted the laws to prevent abuses but the 
vast number have made the technology system slow cumbersome and 
inefficient 
congress should decide if the office of the secretary of defense 
should have greater oversight of the technology programs or 
whether the services should act independently the report said 
in a related development a study by the center for strategic 
and international studies released monday found that almost 100000 
companies stopped doing business with the pentagon over a fiveyear 
period despite an increase in the defense budget 
the report found that in 1982 more than 138000 companies 
provided goods to the defense department but by 1987 the number 
dropped to less than 40000 
some of the 80000 went out of business including about 
20000 small businesses the report said most of the 80000 
firms however simply quit doing business with the defense 
department and opted for other customers 
the report described the dropoff as remarkable in light of 
the increase in the defense procurement budget from 549 billion 
to 87 billion in constant fiscal 1989 dollars 
the study attributed the decline to predatory pricing tactics 
used by the larger companies in some instances those companies 
lowered prices below marginal costs making it impossible for the 
smaller companies to compete 
in addition the report found that in comparison to other 
industries defense is not a highly profitable business 
csis is a private nonprofit think tank which issues studies on 
a variety of national security issues

mikhail s gorbachev and deng xiaoping shook 
hands today and normalized relations between the two communist 
giants while outside their meeting hall hundreds of thousands of 
people chanted for democratic reform 
we can take this opportunity to publicly announce the 
normalization of sinosoviet relations after 30 years deng said 
to applause from soviet and chinese participants in the meeting 
the 84yearold senior chinese leader welcomed gorbachev in the 
redcarpeted eastern hall of the great hall of the people as 
comrade but did not give him the bear hug he reserves for close 
friends and allies 
in the opening minutes of their 2hour meeting he told the 
58yearold soviet president that the worlds key political 
problems have arisen from sovietamerican cold war tensions 
that confrontation he said had helped prevent sinosoviet 
reconciliation but now there may be a turning point in 
competition between the two superpowers and the situation is 
changing from confrontation to dialogue the united states and 
china normalized relations in 1979 
outside in tiananmen square hundreds of thousands of students 
teachers journalists workers and onlookers reminded the leaders 
of momentous change of another sort 
the students who consider gorbachev a hero for the political 
reforms he has championed at home issued appeals for him to take 
up their cause for democratic reforms with chinas leaders 
their fourday occupation of the square chinas symbolic center 
of power forced officials to move an official welcoming ceremony 
for gorbachev on monday as he arrived for a fourday visit 
a planned wreathlaying ceremony was canceled today and the 
protesters later surrounded the great hall halting traffic and 
forcing gorbachevs afternoon meeting with premier li peng to be 
moved to a guest house several miles away more than 3000 students 
have staged a hunger strike on the square since saturday 
one of the student demands is that deng the architect of 
chinas economic reforms step aside they characterize deng as a 
dictator who has served too long and is too old to understand the 
urgency for political reform 
but in a meeting with gorbachev communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang launched into an unusual defense of deng 
saying the party still needs his wisdom and experience 
a foreign ministry spokesman quoted li peng as telling the 
soviet leader china needs a peaceful environment externally and 
a stable environment internally only thus can we accomplish 
modernization 
we do not think that liberty democracy and human rights are 
patent of capitalist countries the premier said adding that 
china is prepared to perfect these aspects in its pursuit of 
political reform 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said deng and gorbachev 
did not discuss the student demonstrations 
he said gorbachev acknowledged that the soviet union had made 
some errors in past dealings with china but the two leaders 
agreed that bygones are bygones what is important is to look 
forward and do more tangible things 
li said the two leaders discussed cambodia where moscowbacked 
vietnamese troops are fighting beijingbacked resistance forces 
they shared some views but did not reach complete agreement he 
said 
the gorbachevdeng summit brought together soviet and chinese 
leaders for the first time since a frosty encounter between nikita 
khrushchev and mao tsetung in 1959 
relations have since been marred by ideological rivalry a 1969 
border war and strong chinese opposition to soviet policy in 
afghanistan and cambodia 
deng said the summit signified the normalization of relations 
between not just the countries but their communist parties which 
had split over chinese complaints of soviet revisionism in the thaw 
following stalins death 
he also praised gorbachevs 1986 speech in the siberian city of 
vladivostok in which the soviet leader appealed for an end to 
chinesesoviet hostility 
all the world and myself could see new content in your policy 
before that we didnt have a new way of thinking deng said 
gorbachev responded before that we did not have a new 
political order 
he said it had taken three years since for a summit to take 
place one year for each obstacle 
the chinese have long said there were three obstacles to better 
relations with moscow the soviet military presence in 
afghanistan soviet troop deployment along the chinese border and 
kremlin support of vietnams invasion of cambodia 
the soviet union pulled out of afghanistan in february and 
gorbachev has announced that soviet forces in asia will be reduced 
by 200000 in addition the vietnamese have promised to pull out 
of vietnam by the end of september 
premier li who spent six years studying engineering in the 
soviet union in the 1950s spoke briefly with gorbachev in russian 
at the beginning of their meeting today he stressed that relations 
between the two powers have been raised to a new high and entered 
a new stage 
deng played host to gorbachev and his wife raisa at a lunch 
student activists whose monthlong protests have posed the most 
serious challenge yet to chinas communist leaders are demanding 
that the government recognize their independent unions and open up 
a dialogue on such issues as allowing a free press and ending 
official corruption 
gorbachevs government has encouraged greater freedom of 
expression at home and has faced mass demonstrations in recent 
months even ethnic violence

not a necktie was in sight at a 
street celebration of carlos menems victory and for good reason 
the charismatic presidentelect has his roots and support in the 
working class 
menems rapport with factory workers gauchos cowboys from 
argentinas rich pampas and others helped return the peronist 
party to power 13 years after it was overthrown in a military coup 
truck driver alejandro galindez 27 who joined thousands of 
other peronists in the streets after menems election on sunday 
said the victory is a return to our roots 
menem defeated eduardo angeloz of the governing party by 78 
million to 61 million votes or 473 percent to 369 percent 
the peronist party also won 67 seats in the chamber of deputies 
to give it 127 overall or exactly one half and one senate seat to 
give it 23 also exactly a half the party controls 17 of 22 
provincial governorships 
president raul alfonsin meanwhile rejected resignation offers 
from his cabinet today and said he wants to meet menem as soon as 
possible to discuss an orderly transition 
presidential spokesman jose ignacio lopez said the eight 
ministers met with alfonsin for 2 hours this morning 
he said they did not consider advancing the date of menems 
inauguration now set for dec 10 
in his victory speech menem called for national unity and 
urged the forces of production businessmen farmers workers 
everyone to put aside differences and set the country in 
motion 
he also pledged an end to the argentina where some live well 
doing nothing and others live badly although they work all day 
the 58yearold governor of tiny la rioja province faces severe 
economic problems when he takes over from the radical civic union 
until then the radicals and peronists must work together but 
that will be difficult given their conflicting views 
alfonsin has tried to balance the budget which is deep in the 
red by selling off state businesses menems preference is to make 
the companies more efficient but keep them in state hands 
the peronists have demanded increases in both the minimum wage 
and federal aid to the provinces alfonsin has tried to hold the 
line on each 
menem specifically has said he will not press alfonsin to step 
down early but hes eager to take power in catamarca province 
where he attended a rally on monday he said we dont want to 
keep administering the crisis we want to confront it and smash 
it 
since february the austral has been devalued by 84 percent 
inflation and interest rates soared to near record levels wages 
shrunk central bank reserves dried up and workers were laid off 
the foreign debt stands at 59 billion 
alfonsin has been widely praised for helping democracy return to 
argentina after the brutal 197683 military dictatorship but 
refuses to step down early 
he has said he is looking forward to argentinas first transfer 
of power to a freely elected successor in 61 years 
menem is a lawyer but he looks more like a 19th century 
caudillo with his his shoulderlength hair and muttonchop 
sideburns 
the politician who likes to drive race cars and be photographed 
with showgirls was born and raised in la rioja a poor arid and 
sparsely populated province of 200000 people about 700 miles 
northwest of buenos aires 
the regions principal products are olives grapes and jojoba 
the son of syrian immigrants who came to argentina early in the 
century and built a prosperous vinyard and winery menem was 
educated in provincial public schools 
graduating from law school in 1955 one of his first cases was 
the defense of peronists arrested following the military ouster of 
party founder juan peron in september 1955 
although the peronist party was barred from political activity 
menems law office quickly became a provincial peronist meeting 
place and he was arrested for participation in a political 
demonstration 
a natural showman menems star rose rapidly and after almost 
two decades of work with the party he was elected to the first of 
his three terms as governor of la rioja in 1973 
although his parents were moslems menem converted in 1964 to 
roman catholicism the religion of most argentines and required by 
the constitution for all presidents his wife zulema also of 
syrian origin has said she prefers to remain a moslem 
its easy for me to communicate with people menem has said 
i talk with everyone i feel at home in the most humble places

employers who project worker absenteeism 
through race gender or age comparisons are making invalid 
assumptions as well as discriminating a researcher said tuesday in 
releasing a study that said employees who smoke or drink dont miss 
work more than those who dont 
while simple comparisons of the absentee rates of men and women 
for example would show women miss work slightly more than men a 
variety of other variables make such information useless to an 
employer trying to determine if a given job applicant is likely to 
have a poor attendance record said the study by the national 
chamber foundation the research arm of the us chamber of 
commerce 
simply because an individual is a member of a group women 
minorities consumers of alcohol consumers of tobacco simply 
because you can look at the average incidence of absence among 
those groups tells you nothing about the particular behavior of 
individuals in those groups study director carlos e bonilla 
said 
even when a number of variables about a job applicant are 
considered the foundation said there is still no statistically 
supportable formula that would allow employers to identify 
applicants who pose a risk of high absenteeism 
instead employers should rely on their subjective opinion of 
applicants and if possible conduct thorough background checks 
including references from former employers the latter task has 
become increasingly difficult in recent years because employers are 
hesitant to provide adverse information about former workers out of 
a fear of lawsuits even if the information conveyed is accurate 
while smoking and drinking cannot be statistically associated 
with absenteeism physical activity did prove to be a significant 
factor the study said 
more physically fit individuals experience fewer work 
absenteeism and employer initiatives that increase the level of 
physical activity among the work force may indeed have a positive 
effect on employee absenteeism it said 
the foundation based its results on 33000 responses to surveys 
conducted in 1983 and 1985 by the federal governments national 
center for health statistics all of the respondents included in 
the study were 18 years of age or older and had jobs 
the study was released a week after the center using some of 
the same data released a study of its own saying sickness keeps 
women away from work about one day more a year than men while the 
authors of that report gave no reason for their finding a 1985 
labor department study said women have higher rates of absenteeism 
in their childbearing years 
the foundation did not dispute those findings saying that when 
gender was the only variable in determining absenteeism women were 
more likely to miss work than men 
in other singlevariable comparisons the study found the 
probability of work loss 
dropped with increases in age 
dropped as education levels rose 
was higher among married workers 
was lower among nonwhites 
was lower as family income increased 
bonilla said those variables were chosen because such 
information is readily available to employers when considering job 
applicants but no variable by itself can provide anything more 
than a generalization about a given group and that generalization 
cannot be projected to an individual applicant he said 
the conventional wisdom based on broad aggregations of 
individuals is inappropriate for use in evaluating the work loss 
behavior of a particular applicant the report said 
even if all of an individuals traits were combined no 
clearcut trends relating to absenteeism develop bonilla said 
in reality groups defy objective comparison bonilla said 
of three lifestyle characteristics examined by the study 
smoking drinking and physical activity only physical activity 
was found to have a statistically significant impact on work 
attendance 
the chamber group said employers who took an applicants race 
gender or age into account when trying to determine likely work 
attendance a key variable in profitability not only would be 
violating antidiscrimination laws but also would be using a faulty 
theory that may very well deprive the employer of well qualified 
employees

whether it is called pima cotton or extralong 
staple cotton the fiber els is a rapidly growing crop that is 
demanding top prices from discriminating textile manufacturers 
around the world 
in the united states market prices for els have been high 
enough the last two years so that the agriculture department hasnt 
had to make deficiency payments to growers 
for example last week the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service announced the average market 
price for els cotton was 115 per pound the target price for 1988 
els was 957 cents per pound meaning growers wont get any price 
subsidies 
upland cotton which accounts for most us production averaged 
565 cents per pound last year well below the 1988 upland target 
of 759 cents which meant millions of dollars in deficiency 
payments to farmers 
the usda generally calls it els but notes that american pima is 
the betterknown name everyone agrees that pima or els is a 
special kind of cotton having a fiber lint measuring generally 
138 inches to 134 inches long the international cotton 
advisory committee traditionally defines extralong staple as 138 
inches or longer 
from a total cotton production standpoint els is puny the us 
cotton harvest last year was about 154 million bales with more 
than 15 million bales of that comprised of upland cotton the 
shorterstaple fiber that is grown commercially in at least 17 
states from georgia to california 
but the 338200 bales of els cotton in 1988 was a record output 
and another increase is expected this year in 1983 us 
production was 94700 bales 
a report by priscilla a andrew of the departments foreign 
agricultural service says there are a number of els varieties grown 
in the world including american pima egyptian giza sudanese 
barakat peruvian israeli pima and indian as well as some in 
china and the soviet union 
this year according to a recent survey els growers plan to 
boost plantings sharply again to 291000 acres from 187400 acres 
in 1988 
arizona is the biggest els producer followed by texas and new 
mexico but it is also being introduced into the san joaquin valley 
area of california 
on a global basis the report said egypt is the biggest 
producer of long and extralong staple cotton considered by some 
to be the finest in the world most of the worlds supply of els is 
used in yarns requiring high strength and fineness 
it is used primarily in high quality sewing thread fine 
broadcloths and specialty yarns for lace and knitted goods the 
report said els is also used in products to enhance their 
appearance and feel 
for example the report said els can be used in dress shirts 
and sheets and towels where a luxurious feel and appearance plus 
durability and strength are desirable most of the worlds els 
exports go to europe and the far east 
the first els cotton was introduced into the united states in 
1786 from seed received from the bahamas it was called sea island 
cotton and was the finest longest and most valuable cotton grown 
in the world the report said production was confined to the 
coastal lowlands of south carolina georgia and florida 
always commanding premium prices sea island cotton sold for as 
much as 110 to 125 per pound in 1825 when upland cotton was 
selling for 9 to 25 cents the report said it was produced for 
export only with most going to europe 
but by 1924 the destructive boll weevil had taken its toll and 
sea island cotton had died out 
the first commercial strains of els appeared in the united 
states about 1912 during world war i els was needed for 
airplanes balloon cloth and machine belts where high tensile 
strength was essential 
egyptian cotton failed in the old cotton belt because of the 
short growing season the report said consequently experimental 
farms were located in arizona on the gila indian reservation of the 
pima tribe pima cotton became one of arizonas most important 
crops

private exporting companies have told the 
agriculture department that the soviet union has bought an 
additional 450000 metric tons of us corn for delivery this year 
under a longterm supply agreement 
the corn is scheduled for delivery by sept 30 the end of the 
sixth year of a longterm grain supply agreement between the soviet 
union and the united states 
officials said monday the latest sales boosted total us corn 
and wheat sales to the soviets in 198889 to a record level of 
nearly 199 million tons including more than 155 million tons of 
corn and 431 million tons of wheat 
additionally sales include 443400 tons of soybeans 137 
million tons of soybean meal and 807400 tons of grain sorghum 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 450000 tons of 
corn would be about 177 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 258 per bushel at the 
farm level according to the latest usda fiveday average meaning 
the latest sale could have a farm value of around 46 million 
wheat sales to the soviet union have been subsidized under the 
departments export enhancement program but the corn and other 
commodities are not subsidized

cultural arts and operates on a 1 million annual budget 
were it not for the fact that the mexican culture itself is 
very strong here the cultural arts would not have survived but it 
just barely did and i think the creation of this institution is 
very timely said rodriguez a former university professor who 
took over the guadalupe cultural arts center in 1983 a year after 
it was formed 
now we have hundreds of artists yearly that we support 
directly through contracts and through the training that we provide 
for about 900 students per year and the art and cultural events 
throughout the community 
but the center hopes to preserve more than just cultural arts 
it also hopes to improve the areas social and economic environment 
the center and the avenida guadalupe development association a 
nonprofit economic development agency are transforming a 
threeblock area around the guadalupe theater from a dilapidated 
barrio dominated by bars and shacks to a medical retail and 
entertainment showplace that will serve one of the citys oldest 
hispanic neighborhoods 
i think all this construction and all the changes are going to 
help everyone here said 48yearold roger mercado a lifelong 
resident of the guadalupe area i think all the art coming out of 
here also will help us communicate with the rest of the community 
the guadalupe theater opened in the 1939 served as host for 
hundreds of spanishlanguage plays and movie premieres until it 
fell into disrepair in the early 70s in 1979 performing and 
visual arts groups banded together to better secure funding for 
hispanic arts by 1982 the group was known as the guadalupe 
cultural arts center a year later the city provided 1 million 
for renovation of the guadalupe theater which by then was being 
used as a flea market 
rodriguez said the centers 17member staff has had to use all 
types of marketing techniques to attract not only those in the 
neighborhood but many nonhispanics who are weary of traveling to 
an area surrounded by housing projects 
there is a certain image about coming to this side of town 
that we have to get people past and that was that it was not safe 
to come over here but thats not true once they get over here we 
know we have them hooked and i think everyone in the community is 
pretty proud of what is happening here rodriquez said 
the guadalupe theater now holds art exhibitions in its foyer 
gallery brings in foreign and artistic films and is home to the an 
antonio cinefestival a hispanic film festival in its 13th year 
its other major event is the tejano conjunto festival a fourday 
event now in its eighth year which will bring in hundreds of 
artists and thousands of spectators to hear accordianplaying 
musicians 
the theater also is home to the theatre arts program which 
produces up to four bilingual plays a year through its resident 
company los actores de san antonio the actors of san antonio 
the centers visual arts program annually sponsors about nine 
exhibits with emphasis on hispanic and native american artists in 
the summer it provides a free weekly outdoor film festival in 
guadalupe plaza 
the centers literature program offers poetry and fiction 
readings and annually sponsors a bookfair this years major 
presenters are pulitzer prize winner alice walker the color 
purple and mexican poet octavio paz 
classes for adults and children are offered in all the various 
arts programs at the center and 15 other locations across the city 
we work out of very makeshift kinds of situations the only 
thing that we do have that is firstrate is the theater but 
everything else that we do we do on a shoestring and in poor 
conditions rodriguez said 
but our vision centers around the creation of an institution 
that will be anchored in bedrock here to stay forever to provide 
services so the mexican arts culture continues to subsist and 
flourish 
there are plans for a 50000squarefoot classroom and office 
building next to the theater rodriquez also envisions use of the 
former progreso theater across the street from the guadalupe as a 
rehearsal and reception hall 
those developments would add to area renovations by the 
development association which built guadalupe plaza and plans to 
open a 48stall mexican market later this spring a private drug 
store and medical complex already are operating next to the plaza 
the avenida guadalupe development association has spent 75 
million in the past decade renovating three city blocks surrounding 
the guadalupe theater 
this neighborhood was one of the pride and joys of san 
antonio but because of demographic and social changes it began to 
deteriorate in the 1960s and 70s said david garza executive 
director of the development agency 
we are just trying to revitalize the area and change the 
conditions of the neighorhood to attract the businesses and the 
families or otherwise we are going to see this neighborhood die 
away garza said

a prosecutor today urged an allwhite jury 
to convict a former ku klux klansman of murder for providing the 
rope used to hang the body of a young black man from a tree after a 
klan slaying 
he had been murdered for a horribly simple reason he was 
black said district attorney chris galanos 
galanos statement came in opening statements in the murder 
trial of benjamin franklin cox 27 he is accused of being an 
accomplice in the 1981 beating and strangulation death of michael 
donald a 19yearold black who was picked at random for abduction 
and killed donalds body was strung up in a tree 
attorneys for cox a truck driver struck all 21 blacks among 
the 60 prospective jurors monday 
two other klansmen already are serving prison sentences in the 
slaying as a result of an fbi investigation that led to the first 
arrests in 1983 
the killing led to a 7 million jury verdict in 1987 against the 
united klans of america the nations biggest klan organization 
the victims mother beulah mae donald was awarded klan property 
in tuscaloosa she died last year 
galanos described a klan meeting in mobile two nights before the 
donald killing saying the white supremacist group discussed 
killing a nigger the district attorney apologized for the 
language but said it would reappear in the trial 
defense attorney neil hanley urged the jury to judge cox as an 
individual not as a former member of the hooded empire the lawyer 
said the states entire case is klan klan klan 
the murder charge against cox does not include the possibility 
of a death sentence 
coxs brotherinlaw henry francis hays was convicted of 
capital murder in 1983 and sentenced to death that conviction is 
on appeal james tiger knowles pleaded guilty in federal court 
to violating donalds civil rights he was sentenced to life in 
prison in a plea bargain that required his testimony against hays 
and cox 
cox was indicted in 1985 for murder conspiracy but that charge 
was dropped because the legal deadline to bring the charge had 
expired he was tried last year on a murder charge and that 
proceeding ended in a mistrial when coxs codefendant bennie jack 
hays collapsed in front of the jury 
bennie hays the 72yearold father of henry hays is expected 
to be tried later 
donald was picked at random off a mobile street at night and 
killed to show klan strength in alabama in an act of revenge after 
a jury did not convict a black defendant in the killing of a white 
policeman according to testimony

a cuban family denied reentry to this 
country since a christmastime trip to canada for a better view of 
niagara falls returned to the united states today hopeful of 
rebuilding their life in florida 
i feel like i have been born again carlos fajardo said 
after clearing customs in buffalo i have no bitterness i am 
thankful for the people who helped us and looking forward to 
returning home 
fajardos wife bermaida leaped out of their car after passing 
through a border checkpoint she shouted and embraced her children 
and a friend 
i have no words to describe how happy i feel mrs fajardo 
said 
members of the cuban family received word monday that us 
immigration officials had granted them political asylum the move 
ends a bureaucratic nightmare that began last christmas when the 
family crossed into canada on a sightseeing trip 
theyre absolutely elated said sister kathleen rimar the 
familys attorney yet they realize that theyll have to start 
all over again 
us immigration officials announced monday that the family had 
been granted political asylum 
fajardo his wife bermaida and her two children yoradlys and 
yoandys were on a vacation and had traveled north to see snow 
they said they crossed the rainbow bridge into ontario on dec 
23 to get a better view of the falls they were denied reentry to 
the united states because they lacked proof of citizenship 
later immigration officials determined the family had a history 
of immigration fraud benedict ferro district director of the 
immigration and naturalization service was adamant about not 
letting the family return saying to do so would be an affront to 
millions of people waiting to enter lawfully 
fajardos request for a humanitarian parole was rejected by 
ferro in march 
meantime members of miamis hispanic community and sen bob 
graham dfla appealed to the ins on behalf of the family saying 
they were responsible members of the community who owned a home and 
a business 
the children ages 9 and 12 attended school in miami 
after an application for asylum and subsequent ins 
investigation ferro said he could overlook the history of fraud 
because they had a legitimate fear of being persecuted if they 
returned to cuba 
but its not without mixed feelings that were allowing them 
back ferro said there was some blatant fraud involved 
ins officials said fajardos wife used phony documents to enter 
the country illegally in 1985 she and the two children from 
another marriage were ordered deported by an immigration judge in 
august 
sister rimar a catholic charities worker said she thought ins 
officials had tried to make an example of the fajardos 
i think they could have allowed them back a lot sooner she 
said 
the family apparently has lost their home car and boatbuilding 
business during the five months in canada where they subsisted on 
charity

they came tuesday by the hundreds of thousands 
by bus and bike on foot and on trains doctors lawyers miners 
oil riggers government officials and journalists to support 
3000 college students fasting for freedom in tiananmen square 
officials from the staterun labor union were there making a 
daring call for a union free of government control eight 
newspapers and the xinhua news agency also joined in demanding a 
free press and an end to censorship 
reporters from the china central television station marched and 
said they wanted ai zhisheng to resign as minister of radio film 
and television 
he stops us from reporting the news kick him out said one 
reporter i dont care if i lose my job how can i return to the 
old ways now that i feel we are so close to freedom 
composers and singers from the beijing song and dance troupe 
also played their role fighting what they said was the death of 
chinese culture 
the leaders told us not to come out today but we had to 
said one composer any chinese person with any conscience is out 
today those students are dying for democracy and the government is 
doing nothing 
several hundred high school students tagged along in two 
years we will become you read their banner 
the protest by an estimated 300000 people which ringed 
tiananmen in a sea of banners was unprecedented and marked the 
high point of more than one month of demonstrations led by an 
increasingly powerful student movement that wants a freer and more 
democratic china 
the last time workers came out in force was april 27 when 
thousands of laborers pushed and shoved their way through lines of 
unarmed police opening a way for marching students 
but tuesday they came to pay their respects at tiananmen square 
where more than 3000 increasingly weak students have been on a 
hunger strike for three days and unlike last time they 
identified themselves with the huge red and white banners that have 
become a hallmark of these demonstrations 
government how long will you allow the students to starve 
read a banner carried by journalists of the conservative staterun 
guangming daily 
we wont be silent anymore read another sported by labor 
union officials 
the students were moved by the march 
mama i cant come home when all these people are here for 
us said a young woman weeping into a public telephone they 
are wonderful 
the students are demanding the government recognize their 
independent student union and conduct a dialogue about democratic 
reforms 
tuesdays demonstration highlighted the role students play as 
instigators of change in chinas modern history 
ever since may 4 1919 when beijing students marched against 
concessions made to the japanese after world war i and began the 
may fourth movement chinese have looked to the students for 
inspiration 
the students dare to speak and to act said a miner one of 
600 who marched to the square they are the spark we are the 
fire 
talk to the students talk to the students chanted a group 
of engineers and oil riggers from the ministry of petroleum 
the ministry was one of several government bureaus including 
the seismological institute and the ministry of aeronautics and 
astronautics industry represented in the march 
government officials said they did not care about punishment 
punish me and my comrades said one official at the 
aeronautics ministry and then punish the rest of the country 
those old methods dont work 
pan kang and about 200 high school teachers from hebei province 
traveled about 140 miles by train to beijing we heard about the 
students fasting in the square he said they are speaking for 
us and suffering for us we had to express our support 
about 160 doctors from two hospitals bicycled to the square to 
express their concern these children worry me i think of them 
as my own said a bespectacled doctor in his 50s i dont want 
to see any of them sick but i believe in their struggle 
clothed in a ripped tshirt the words democracy and 
freedom scrawled on his back businessman wang xiafeng adjusted 
his position on the threewheeled cart and shouted down with 
bureacracy down with corruption 
the ragtag beijing city peoples group a newly formed protest 
group shouted back 
i am afraid of these people most of all said one passerby 
as the group of mostly jobless youths marched by they are very 
angry

the united states is asking latin 
american nations to withdraw their ambassadors from panama in a bid 
to force the ouster of military strongman gen manuel antonio 
noriega diplomatic sources say 
in washington administration officials said evacuation flights 
from panama will be offered beginning today to all us military 
dependents who wish to leave 
in panama diplomatic sources who spoke monday on condition of 
anonymity said washington is circulating a petition among the 
regions leaders in anticipation of an organization of american 
states meeting wednesday in washington 
the oas meeting was called to discuss the panamas contest 
national elections and the opposition has called for a general 
strike in panama to coincide with the gathering 
in a communique pubished today panamas labor ministry declared 
the strike illegal because it was inspired by political motives 
not labor issues the communique did not specify what might happen 
to those who take part in the strike 
a lawmaker on state radio today accused the opposition of timing 
the strike to damage panamas image abroad 
rigoberto paredes an influential national legislator and 
militant noriega backer claimed noriegas departure is not 
negotiable 
he also said the proposed general strike is intended to create 
disorder in the streets to a degree that the united states can use 
it to justify direct physical intervention in panama 
a diplomatic withdrawal would be part of a general condemnation 
of the noriegabacked government which nullified the may 7 
presidential elections 
international observers have said that opposition candidate 
guillermo endara clearly won the election endara and one of his 
running mates were beaten with metal pipes by noriega supporters 
last wednesday 
the united states venezuela and mexico have already recalled 
their envoys and one diplomatic source said venezuela would ask the 
oas to demand that the panamanian government immediately recognize 
the results of the elections 
the opposition is demanding it be declared the winner 
government candidates have accepted the decision of the electoral 
tribunal and have refused to make any other public comments 
us ambassador arthur davis left panama on monday after 
accusing noriega of ordering his men to try to kill one of the 
opposition leaders second vice presidential candidate guillermo 
ford in wednesdays assault 
i leave panama with a heavy heart but with great hope 
davis told a news conference before leaving from howard air base a 
us military installation near panama city the panamanian 
people have repeatedly been victimized by noriegas brutality yet 
they are heartened by their election victory 
davis said the attack on ford during an opposition march was 
meant to kill endara has been hospitalized with head injuries 
but was to be released today 
ford called on monday for the ouster of noriega and said any 
talks with the military over a possible solution must center on a 
definite point of departure date and time and flight number for 
panamas de facto ruler 
he also said a solution must include recognition of the 
oppositions electoral victory 
ford said he agreed that the attack on him was an assassination 
attempt but that he did not know whether noriega had ordered it 
as davis asserted 
the us government has been trying to oust noriega since he was 
indicted by a florida grand jury in february 1988 on 
drugtrafficking charges 
it accuses him of repression and has called on the panamanian 
defense forces to oust him 
noriega can talk to the united staes about his problems with 
drug charges ford said but he will have to talk to us about 
his problem with us and thats a hell of a big problem

on the eve of a major international conference 
on the panama crisis us officials believe the position of 
military leader manuel antonio noriega has been severely weakened 
hes in trouble said us ambassador arthur davis who 
returned home monday for an indefinite stay as part of a series of 
measures taken by president bush in response to fraud allegations 
and violence surrounding last weeks panamanian election 
organization of american states foreign ministers meet here on 
wednesday to determine whether a common stand is possible on the 
panamanian situation 
it will be the first special meeting of oas foreign ministers 
since the falklandmalvinas crisis of 1982 
meanwhile the house foreign affairs committee today approved on 
a voice vote a resolution condemning noriegas reprehensible 
actions in thwarting the election and calling on him and the 
panamanian military to recognize endara as president 
despite these deplorable efforts to thwart the will of the 
panamanian people all credible panamanian and international 
observers have recognized guillermo endara as the indisputable 
winner of the election stated the nonbinding resolution which 
was expected to be approved later in the day by the full house 
the statement also endorsed the careful and prudent policy 
steps taken by bush as an appropriate and measured response to 
the crisis in panama 
given the international outcry against noriegas actions us 
officials were cautiously optimistic that a strong stand in the oas 
will be taken 
panamanian officials already have indicated that they plan to 
try to portray the situation in panama as the product of us 
interventionism a noriegacontrolled tribunal annulled the 
election results last week claiming outsiders had compromised the 
balloting 
a panamanian envoy carlos russell has alleged that the us 
government has engaged in economic aggression against panama and 
spent 10 million in support of opposition candidates during the 
presidential campaign 
davis refused to comment monday when asked about the allegations 
at least two dozen countries have spoken out against noriega 
since the returns from the may 7 elections were tossed out amid 
charges of fraud and the beating of opposition candidates during an 
antigovernment demonstration 
there is no possibility of oas sanctions against noriega but 
nonetheless us officials believe an oas statement condemning 
noriega combined with his weakened position domestically could 
hasten his eventual departure 
davis spoke to reporters at andrews air force base on monday 
after a flight from panama he said there are increasing signs that 
noriegas situation is becoming untenable 
one is that the government appears to lack the resources to pay 
civil service employees he said another is that the nominal head 
of government president manuel solis palma has disappeared from 
public view since the election 
before departing from panama davis accused noriega of directing 
an attack on the life of guillermo ford a vice presidential 
candidate in the may 7 election 
after his arrival here davis elaborated on his allegation 
with ford prostrate on the floor of an automobile and a 
bodyguard lying on top of him for protection a member of an armed 
progovernment force known as the dignity battalion opened fire 
into the vehicle davis said the bodyguard was killed 
you dont put a gun into the side of an automobile and fire at 
the people in it unless youre planning to kill somebody davis 
said 
asked about the link to noriega davis replied well theyre 
his men nobody else ordered it except noriega the dignity 
battalions are under his control 
the dignity battalions davis said have about as much dignity 
as a rat 
the battalions have been widely portrayed as young unemployed 
thugs hired by the panamanian government but davis said some were 
panamanian defense force personnel in disguise 
davis said us officials have photographs showing pdf personnel 
changing into dignity battalion garb on the day ford and other 
opposition candidates were attacked

czechoslovakia said tuesday it has 
protested hungarys decision to halt a joint hydroelectric project 
on the danube river and it may demand compensation from budapest 
rude pravo the communist party newspaper said foreign minister 
jaromir johanes summoned hungarian ambassador miklos barity on 
monday to receive the protest the dispute is the latest indication 
of declining relations between the warsaw pact allies 
gyula horn the hungarian foreign minister said monday his 
government would examine all environmental implications of the 
joint project hungary ordered a halt saturday on its part of the 
nagymaros dam 
if previously unforeseeable ecological consequences are 
found horn said hungary reserves the right to renegotiate the 
agreement with czechoslovakia 
opposition to the project has grown for months in hungary where 
unofficial groups are gaining a bigger say in politics 
czechoslovakia has given no publicity to possible environmental 
problems which it says those were addressed before the project was 
agreed upon in 1977 
its part of the project a dam and power station at gabcikovo 
40 miles east of bratislava is expected to be finished in july 
those installations have cost czechoslovakia about 11 billion 
but will not be able to operate as planned without nagymaros which 
is only about half finished 
this onesided step by the hungarian government means a threat 
to the whole objective the government protest said 
the decision by the hungarian government was made without 
negotiation this violated the agreed procedure for solving 
controversial issues therefore the czechoslovak government insists 
that construction should continue 
if the nagymaros dam is not built it said czechoslovakia may 
demand compensation under provisions of the 1977 agreements 
horns statement indicated however that hungary would insist 
on renegotiating the agreement rather than paying compensation 
under the old one 
relations became touchy last month after hungarian television 
interviewed alexander dubcek the czechoslovak communist party 
chief who led the prague spring liberalization of 1968 which 
was crushed by a sovietled invasion

nations that profess nonalignment begin 
planning their ninth summit wednesday but some question whether 
the group still has a purpose now that east and west appear to be 
getting together 
the 101member movement was formed in yugoslavia in 1961 with 
president tito as a founder to offer an alternative to the power 
blocs led by the united states and soviet union the next summit is 
scheduled for september in yugoslavia 
discussions at the threeday meeting to set the summit agenda 
are expected to focus on third world conflicts mounting foreign 
debt south african racial policies superpower efforts on arms 
reduction and the plo declaration of an independent palestinian 
state 
it was scheduled as a meeting of foreign ministers but 
conference sources said no more than 30 were expected to attend 
which strengthened the argument by critics that the organization 
lacks relevance to international politics 
president robert mugabe is chairman of the nonaligned movement 
those who say the movement no longer has a role note that the 
superpowers not the nonaligned nations were responsible for 
recent easing of crises in the third world withdrawal of soviet 
forces from afghanistan and a regional peace pact promising 
namibian independence from south africa 
a committee was formed last year to determine why the movement 
seems to be stagnating its findings and recommendations have not 
been revealed 
an asian delegate told the associated press theres too much 
rhetoric and not enough action the soviet bloc and the west bloc 
get things done without too much talk 
draft recommendations for the foreign ministers and other 
delegates to consider include 
promoting a ban on nuclear weapons tests 
condemning south africa for acquiring a nuclear weapons 
capability with the alleged help of western powers and israel 
denouncing the west for supporting south africa 
diplomatically economically and militarily 
supporting a broadbased government in afghanistan 
backing for efforts toward international peace talks on the 
middle east 
supporting the palestine liberation organization declaration 
of an independent state 
criticizing the united states for destabilizing actions and 
coercive economic measures against panama 
among the first issues up for consideration is a disagreement in 
latin america about efforts by panama to prevent admission of 
venezuela as a member 
panamas delegation accused venezuela of plotting to overthrow 
its government no details were revealed of the alleged plot 
against gen manuel antonio noriega panamas de facto ruler who 
commands the military and police 
last week panama said president carlos andres perez of 
venezuela had been in touch with panamanian army officers urging 
them to overthrow noriega 
the movements coordinating bureau meeting in new york in 
march recommended that venezuela be admitted a venezuelan 
delegation is expected to attend the harare meeting

the united states government has decided to 
offer evacuation flights from panama to all military dependents who 
wish to leave starting today administration officials said 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman said some dependents 
of military servicemen and us embassy workers already had 
departed panama on space available seats on military transports 
over the last few days 
but howard and other officials who asked not to be named said 
the defense department was now launching a much broader effort 
using chartered commercial planes in addition to the military cargo 
planes that have been ferrying extra troops to panama 
howard insisted several times at a briefing the movement of 
military dependents was not an evacuation but rather an 
accelerated drawdown 
the word evacuation suggests a nearpanic withdrawal and thats 
not what is happening now in panama howard said 
the spokesman said he didnt know how frequently flights would 
operate and to which cities in the united states they would run 
but a spokesman at the charleston sc air force base said today 
that at least some flights would be using that city as a point of 
entry 
lt lester t carroll jr the spokesman said the first of at 
least two evacuation flights of dependants from panama was 
scheduled for arrival in charleston tonight carrying between 200 
and 300 people 
there are about 14000 dependents of service personnel and 
defense department employees living in panama 
according to howard the pentagon and the us southern command 
which is headquartered in panama have decided that all socalled 
commandsponsored dependents will either be living inside us 
bases or transported home by july 1 
the pentagon announced monday that that all command 
sponsored military families those who are there under official 
us government sponsorship had moved inside us military bases 
in panama under an emergency order 
but there are not enough houses on the bases for those who had 
been living off base about 1396 people to stay there 
permanently howard said so while the evacuation flights are 
currently voluntary some dependents may face orders to fly home if 
not enough volunteer the spokesman said 
of the roughly 14000 military dependents in panama 3081 live 
off base of that total 1396 are command sponsored and 1685 are 
not the families who are not command sponsored have been urged to 
move to one of the 10 us military installations in panama but 
cannot be forced to do so 
howard said today the flights home were being offered to all 
military dependents in panama including those who were not 
officially sponsored by the military and had decided on their 
own to live there with a husband or wife 
howard said the administration wanted to launch its drawdown 
because of the difficulty of forecasting the actions of the noriega 
government gen manuel antonio noriega the strongman behind that 
government staged and then declared void a popular presidential 
election a week ago when it became clear his candidate had lost 
president bush subsequently ordered almost 2000 additional 
troops to panama to ensure the safety of american citizens

boston universitys 5600 seniors are taking a 
final lesson in supply and demand with some scalping tickets to 
this weekends commencement featuring president bush and frances 
president francois mitterrand 
tickets reportedly are going for as much as 100 
about 30000 people 10000 more than usual are expected at 
the ceremony for which each senior was allotted four tickets 
we havent had to use a system like this in the past because 
weve been able to accommodate everyone but the students response 
this year has been overwhelming bu executive vice president jon 
westling said tuesday 
for the most part students say their parents wouldnt dream of 
missing graduation or the chance to watch two world leaders in 
academic robes collect honorary degrees 
but for some seniors whose families are small or eagerness to 
make a buck is great the opportunity for a little wheeling and 
dealing is attractive 
we think that it would have been preferable for students who 
werent going to be needing tickets to have turned them back so a 
fair allocation procedure could have been used westling said 
its a very difficult thing to stop but its not something we 
encourage or condone 
university president john silber has been credited with 
persuading bush and mitterrand to converge on the schools urban 
campus thus dominating the keen annual competition among 
massachusetts 120 colleges for commencement speakers 
silber attracted not one but two world leaders while harvard 
university had to settle for pakistani prime minister benazir 
bhutto and tufts university for un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar 
he extended the invitations worked with the staff both at the 
white house and at the elysee to make sure that the case for coming 
to boston university was put as clearly and effectively as 
possible westling said and it appears to have worked 
bu spokesman thomas cashman said silber was able to arrange the 
visit through his friendship with bush which dates to his days at 
the university of texas in the 1960s and his more recent 
acquaintance with mitterrand through nobel laureate elie wiesel a 
bu professor and friend of the french head of state 
the presidents also had plans to meet at bushs summer retreat 
in kennebunkport maine around graduation day making a side trip 
to boston convenient 
while bus presidential coup has set the community abuzz its 
been a headache for campus security said adam c thermos 
manager of protective services 
senior cindy carron said she and many of her friends regarded 
the presidential visit as a mixed blessing since it limited the 
number of tickets available to students and required extensive 
security checks 
id almost rather have my whole family there to share in the 
ceremony instead of the president whos untouchable she said 
lauren goldstein a native of new york agreed 
its becoming such a hassle she said that my parents 
have to get here at the crack of dawn to get through security is 
ludicrous but unfortunately thats what you have to do when a 
president comes to town

a drug dealer was sentenced today to the maximum 
term of 25 years to life in prison for the murder of a rookie 
policeman whom president bush has called a victim of cocaine 
cowards 
state supreme court justice thomas a demakos also sentenced 
philip copeland to five to 15 years for weapons possession to run 
concurrently the sentence prompted thunderous applause from about 
150 officers in the courtroom 
you are unfit to be a member of our society the judge told 
copeland 
demakos said he wished the law allowed him to make the sentences 
consecutive he said he would recommend no parole and said that 
when he retires his last act would be to remind the parole board 
of his recommendation 
copeland 23 was the first of three young men to be sentenced 
in the killing he was convicted march 29 with todd scott 20 and 
scott cobb 25 after a twomonth trial in the death of officer 
edward byrne who was shot five times while he guarded the home of 
a drug witness in february 1988 
bush gave the case national publicity during last years 
presidential campaign and called it a symbol of drugrelated crime 
byrnes family gave his badge to bush who called the killers a 
gang of cocaine cowards 
byrnes funeral drew 10000 uniformed police officers from 
around the country 
prosecutors charged that the defendants killed byrne on orders 
issued from jail by reputed drug kingpin howard pappy mason 
who reportedly was enraged when he was jailed on a gun possession 
charge 
there is no doubt that of the three copeland was the worst 
demakos said this arrogant act assaults our society 
assistant district attorney eugene kelly called copeland the 
mastermind of the plot this is a crime of monstrous 
proportions this was a message to society 
scott and cobb face the same sentences for seconddegree murder 
and seconddegree criminal possession of a weapon

mikhail s gorbachev told the united states 
that he has halted its weapons shipments to nicaraguas leftist 
government but the white house today said the evidence shows the 
opposite and accused him of drugstore cowboy rhetoric 
president bush is waiting for gorbachev to match his words 
with deeds said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
who also accused gorbachev of playing a pr game 
we are very leery their intentions he said noting that the 
soviets have made no public statements about cutting off aid to 
nicaragua 
gorbachev informed president bush of the decision in a letter 
this month and confirmed it in conversations with secretary of 
state james a baker iii in moscow last week an administration 
official said monday night 
fitzwater did not directly confirm the letter but said the 
soviets gave private indications to us officials that they were 
ceasing their military aid to nicaragua as president bush has 
pushed them to do 
at this point we dont see the evidence of any cutoff the 
military aid is still coming in it could be that is still in the 
pipeline it could be aid from another country from cuba or 
something on that order fitzwater said 
he said us officials have evidence showing that nicaragua has 
received military shipments amounting to several millions of 
dollars since the beginning of this year but he could not say from 
where it was coming 
fitzwater linked the nicaragua situation with recent soviet arms 
cut proposals which he said appear to be something theyre not 
thats the essence of the pr game that hes playing here 
when asked why it seemed gorbachev was making all the initiatives 
while bush lays back 
and that is that the united states has been very careful and 
methodical in its examiniation of our relationship with the soviet 
union fitzwater said 
we contrast that which is an admittedly cautious approach to 
the one of throwing out in a kind of a drugstore cowboy fashion one 
arms control proposal after another out of which upon examination 
appears to be either very little change from existing situation 
involving promises that have been made in the past involving 
reductions that are not meaningful in terms of our strategic 
relationship with the soviet union 
prior to his moscow visit baker had cited soviet support of the 
sandinistas as a litmus test for ussoviet relations questioning 
whether gorbachevs deeds would live up to his words of 
conciliation toward the west 
bush received gorbachevs letter before baker went to moscow 
where the secretary of state met with gorbachev and foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
the united states estimated that the soviets provided 515 
million in various forms of military aid including weapons to the 
sandinista government in nicaragua last year the most potent 
weapons were attack helicopters 
a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity stressed 
that gorbachevs assurances did not foreclose delivery of other 
forms of military assistance besides weapons that assistance could 
include vehicles supplies and clothing baker did not persuade the 
soviet leaders to cut off that assistance as well the source said 
also the soviets declined to suspend their military support of 
cuba the other prominent soviet client state in the region the 
official said the united states had also sought to have the 
soviets halt supplies to cuba 
ernesto palazio head of washington office of the nicaraguan 
rebels said he was not convinced that gorbachevs reported 
commitment would diminish the sandinista military capability 
he said press reports about gorbachevs position indicate that 
cuba may replace the soviet union as the sandinistas arms supplier 
cuba now manufactures similar arms palazio said so 
whether the soviet union does it arms the sandinistas directly or 
through a surrogate well just have to wait and see 
house speaker jim wright dtexas hailed the soviet decision as 
overdue 
its high time that the soviet union does stop supplying 
military support to nicaragua wright said adding that he had 
discussed the matter with soviet diplomats during the reagan 
administration 
it has to come he said if were really to demilitarize 
the zone we really do need to get foreign interests out of there 
rep tom foley dwash the house majority leader called it 
a very welcome decision 
the swedish foreign minister sten andersson here for talks 
with bush and baker today called gorbachevs move a very 
positive step 
rebels known as contras and backed by the united states have 
been fighting the sandinista forces since 1981 the united states 
provided arms to the contras but congress subsequently limited 
us assistance to socalled humanitarian aid 
baker while in moscow said he had made headway with gorbachev 
and shevardnadze toward cooperation in latin america the middle 
east and other areas but did not disclose the gorbachev letter 
in the kremlin last week shevardnadze reiterated to baker that 
weapons deliveries had ceased and gorbachev underscored the 
commitment at a 3hour meeting with baker the official said

today and tanks circled the presidential palace and other key 
government buildings in an apparent dispute among military leaders

telephone the trouble stemmed from an apparent division among 
top officers 
the employee who spoke only on condition that he not be 
identified said a measure of calm had returned by midevening and 
the two sides were talking within the ministry in an attempt to 
resolve their differences 
the trouble broke out several hours after president mengistu 
haile mariam left addis ababa for a previously unannounced visit to 
east germany sources said he took his family with him 
there have been persistent reports of army unrest in ethiopia 
whose marxist government is engaged in war against separate rebel 
groups in its northernmost provinces of tigre and eritrea 
government forces have been pushed out of eritrea and tigre 
provinces in a series of humiliating recent defeats by the 
eritrean peoples liberation army and the tigray peoples 
liberation army 
civilian and military employees were not allowed to leave the 
defense ministry building after the trouble erupted it was ringed 
by tanks armored cars and troops in what appeared to be defensive 
positions 
i dont know what weve got quite frankly said a spokesman 
for the us embassy weve got reports of some shooting in the 
city but not a great deal of it 
i cannot comment on whats going on said allen collins 
head of chancellery in the british embassy we are trying to make 
our own assessment and any comment would be premature 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
the us embassy in addis ababa had confirmed that there was 
fighting in the streets but had no other information about the 
conflict 
we dont know exactly what is going on there boucher said 
government sources speaking only on condition of anonymity 
said shooting broke out inside the defense ministry at about 4 pm 
just as employees were about to end their day it could not be 
determined if there were any casualties 
almost immediately two air force mig jet fighters began buzzing 
the city repeatedly and tanks armored personnel carriers and 
troops surrounded the ministry 
later tanks armored cars and soldiers took up positions 
outside other key government buildings including the presidential 
palace the ministry of interior and the ministry of information 
which houses the government broadcasting station

a senate office memo inadvertently faxed to a 
news organization sheds new light on how capitol hill groundwork is 
laid for the political favors that can make or break legislation 
the bill in question here writes a staffer for sen connie mack 
of florida is harmless might help at home and would be a big 
big big favor to a party colleague seeking higher office in 
another state 
the legislation on plastics recycling probably isnt a vital 
issue to many in congress but it is to rep jim courter whose new 
jersey district would include a national headquarters for a major 
recycling project if the bill passes 
passage of the republican congressmans bill would be something 
solid he could point to as he presses his campaign to succeed gov 
tom kean in new jersey so while he prepares to introduce the bill 
in the house hes been searching for someone to sponsor it in the 
senate someone like mack a florida republican 
thats where the memo accidentally sent by facsimile machine 
to the associated press comes in 
it was written by michele chouteau at the time a staff member 
for mack to the senators administrative assistant mitch bainwol 
ms chouteau who left macks office on friday to take over as 
press secretary for rep chuck douglas rnh said she sent the 
memo monday to her old office and speculated it may have been 
mistakenly faxed with other material to aps new hampshire office 
in concord 
the undated document describes a 15 million plastics recycling 
bill to provide grants to several universities including the 
university of florida at gainesville the university of 
massachusetts at amherst and rutgers university which is in 
courters district 
why should mack sponsor it ms chouteau spelled out four 
arguments 
it is virtually a harmless issue 
it gives money to uf while not being a very expensive piece 
of legislation 
its a decent environmental initiative that can be played up 
or down as much as you see fit 
it would be a big big big favor to a republican seeking the 
governors slot in new jersey courter needs a senate sponsor and 
is dealing with new jersey bradley and lautenberg massachusetts 
need we say more and florida which leaves graham and cm yes 
cm is his only hope for an appropriate senate sponsor 
ms chouteau said monday that she had meant that cm sen 
mack was the only republican senator from among those states that 
could expect grants 
these are my analyses really ms chouteau said 
courters office said heres the bill what do you think in 
trying to expedite action by the senators office i tried to put 
in my arguments 
courter spokesman phil peters declined to say whether courters 
aides had been making the same arguments ms chouteau made as 
far as she analyzed the legislation i dont have any comment on 
that he said 
he did take issue with her dismissing chances of sponsorship 
from other states senators pointing to rudy boschwitz rminn 
as a possible candidate 
mack spokesman mark mills said he saw the memo for the first 
time on monday but had been aware for about a week of courters 
attempt to win macks sponsorship 
from our standpoint the reason we were brought in on it is 
that it will impact the university of florida in gainesville if it 
helps florida were all for it mills said all the other 
arguments im just not familiar with 
mills said macks staff would be consulting with the university 
on the legislation sometime this week 
courters aide peters said he understood mack had been tied up 
with monitoring the election in panama and might have been unable 
to review the legislation in the three weeks since the senators 
office had been given copies

americans are unwise to threaten a troop 
withdrawal from europe because of differences with the west german 
government over shortrange nato nuclear missiles horst ehmke a 
leader of the west german social democratic party said today 
lets stop all this nonsense about getting out and dissolving 
the alliance ehmke deputy chairman of the spd parliamentary 
group told reporters at a news conference arranged by foreign 
policy magazine 
ehmke in washington for talks with members of congress and the 
bush administration said a majority of west germans oppose us 
plans to upgrade the lance missiles 
the united states and britain are leading an effort in the north 
atlantic treaty organization to replace the 88 lance missiles 
which have a range of 71 miles with more powerful rockets that 
would come closer to the shortrange limit of 310 miles 
all the main political parties in west germany including 
chancellor helmut kohls christian democrats have objected to the 
modernization effort 
west german leaders also have called for negotiations with the 
soviet union to reduce or eliminate the weapons on both sides but 
the us government has objected claiming the missiles are needed 
to deter any attack from the larger soviet bloc conventional forces 
influential members of the us senate armed services committee 
have said that they might urge a withdrawal of united states forces 
from europe if the west germans insist on increasing the risk to 
the troops by removing the missiles 
its not wise to hint and say that you will withdraw your 
troops said ehmke the german people will feel like they were 
being blackmailed 
he said the united states should back down from its refusal to 
negotiate with the soviet union on reducing the shortrange 
missiles in europe 
i dont see any reason for the american fear about 
negatiating ehmke said the most dangerous position in this 
respect is the one the american administration is taking right now 
by saying no negotiations 
it would be much easier to negotiate while saying that any 
reduction in the conventional and nuclear forces would have to be 
acceptable to both sides in europe he said 
it would be much easier to win popular support for a position 
like that than for the position the american government has now 
ehmke said 
he said americans shouldnt view their commitment to nato as 
purely to help the europeans 
your troops are over there not only for the protection of 
germany but for the protection of your own interests he said 
you could not allow the soviets to get influence over the 
european coast of the atlantic 
on the other hand we like you to be there because we are not 
big enough to do the job alone ehmke said so its in our 
interests we need you to protect our sea and air lanes

unnecessary pentagon specifications have 
wasted taxpayers dollars with at least one defense contractor 
forced to package a 5cent spare part in a 2 box witnesses told a 
senate panel tuesday 
contractors described for the senate governmental affairs 
subcommittee on oversight of government management how strict 
pentagon specifications for commercially available products along 
with excessive requirements have made them less than willing to 
deal with the defense department 
my manager said hed rather have aids than a government 
contract robert rossow iii of midland brake inc of owosso 
mich told the senate panel 
while contractors expressed their misgivings to one 
subcommittee another panel was hearing testimony from officials of 
the office of technology assessment a congressional watchdog 
agency on a report concluding that the oncelarge us advantage 
in a variety of defense technologies has diminished 
the defense technology base is not in crisis alan shaw 
manager of the offices international security and commerce 
program told the senate armed services subcommittee on defense 
industry and technology but it does face major problems 
stiff competition from an increasing number of foreign 
competitors delays in translating laboratory research and 
development into practical use and a vast number of rules and 
regulations that slow the acquisition process were among the 
problems cited in the report 
b dan pinick senior vice president of the boeing co 
described to the senate governmental affairs subcommittee one such 
encounter with excessive regulations 
boeing in its bid for the navys longrange air asw capability 
aircraft proposed a modified version of its 757 commercial 
jetliner at the time of the bid the commercial jet program was 10 
years old meaning that boeings contracts with suppliers and 
vendors had been firmly established pinick said 
based on previous contracts boeing proposed to the pentagon 
waiving certain contract clauses and military specifications that 
are applied to new governmentdesigned aircraft to comply with 
the clauses boeing would have had to reopen and try to renegotiate 
about 3900 contacts pinick said 
we believe there is a large base of highquality commercial 
suppliers to which the us government may not have access because 
of the terms and conditions associated with government contracts 
the boeing official said 
rossow described how one pentagon overspecification required him 
to package a 5cent brake system repair part in a plastic bag a 
box wrapped in plastic and then another box at a cost of 2 
life has enough complications without deliberately courting 
more rossow said given the complexities and risks associated 
with government contracting who needs it 
the complaints from the government contractors came one day 
after a study by the center for strategic and international studies 
found that almost 100000 companies stopped doing business with the 
pentagon over a fiveyear period 
the report by the private nonprofit think tank that studies 
national security issues found that in 1982 more than 138000 
companies provided goods to the defense department but by 1987 
the number had dropped to less than 40000 
some of the 80000 went out of business including about 
20000 small businesses the report said most of the 80000 
firms however simply quit doing business with the defense 
department and opted for other customers 
the report found that in comparison to other industries 
defense is not a highly profitable business

us supreme court justice anthony m 
kennedy today blocked a 15yearold florida girl from getting an 
abortion without first getting the consent of her parents or a 
judge 
the stay came just three hours after the florida supreme court 
said it would allow the girl to get an abortion clearing the way 
for other minors to have abortions without such permission 
the states abortionconsent law which took effect in february 
was ruled unconstitutional by a state appellate court friday and 
the state supreme court said today it would rule this fall on the 
laws constitutionality 
kennedy acting on a request by a lawyer appointed to represent 
the fetus issued a stay in washington his order blocks the 
abortion until the full us supreme court considers the matter 
probably at a closed conference thursday 
the case involves a 15yearold girl who wants an abortion but 
was afraid to seek her parents consent 
certainly time is of the essence and that can be determined 
from the flurry of activity richard boylston a lawyer from 
tavares appointed to represent the interest of the fetus had said 
earlier 
jerri blair attorney for the lake county 15yearold filed a 
motion monday to dissolve the stay 
the girl is 12 weeks pregnant and many clinics wont perform 
abortions after the 13th week of pregnancy because of a greater 
risk of medical complications she noted 
ms blair refused to say today if her client had been told of 
the decision and also said she would not disclose any decision the 
girl makes on whether to go ahead with the abortion 
i think we are examining a law that needs to be examined that 
needs to be very clear for the trial courts ms blair said 
ultimately what will happen it will cause the legislature to 
revisit and clarify the guidelines 
the state high court will set a schedule for lawyers to submit 
written arguments on the constitutional issues and argue the case 
before the justices in the fall 
the case began may 2 when the girl petitioned a lake county 
court for permission to get an abortion without her parents 
consent she said she could not approach her parents for permission 
without fearing emotional or physical abuse 
two days later circuit judge jerry t lockett denied the girls 
petition saying the states abortionconsent law was unworkable 
because it is unconstitutionally vague and does not let judges hold 
proper hearings 
charlene carres legislative counsel for the florida american 
civil liberties union filed a friendofthecourt brief monday 
claiming that the girl had a constitutional right to privacy and 
hence to an abortion without outside consent 
the florida attorney generals office filed a motion supporting 
the parentalconsent law 
of approximately 75000 abortions performed in florida last 
year about a third were on minors according to prochoice 
activists yet since the new law took effect in february few 
teenagers have gone through the court system to seek a judges 
permission for an abortion 
janis comptoncarr executive director of the florida abortion 
rights action league says many are simply bypassing the legal 
system and traveling to georgia 
amanda jones director of a gainesville abortion clinic called 
the bread and roses well women care center said monday that she 
has referred 20 to 30 girls to georgia abortion clinics in recent 
months but fears many of them wouldnt be able to afford the trip 
some girls cant even get a ride to the center much less to 
georgia ms jones said

vice president dan quayle made a nostalgic 
return tuesday to the senate committee room where he helped shape 
the nations largest job training program and was met with heaps of 
praise a handful of jokes and a serious request for more money 
the topic of the unusual forum hosted by members of the senate 
labor committee was the job training partnership act which quayle 
then a senator and sen edward m kennedy coauthored in 1982 the 
program was cited during the presidential campaign as quayles 
major congressional achievement 
quayles appearance came less than a week after labor secretary 
elizabeth dole introduced the bush administration proposals to 
answer criticisms of the program 
the administration proposed channeling most money to the 
unskilled poor and teenagers and establishing a separate program 
title for youthtraining programs now scattered throughout jtpa 
ventures that also serve adults 
current formulas written by quayle and kennedy in the midst of 
the 198182 recessions allocated twothirds of jtpa money to areas 
with high unemployment rates regardless of whether those unemployed 
lack basic skills 
tuesdays forum was designed to promote bipartisanship as 
congress considers major revisions to the program but with no new 
ground to break the sessions instead largely unfolded as a 
lovefest for quayle 
kennedy leading the praise also took a minute to add that he 
expected quayle to lobby president bush for additional funding for 
the multibilliondollar program 
we were genuine partners on jtpa but dan quayle was the senior 
partner said kennedy dmass it was a quaylekennedy bill 
not a kennedyquayle bill 
kennedy praised quayle for sticking with the bill despite 
opposition from the reaganbush administration quayle himself 
recalled having notsonice things to say about the occupants of 
the white house at that time 
i can remember those days orrin how we referred to those 
folks down there at the white house quayle said to sen orrin 
hatch rutah who at the time was committee chairman 
but he added with a smile ive changed my mind 
there were jokes about quayles age too 
sen paul simon dill said he missed having the 42yearold 
vice president as the ranking republican on a subcommittee he 
leads a position now held by sen strom thurmond 
he has not had as much experience in the senate as you have 
had simon said jokingly of the 86yearold thurmond who has 
served in the senate since quayle was 9 years old 
quayle thanked his former colleagues for their praise but said 
it was their work that would bring about the needed changes to jtpa 
after all he told them he was at the forum only as someone 
remarked somebody who used to have an important job in this town

a gallup survey released tuesday found most 
south africans oppose international economic sanctions saying such 
measures would lead to more joblessness in their nation 
only one in six blacks said sanctions are a good idea because 
they would force the government to abolish apartheid six of 10 
blacks said they would oppose sanctions even if these led the 
government to resign within five years 
the survey of 2192 people 1400 blacks 392 whites and 400 of 
mixed race and asian origin was commissioned by the south african 
chamber of mines representing the countrys mining industry 
of those polled 82 percent of the blacks and 95 percent of the 
whites rejected foreign sanctions with most saying they would lead 
to higher unemployment 
release of the survey coincided with a visit set this week by 
leaders of south africas prosanctions movement including nobel 
prizewinning archbishop desmond tutu seeking support from 
president bush and congressional leaders for proposed negotiations 
between the black majority and the white south african government 
to end racial segregation policies 
tom main chief executive of the mining association said the 
study was commissioned to provide a definitive idea of the pros 
and cons in the sanctions debate as other countries consider 
whether to follow the us example and impose trade restrictions on 
south africa 
congress imposed limited sanctions on south africa in 1986 
overriding a veto by thenpresident reagan in an effort to force 
the government to grant political rights to the black majority 
main speaking by satellite from johannesburg said at a news 
conference to present the gallup survey that south africas coal 
mining industry had a drop in 1987 exports from 44 million tons to 
37 million but bounced back last year to post its second best 
exports ever 
the sanctions resulted in the loss of 8000 to 10000 jobs he 
added all of them held by blacks 
the survey conducted between march 11 and may 8 had a 4 
percent margin of error neil upmeyer research director for 
gallup said that to ensure credibility of the responses 
interviews were conducted away from the work place by interviewers 
of the same race as the respondent 
in the survey 59 percent of the blacks and 51 percent of the 
whites 58 percent of all respondents said american companies in 
south africa can help make the government moderate its racial 
policies 
of those polled 77 percent of blacks and 50 percent of whites 
said ending american business operations would seriously hurt the 
south african economy

the discovery channel jumped into the 
burgeoning classroom cable television market tuesday with 
assignment discovery a daily teaching aid that boasts no 
commercials and broad support from educators 
the hourlong program due to debut sept 18 will be shown five 
days a week at 9 am eastrn time on cable systems offering the 
discovery channel 
teachers will be allowed to tape the programs and use them as 
needed for up to a year after the initial broadcast 
corporations and foundations will be recruited as underwriters 
discovery officials said but billboards identifying the 
underwriters will not interrupt the two major educational segments 
planned for each hour 
were approaching this first and foremost as a public 
service said discovery chairman john hendricks he said 
satellite time will cost about 250000 a year but declined to 
estimate the price tag on the entire project we dont expect to 
incur huge losses he said 
the fouryearold discovery channel which specializes in 
documentaries is shown on cable systems with 413 million 
subscribers hendricks estimates the channel is already available 
in 65 percent of the nations schools 
the announcement of assignment discovery comes on the heels 
of ted turners announcement that his cable news network will begin 
running a 15minute current events show called cnn newsroom on 
aug 14 teachers will be able to tape the earlymorning program 
and use it in their classrooms 
turner decided at the last minute to nix the commercials 
initially included in the package he said cnn will absorb millions 
of dollars in production costs 
turners entry was widely viewed as competition for a 12minute 
newscast with two minutes of commercials the controversial 
channel one from whittle communications of knoxville tenn the 
program which comes with 50000 in tv equipment for participating 
schools was recently tested in six high schools 
discovery president ruth otte said her network is not in the 
news business and does not consider its new program competition for 
the cnn or whittle shows more power to all of us if we can all 
make a contribution she said 
assignment discovery will feature a particular subject area 
each day of the week science and techology on monday social 
science on tuesday natural science on wednesday arts and 
humanities on thursday and world events and contemporary issues on 
friday 
each hour will consist of two 20to25minute curriculum 
segments an educators bulletin board with news and 
information for teachers and sponsorship billboards between the 
segments the curriculum segments will be drawn from the channels 
extensive documentary collection 
officials said that the program will be aimed at secondary 
school students but that past experience indicates some teachers of 
younger children will also use the programs schools can buy a 
supplemental teaching package for 100 a year and copy it for 
distribution to all interested teachers 
the major obstacle to the series was overcoming copyright 
restrictions hendricks said otte said that educational rights are 
being sought for documentaries already in the networks library and 
that such rights will be included in future contracts with film 
producers 
the series has been developed in consultation with teachers 
administrators and others in the education community a 
characteristic that sets it apart from the whittle and turner 
efforts educators say 
assignment discovery is teacher friendly primarily 
because the discovery channel has taken the time to do its homework 
before jumping into the classroom said lew armistead a 
spokesman for the national association of secondary school 
principals 
this is indeed a partnership said gary marx a spokesman 
for the american association of school administrators he said the 
discovery program is designed primarily to enhance education while 
whittles basic purpose is the commercial exploitation of a 
captive audience of students 
the principals and administrators groups along with the 
national school boards association have formed an advisory panel 
to support the discovery effort

scientists said tuesday that they have 
been unable to determine what killed seven seals washed ashore 
since april 27 and that the deaths simply may reflect an increasing 
seal population 
weve seen more seals south of cape cod and all the way down 
to chesapeake bay than we normally do said doug beach a 
biologist with the national marine fisheries service in woods hole 
mass 
the dead harbor seals washed ashore in portsmouth and tiverton 
the animals must have died pretty suddenly said bernadette 
bode spokeswoman for the mystic marinelife aquarium in mystic 
conn they werent suffering from a longterm illness and 
showed no signs of poisoning or injury 
there were a lot of harbor seals in the area she said it 
could be a natural occurrence it doesnt necessarily point to any 
evil against the animals 
harbor seals which grow to 160 to 200 pounds and 4 to 5 feet 
long normally spend winters in long island sound and migrate to 
northern new england in the summer

the judge preparing for a custody battle 
over frozen embryos says hes reminded of the classic scopes 
monkey trial that thrust another small tennessee court under a 
national microscope 64 years ago 
circuit court judge w dale young said the custody case weighs 
so heavily on his mind that he reread six days or forever ray 
gingers account of the 1925 scopes trial in dayton in which the 
teaching of evolution was attacked successfully 
that trial drew national attention as famed attorneys clarence 
darrow and william jennings bryan squared off 
theres not a day goes by that i dont think about the case 
and what the issue will be young said of the custody battle 
between junior lewis davis and mary sue davis the trial is 
scheduled for aug 7 
never in my wildest dreams did i think hearing any lawsuit in 
this court would attract the attention of more than 12 jurors and 
the parties he told the knoxville journal in an interview 
published monday 
young said he mostly hears cases involving domestic matters 
civil suits minor injury and malpractice his 65seat courtroom 
probably wont be able to hold the reporters spectators and 
lawyers expected for the davis case 
davis obtained a court order temporarily barring his wife from 
having seven invitro fertilized eggs implanted for pregnancy he 
said the embryos are joint property and that implanting them would 
violate his right to decide whether to become a father 
his wife has said she considers the embryos her best chance to 
become a mother her attorney has argued that davis decided to 
become a father when he participated in the testtube baby program 
young a softspoken man with an easy smile said he wont let 
the national attention affect his decision 
were going to do it in a professional manner he said

employers failure to withhold taxes from 
paychecks of workers who are erroneously carried on the books as 
independent contractors is costing the federal treasury 
billions of dollars government auditors said tuesday 
in 1984 alone the general accounting office said in testimony 
to the house government operations consumer subcommittee the loss 
was nearly 16 billion by comparison the anticrime plan 
announced monday by president bush would cost 12 billion 
the gao an arm of congress said government agencies federal 
state and local have been just as lax as businesses in filing 
required reports on payments made to independent contractors 
the importance of employers filing required information 
returns on payments made to independent contractors cannot be 
overemphasized said paul l posner a gao associate director 
billions of dollars of taxes are owed due to independent 
contractors unreported income and misclassification with this 
compliance problem enhanced irs enforcement efforts are 
warranted 
an independent contractor provides services ranging from lawn 
mowing to computer programming whether a worker is a contractor or 
an employee depends on a 20part irs test of who sets working hours 
and conditions 
if a worker is classified as an employee the employer must 
withhold social security and income taxes match the social 
security tax and pay an unemployment tax but if the worker is 
classified as an independent contractor the employer withholds no 
tax and pays neither a social security nor unemployment tax too a 
contractor may claim business deductions that are not available to 
an employee 
under the law an employer must report to the irs on payments of 
over 600 a year for services provided by a noncorporate 
independent contractor that permits the irs to crosscheck those 
reports against the contractors tax return 
the irs found that about 14 percent of businesses sampled had 
misclassified some employees as independent contractors in 1984 
irs needs to do more to see that employers understand and act 
on their reporting responsibilities the gao told the house 
panel too the report said the irs needs to be more aggressive in 
searching out cases of failure to report when business tax returns 
are audited 
the acting irs commissioner michael j murphy acknowledged 
that the agency could do more and said that efforts to improve irs 
performance in this area are already are under way he blamed 
congress for part of the problem 
in 1978 the irs operated a tough enforcement program that 
resulted in back taxes and stiff penalties being levied against 
many businesses in response congress passed a law preventing the 
irs from reclassifying as an employee any worker that a business 
had reasonable ground for listing as an independent contractor 
that law works to the disadvantage of employers who properly 
classify workers and is difficult to administer murphy said he 
urged congress to consider changing it 
the gao estimated the law cost the federal treasury at least 
111 million in 1984 
the gao report cited a treasury department finding that 12 of 14 
federal agencies surveyed had failed to report 9 billion in 
payments to independent contractors in 1984 and 1985 the gao 
conducted its own spot survey of state and local governments and 
found 16 of 17 state agencies checked and seven of 10 local units 
were not in full compliance 
in reviewing 9 million in payments to independent contractors 
by the sampled state and local agencies that were subject to 
information reporting we found that 8 million had not been 
reported posner said 
many state and local officials do not fully understand the 
reporting requirements and irs has not done enough to clear up the 
confusion the gao said 
the gao spotchecked business tax returns that had been audited 
by the irs and found that in half the cases at least one 
information report was missing the problem was compounded the 
report said because irs auditors failed to detect the missing 
reports which involved payments of 6 million to contractors

unless women win more access to family planning 
education and employment the worlds population could almost 
triple to 14 billion by the year 2100 a un agency said in a 
report tuesday 
too many women remain trapped because of fundamentalist 
religions that keep women in bondage and cultural values that 
put men first said dr nafis sadik executive director of the 
united nations population fund in launching the 1989 state of 
world population report 
appealing for a fivefold increase in world spending on family 
planning the report said the status of women will be crucial in 
determining future population growth rates 
half the worlds women have no access to family planning 
services mostly those in traditional maledominated societies or 
areas far from family planning services mrs sadik said 
yet this is precisely the audience we must reach if we are to 
have further success in our efforts she said 
she said world population now 52 billion is at a critical 
juncture likely to increase by more than 90 million a year until 
the end of the century and stabilize at 10 billion about a century 
from now 
this optimistic projection assumes that fertility in the 
developing world will drop by onethird in the next 40 years the 
report said 
the report said about 465 million women in the developing world 
or 45 percent use contraceptives 14 percent in africa 50 percent 
in asia and 56 percent in latin america 
without chinas extensive birth control program the overall use 
of contraceptives in the developing world would drop to about 30 
percent the report said 
to attain the desired drop in fertility 58 percent of women 
will have to be using family planning in 2000 and 71 percent the 
present level in industrialized countries by 2025 it said in 
subsaharan africa those using family planning would have to 
increase tenfold 
but this will not happen unless more of the worlds women are 
given more health care family planning services education and 
employment opportunities mrs sadik said 
we now have clearcut concrete evidence of linkage between 
female education fertility and mortality between gainful 
employment for women and patterns of family formation and between 
womens participation and the success of population programs and 
economic development she said 
thirtyone countries in the developing world still have 
virtually no family planning facilities the report said and 37 of 
the poorest countries have cut health spending by half and 
education by onefourth in the last four years 
if the family planners failed the world would have 14 billion 
people by 2100 which would create enormous potential for 
violence and social upheaval she said 
the pakistani physician called on societies to end legal and 
social discrimination against women increase their access to 
leadership positions and teach at all levels that women and men 
are equal in value 
asked whether religious fundamentalism was hampering women and 
family planning she replied all these movements seem to be 
designed to somehow keep women in bondage 
she accused religious leaders of being on a powerego thing 
theyre reinforcing their authority its like all religious 
leaders who do they talk to they talk to the poor and the 
illiterate and those are the only groups they can really sway 
all religious movements look at the woman as the one who 
should cater to and serve the family never the other gender she 
said 
she criticized the united states for halting its contribution to 
the fund in 1986 the reagan administration contended the agencys 
policies promoted coercive abortion but mrs sadik said the reasons 
were political and expressed hope the bush administration would 
resume the us contribution 
the un population fund urged governments to earmark 1 percent 
of gross national product for family planning it asked major 
donors to increase assistance for family planning programs fivefold 
to 25 billion a year 
this could also save 3 million womens lives by the year 2000 
as fewer poor women would die from complications from pregnancy 
childbirth and illegal abortion mrs sadik said

a senate committee approved legislation on 
tuesday that would bar airlines from refusing to seat blind 
passengers in rows that have emergency exits 
the measure approved on a voice vote goes against a proposed 
federal aviation administration regulation that would prohibit 
blind and other disabled people from sitting next to emergency 
doors 
the ease with which the measure was approved by the commerce 
committee debate lasted only several minutes might not be 
indicative of its prospects for final enactment although only two 
members of the committee spoke against the bill congressional 
sources said some public supporters have private doubts 
the bill has been lobbied heavily on both sides and at least 
one member of the committee who supports the measure admits that 
the issue has put him in an uncomfortable position 
how would you like to be the guy who voted for this bill on 
the oneinabillion chance that a blind person was sitting next to 
an exit door when an incident occurred and something happens 
said the senator speaking on condition he not be further 
identified 
one congressional source also speaking only on condition of 
anonymity acknowledged the measures 31 cosponsors and the ease 
with which it cleared the commerce panel but said a lot of 
people did it anticipating it wasnt going to go anywhere 
groups representing the blind have complained that some 
airlines policies of refusing to seat blind people near emergency 
exits are discriminatory some advocates for the blind have been 
removed from planes and arrested after refusing to leave exit seats 
to which they had been assigned 
the bills sponsor committee chairman ernest hollings dsc 
said the legislation would move to eliminate once and for all the 
embarrassment and hassle given our blind passengers 
but lined up on the other side are the faa the airline industry 
and many of its labor unions who argue that if an emergency 
occurred the danger could be greater if the seat nearest the exit 
were occupied by a blind traveler 
in a letter to hollings written last week the air transport 
association which represents the nations major airlines asked 
for a study of the problem in place of the legislation 
until such time as there is good evidence that persons with 
visual impairments will not impede an emergency evacuation we 
continue to believe that the prudent course of action is to put the 
safety of all passengers and crew members ahead of the narrow 
interests of a vocal advocacy group the association wrote 
a similar bill has been introduced in the house but it has yet 
to receive committee approval

helen suzman south africas 
bestknown white civil rights campaigner said tuesday she will 
retire in september after 36 years at the forefront of 
antiapartheid opposition in parliament 
she will be missed as a courageous fighter who was ahead of 
her time said con botha chief spokesman for the governing 
national party 
mrs suzman 71 is the longestserving member of parliament 
having represented the same johannesburg constituency since 1953 
from 1961 until 1974 she was the only legislator representing 
opponents of south africas legal policy of race discrimination 
often she cast the sole vote against discriminatory or repressive 
laws 
she said she would not seek reelection sept 6 when a general 
election will be held for the white asian and mixedrace chambers 
of parliament she has campaigned consistently to extend political 
rights to the black majority which has no representation in 
parliament 
allies and opponents joined in praising her 
andries treurnicht leader of the extremeright conservative 
party said i didnt agree with her political views but she was 
someone you could respect for the conviction with which she held 
them 
one of her liberal colleagues colin eglin said her years in 
politics were perhaps unequalled for sustained excellence by an 
opposition politician in any parliament in the world 
her departure will leave a huge vacuum said the argus a 
cape town newspaper 
mrs suzman told reporters it was time to let a younger 
politician represent her district she also said she would attempt 
to write her memoirs 
my most important task the disappearance of apartheid has 
not been completed she said but a number of important laws 
have been repealed laws which i opposed when they were introduced 
and thats a source of considerable satisfaction for me 
probably more so than any other white elected official mrs 
suzman earned the trust and good will of black activists she 
attended funerals of slain militants frequently visited black 
townships and in 1987 finished ninth in a poll asking black 
newspaper readers who they wanted as president 
she met several times with imprisoned black leader nelson 
mandela who placed first in that newspaper poll and she

housing prices skyrocketed in california in 
the first three months of 1989 despite rising mortgage interest 
rates but markets cooled in the northeast a real estate trade 
group said tuesday 
meanwhile home prices in many midwestern industrial cities 
posted healthy appreciation rates and real estate in oilproducing 
states showed a spotty recovery the national association of 
realtors said 
the median price of an existing home in the san francisco area 
soared to 243900 in the first quarter meaning half sold for more 
and half sold for less that represented a 318 percent increase 
from a year ago and was the steepest appreciation rate among 83 
metropolitan areas surveyed by the trade group 
in fact california accounted for the top five appreciation 
rates in the nation home prices in orange county shot up 302 
percent to a median of 237900 in los angeles prices rose 263 
percent to 201000 in san diego 219 percent to 163900 and in 
riversidesan bernardino 216 percent to 116000 
that compares with the 34 percent increase to 91600 for the 
medianpriced existing home for the entire united states 
a healthy diversified economy population growth and foreign 
investment particularly from the japanese are fueling the boom in 
california according to economist mark zandi of the wefa group a 
bala cynwyd pa forecasting firm 
he and other analysts said however that the west coast market 
may be in danger of overheating 
i would be concerned that at this point its 
speculatively driven and that the bubble may be about to burst 
zandi said californians seem to have no concern for the amount 
of debt theyre taking on they seem to think home prices can 
continue escalating forever 
my guess is youre getting close to the end of this very rapid 
price appreciation in california said economist mark obrinsky of 
the federal national mortgage association i think in this case 
the reason is going to be mortgage rates as much as anything else 
fixedrate mortgages started out the quarter averaging 1077 
percent and jumped nearly half a percentage point to 1119 percent 
by the end of the period oneyear adjustablerate mortgages went 
from 849 percent to 931 percent in the first quarter a year ago 
mortgage rates were falling 
northeastern cities continued to be some of the most expensive 
places to live but home prices in new york city and its suburbs 
boston and worcester mass and hartford and new haven conn 
either fell or rose only modestly 
new york area prices the fifth highest in the nation after 
san francisco orange county honolulu and los angeles sunk 28 
percent to 181700 
the five least expensive areas in the country were peoria 
ill 42000 spokane wash 50200 mobile ala 50900 
oklahoma city 52300 and akron ohio 56000 
in texas the median price of houses and condominiums in houston 
recovered 45 percent to 62900 while the median rose 27 percent 
to 88400 in dallas 
i would certainly treat the dallas information as a very 
positive sign that the southwest is on the mend said economist 
james christian of the us league of savings institutions 
but home values in smaller texas cities and elsewhere in 
oildependent states continued to drop 
the five biggest declines were in fort worth texas 109 
percent oklahoma city 74 percent baton rouge la 7 percent 
worcester mass 59 percent and tulsa okla 47 percent 
a number of midwestern cities bolstered by a resurgence in 
manufacturing caused by last years boom in export sales posted 
strong appreciation rates including chicago up 7 percent 
columbus ohio up 116 percent indianapolis up 10 percent and 
st louis up 99 percent 
the realtors said the pace of existing home sales lagged 
nationally and in most states although several states with 
lowcost housing areas managed to buck the trend 
nationally sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 382 million units down 66 percent from the last quarter of 
1988 twentyeight states and the district of columbia posted 
declines while 22 states recorded increases 
west virginia showed the greatest sales pickup 613 percent 
followed by south dakota 435 percent north dakota 271 percent 
washington 223 percent and vermont 216 percent 
the states with the biggest sales declines were alaska 406 
percent utah 277 percent louisiana 238 percent iowa 202 
percent and minnesota 177 percent

us threats to pull troops from western 
europe over the nato shortrange nuclear missile dispute are viewed 
as blackmail in west germany and only aggravate tensions within 
the alliance a leading west german social democrat said tuesday 
its not wise to hint and say you will withdraw your troops 
said horst ehmke the chairman of the opposition partys 
parliamentary group its a litte bit shortsighted 
ehmke a onetime aide to former west german chancellor willy 
brandt spoke on the hottest issue dividing members of the north 
atlantic treaty organization at a news conference arranged by 
foreign policy magazine 
the united states and britain want to modernize the alliances 
shortrange lance missile force but most west germans and several 
other west european nations oppose it 
under the proposal 88 missile launchers would be made more 
powerful to carry their 700 or so singlewarhead missiles more than 
250 miles the weapons designed for use on the battlefield now 
have a range of only 75 miles most are on west german territory 
west german chancellor helmut kohl has irritated us officials 
with his objections to the modernization plan and demands for 
direct ussoviet negotiations over the issue in a rare 
combination all of the west german political parties including 
kohls christian democrats and ehmkes social democrats object to 
the nato modernization plan 
us officials insist the upgraded weapons are necessary to 
deter any attack from the larger soviet bloc conventional forces 
and they reject the idea of direct negotiations at this point 
because of the huge warsaw pact advantage 
in recent weeks influential members of the senate armed 
services committee have said they might propose a withdrawal of 
us forces from western europe if the west germans persist in 
their demands failing to update the missiles those senators say 
would increase risks to american soldiers in europe 
arguing that such an approach was dead wrong ehmke also 
said he believed that the dispute among the allies had gotten out 
of hand 
lets stop all this nonsense about getting out and dissolving 
the alliance he said 
its not wise to hint and say that you will withdraw your 
troops the german people will feel like thats blackmail he 
added 
ehmke who is in washington for talks with members of congress 
and state department officials said the united states should 
rethink its refusal to negotiate with the soviet union 
i dont see any reason for the american fear about 
negotiating ehmke said the most dangerous position in this 
respect is the one the american administration is taking right now 
by saying no negotiations 
the official said that the heated tone of the nato argument 
should change because it serves only to advance the image of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev as the proponent of disarmament in 
european public opinion 
this puts nato on the defensive the most important thing is 
to get the initiative back ehmke argued as a reason for the 
us side to enter negotiations

this arrogant act assaults our society supreme court 
justice thomas a demakos told philip copeland 23 who was 
convicted along with two other men march 29 in the february 1988 
slaying of officer edward byrne 
there is no doubt that of the three copeland was the

shoshone and arapahoe indians in wyoming are 
guaranteed fishing rights by federal treaties but the government 
diverts water from the reservation for local farm use so there are 
few fish to be had witnesses told a senate panel tuesday 
an act of congress more than 40 years ago allowed construction 
of the bull lake dam and reservoir so land in the arid wind river 
valley could be commercially farmed 
but in doing so the government created a seemingly 
irreconcilable conflict between the treaty rights of the indians 
and the needs of area residents to water their crops witnesses 
said 
water levels sometimes dropped so low fish could not spawn and 
without the fish the indians were deprived not only of food but 
their ability to practice some parts of their religion the 
committee was told 
starr weed religious leader for the shoshones said his tribe 
considers the bull lake sacred and remembers when buffalo used to 
live in the area 
since the dam was built the fish arent always available for an 
important tribal ceremony known as the sun dance in which fish are 
eaten before three days of fasting and dancing he said 
when the water goes down it hurts our feelings the elderly 
indian told the committee 
the situation is typical of other parts of the country where 
water is in short supply and indians have a right to it said ken 
ballen chief counsel to the special panel of the senate select 
committee on indian affairs which is investigating all agencies 
that have responsibilities to american indians 
david allison superintendent of the wind river agency of the 
bureau of indian affairs said he doesnt think the federal 
government is meeting its trust responsibilities to the shoshones 
and arapahoes and he said he found it frustrating to be an 
official with that responsibility 
the federal agencies at wind river are not properly 
coordinating their activities he said 
the bureau of reclamation is charged with making sure the land 
is irrigated while the bia must protect indian rights 
there is inherent conflict said roger patterson regional 
director of the reclamation bureau 
theres not enough water to satisfy all the purposes he 
said 
patterson said farmers in the area grow grain and sugar beets 
with a production value of about 30 million a year on about 70000 
acres of irrigated land 
allison of the bia said the 8000 or so indians in the area 
are not only losing fish for their own use but about 500000 in 
trade from the sportsmen who used to fish there

tuesday by sens john danforth rmo and ernest hollings dsc 
increasingly the sentiment of the american people when they 
look at american politics today is nausea said danforth adding 
campaigns should be to inform the public not to nauseate the 
public not to make them feel like throwing up 
the bill would require broadcasters to provide free time to 
presidential and congressional candidates to respond when 
opponents broadcast ads that refer to them this would not 
apply if an opponent appears in the ad to personally make the 
attack 
an independent committee or individual broadcasts any type of 
political ad either supporting or opposing a candidate the

industry witnesses urged congress tuesday to 
create a trust fund increase tax credits and take other steps to 
encourage research and development work on highdefinition 
television 
japanese and european governments have been investing in hdtv 
technologies for years jerry k pearlman chairman and president 
of zenith electronics corp told a senate subcommittee 
now is the time for ours to do the same he said pearlman 
told the subcommittee on science technology and space 
pearlman whose company is the sole domestic television 
manufacturer proposed setting up a trust fund financed by a 5 
per television excise tax to pay for the federal portion of hdtv 
research by us companies 
with television sales in the united states running about 20 
million a year such a trust fund could raise 100 million per year 
pearlman suggested that after three to four years the excise tax 
on conventional televisions could be dropped and the program 
financed through sales of highdefinition sets 
meanwhile sen albert gore dtenn introduced a bill that 
would require the secretary of commerce to draft within 90 days a 
plan of policies and procedures that would underlie development of 
highdefinition television production 
gore who heads the commerce subcommittee on technology said 
such production will consume more semiconductors than the entire 
us personal computer industry 
highdefinition tv promises far sharper pictures and clearer 
sound than possible from conventional sets

the nato dispute over deployment of 
shortrange missiles has widened a split within the government a 
newspaper reported tuesday 
transport minister friedrich zimmermann was quoted by the bild 
am sonntag newspaper as accusing foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher of covering up his true disarmament aims 
if you look genscher in the eyes you know that he is lying 
the newspaper quoted zimmermann of the conservative socialist union 
as saying during a may 8 meeting of his party leadership 
zimmermann on tuesday denied the report but bild am sonntag 
editor michael spreng immediately issued a statement saying the 
newspaper stood by its article and that it was based on firsthand 
reports 
west germanys wavering on the issue has triggered a crisis 
within the bonn leadership as well as within nato kohls coalition 
government is composed of three divergent parties his own 
christian democratic union the conservative christian socialist 
union of bavaria and the liberal free democratic party 
genscher has been at the forefront of west german resistance to 
natos plan to upgrade shortrange missiles deployed in west 
germany urging the superpowers to try to negotiate down their 
weapons stockpiles 
he has denied he wants the complete elimination of shortrange 
rockets but he is a member of the liberal free democratic party 
and a vocal supporter of improving relations with eastern europe 
and some bonn officials charge genscher is aiming for a 
nuclearfree europe 
a may 2930 nato summit will examine the question of replacing 
the lance rockets which have a range of about 75 miles with 
missiles of a range nearing 300 miles the united states and 
britain want the rockets upgraded 
bonn has insisted that the decision be put off for at least two 
years partly to avoid angering voters before the next federal 
elections in december 1990 
opinion polls show west germans are against renewing the 
missiles and kohls party has suffered serious defeats in recent 
local elections as well as a nationwide tumble in public opinion 
polls

gasoline prices are likely to rise four cents 
more a gallon by summer and the supply outlook is unclear a 
government agency said tuesday 
the energy information administration said in a special report 
on the summer gasoline outlook that prices for all grades are 
likely to average 109 a gallon up from 105 now the average 
price last summer was 99 cents a gallon the report said 
prices rose sharply immediately after the march 24 exxon oil 
tanker spill in alaska which caused a brief drop in shipments of 
north slope crude oil but then stabilized 
the additional price increases by summer will reflect a recent 
rise in crude oil prices paid by refiners and an estimated 1 cent 
per gallon increase in state gasoline taxes the report said 
also putting upward pressure on prices should be the usual 
summertime jump in gasoline demand reaching a level 19 percent 
higher than last summer the agency said the growth will result in 
part from slower gains in auto fuel efficiency 
the report said that while gasoline supplies currently are 
adequate a squeeze could develop this summer if increased import 
requirements cannot be met it said onehalf of the anticipated 
increase in gasoline demand would have to be met by imports

president raul alfonsin rejected 
the resignation of his eightman cabinet on tuesday and sought a 
meeting with presidentelect carlos menem on an orderly transition 
of government 
menem a flamboyant provincial governor who led an opposition 
peronist resurgence in elections on sunday flew to buenos aires 
from his northwestern province of la rioja to meet with aides 
menem told a newspaper he was willing to meet as many times as 
necessary with alfonsin all he has to do is call me menem 
said 
alfonsin met for 2 hours with his cabinet rejecting the 
resignations that labor minister ideler tonelli said were offered 
because we thought it was opportune 
presidential spokesman jose ignacio lopez told reporters that 
alfonsin had ordered interior minister enrique nosiglia to contact 
menem immediately to arrange a meeting 
the president lopez said plans to ask menem to appoint liaison 
teams that would maintain close contact with each ministry in an 
effort to make the transition viable until dec 10 the last day 
of alfonsins sixyear term 
alfonsins decision seemed to reject a call to advance the 
inauguration to reduce tension during the nearly seven months 
remaining in his term 
argentinas economy is staggering under tripledigit inflation 
soaring interest rates local currency devaluation a budget 
deficit and a 59 billion foreign debt on which no interest 
payments have been made since last year 
leaders of the peronist party and alfonsins governing radical 
civic union have pledged to work together to ensure a smooth 
changeover but have acknowledged that it will not be easy 
alfonsin has tried to balance the budget by selling off state 
businesses menems preference is to make the companies more 
efficient but keep them in state hands 
the peronists have demanded increases in both the minimum wage 
and federal aid to the provinces alfonsin has tried to hold the 
line on each 
menem defeated eduardo angeloz of the governing party by 78 
million to 61 million votes or 473 percent to 369 percent 
the president of the chamber of deputies radical leopoldo 
moreau suggested alfonsin consider moving up the delivery of 
power 
menem obtained a resounding majority support of society 
moreau said and if society believes that his proposals 
illusions and hopes are within reach then lets put them to work 
as soon as possible and lets look together for solutions to 
existing problems 
the peronist party also won 67 seats in the chamber of deputies 
to give it 127 or exactly one half and one senate seat to give it 
23 also exactly a half the party controls 17 of 22 provincial 
governorships 
menem in an interview published tuesday by the leftist 
newspaper pagina 12 said he opposed any change in the inauguration 
date it will be argentinas first transfer of power between freely 
elected governments in 61 years 
the constitution is clear and president alfonsin must 
complete his six years of office menem was quoted as saying 
alfonsin has been widely praised for helping democracy return to 
argentina after the brutal 197683 military dictatorship

the ohio highway patrol superintendent used 
bad judgment in accepting two free trips to south africa and 
deserved to be fired gov richard celeste said tuesday 
col jack walsh was dismissed monday after he refused to accept 
a demotion to major 
heres a man whos leader of an elite law enforcement 
organization in our state said celeste interviewed after a 
meeting with president bush hes going to be recruiting young 
blacks to come into the ohio highway patrol right 
walshs first trip to racially segregated south africa in 1984 
was sponsored by the johannesburg safety council the second this 
month was sponsored by the johannesburg city council 
i think it was appropriate to say we cant have you in this 
position of leadership the governor said 
celeste said the situation might have been different if walsh 
had paid his own way or at least had warned the governors strongly 
antiapartheid administration of his plans to make a second visit 
to south africa 
the governor said he was led to believe wrongly that walshs 
first visit was at the expense of the international association of 
chiefs of police 
walsh was not available for comment tuesday his telephone 
number is not listed but he told the columbus dispatch he is 
opposed to racial discrimination and saw nothing wrong with the 
trip 
i really cant see there is any conflict with my job as a 
police officer as superintendent of the highway patrol walsh 
said i guess the next thing is you wont be able to go to a 
library and read a book on south africa 
walsh 53 was part of the highway patrol for 31 years and was 
paid about 54000 annually he was appointed superintendent in 
1979 by gov james a rhodes

which has interests in companies that do business in south africa

mayor of maple heights a predominantly white cleveland suburb

business civic and political leaders see south africa and 
johannesburg for themselves 
they want people to see what its like over there firsthand 
theres no brainwashing he said they did not try to force

a union seeking to oust a larger rival as the 
representative of more than 60000 social security workers has 
withdrawn its initial effort to sign up 12000 of those federal 
employees union officials said tuesday 
the national treasury employees union said its move was 
temporary and necessitated by delays in a planned reorganization of 
the social security administration that when completed will place 
the 12000 workers under the jurisdiction of regional ssa 
commissioners 
the american federation of government employees which 
represents the majority of social security workers and 700000 
federal workers in all characterized the nteus withdrawal of its 
effort as a facesaving move their petition never had merit 
afge president john n sturdivant said 
but nteu president robert n tobias said the petition was 
withdrawn because a federal labor relations authority official last 
week informed the union he could not determine if nteu had 
jurisdiction over the 12000 workers because the reorganization has 
not been completed 
well have to wait until management gets its act together but 
we intend to continue our effort tobias said in a statement 
its not a matter of winning or losing because its not over 
yet nteu spokesman george king said 
among the federal workers represented by nteu are those at the 
regional offices of the department of health and human services 
the parent agency of ssa hhs in september announced plans to place 
12000 of the ssa workers under the control of the regional offices 
and nteu since then has asserted it should have jurisdiction over 
them 
nteu which has about 145000 members has been seeking a 
foothold among social security workers so it can attempt to 
organize the agencys entire work force part of its larger effort 
to chip away at afges lead in representing federal workers

with final approval near on the 1990 federal 
budget president bush and congressional leaders on tuesday began 
laying groundwork for a fiscal 1991 package that some of the 
lawmakers said must include new taxes 
bush did not comment on any options presented to him including 
the possibility that new taxes would be needed to meet budget 
deficit goals 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
presidents attitude is that he does not want to raise taxes now or 
any time but you consider each budget year as it comes we did not 
raise taxes in 1990 obviously no one wants to do it in 1991 
doing it would also go against bushs read my lips no new 
taxes campaign pledge of last year 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said participants in the meeting made some good 
progress toward discussions on the sticky subjects such as taxes 
and spending cuts 
the only specifics that we all discussed there was the fact 
that everything is going to have to be on the table defense 
entitlements taxes all three are going to have to be part of that 
kind of package he said after the meeting with bush 
there werent any violent reactions said house speaker jim 
wright of texas when reporters asked him how bush had reacted to 
suggestions of new taxes 
rep thomas foley of washington the house majority leader said 
administration officials have not ruled out discussion of any 
options but that the white house had sent no signals that it was 
willing to look at new taxes 
next years budget is going to be monumentally more difficult 
than this years said wright when he emerged from the meeting 
that included bushs budget team and several democratic and 
republican lawmakers 
several of the members in the meeting told bush there is no way 
they can produce a budget meeting next years 64 billion deficit 
ceiling unless he agrees to new taxes said those who were present 
sen pete domenici of new mexico ranking republican on the 
senate budget committee said there was general discussion of 
options on what must be done next year he said the group agreed to 
continue the momentum of working together to continue serious 
discussions about starting soon with a group representing the 
leadership that would begin to look seriously at all the options 
for the 1991 budget 
wright said the 1990 budget that is expected to get 
congressional ratification this week is a special case its 
patchwork that was made possible by agreements that cannot be 
duplicated next year 
last month bush and congressional leaders agreed on a budget 
outline for fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 congress has since 
produced a budget resolution based on that pact 
the house is scheduled to consider the compromise 12 trillion 
budget on wednesday and final senate action is expected late 
wednesday or thursday 
some lawmakers even while signing on to the 1990 package 
criticized it for using a smoke and mirrors approach to meet 
the 1990 deficit ceiling of 100 billion 
critics say the package relied on unrealistic economic 
assumptions that make the deficit seem smaller and on accounting 
gimmicks that create little real saving 
it also includes 53 billion in unspecified additional tax 
receipts bush says 48 billion of that can come from cutting the 
capital gains tax but democrats say his plan is a handout to the 
wealthy and a moneyloser

a bipartisan group of 13 governors met with 
president bush on tuesday to press a list of state concerns and 
said the president agreed to call a national summit meeting on 
education later this year 
virginia gov gerald baliles said the governors expressed their 
concerns on schools the environment roads crime and welfare 
reform in their halfhour private meeting in the cabinet room of 
the white house 
we told the president that we need a road map a game plan if 
this country is going to maintain its momentum baliles a 
democrat and chairman of the national governors association said 
afterward 
governors are realistic they know these issues are not going 
to be resolved in 100 days he said but theyre also eager for 
results we want to work with washington but were not waiting on 
washington 
iowa gov terry branstad a republican said he had first 
suggested a domestic summit meeting of governors and education 
leaders when bush met with the governors after his election in 
november and repeated that request tuesday 
he said bush indicated he will host a summit conference on 
education in september and will be working with the governors 
in planing for that he said the meeting would include governors 
state education chiefs and local educators who are trying 
innovative approaches to improve learning 
a recent report by education secretary lauro cavazos ranked the 
states in education and concluded education is not improving 
overall in the nation 
despite that branstad said there are exciting and innovative 
things happening in many of the states to deal with the education 
problems of the nation and this summit conference is going to give 
us an opportunity to share them 
vermont gov madeleine kunin said that she encouraged bush to 
support strenthening the clean air act and that delay is now not 
acceptable on the issue she said bush seems to agree with that 
fundamental message 
branstad who will become chairman of the nations governors 
this summer said he urged more federal effort to help midwestern 
farmers deal with drought and urged a relaxation of new federal 
welfare regulations affecting the states which he said dont fit 
the spirit of the welfare reform act 
bushs meeting with the governors amounted to a makeup session 
since he was out of the country last winter when the national 
governors association held its annual washington conference which 
traditionally includes meetings with the president and dinner at 
the white house 
the president will host the governors at a formal state dinner 
monday night 
earlier in the day the governors association released a report 
by its task force on research and technology which said states and 
the federal government should take steps to promote commercial 
appliciations of technological advances that are necessary to make 
the united states competitive with other countries 
it recommended a revision of federal antitrust laws to promote 
joint research and development projects by businesses and renewal 
of the federal tax credit for research and development 
the report said that the nation has spent a declining share of 
its gross national product on commercially applicable research and 
development in the 1980s and that federal spending on research has 
gone increasingly toward specialized military needs

drawing personnel from across state government 
gov michael s dukakis on tuesday launched an environmental strike 
force of 33 lawyers scientists and law officers to bring criminal 
charges against polluters 
state officials plan to use an array of crimefighting 
techniques undercover agents aerial surveillance and search 
warrants in the pollution crackdown which they say is the most 
sweeping in the nation 
these are violent crimes they do violence against others 
against houses against neighborhoods and against the water we 
drink and the air we breathe dukakis said 
escorted by dozens of officers dukakis stood between the shore 
of the charles river and a new jail to emphasize massachusetts 
resolve to go after polluters 
dukakis aides said the strike force should not be expected to 
generate headlines soon because the goal is major investigations 
that may take months but their hope is that a few highprofile 
prosecutions will deter polluters 
environmental affairs secretary john devillars who initiated 
the program after being appointed six months ago said 
investigators will concentrate on cases that involve the greatest 
costs in terms of cleanup and human health 
dukakis aides said they plan to work with the environmental 
protection agency and the us attorney 
the state is thinking big and thinking properly said elissa 
parker policy director at the environmental law institute a 
nonprofit research group in washington 
she said maryland ohio and pennsylvania have strike forces that 
concentrate on toxic dumping and water pollution while 
massachusetts will also include the protection of wetlands and 
other habitats 
except for those three states there arent any statewide 
initiatives that even come close to what massachusetts is doing 
she said 
daniel greenbaum who heads the state department of 
environmental quality engineering said up to half the people 
discharging pollutants into sewers or the air do not have permits 
many who have permits violate their limits he said 
devillars said polluters have ruined 103 water supplies in 
massachusetts created more than 1000 toxic dumps and cost the 
state 90 million a year in losses from contaminated shellfish beds 
joseph duggan of the greater boston chamber of commerce 
criticized the strike force as all stick and no carrot 
people who are intentionally disobeying the law fouling the 
land and atmosphere should be cracked down on and made to pay 
duggan said but others find out after buying property that it was 
contaminated and are ordered to clean it up 
we are objecting to that we dont think its the right 
approach he said

battle over construction of the space station will be especially 
difficult

a senior politburo member and rival of president 
mikhail s gorbachev denied a prosecutors charge of corruption and 
said the allegation was politically motivated it was reported 
tuesday 
the denial by politburo member yegor ligachev and his 
subsequent charge of mudslinging by the crusading prosecutor 
nikolai ivanov was the latest development to stun soviets 
unaccustomed to hardball political campaigns 
the official novosti news agency said tuesday that ligachev 
considered a conservative and a potential foe of gorbachev 
resolutely denied the accusation made friday by ivanov in the 
prosecutors final days of an election campaign for the new soviet 
parliament ivanov won a seat in the parliament on sunday 
politburo members have been caught in corruption scandals but 
ususally they resign and disappear before a whiff of scandal 
emerges it is unusual for a sitting powerful communist party 
leader such as ligachev to be accused of wrongdoing and even more 
unusual for a denial to be published 
yegor ligachev has resolutely denied these allegations and 
called the attention of the commission to the fact that the 
slanderous statement was intended as a political provocation 
novosti said in its report sent to the associated press by telex in 
a message titled televised disinformation 
he insists that the case be thoroughly considered and the 
results reported in the press novosti said citing reliable 
sources for its report on one of the highest officials in the 
kremlin 
ivanov helped prosecute a corruption case that led to the 
conviction of former deputy interior minister yuri churbanov the 
soninlaw of former president leonid i brezhnev 
in his accusation made on leningrad tv friday night ivanov said 
ligachevs name had come up in the investigation he offered no 
details 
ivanov and his boss telman gdlyan both are being investigated 
for alleged abuses of power by a commission of the presidium the 
nations top executive body ligachev issued his complaint to that 
commission novosti said 
ivanov and gdlyan who won a legislative seat in an earlier 
round of elections became nationally known in a bizarre corruption 
case that involved an uzbek collective farm chairman who kept a pet 
lion and a private prison the scandal spread to include the 
president and premier of uzbekistan and churbanov 
ivanov said on tv that if he were elected he would do his best 
to see that ligachev also a deputy to the new congress is not 
chosen a member of the smaller supreme soviet that will hold much 
of the legislative power 
the prosecutor won his seat in the new congress of peoples 
deputies with a resounding majority he campaigned on the slogan 
no to the mafia yes to ivanov he emphasized his record as a 
prosecutor and called for a national investigative commission to 
uproot corruption 
election opponents accused him of methods reminiscent of 
dictator josef stalin and said they feared he could set off 
another round of deadly purges by playing on the publics need to 
find scapegoats for the disastrous state of the soviet economy 
the presidium commission investigating ivanov and gdlyan was 
formed to consider citizens complaints that the men abused their 
power in investigating highlevel corruption gorbachev chairs the 
presidium 
both men reportedly were removed from the corruption 
investigation last week a man who answered gdlyans office 
telephone tuesday night said gdlyan was refusing comment on both 
his own investigation of corruption and the presidium investigation 
of him 
the commission said saturday in the communist party daily pravda 
that the two prosecutors made provocative statements about 
violations of law by some political leaders and accused them 
of trying to disorient people and interfere with the commission 
a separate investigation by the supreme court already has 
determined that gdlyan helped convict an innocent man in 1983 in 
estonia the accused an eminent scientist died in jail the 
supreme court has asked the prosecutors office to consider 
dismissing gdlyan as a result

six american health care companies have formed 
a consortium with the soviet government to produce badly needed 
medical goods for the soviet union the group announced tuesday 
this is more than an experiment in sharing knowledge and 
experience said dennis sokol who is president of the consortium 
and chairman of medserv international inc of stamford conn one 
of the american companies 
the other american companies are abbott laboratories inc 
pfizer international inc hewlett packard inc hca international 
co and the colgatepalmolive co 
on the soviet side are the soviet ministries of health the 
medical and microbiological industry and instrumentmaking means of 
automation and control systems the group said in statement 
sokol anticipated a substantial twoway flow of business for 
the first time in this field but said it was too early to 
speculate on the volume 
although the soviets claimed for years to have one of the most 
advanced health care systems in the world serious shortcomings 
have been revealed under glasnost including high rates of 
alcoholism and infant mortality and a falling life expectancy for 
men 
consortium members said the group could play a role in the 
expansion of medical facilities in the soviet union and quoted 
soviet health minister yevgeny chazov as saying he expects his 
nation to triple health care expenditures by the year 2000 
barry mactaggart chairman of the consortium and president of 
pfizer ancitipated that the group would market soviet health 
technologies in the west but did not explain explain what those 
might be 
we expect to get the benefit here in the united states from 
the technological developments that have been made in the soviet 
union in a variety of medical and scientific areas mactaggart 
said in a statement 
consortium members did not explain how the american participants 
could profit from helping expand medical care in the soviet union 
the ruble cannot be converted profitably into western currencies 
and previous us ventures in the soviet union have been hampered 
by tight kremlin rules governing how foreign firms can repatriate 
their profits 
the consortium was intended to facilitate the formation of joint 
ventures involving us and soviet participants and stemmed from 
discussions that took place within the usussr joint trade 
and economic council a binational group aimed at promoting 
commerce between the superpowers

police swept through israeli markets and 
industrial plants in an unprecedented move tuesday forcing 
palestinian workers who live in the occupied gaza strip to go home 
in the occupied territories israeli troops shot and killed two 
palestinians and wounded at least 17 arab reports said the army 
confirmed one dead and five wounded 
also tuesday a 50yearold palestinian jailed for security 
reasons mohammed assad fukaha died of dehydration suffered in a 
hunger strike at megiddo prison in northern israel where he was 
held for eight months military sources said 
an army spokesman confirmed the death 
officials said the expulsion of arab laborers was intended to 
punish gaza residents for antiisraeli activities in the 17month 
palestinian uprising 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the order may be widened to 
include the occupied west bank adding he hoped the penalty would 
persuade palestinians to end their violent campaign against israeli 
rule 
about 60000 palestinians from the west bank and 50000 from the 
gaza strip work in israel 
even a temporary ban could cause severe hardship for palestinian 
laborers who have few employment opportunities in the occupied 
lands 
if i dont go to work or i get sent home the store owner will 
fire me said a gazan worker in tel aviv speaking on condition 
his name not be used where am i going to get food for my 
children 
police commissioner david krauss warned on the radio tuesday 
that if gazans do not leave we will begin detaining workers and 
returning them to gaza 
rabin said the intention is to warn the residents that 
permission for free travel and work in israel are not givens they 
depend on the behavior of those who leave for work 
army chief of staff dan shomron told a parliament committee the 
expulsions were a punishment measure and said israeli leaders 
considered and rejected banning all palestinian labor in israel 
gaza has been the site of most of the latest stonethrowing 
clashes with israeli soldiers police also have said they suspect 
palestinians from gaza kidnapped one soldier and murdered another 
whose body was found last week 
in gaza on tuesday 13yearold yasser mahmoud eldranee died 
when shot in the neck by israeli troops in jabaliya refugee camp 
hospital officials said 
in the west bank town of nablus troops shot and killed yassin 
anabulsy 21 in a clash with stonethrowers the army said 
at least 479 palestinians have died as a result of the uprising 
that began in december 1987 twentyone israelis also have died 
arab reports said 12 palestinians suffered gunshot wounds in 
gaza and five in the west bank including a 15yearold critically 
hurt with a bullet wound in the heart 
in the west bank town of hebron stonethrowing attacks on 
jewish settlers cars were reported israel radio said one settler 
injured in the head fell down and his gun accidentally fired 
hitting another settler in the leg 
arab reports said dozens of settlers from nearby kiryat arba 
later attacked arab cars in hebron breaking windshields and firing 
in the air troops firing tear gas clashed with stonethrowing arab 
youths shouting allahu akbar god is great they said 
it was uncertain how many gaza workers police rounded up many 
could not report to work anyway because an indefinite curfew 
declared monday night confined gazas 700000 residents to their 
homes 
at the erez crossing into gaza hundreds of palestinian workers 
sat on the ground under army guard they had been transported by 
israeli taxis and were being taken into gaza by army trucks 
paramilitary border police went through tel avivs carmel market 
demanding arabs identity cards gaza residents were told to leave 
by tuesday night witnesses said

proposal to hold elections in the occupied lands as a first step in 
a peace process there

defense secretary dick cheney met privately 
tuesday with six congressional supporters of the v22 osprey 
aircraft project but they failed to sway his decision to shut down 
the program pentagon officials said 
the officials speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
cheney met with both of pennsylvanias senators and four of its 
congressmen for about 30 minutes to discuss the embattled project 
pennsylvania is the home state for one of the two contracting 
partners developing the plane the boeing helicopter co the other 
prime contractor is bell helicopter textron inc 
cheney in overseeing cuts in the fiscal 1990 pentagon budget 
promised by president bush announced last month he was scuttling 
the v22 program as too expensive despite intense pressure ever 
since including threats by the contractors to begin immediate 
layoffs cheney has held firm to that position 
on tuesday cheney made clear to the lawmakers that he 
understood their concerns but nothing has changed there wont 
be any more money for the program one official said 
the six pennsylvania legislators were republican sens john 
heinz and arlen specter republican reps curt weldon william f 
goodling and don ritter and democratic rep thomas foglietta 
the v22 osprey described by the marine corps as its most 
important weapons program is a revolutionary aircraft designed to 
take off like a helicopter and fly like an airplane to do this it 
utilizes special propellers at the tip of each wing that can swivel 
upward and back 
the marine corps wants to use the planes to improve its ability 
to conduct surprise longrange amphibious assaults the first of 
the planes recently began flight tests in texas 
in fashioning the fiscal 1990 budget cheney concluded the 
pentagon couldnt afford the plane and the marine corps could do 
just as well by ordering additional helicopters 
the pentagon had earlier planned to spend 259 billion on 663 
ospreys including 13 billion in 1990 the department has already 
invested 2 billion in the program over a nineyear period 
of all of cheneys budget decisions the cancellation of the 
osprey has attracted the most intense opposition on capitol hill 
the plane is built in the district of house speaker jim wright 
dtexas and also enjoys widespread support among republicans

less than a year out of stanford the 
22yearold daughter of new dallas cowboys owner jerry jones is 
making 60000 a year as an aide to a congressman who reports owing 
at least 100000 to jones 
charlotte jones who holds three titles on the staff or rep 
tommy robinson dark said tuesday there is absolutely no 
connection between her meteoric rise in position and pay on 
robinsons staff and the debt the congressman owes her father 
members of congress involved in current ethics probes said they 
also saw nothing that would constitute a violation of house rules 
if she comes to work and does the work its not a problem 
said house gop whip newt gingrich of georgia who brought the 
initial allegations of ethics violations that house speaker jim 
wright of texas faces in a separate matter 
rep john t myers the ranking republican on the ethics 
committee now investigating the allegations against wright said 
there is no de facto rule against hiring a relative of a 
campaign contributor or business partner 
there is no problem if she actually does work myers said 
robinson 47 and jones 46 have been friends since the they 
attended high school together in north little rock while jones 
took over his fathers insurance business and became a 
multimillionaire through oil and gas ventures robinson turned to 
politics with financial backing from jones 
in february jones purchased the dallas cowboys football 
franchise for an estimated 140 million 
the two men own a farm together in arkansas under the name jr 
agricultural enterprises inc of which robinson is president and 
robinson listed among his liabilities in his 198788 financial 
disclosure form a personal loan from jones of between 100000 and 
250000 
i dont know the details of that loan jones daughter said 
tuesday but as far as i know monthly payments on it are being 
made 
she conceded in an interview that her fathers relationship with 
robinson was instrumental in getting her a job on the congressmans 
staff as a 31000 constituent caseworker after graduating from 
stanford last june with a degree in human biology 
i cannot deny that im here because of my father she said 
but its not the money its the motivation that he encouraged in 
me i see no ethical conflict none whatsoever 
she said she has had a close friendship with robinson back to 
when she was in high school and he was a county sheriff and she 
interviewed him for a class paper on politics 
i have a different kind of access to him that makes it easier 
for me to interrupt him or intervene with him on behalf of somebody 
else she said i think he feels secure with me being here 
ms jones now holds three titles in robinsons office 
administrative assistant office manager and press secretary as 
more of her own doing 
the average salaries in 1987 there have been raises since 
for respective positions were 55140 25900 and 29000 
according to the congressional management foundation a nonprofit 
group that monitors congressional staff pay and provides management 
services to congress 
however most congressional employees with a college degree and 
under 25 hold jobs such as legislative assistants with an average 
pay of 23800 or legislative correspondent involved with handling 
constituent mail and services at an average pay of 18000 
according to the foundation 
robinson could not be reached monday or tuesday but he has 
defended earlier her ms jones rapid elevation on his staff saying 
she has performed her tasks in an exemplary way and adding 
you dont really expect me to hire one of my enemies do you 
i like people with no experience because theyre not 
opinionated and you can train them the way you want them to be 
trained he told the arkansas gazette which first disclosed ms 
jones salary 
ms jones said she had attempted to discourage robinson from 
boosting her pay from 51300 to 60000 in march after raising it 
from 31000 just two months earlier 
i knew how it was going to come out in the media and cause him 
political damage and i didnt think it was worth it she said 
so i held it back for three weeks until he bantered hed fire me 
if i didnt put it through

a virus called abby shows promise of being an 
effective killer of foliageeating gypsy moths the agriculture 
department said tuesday 
once the virus is applied it is transmitted to each new 
generation of moths said entomologist martin shapiro of the 
departments agricultural research service 
the agency and the forest service plan to field test the abby 
virus this summer in western maryland scientists will count the 
number of dead moth larvae and measure the amount of foliage that 
was protected 
shapiro said if abby passes the tests the virus could become an 
alternative to either bacillus thuringiensis bacteria or 
diflubenzuron a chemical presently used against the moths by 
keeping them from reaching adulthood 
shapiro who has worked on the virus strain for about seven 
years at the agencys insect patholoy laboratory in beltsville 
md named the new virus abby after the town where it was found 
abington mass 
the abby virus showed up early in the studies as one of the most 
effective of 19 different strains of nuclear polyhdrosis virus or 
npv around the world the npv strains infect gypsy caterpillars 
but may not always prevent them from defoliating trees 
but shapiro said the abby virus demonstrated in laboratory tests 
that it can kill more caterpillars 10 times faster than the 
standard npv which has been used for two years by the national 
park service in selected areas of rock creek park in washington 
dc 
park officials said that wherever npv was sprayed there was 
little or no defoliation to the trees shapiro said and that 
was the natural strain not abby 
gypsy moths in the caterpillar or larvae stage are voracious 
eaters of foliage they have gradually spread from massachusetts 
where they were imported in 1869 by a french biologist to breed 
with native american silkworms 
but the moths escaped from the laboratory and started eating 
foliage the scientist louis trouvellot returned to france and 
pursued a career in astronomy

new federal ethics rules placing strict 
restrictions on postgovernment employment will be held up for 60 
days under a delay signed by president bush on tuesday 
the new regulations which some officials have blamed for a 
spate of resignations in various government agencies including the 
national aeronautics and space administration and the pentagon 
were to have taken effect tuesday 
but bush signed legislation to postpone the measures until july 
16 after both the house and senate approved that request by the 
pentagon and the office of management and budget 
the new rules would ban federal contractors from hiring 
government officials who have supervised their competitors 
projects subject to maximum fines of 1 million and imprisonment 
of up to five years 
rep john conyers jr dmich chairman of the house committee 
on government operations said the purpose for the delay was to 
give government and industry officials an opportunity to train 
their personnel regarding the new regulations 
he said the administration and industry representatives assured 
his committee that they would not use the extension period to 
seek legislative repeal or modification of the new ethics law 
thomas l moser acting chief of nasas space station program 
blamed the new ethics regulations for being too restrictive when he 
tendered his recent resignation 
the new rules are the result of legislation passed by congress 
last year however the administration did not issue final 
regulations until last thursday

the vatican on tuesday urged authorities 
worldwide to pass tough new laws and enforce existing ones to halt 
what it says is an alarming rise in pornography and violence in the 
media it supported boycotting sponsors of offending programs 
the right to freedom of expression does not exist in a 
vacuum it said in a 13page document issued after a fiveyear 
study by the pontifical council for social communications 
the document titled pornography and violence in the 
communications media a pastoral response holds that the media 
have become a vehicle for a warped outlook on life the family 
religion and morality 
the legitimate rights to free expression and free exchange of 
information must be respected but so must the rights of 
individuals families and society to privacy public decency and 
the protection of basic values it said 
sound laws must be enacted where they are lacking weak laws 
must be strengthened and existing laws must be enforced 
the document cited no specific cases and named no countries 
the council president american archbishop john p foley and 
secretary italian monsignor pierfranco pastore also declined at a 
news conference to identify specific films programs or 
publications considered pornographic or identify particular 
countries 
but foley criticized films such as some kung fu movies that 
depict violence for the sake of violence and scenes where 
individuals appear to enjoy inflicting physical harm on others 
that is a type of violence that is really disgusting and can 
give individuals terrible ideas to act out he said 
some soap operas and other tv offerings in latin america are 
becoming more and more explicit and some in the united states are 
suggestive he said 
these dramatic programs can certainly reflect moral evil 
that is part of reality but they shouldnt glamorize evil and make 
evil something which is to be desired he said 
the document condemned pornography as a violation of human 
dignity and rights and of christian values it said the media 
lured by profits tragically succumbed to the temptation of 
exploiting human weakness 
pornography and sadistic violence debase sexuality corrode 
human relationships exploit individuals undermine marriage and 
family life foster antisocial behavior and weaken the moral fiber 
of society itself it said 
even softcore pornography can have a progressively 
desensitizing affect gradually rendering individuals morally numb 
and personally insensitive to the rights and dignity of others 
exposure to pornography can also be like exposure to 
narcotics habit forming and can lead individuals to seek 
increasingly hardcore and perverse material 
foley said the church wants to express solidarity with families 
and particularly with women who he said feel themselves to be the 
special victims of pornography and violence in the media 
he said the church supports groups such as those in the united 
states that organized boycotts of sponsors of programs they 
consider offensive 
it is their right to do so and if they feel certain things 
are damaging to their children perhaps it is even their duty to do 
so he said 
foley said the media should police themselves through 
professional codes that the church needs to maintain a clear and 
constant teaching of the faith and that parents should provide 
children with healthy attitudes toward sexuality and a basic sex 
education 
a fundamental reason for the spread of pornography or violence 
in the media would seem to be a pervasive moral permissiveness 
rooted in the search for personal gratification at any cost the 
council said 
the more sexual activity is considered as a continuing 
frenzied search for personal gratification rather than as an 
expression of enduring love and marriage the more pornography can 
be considered as a factor contributing to the undermining of 
wholesome family life 
the council said willing participation in producing or 
disseminating pornography can only be judged as a serious moral 
evil

the white house said tuesday it was very 
leery about a promised halt in soviet weapons shipments to 
nicaragua and accused soviet president mikhail s gorbachev of 
acting like a drugstore cowboy offering one arms control 
proposal after another 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed that gorbachev 
had privately told the united states that moscow was stopping its 
arms shipments to the leftist sandinista government in managua 
however he said there was no evidence of any cutoff and that 
military supplies still were going into nicaragua 
on the other hand fitzwater said the weapons being received now 
might simply have been in the pipeline when gorbachev made his 
promise or might be coming in from another country such as cuba 
im willing to leave the door open on the idea that maybe that 
evidence of continuing military shipments is misleading 
fitzwater said 
other administration sources said later there was preliminary 
evidence that nicaragua had received 17 shipments of military 
goods from the soviet union and its allies in the first four months 
of this year the value was estimated at 80 million 
the officials who insisted on anonymity said they were unable 
to determine what the shipments contained and whether the source 
was the soviet union eastern europe or cuba the officials 
cautioned reporters against drawing conclusions 
referring to the letter one official said if implemented 
this would be good news and an acknowledgement that the soviets may 
be willing to support our diplomatic effort to bring democracy and 
peace to nicaragua and an end to subversion in the region 
emphasizing that the soviet union has not made any public 
statements to back up its private promises fitzwater said we 
are very leery of their intentions were reluctant to be 
positive about this because we didnt receive the kinds of public 
commitments or the kinds of visual ones that we would like to see 
on capitol hill sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the 
senate foreign relations subcommittee on latin american affairs 
said it would be an extremely important breakthrough if 
gorbachev was in fact ending military aid to nicaragua 
and that ought to be treated seriously and not treated as if 
it were humor dodd said 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said its high time that 
the soviet union does stop supplying military support to nicaragua 
it has to come wright said as he left a white house meeting 
with president bush on the budget if were really to 
demilitarize the zone we really do need to get foreign interests 
out of there 
rep tom foley dwash the house majority leader called it 
a very welcome decision 
the promised cutoff in soviet aid put new pressure on the bush 
administration to counter a string of arms control proposals by 
gorbachev the most recent of which calls for the removal of 500 
shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
fitzwater accused gorbachev of playing a pr game in contrast 
to what he described as the very careful and methodical 
approach by the united states to examine its relationship with the 
soviet union 
we contrast that which is an admittedly cautious approach 
to the one of throwing out in a kind of a drugstore cowboy fashion 
one arms control proposal after another fitzwater said 
he said the soviet offers upon examination appear to be 
either very little change from the existing situation involving 
promises that have been made in the past involving reductions that 
are not meaningful in terms of our strategic relationship with the 
soviet union or reductions that are not meaningful in terms of 
nato 
the soviet offers have inflamed tensions within nato over 
shortrange nuclear weapons in europe backed by other members of 
the western alliance west germany has called for eastwest 
negotiations soon on reducing the weapons 
however the united states supported largely by england has 
adamantly opposed such negotiations on grounds that nuclear weapons 
are needed to offset the big advantage in conventional forces 
enjoyed by the sovietled warsaw pact 
with the dispute threatening to mar the unity of a nato summit 
may 2930 fitzwater said bonn and washington have not been able to 
reach an agreement 
we have not reached a compromise at this point he said 
its difficult to say whether or not we will but we continue to 
discuss the matter with them 
an administration official said the promise of a soviet aid 
cutoff to nicaragua was contained in a letter from gorbachev to 
bush it arrived in washington before secretary of state james a 
baker iii left for talks in moscow early last week 
the united states estimates the soviet union gave nicaragua 515 
million in military aid last year including attack helicopters and 
other weapons 
fitzwater said preliminary estimates indicate the sandinistas 
have received several shipments of military goods worth 
millions of dollars this year although he was unclear about the 
source of the aid 
us intelligence shows that nicaragua received 17 shipments of 
military goods from soviet bloc sources since the beginning of the 
year with a value estimated at 80 million said an administration 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
that compares with some 130 million to 150 million worth 
received by the sandinistas in the first half of last year 
indicating a somewhat slower rate this year

pan am has lost more than 60 million in 
revenue because of the bombing of flight 103 over scotland last 
december the companys chairman said tuesday 
thomas g plaskett said the worst losses appear to be over but 
that the threat of terrorism against us and other government 
policies continues and governments should begin paying for a 
greater share of aviation security 
the us government plaskett said in a speech to an aviation 
industry group should stop putting the financial burden on the 
backs of either the industry or the traveling public 
the bush administration has ordered airlines to pay the expected 
100 million cost of installing devices to detect plastic 
explosives at highrisk airports around the world but a bill is 
pending in congress to use federal funds for the units 
the dec 21 bombing of flight 103 which killed all 259 people 
aboard the plane and 11 on the ground in lockerbie scotland has 
been traced to a plastic bomb concealed in a checkedin 
radiocassette player 
plaskett said pan am lost 60 million in the first quarter of 
1989 and more in april after some us companies advised employees 
not to fly on us carriers in europe because of the threat of 
terrorist attacks 
plaskett said 12 of the last 14 terrorist incidents against 
civil aviation involved nonus carriers 
he said pan am spends close to 45 million a year on security 
compared with an average of 10 million for foreign carriers whose 
governments usually share the expense all us airlines he said 
spend about a halfbillion dollars a year on security 
he said us airlines xray or handsearch all checked baggage 
deny passengers access to checked baggage carry only bags that can 
be matched to passengers aboard the aircraft and give additional 
screening to passengers who fit a risk profile

federal authorities arrested at least 26 
people including two panamanian nationals during a crackdown 
tuesday on a major drug ring that operated here and in los angeles 
and new york authorities said 
us attorney jay b stephens estimated the organization 
distributed up to 50 kilograms of 98 percent pure cocaine and crack 
every month the fbi estimated the drugs value at 6 million 
monthly 
the action came four days after a grand jury handed up a 
112count indictment charging 32 persons with narcotics trafficking 
and conspiracy 
stephens said authorities on tuesday seized four kilograms of 
cocaine thousands of dollars in cash five cars three houses and 
several guns 
the organizations alleged kingpins were panamanian nationals 
marcos loinas anderson and gabriel davismunoz stephens said he 
would not dismiss a possible connection between the two and 
panamanian military strongman manuel antonio noriega but said it 
would be speculation 
officials suspect the drugs originated in colombia and were 
transported through panama on commercial air lines to los angeles 
and new york using panamanian and jamaican immigrants as couriers 
from there the narcotics were moved by car to the washington 
area and in lesser degrees to colorado springs colo and killeen 
texas said fbi agent w douglas gow 
all of the suspects were charged with conspiracy and face a 
maximum sentence of life imprisonment and 4 million in fines 
stephens said

former attorney general edwin meese iii and 
the american civil liberties union bitter foes in the past joined 
forces tuesday to endorse freedom of expression on american college 
campuses 
the unlikely alliance was prompted by the settlement of a 
lawsuit pitting california state university at northridge against 
james taranto a conservative former editor of the universitys 
student newspaper 
taranto was suspended from the news editors job at the daily 
sundial in 1987 after he wrote an opinion piece criticizing ucla 
officials for their handling of a controversy over affirmative 
action 
taranto also reprinted a cartoon from the ucla student newspaper 
that satirized affirmative action 
meese once called the aclu a criminals lobby and as a deputy 
district attorney in 1964 had supervised the arrest of more 700 
student demonstrators on the university of californias berkeley 
campus during the free speech movement 
on monday he attended a news conference at the aclus 
headquarters in washington with taranto and aclu director morton 
halperin 
i disagree with the aclu on many of their policies meese 
said but i have never said they should not be free to espouse 
them i dont see anything inconsistent with encouraging them when 
they do what is right 
the university should be a citadel of free speech meese 
said regardless of whether the views expressed are liberal or 
conservative 
halperin said were happy to have any allies we can get on 
any issue were delighted to have meese come and express support 
for first amendment rights on campuses 
he added that he was particularly pleased that meese gave his 
support to the aclus approach to dealing with controversial 
subjects the remedy here is more speech not to suppress 
speech halperin said 
the aclu continues to believe university officials should 
speak out against racist or antiminority views when they are 
expressed in student publications halperin said but they should 
not use the coercive powers of the university to censor those 
views he said 
taranto is now a public relations assistant at the conservative 
heritage foundation here where meese also is employed taranto 
said he invited meese to attend tuesdays news conference and the 
former attorney general readily agreed 
tarantos article in the daily sundial in march 1987 said ucla 
officials had helped stifle dissent about the issue of 
affirmative action 
the cartoon first printed in the ucla newpspaer the daily 
bruin and reprinted to accompany tarantos article depicted a 
rooster saying he was admitted to ucla under its affirmative action 
program to help minorities 
taranto was suspended as editor by cynthia rawitch the faculty 
adviser to the student newspaper at california state she said he 
had violated a school policy requiring consultation with the 
faculty adviser before running controversial articles 
taranto said he had been punished for his conservative views 
and with the help of the aclu sued the university on grounds his 
freespeech rights had been violated 
campus leftists are attempting to silence conservative 
students through censorship and intimidation taranto said 
under the settlement to the suit announced tuesday the 
university agreed to give taranto 93 in back pay for the twoweek 
suspension and remove the reference to his suspension from his 
university records 
the university also amended its policy on publication of 
controversial articles in the daily sundial it agreed to declare 
the newspaper a public forum and permit publication of 
controversial material without the faculty advisers permission 
unless the material could be obscene libelous or invade someones 
privacy 
michael emery head of the universitys journalism department 
said in a telephone interview he considers the settlement fair for 
both sides 
everybody now knows exactly where they stand he said emery 
described the incident involving tarantos article as a real 
quirky deal and said the university always has stood for freedom 
of expression 
the cartoon caused holy hell when it was printed in the ucla 
newspaper he said there could have been a similar explosion at 
our school 
but emery said in the future the studentrun newspaper would be 
free to run such material without consulting with the faculty 
adviser

the marxist government said on tuesday 
that moslem guerrillas abandoned their quest to capture the eastern 
city of jalalabad and opened a major offensive on the southern 
border town of khost 
at least 1193 guerrillas were killed since the khost attack 
began sunday including 723 since monday foreign ministry 
spokesman mohammad amani said 
amani said the armed forces responded with heavy artillery and 
air strikes to a frontal assault by 9000 guerrillas and fired 
dozens of scudb missiles from bases in kabul the capital about 
250 miles north of khost 
rebels fired seven rockets into kabul on tuesday and one hit a 
gate at a terminal at kabul airport killing three people amani 
said he said no other casualties resulted 
rain and low cloud cover grounded afghan warplanes allowing the 
insurgents hiding in the surrounding mountains to move closer to 
kabul he said military transport and civilian flights were 
canceled 
the guerrillas armed by the united states saudi arabia and 
china and based in neighboring pakistan have tried for 11 years to 
topple the sovietbacked government 
the rebels control much of the afghan countryside but not the 
cities capturing a city would give them a base for the interim 
government they formed in pakistan in february 
the guerrillas launched a major assault in early march on 
jalalabad 45 miles from pakistan after surrendering several key 
outposts early in the attack government troops beat back the 
guerrillas in a counterattack 
according to amani government forces began sweeping through the 
southwestern part of jalalabad on monday to clear out rebels he 
said 35 guerrillas were killed and 34 wounded eight civilians also 
were wounded 
military officials have said 500 civilians were killed and 3000 
wounded during the siege 
amani said that having failed to capture jalalabad the 
guerrillas attacked khost about six miles from the pakistan border 
they were expecting a quick victory in jalalabad but they 
found this was very difficult the foreign ministry spokesman 
said now they have failed and given up and begun an attack on 
khost 
time and again they have claimed to control much of the 
country but they control no city they were totally defeated in 
jalalabad and now they will be defeated in khost 
unlike jalalabad khost has no major airport or 
telecommunications center but contains one of the countrys 
strongest military bases amani said 
about 80000 people live in the khost district a major 
agricultural center 
amani said the main road between kabul and khost cuts through 
rugged terrain and can be easily blocked 
he said insurgents staged hit and run attacks in northern konduz 
province soldiers killed two rebels and wounded 28 without 
suffering casualties he said

the half million students affected by a 
strike in the nations secondlargest school district held raucous 
demonstrations played hooky or dawdled through a second day of 
classes tuesday with too few teachers 
to even pretend any teaching was going on would be short of 
ridiculous said don schrack a spokesman for united teacherslos 
angeles which represents about 22000 teachers counselors nurses 
and librarians 
informal talks were continuing but negotiators appeared to be 
awaiting a report due wednesday from a state factfinder who began 
investigating the claims of both sides last march when negotiations 
reached an impasse in the 16month contract dispute 
hundreds of boisterous students marched out of benjamin franklin 
high school in highland park and faced off briefly with police 
after a patrol car was pelted with rocks 
students left belmont high school to picket the school 
districts downtown headquarters 
my fathers a teacher he works overtime constantly and i 
dont think he gets paid enough said mercedes chavez 18 whose 
father rudy teaches english at belmont she had been marching at 
the district headquarters for three hours with her 15monthold 
daughter dominique 
among those carrying a picket sign tuesday was garfield high 
school calculus teacher jaime escalante whose portrayal in the 
film stand and deliver has made him probably the citys 
bestknown instructor 
i have to support them 100 percent because i feel that we 
deserve better pay and professional pay if we look for quality 
education said escalante 
without additional teachers its going to be very very 
difficult to finish the final weeks of the semester and grade 
students fairly said gabriel cortina a los angeles unified school 
district associate superintendent 
he made a plea for more substitutes which the district hopes to 
lure with higher than usual pay 167 instead of 137 a day 
the higher pay outraged picketing teachers 
its demeaning to be treated like that said dale tropp a 
teacher at an elementary school 
i make about half what the substitutes are making today 
said susan perry a thirdgrade teacher 
on monday substitute teacher randy kiyabu arrived at narbonne 
high school in a white chauffeured limousine as a way of outraging 
strikers 
students at san fernando high school took up a collection of 95 
for one substitute who said he only took the job because he needed 
the money the unidentified teacher left after he was handed the 
cash 
there were no immediate figures tuesday on attendance by the 
districts nearly 540000 students or on the number of teachers who 
crossed picket lines 
schools spokeswoman diana munatones told reporters we do have 
a trend established that a lot of teachers are returning to the 
classroom 
our estimates are that 73 to 83 percent of the teachers are 
out said union spokeswoman catherine carey adding we dont 
see any significant attrition 
the teachers are demanding a 21 percent pay increase in two 
years they also want relief from unpaid duties such as playground 
patrol and greater control in choosing curricula 
the district most recently offered a 215 percent pay increase 
over three years and has promised to set up teachers councils at 
individual schools on curricula 
teachers in the district earn from 23440 in beginning salary 
to 43319 for those with doctorates 98 extra course units and 19 
years experience

us supreme court justice anthony m 
kennedy on tuesday blocked a 15yearold girl from obtaining an 
abortion without the consent of her parents or a judge 
in effect kennedy reinstated a 1988 state law that had been 
struck down as unconstitutional by a florida appeals court 
his ruling means a minor seeking an abortion in florida will 
still have to get permission from her parents or a judge until at 
least thursday when the full us supreme court reviews kennedys 
decision at a conference 
kennedy acted without comment after the florida supreme court 
earlier in the day decided to allow the girl and all other minors 
in florida to obtain abortions without adult consent until the 
florida justices hear arguments on the matter in september 
kennedys action will stand only until the full court considers 
it the justices could continue to keep the law in effect until 
they decide whatever constitutional issues may be involved 
another option would be to lift kennedys stay and let the 
decision of the 5th district court of appeal in daytona beach stand 
until the federal justices or the state supreme court rule on the 
merits 
i think we are examining a law that needs to be examined that 
needs to be very clear for the trial courts said jerri blair 
the girls lawyer before kennedy ruled ultimately what will 
happen it will cause the legislature to revisit and clarify the 
guidelines 
fourteen states including florida have consent laws but two 
are unenforced and three have been blocked by courts said kathryn 
kolbert an american civil liberties union lawyer in new york city 
in 12 other states ms kolbert said parents only have to be 
notified about the abortion but that is not enforced in four 
states and courts have blocked the laws in five other states 
in february the us supreme court allowed kentucky to begin 
enforcing a 1986 parental notification law the justices without 
comment turned down an emergency request by abortionrights 
activists seeking to block the law 
this time the request for an emergency stay was filed by a 
lawyer appointed to represent the interest of the fetus 
certainly time is of the essence and that can be determined 
from the flurry of activity said attorney richard boylston of 
tavares 
the girl is 12 weeks pregnant and many clinics wont perform 
abortions after the 13th week because of a greater risk of medical 
complications ms blair said 
its our view that its highly inappropriate that a lawyer 
should be appointed for the fetus said ms kolbert she said the 
aclu which filed a friendofthe court brief with the state 
supreme court may do the same in the nations high court 
the national organization for women issued a statement in 
washington that read in part every passing day has the potential 
of making an abortion more difficult and possibly dangerous if not 
impossible for the young woman whose life has become a judicial 
football 
those following the case said kennedys action caught them by 
surprise and they could not immediately analyze what it might mean 
to abortionconsent laws around the nation 
i have no idea whatsoever what is going on said charlene 
carres counsel for floridas branch of the american civil 
liberties union 
others noted that the final disposition of such state laws as 
floridas would have to await results of a us supreme court 
review of a missouri case in which it could revise the roe vs wade 
decision that legalized abortion in 1973 
state rep daniel webster a republican who sponsored the 
abortion consent law last year called the state courts ruling 
striking down the abortion consent law only temporary and said 
were looking at a broader picture 
the florida law requires unmarried girls under 18 to obtain the 
consent of their parents or a judge 
in the case in which kennedy acted a girl petitioned a court 
may 2 for permission to get an abortion she said she could not 
approach her parents without fear of emotional or physical abuse 
two days later circuit judge jerry t lockett denied the 
petition saying the law was unworkable because it is 
unconstitutionally vague and does not let judges hold proper 
hearings the case then went to the appeals court which struck 
down the law 
of approximately 75000 abortions performed in florida last 
year about a third were on minors according to abortionrights 
activists 
since the law took effect in february few teenagers have gone 
through the courts to seek a judges permission for an abortion 
janis comptoncarr executive director of the florida abortion 
rights action league said many youngsters are going to georgia to 
get abortions 
the now statement noted kennedy the high courts newest member 
has not yet ruled on an abortion case but his decision to block the 
florida ruling bears out the groups suspicion that he is hostile 
to the constitutional concept oulthood 
shapiro who has worked on the virus strain for about seven 
years at the agencys insect pathology laboratory in beltsville 
md named the new virus abby after the town where it was found 
abington mass 
the abby virus showed up early in the studies as one of the most 
effective of 19 different strains of nuclear polyhdrosis virus or 
npv around the world the npv strains infect gypsy caterpillars 
but may not always prevent them from defoliating trees 
but shapiro said the abby virus demonstrated in laboratory tests 
that it can kill more caterpillars 10 times faster than the 
standard npv which has been used for two years by the national 
park service in selected areas of rock creek park in washington 
dc 
park officials said that wherever npv was sprayed there was 
little or no defoliation to the trees shapiro said and that 
was the natural strain not abby 
gypsy moths in the caterpillar or larvae stage are voracious 
eaters of foliage they have gradually spread from massachusetts 
where they were imported in 1969 by a french biologist to breed 
with native american silkworms 
but the moths escaped from the laboratory and started eating 
foliage the scientist louis trouvellot returned to france and 
pursued a career in astronomy

the bush administration pressured house 
democrats on tuesday to quickly provide 340 million for veterans 
health programs and warned lawmakers that adding extra spending to 
the measure would prompt a presidential veto 
the money is in a multibilliondollar domestic spending bill for 
this year that continued to be snarled because of differences over 
hundreds of millions of dollars it contains for antidrug programs 
in a letter to house appropriations committee chairman jamie 
whitten dmiss veterans affairs secretary edward j derwinski 
said that failure to provide the money soon would result in delayed 
purchases of medical equipment and a gradual reduction in the 
departments work force 
each day that supplemental funding is not forthcoming the 
level of service provided by the vas medical system is 
diminished he wrote 
letters were also directed to whitten and house leaders by the 
veterans of foreign wars the american legion and the paralyzed 
veterans of america each of which urged quick passage of the 
legislation 
to be blunt veterans are being placed in lifethreatening 
situations the veterans of foreign wars said 
agency officials have previously warned that veterans hospitals 
will begin running out of money in late may 
the money is for the 1989 fiscal year which ends sept 30 with 
congress memorial day recess coming up lawmakers are reluctant to 
leave town without having provided the veterans money 
but the hangup continued to be 822 million for new prisons 
extra law officers and other antidrug initiatives which the 
administration has argued can wait until next year 
rep neal smith diowa chairman of the appropriations justice 
subcommittee has said the money is needed and argued that 
republicans should be forced to demonstrate how resolutely they 
support president bushs efforts against drugs 
he has proposed paying for much of the spending with parts of 
the 650 million the government expects to collect in fines from 
the wall street firm of drexel burnham lambert 
in a policy statement it issued tuesday the administration said 
it believed smiths financing plan is not valid because it 
would still add to the deficit 
leading members of the appropriations committee met among 
themselves and with the democratic house leadership for much of the 
day but were unable to work out a solution to the problem 
everybody keeps working on all kinds of alternatives smith 
said 
a 47 billion version of the bill was pulled off the house 
floor last month after objections were raised over its cost 
the leadership of the appropriations committee has reduced the 
measures price tag to about 32 billion excluding the drug 
spending according to one government source who asked to not be 
identified

experts on violence involving children urged a 
house panel tuesday to shift its focus from stiffening penalties 
for criminals to minimizing the effect on children of witnessing 
violent crime 
but legislators were not receptive to that message which came 
one day after president bush unveiled an extensive anticrime 
package 
the experts told the house select committee on children youth 
and families that federal efforts to reduce violence by and against 
children should work to dispel myths about crime especially in 
innercity black communities 
the government also should restructure the education system to 
emphazize values and offer viable employment and recreational 
options to youth the experts testified 
the experts received little encouragement from federal lawmakers 
your recommendations are really out of kilter with where 
politicians are headed said rep george miller chairman of the 
panel 
the california democrat said most of his fellow congressmen are 
getting on the bandwagon heading down the road of stiffer and 
stiffer penalties 
dr carl c bell a chicago psychiatrist warned that many 
children who regularly witness extreme violence dont get the 
counseling they need to lessen their risk of becoming victims or 
perpretrators of crime 
what we need to consider is that a lot of the educational 
problems and behavioral disturbances that i see among young black 
children may very well be due to the fact that theyve 
witnessed violence and are suffering from posttraumatic stress 
disorder similar to what vietnam veterans suffered said bell 
he warned that myths and misconceptions about homicides in the 
black community are being heightened by media focus on sensational 
incidents 
many blacks think its white policemen who have killed the 
majority of blacks he said but blackonblack murder is the 
leading cause of death in black males 15 to 44 and the leading 
cause of death in black females 15 to 34 
but bell said policymakers cannot be excused for demonstrating 
a selective inattention to black homicide because many whites 
harbor the fear expressed by one of his colleagues if black 
people stop killing black people they will start killing white 
people 
dr howard spivak deputy health commissioner of massachusetts 
said the typical homicide occurs when two young men of the same 
race who know each other have been drinking or using drugs and get 
into an argument that escalates into a fatal act of violence 
punitive measures like those being touted nationally would have 
no effect said spivak 
but district of columbia superior court associate judge reginald 
walton who has been nominated to be the no 3 man in the office of 
national drug control policy said many young men who end up before 
him have no idea what the appropriate role of a male or father is 
in this society 
walton complained that policy makers have ignored earlier 
recommendations for dealing with the effect of crime on children 
he said no action was taken when a task force for washington 
dc schools on which he served proposed improving school athletic 
programs consequently the judge said he learned that drug 
dealers are financing an underground basketball league used to 
recruit young people 
bell and spivak also criticized television for presenting 
unrealistic heroes male role models and situations that emphasize 
violent solutions to problems 
one young man being treated in an emergency room for a gunshot 
wouund told me that he was surprised that the injury hurt his 
perception from television was that such injuries were neither 
painful nor incapacitating said spivak 
weve simply got to stop peddling violence to the children of 
this country added gregory loken executive director of covenant 
house a runaway youth program based in new york city

the white house came to a temporary halt 
tuesday for what president bush described as a dog eat dog 
tennis match featuring pros chris evert and pam shriver against two 
of bushs sons 
the two women were supposed to have played against marvin and 
jeb bush last year in florida in a fundraising game during bushs 
presidential race however the game was rained out 
it was finally rescheduled for tuesday on the white house courts 
but was rained out there as well so they moved the game to an 
indoor court usually reserved for senators on the fifth floor of 
the hart senate office building 
watching from the sidelines were commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher cia chief william webster michael j boskin chairman 
of the council of economic advisers a sprinkling of members of 
congress and other guests 
this is just a happy family match dog eat dog bush said 
the press was excluded from most of the match but it was clear 
during a brief phototaking session that the teams were evenly 
matched 
on the return to the white house reporters shouted to ask who 
had won 
jeb bush was about to answer but pam shriver clamped her hand 
over his mouth 
it was learned from reliable sources that the men won two out 
of three sets

an air force plane evacuated the 
first group of us military dependents tuesday on the eve of a 
general strike that the panamanian government has called illegal 
the opposition vowed to go ahead with the oneday strike which 
coincides with the opening wednesday in washington of a conference 
of the organization of american states on panamas nullified 
election 
president bush telephoned guillermo endara the oppositions 
presidential candidate in the may 7 election who was severely 
beaten a week ago by street gangs from the progovernment dignity 
battalions 
endara was released from a hospital tuesday an aide said bush 
spoke with endara for about seven minutes and told him us actions 
were aimed at gen manuel antonio noriega commander of the 
nations defense forces and not the panamanian people 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said in washington that 
bush called endara to express sympathy over the assault which mr 
endara and his fellow leaders of the democratic forces in panama 
suffered at the hands of the noriega regime 
the president noted the wave of outrage which has swept the 
hemisphere in the wake of noriegas effort to steal the election by 
force and fraud 
at the us howard air force base 238 americans boarded a 
chartered air force plane the first of hundreds of dependents to 
be evacuated in the next few weeks 
air force maj joan ferguson said the group had 164 military 
dependents 71 activeduty personnel and three dependents of an 
armed forces civilian employee 
she said some of the activeduty personnel had fewer than three 
months left on their tours in panama and were vacating base housing 
to make room for those who had been living off the base she said 
others were going on home leave and were taking advantage of the 
special flight 
while some americans were being evacuated the bush 
administration was sending 1900 military personnel into panama to 
reinforce the more than 10000 troopers stationed here 
the noriegacontrolled government said wednesdays strike is 
motivated by political goals not economic issues and is an 
attempt to stain panamas image at the oas meeting 
both the government and opposition say they will have 
representatives at the conference 
benjamin colamarco the head of the dignity battalions said 
the paramilitary groups had no plans for the general strike and 
were poised only to repel a us invasion members of the groups 
have frequently attacked opposition rallies 
endara after leaving the hospital said wednesday would be a 
very important day and threats would not stop the opposition 
influential legislator rigoberto paredes said on stateowned 
radio nacional the strike is intended to create disorder in the 
streets to a degree that the united states can use it to justify 
direct physical intervention in panama 
he said noriegas departure from power is not negotiable 
the opposition has said any solution to the panamanian crisis 
must involve talks with the military leading to noriegas dismissal 
or resignation 
the troop presence on the streets has been low since may 11 
with the government frequently broadcasting declarations that the 
nation is calm 
the opposition wants the oas to impose sanctions that would 
amount to a political and diplomatic quarantine of panama if the 
government refuses to respect the results of the may 7 presidential 
elections 
opposition leaders says they won by a 31 margin the government 
contends its candidates were ahead 21 when it stopped the vote 
count and nullified the elections 
washington is urging latin american nations to remove their 
ambassadors from panama 
us ambassador arthur davis recalled for consultations by 
bush left for washington monday mexico and venezuela also have 
recalled their envoys 
endara smiling but with a bandaged head walked from the 
hospital and was cheered by a small group of hospital workers and 
other supporters 
he repeated the opposition contention that their candidates won 
and that nothing short of being sworn into office will satisfy them 
endara rejected the idea of a junta ruling after acting 
president manuel solis palmas term runs out sept 1 
the panamanian people expressed their will on may 7 we 
consider it the will of god and will not compromise he said 
a communique from the labor ministry published in newspapers 
tuesday said businesses may not close their doors and their 
first obligation is to give work to all of their workers 
it urged businesses to open and employees to report for work 
but did not say what would happen if they did not 
the opposition is urging panamanians to stay in their houses 
wednesday except for protests at noon by any imaginable means

now five days later the kirbergs are resigned to living with 
the leblancs under evacuation rules they said they have until 
july 1 to find onbase housing or blake and his mother will have to 
leave 
kirbergs twoyear tour as an army contract employee ends in 
july anyway 
they are planning a trip to their 10thfloor apartment 
overlooking the city and the bay to bring back anything that 
could be stolen that includes three tv sets and a vcr theyll 
also check on the dog sissy boarding with a foster family 
for them its the little things that are the biggest problems 
fouryearold blake misses his dog but has found a new playmate 
in the leblancs 9weekold toy poodle prince 
emil kirberg misses sissy too the 20pound mutt used to pull 
guard duty in blakes bedroom and now blake insists on sleeping in 
the kirbergs bed 
hes like an octopus hes got eight arms and he swims said 
kirberg 
blake will be out of school as of friday the base is cutting 
short the school year so those who want to leave soon can receive 
credit andor graduate 
the leblancs with two daughters in college in texas originally 
took in a second family too but that crowded the house 
theyre the kind that only need five hours of sleep while the 
rest of us need eight said boyle so they were lying in bed at 
5 am afraid theyd wake us up if they moved around 
that family moved out sunday returning to their house in panama 
city 
his motherinlaw really wanted to go home and they didnt see 
any security problem said kirberg she was 78 and it was all 
too much for her 
indeed the reasons for the evacuation escape even some 
hardbitten veterans 
one retired master sergeant who still works at fort clayton said 
he got together with some of his onduty comrades monday night to 
complain about the management 
this is not being handled well he grumbled there just 
isnt any crisis 
other drawbacks aside from not sleeping in your own bed as 
boyle said are minor 
leo leblanc doesnt like blake fooling with his stereo hookup 
theres only one shower the leblancs wont accept money for food 
so the kirbergs try to figure out the menu and buy for it 
there are also some positive features the leblanc house is only 
two minutes from the kirbergs offices instead of half an hour 
and pat leblanc is a great cook which the kirbergs admit has 
not been a strong point for either of them 
i want to stay forever said blake 
fine well draw up the adoption papers said leo leblanc 
but pat leblanc shook her head 
i havent forgotten what its like to have little kids she 
said

the rail line wrecked by a runaway 
train that leveled homes killing four people reopened tuesday 
after southern pacific and the city reached an agreement heading 
off a threatened court order 
the first train down the cajon pass rolled past the site of the 
accident at 405 pm and the second train followed 40 minutes 
later said southern pacific spokesman jerry pera 
city attorney james penman with city council authorization to 
seek an injunction keeping the track closed insisted on an 
agreement requiring that the railroad buy 11 properties damaged in 
the accident friday 
southern pacific had agreed to buy seven 70000 homes that were 
demolished and agreed tuesday afternoon to buy the other four and 
accepted the citys demand for an undeveloped land buffer in case 
of another derailment 
southern pacific also agreed to pay the costs of relocating 
residents and housing them for 90 days pick up the citys cleanup 
costs and defend san bernardino in any lawsuit resulting from the 
wreck 
penman said the agreement prevented a potentially protracted 
court fight we know it is difficult to get an injunction against 
a national transportation arm he said 
eight trains that normally use the line daily had been rerouted 
since friday when a train traveling 90 mph jumped the tracks on a 
curve trains are supposed to take at 30 mph two boys in a home and 
two crewmen were killed 
penman said the railroad complained that it is losing 1 million 
a day while the track is closed 
the national transportation safety board was winding down 
interviews tuesday in a monday night briefing officials said 
trainman larry hill didnt tell the lead engineer about a set of 
failed brakes on the train 
hill also told investigators that he failed to activate 
emergency brakes for 13 miles after first noticing a loss of 
pressure in brake lines officials said 
ntsb officials said there also was a chance the crew of the 
69car southern pacific freight train was unaware of how heavy 
their freight was and miscalculated the braking needed down the 
pass where the accident occurred

the leaders of eight african nations on 
tuesday signed an angolan government peace plan aimed at ending the 
countrys 14year civil war the news agency lusa reported 
after a oneday summit in luanda angolas capital the leaders 
supported the peace plan by president jose eduardo dos santos the 
portuguese agency said 
dos santos did not disclose details of the plan other than to 
say it includes a peace zone along the benguela railroad lusa 
reported 
the railroad running through central angola is an important 
route to the atlantic ocean for landlocked zaire zambia and 
zimbabwe but rebel attacks have paralyzed much of the track 
dos santos was joined in support for his plan by the presidents 
of congo gabon mozambique sao tome e principe zaire zambia and 
zimbabwe 
its not about obtaining peace at any price the angolan 
news agency angop quoted dos santos as saying earlier tuesday 
but to consider the means and to create the conditions for 
launching a just and lasting peace 
angop said most of the african leaders support an african 
solution proposed by the angolan government that would allow 
rebels to integrate into society through a government amnesty 
dos santos has refused to negotiate with jonas savimbis rebel 
national union for the total independence of angola and says any 
solution must accept oneparty rule by his popular movement for the 
liberation of angola a marxist party 
the rebels have rejected the amnesty and demand negotiations 
leading to powersharing in the former portuguese colony 
savimbi was excluded from ussponsored peace talks that led to 
a december agreement by which south africa pledged to halt aid to 
the rebels and grant independence to angolas southern neighbor 
namibia 
in exchange 50000 cuban troops backing the angolan government 
in the war have begun leaving angola 
the luanda summit follows a series of meetings between dos 
santos and other african leaders since last october when the 
angolan president committed himself to look for a solution 
inspired by the experience of other african countries that have 
lived through similar situations 
earlier tuesday african leaders criticized us support for the 
rightwing angolan rebels who have waged a bush war since 1974 
dos santos attacked what he called the united states publicly 
declared intention to continue to destabilize angola the angop 
news agency said in a report monitored in lisbon 
zambian president kenneth kaunda praised the reagan and bush 
administrations for mediating in the angolan dispute but said the 
us supply of arms to the rebels contradicted this and was 
killing the angolan people

hud secretary jack kemp said tuesday he would 
restore funding beginning june 1 to a subsidized lowincome housing 
program he canceled last month 
testifying for the second day before the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on hud and independent agencies kemp also said the 
department of housing and urban development would issue new 
guidelines to ensure competitiveness and more equitable 
distribution of funds in the scandalplagued moderate 
rehabilitation program 
ive asked my general counsel to prepare for the federal 
register by june 1 the notification of fund availability said 
kemp we want to make sure that the good guys are not 
squeezed out of the system by political influence 
kemp suspended the section 8 moderate rehabilitation program on 
april 26 after an audit by the hud inspector general revealed 
several former hud and other government officials were consultants 
to public housing authorities obtaining grants to renovate and 
repair subsidized housing for lowincome families 
the consultants charged the housing authority or developer 
between 500 and 1500 per unit in many cases for doing little 
more than placing phone calls or writing to former government 
colleagues 
the inspector generals audit also showed many states received 
more than their alloted fair share of the grants while those 
most in need were shortchanged 
the integrity of the system is important for all of us said 
kemp promising the inspector general would maintain an ongoing 
audit of the program 
those people who are going to participate in this program are 
going to know up front from day one that it is going to be audited 
very carefully 
asked by subcommittee chairwoman sen barbara mikulski dmd 
how he would also ensure the good guy communities which 
followed previous hud regulations werent punished kemp said there 
would be no prejudice against those communities and projects that 
had been approved before the suspension 
however he said it would not be possible to preserve the 
programs competitiveness if their proposals were given any 
advantage over new submissions 
they wont lose their position he said it will be looked 
at very carefully theyve already done much of the work thats 
involved but it will just be a broader competitive process 
mikulski also wanted some assurance that hud was taking steps to 
recover any actual losses discovered by the departments audit 
the audit estimated that incorrect rent calculations in the 43 
projects reviewed by the inspector general would result in 
excessive housing assistance totaling 58 million during the 
15year contract period total excessive assistance for all 
projects funded could approach 413 million the report said 
where we find that the rent levels have been set to high 
because of the inappropriate level of rehabilitation we will on 
a casebycase basis take steps to roll back the rents and that 
will in turn save subsidy costs over the multiple year period 
said jim schoenberger hud general deputy assistant secretary

communist party chief zhao ziyang promised 
hungerstriking students early wednesday the government will take 
concrete steps toward democracy demanded by the 300000 people 
jamming tiananmen square 
but student leaders said they rejected zhaos offer and would 
press on with their protests for democracy 
as chinese leaders held a historic summit with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev in the great hall of the people on tuesday 
protesters surged onto its steps the crowd including students on 
a 4dayold hunger strike turned the adjoining 100acre square 
into a vast parade ground 
hundreds of police and soldiers guarded the hall entrances but 
no police were seen in the square 
the monthold student campaign for democracy became a mass 
movement as teachers doctors reporters government employees 
workers and others who had cheered from the sidelines took up 
banners and marched 
not since the 196676 cultural revolution when youths mobilized 
by mao tsetung ousted alleged rightists has there been such a 
mass challenge to the communist establishment this time however 
it is coming from outside the party 
we cannot fail to come out at such a critical moment said a 
qinghua university teacher 
after midnight zhao sent a message to the students from the 
party leadership saying it affirmed their patriotic spirit in 
calling for greater democracy and attacking official corruption 
he also said the government would not punish them and would 
work out concrete measures to enhance democracy and law oppose 
corruption build an honest and clean government and expand 
openness 
the message reported by the official news agency xinhua 
addressed key demands of the students but he did not accede to a 
demand for talks with officials to be broadcast live 
zhao promised only that leaders would talk with students and 
other people at various levels through multiple channels after the 
students return to campuses 
student leaders received the document from party officials 
during the night and rejected it after a meeting said cheng zhen 
of beijing normal university 
she said it did not adequately address the question of a 
dialogue with the students and did not thoroughly reject the 
governments previous stance that students want to put the country 
in turmoil 
students planned another mass march on wednesday afternoon 
hundreds conducted an overnight sitin outside communist party 
headquarters led in occasional chants of li peng come out by 
a buddhist monk in a saffron robe waving a small bell 
many chinese speculated the protest would force the complete 
retirement of 84yearold senior leader deng xiaoping who in 1987 
stepped down from all posts except head of the central military 
commission 
if the leaders fear the people they cant represent them 
said song lou a teacher at the workers movement institute 
in a meeting with gorbachev however zhao said we still need 
his wisdom and experience 
a doctor at the beijing emergency center said early wednesday 
about 600 of the more than 3000 hunger strikers had been 
hospitalized since the strike began saturday but some later 
returned to the square he said some cases were serious including 
one student he treated for heart failure 
twelve students also stopped taking liquids tuesday 
classmates laid them on blankets just off the square already 
closed to traffic by the crowd 
we cannot die today proclaimed a banner held over their 
heads 
in the coastal city of shanghai more than 4000 students held a 
sitin at city headquarters to show support for the beijing hunger 
strikers xinhua reported 
xinhua and the tv news also carried unusually complete reports 
of the beijing protest including the support shown by the public 
a high party official yan mingfu visited the strikers and said 
over a studentcontrolled loudspeaker he sympathized with them but 
urged them to go home and give the government more time several 
student leaders agreed 
yan is somebody we can trust said wuer kaixi of the united 
association of beijing universities an independent student group 
formed to lead the movement the hunger strikers voted to stay 
with only 56 dissenting 
the presidents of beijing colleges issued a letter read over the 
public address system that urged the students to end the protest 
but also asked the government to meet the demands 
students say they will not leave the square until the government 
apologizes for an april 26 editorial in the peoples daily that 
accused them of plotting against the state 
they had expected the government to capitulate quickly but then 
prepared for a long protest 
with public donations they bought umbrellas and hats to shelter 
protesters they organized trucks to bring water and take away 
garbage and kept paths clear for the trucks and ambulances 
hunger strikers sprawled listlessly on blankets surrounded by a 
wall of fellow students holding hands 
hundreds of thousands of nonstudents roamed the square and 
nearby avenues marchers included people from official media 
outoftown schools and hospitals the staterun airline and labor 
federation artists movie makers and hastily formed organizations 
calling themselves the beijing citizens support group and 
unemployed youth support group joined the demonstration 
the peking union medical college set up a tent and administered 
salt and sugar water intravenously to more than 100 students 
dr ma sui said most fasters could continue three or four more 
days but after that i fear they will be in danger of their 
lives

us officials said they were displeased with 
the wording of preliminary draft resolutions intended for 
wednesdays emergency session of the organization of american 
states to discuss the panama crisis 
us officials who asked not to be identified said tuesday one 
of their main objections to the draft resolutions by venezuela and 
peru was that neither mentioned gen manuel antonio noriega by name 
the united states is expected to push hard for a resolution 
demanding that noriega panamas military leader and de facto ruler 
of the country step down 
the venezuelan draft calls for the immediate recognition of 
the may 7 electoral returns in panama while asserting that the 
solution to panamas crisis rests exclusively with the panamanian 
people 
a us official said the venezuelan proposal is not plausible 
because no accurate count of the election returns is possible since 
most of the ballots have been destroyed 
the peruvian draft calls on the oas secretary general to 
facilitate a dialogue between the panamanian government and 
opposition leading to the election of new authorities 
alternatively other mechanisms would be agreed to that would 
ensure the transfer of power in panama 
among the 31 oas members the united states is aligned with a 
cluster of democratic countries in central and south america while 
mexico and brazil are proponents of a less activist policy citing 
oas provisions guaranteeing respect for the principle of 
nonintervention 
the meeting is being convened at the request of venezuelan 
president carlos andres perez who reportedly favors a resolution 
calling on noriega to step down 
the bush administration position favors the recognition of the 
opposition candidate in the may 7 election guillermo endara as 
the legitimate authority in panama four days after the election 
the state department began referring to endara as panamas 
presidentelect 
the house voted 4130 on tuesday to approve a resolution 
condemning noriegas reprehensible actions in thwarting the 
election and calling on him and the panamanian military to 
recognize endara as president 
despite these deplorable efforts to thwart the will of the 
panamanian people all credible panamanian and international 
observers have recognized guillermo endara as the indisputable 
winner of the election stated the nonbinding resolution which 
was sent to the senate 
it also endorsed the careful and prudent policy steps taken 
by president bush as an appropriate and measured response to the 
crisis in panama 
we have a better indication of positive results than we have 
come to expect in the past white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said of the reaction by latin countries to the 
administrations call for solidarity against noriega 
there is hope that the oas will take a strong position he said 
on the other hand we dont have any specific indication of what 
the oas might do he said 
he said he was unaware of an effort reported from diplomatic 
sources in panama that the united states is engaged in a petition 
effort to get other countries to recall their ambassadors from 
panama as the united states has done 
as to whether the administration wants noriega to accept an 
offer of refuge in venezuela fitzwater said the presidents 
feeling is that he ought to take any offer he could get 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said tuesday 
the administration looks forward to working with governments 
throughout the hemisphere to develop action in support of 
democracy in panama 
indicating that the united states plans a circumspect role at 
the meeting boucher said this is a meeting called by latins 
led by latins and we expect the result to reflect latin interests 
in democracy 
meanwhile panamanian diplomats are expected to try to convince 
their hemispheric colleagues that panamas problems are the product 
of a systematic campaign of us interventionism including a 
series of economic sanctions and a widely reported 10 million us 
government contribution to the opposition campaign 
the dilemma facing the delegates stems partly from conflicting 
provisions in the oas charter one paragraph calls representative 
democracy an indispensible condition for stability in the 
hemisphere while another stresses that no state shall be subject to 
outside intervention for any reason whatsoever 
with a large majority of hemispheric countries headed by elected 
governments some delegates are expected to push hard for an 
antinoriega resolution because to do otherwise might encourage 
restive military officers to displace civilian presidents 
but others are likely to be reluctant to push noriega too hard 
particularly concerning allegations that he attempted to rig the 
elections these delegates may be wary about setting a precedent in 
the event that the election processes in their own countries face 
similar criticism 
us officials who asked not to be identified seemed guardedly 
optimistic on tuesday that a consensus existed for an antinoriega 
resolution 
the oas is on the ropes one official said noting that the 
organization is plagued by declining prestige and onrous financial 
problems about 300 oas employees were laid off earlier this year 
the official said it would make no sense for the oas to create 
a cloud of dust by convening a foreign ministers meeting and then 
do nothing 
a large turnout of foreign ministers will be on hand for the 
special session the first of its kind for the oas since 1982 when 
britain and argentina went to war over their conflicting claims to 
the falklandmalvinas islands 
among the handful of foreign ministers not expected to attend 
are the ones from brazil and chile they will be represented by 
subordinates 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said that bush called 
presidential endara on tuesday to express sympathy over the 
assault which mr endara and his fellow leaders of the democratic 
forces in panamna suffered at the hands of the noriega regime 
the president noted the wave of outrage which has swept the 
hemisphere in the wake of noriegas effort to steal the election by 
force and fraud he said 
popadiuk said he had no further information on the call

its an episodic thing he has pneumoia and his condition has 
been downgraded said eugene tiwanak assistant administrator of

treatment of heart and respiratory ailments 
on april 12 marcos was transferred from the intensive care unit 
to one that cares for heart patients doctors said then that he was 
chronically ill and unlikely to recover

be improving and had requested that a reclining chair be brought to 
his hospital room from his makiki heights home 
hospital officials on tuesday refused to detail the downturn in 
marcos health but marcos spokesman gemmo trinidad said marcos 
suffered a sudden drop in blood pressure 
i really dont know much more than that he said his 
blood pressure dropped and they thought he should be back in icu 
marcos and his wife imelda are under us indictment on 
charges they plundered the philippine government of more than 100 
million and stashed much of the money in the united states in the 
form of art and real estate 
a judge ruled marcos will not have to stand trial unless he 
recovers 
the marcoses have lived here in exile since february 1986 when 
they were ousted in a popular revolt that lifted corazon aquino to 
power

britishtrained guardian angels began their first 
subway anticrime patrols tuesday and immediately ran into trouble 
so many reporters and photographers followed them around that 
underground traffic jams developed london transport police 
intervened telling the mob of journalists pursuing the angels 
through subway cars to split up to stop the overcrowding 
we had received a number of complaints not about the guardian 
angels but about the pressmen accompanying them who were causing an 
obstruction said a transport police spokesman who refused to be 
identified 
they were asked to leave and split into smaller groups 
thirty angels completed three months of training sunday and 11 
began work tuesday led by american curtis sliwa who founded the 
group in new york and helped spread chapters throughout the united 
states 
be courteous vigilant and alert sliwa told his recruits 
who have been criticized by police as vigilantes 
the police have been negative the public will ask many 
questions let them know you are the newly qualified london 
guardian angels 
so far they have been used to brooklyn and bronx accents 
sliwa said referring to initial patrols made by sliwa and other 
new yorkbased angels 
most subway passengers paid no attention to the angels in their 
signature red berets and tshirts but one woman walked up to shake 
sliwas hand 
i am delighted to see you said marrion caullen 64 your 
presence is very reassuring to pensioners senior citizens like 
myself 
meanwhile the police federation chairman alan eastwood told 
his groups annual conference in blackpool that groups like the 
angels tended to work according to their own laws 
if you dress people in tshirts and berets and invest them 
with spurious powers they start to run the neighborhood the way 
they want it but not necessarily the way the law says it should be 
done eastwood said 
he said police were studying bringing back a world war iiera 
association of retired police officers called dads army which 
fought street crime it was disbanded in the late 1950s 
we are looking at it as a possible means of resisting the 
growth of uncontrolled and unaccountable private security while at 
the same time giving chief officers greater flexibility in dealing 
with manpower problems he said

the bush administration is mixing praise for 
mikhail s gorbachevs efforts to revamp soviet economics and 
politics with skepticism about the soviet leaders proposals to 
reduce nuclear weapons in europe 
what is going on in the soviet union is truly revolutionary 
when you consider the economic and political system they have had 
for the last 70 years secretary of state james a baker iii said 
monday 
just back from moscow and a 3hour meeting with gorbachev the 
us official said he favored normal trade with the soviet union 
which is now restricted by the 1974 jacksonvanik amendment and 
gave a positive appraisal of perestroika the economic

smoking and drinking do not affect worker 
absenteeism rates but physical fitness does with outofshape 
workers likely to miss more days of work according to a study 
released today 
more physically fit individuals experience fewer work 
absenteeism and employer initiatives that increase the level of 
physical activity among the work force may indeed have a positive 
affect on employee absenteeism said the report from the national 
chamber foundation 
while the foundation the research arm of the us chamber of 
commerce found attendance differences based on individual 
characteristics such as income education and physical condition 
it said group absenteeism projections based solely on race or 
gender are groundless as well as discriminatory 
the variance of absenteeism patterns among individuals is so 
great as to make characterizations based on group behavior of no 
value to the employer the study said

the us treasury is losing billions of 
dollars because employers including the government itself fail 
to withhold taxes from the paychecks of workers who are erroneously 
designated as independent contractors the general accounting 
office said today 
gao placed a good share of the blame on congress which in an 
effort 10 years ago to curtail the internal revenue service made 
it more difficult to crack down on employers who violate the 
withholding provisions 
paul l posner a gao associate director said in testimony 
prepared for a house government operations subcommittee that the 
failure of workers designated as independent contractors to report 
some or all their income is at the root of the revenue loss 
in turn gao found employers are not complying with 
requirements that they file reports with the irs on payments made 
to individual contractors even when auditing business tax returns 
the report said the irs is not identifying businesses that fail to 
file such reports

excessive drinking gridlock and 
trashed hotels are causing some residents to question whether the 
welcome mat to this spring break mecca should be rolled up 
when fort lauderdale more or less told students to go elsewhere 
for their weeks of unbridled partying daytona beach took over as 
the nations top spring break destination 
it attracted 500000 students during the four weeks that ended 
in early april according to georgia carter of the tourism 
promotion agency destination daytona 
although students spent 100 million here they left behind 
angry residents who complained about car stereos blaring throughout 
the nights on clogged streets and youths urinating on lawns and

polands election campaign is under way with

in the lazy afternoon sun the people of 
this vacation area close by the soviet border gathered around a 
park bandshell where a union troubadour strummed a guitar 
men in white golfing hats emblazoned with the red solidarity 
logo handed out paper flags to children while at folding tables 
volunteers sold campaign bricks coupons printed to look like 
bricks to build a campaign fund 
in a scene similar to the fourth of july in smalltown america 
solidarity was going to the people in polands experiment with a 
new political style democracy 
historian bronislaw geremek and filmmaker andrzej wajda were 
kicking off their campaigns for the national assembly in warsaw on 
the ticket of the solidarity citizens committee 
a deal between the solidarityled opposition and communist 
authorities lets the opposition seek 161 seats in the existing 
460seat sejm and creates a 100member senate the east blocs 
first fully democratic legislative chamber 
solidarity has 261 candidates campaigning in all of the 
countrys 49 provinces 
their bustling election offices are provided by authorities and 
staffed by volunteers while leaflets placards and flags are paid 
for from small campaign donations collected at tables set up by the 
local citizens committees officials say the money comes in too 
quickly to count 
some communist candidates also have been out meeting voters but 
in general theyve been slower to take up the westernstyle 
campaigning 
despite occasional murmurs about carpetbaggers from warsaw 
wajda last lived in suwalki when he was 7 years old and geremek 
never lived here this town of 59000 people was puffed up to have 
two such renowned candidates and gave them a warm reception even 
the communist mayor received them 
wajda is polands bestknown filmmaker geremek one of lech 
walesas closest advisers is an architect of the roundtable 
talks that ended april 5 making solidarity legal again and opening 
the way to the june 4 vote 
joining them were the local members of the solidarity slate 
jerzy pietkiewicz a 41yearold teacher from nearby elk and 
stanislaw bernatowicz an elderly scientist active in protecting 
the regions lakes and forests 
wajda and bernatowicz running for senate and geremek and 
pietkiewicz for the sejm sounded similar themes at the park rally 
with about 1000 townspeople poland needs independence the system 
has failed and voters should use the elections to end the power 
monopoly held by the communist party officially the polish united 
workers party 
at first slow and nervous the intense pietkiewicz soon was 
being interrupted by cheers 
do we really live in a polish state he asked if those 
who have ruled have had to go to red square for instructions 
he said poland was victimized by a marxistleninist philosophy 
that wrongly thought it could create paradise of earth through 
materialistic values that ignored religion and truth 
said geremek it cannot be any longer as it is now 
everyday suffering lines lack of money or lack of goods hard 
life for women lack of hope and lack of prospects for youth 
it has to be changed 
candidates stressed the elections are a step to totally free 
voting in four years authorities promised as much at the round 
table but the opposition is skeptical making solidarity a 
parliament force is seen as a way to hold the communists to their 
word or as one pamphlet put it each vote for our candidates is 
a step toward freedom 
earlier geremek visited a hospital and wajda a technical school 
where bulletin boards were covered with posters showing scenes from 
his films 
he shared early memories of suwalki with about 500 students of 
voting age 18 and discussed his plans for a documentary about the 
world war ii massacre of polish officers including his father at 
katyn in the soviet union the government has been edging toward 
acknowledging soviet guilt for the massacre 
in a province where a committee actively seeks the fate of some 
200 residents rounded up by the soviet secret police in 1945 and 
believed executed the allusion to katyn was vivid 
id vote for him 19yearold bartosz iwanowski said 
support for wajda and geremek is quite big when people see 
these names they immediately just sign underneath even party 
members sign our list for wajda said grzegorz wilczynski 
helping to manage the solidarity citizens committee office three 
small rooms in city hall 
the churchs support has been a big help he added its 
not done so openly just on the part of individual priests but 
the people know 
he said people are elated to have a chance to make a real choice 
if it turns out that we lose i suspect many people will just 
go into exile were laying out all our cards in this game 
but for one woman in the park on a monthly pension of 23000 
zlotys 33 at the official rate the time for optimism has 
passed 
i dont support either the party or solidarity how can i make 
a choice having only 23000 she said bitterly as people gave 
1000zloty donations a few steps away hope is the mother of 
fools i have no more

the telephone company is dividing up london 
the city is running out of telephone numbers so starting next 
may 1 it will be split in two with separate area codes for the 
central and outlying areas 
it will be like what the telephone company in new york city did 
when it separated the boroughs of brooklyn queens and staten 
island from manhattan and the bronx 
in britain the split offers fresh potential for social 
oneupmanship 
out will go the old 01 area code for london to be replaced by 
071 for subscribers within roughly 4 miles of charing cross 
londons official center point and 081 for the rest 
it will also spell the end of londons preeminence in britains 
telephonic pecking order stripped of its unique twodigit prefix 
the capital will have to get in line behind birmingham 021 
edinburgh 031 glasgow 041 liverpool 051 and manchester 
061 
some londoners may find it irksome to have to dial 10 digits to 
cross the divide and snobs will probably have a field day 
071 will be a superior number to have declares elsie burch 
donald author of debretts etiquette and modern manners 
clearly there is an advantage socially culturally 
economically to be living in central london 
like new york where manhattan and the bronx kept the original 
212 area code and the other boroughs got 718 london is running out 
of telephone numbers especially since the rise of the fax system 
which sends documents over telephone lines 
the new codes will double londons telephone capacity to 10 
million without the change it would have run out of numbers next 
year swamped by a 25percent upsurge in demand in the last four 
years much of it in the center 
british telecom the national telecommunications giant has 
given the public a full year to adapt and is spending tens of 
millions of dollars on the switchover including 165 million just 
to publicize it 
but it isnt offering financial compensation for letterheads 
signs and addresses on delivery trucks that will have to be changed 
sign writers copywriters printers decorators telephone 
engineers look to be in for a busy year telephonetriggered 
burglar alarms will have to be adjusted too 
some subscribers have suggested running the split along the 
thames river which divides the city into north and south 
but british telecom opted for rings partly because peoples 
geography gets pretty hazy outside central london said spokesman 
andrew emerson 
for the confused british telecom will provide a free recorded 
message to set them straight 
the 071 code will be stretched to include the docklands some 6 
miles from the center of london which is being transformed from a 
wasteland of empty wharves and rusting warehouses into a bustling 
telecommunications center 
the new codes will carve through communities like hammersmith in 
west london where some residents may have to dial 10 digits to 
phone a neighbor across the street 
phone numbers used to be instant status symbols when the first 
three digits were represented by letters 
reporting the latest change the conservative daily telegraph 
wrote telephone subscribers in london who mourned the loss of 
such emotive and colorful exchange names as the poetic byron and 
macaulay and the stately noble frobisher empress and gulliver may 
be further alarmed to hear that british telecom is hoping to scrap 
the 01 dialing prefix for london 
the letters system was scrapped 22 years ago but numerical 
prefixes remain a status symbol 
even now a number tells a tale says catherine alabaster an 
estate agent in upmarket knightsbridge 235 is belgravia 730 is 
sloane a lot of people dont know it but there are smart numbers 
there are always these nuances 
she says the latest change will make little difference to her 
wealthy clientele who will only know london as 071 they wont 
look at the other zone it will almost be as if it doesnt exist 
theyre not interested in fringes in fact they wont cross the 
river

three years ago werner and 
ingeborg kuenz renounced their west german citizenship packed 
their belongings into the family mercedes and headed for a new life 
in east germany 
the decision stunned friends and relatives who could not 
comprehend why they would both give up wellpaying jobs and a 
comfortable home to move to one of the most rigidly controlled 
societies in eastern europe 
our relatives told us we were crazy werner kuenz said 
nobody could believe that anyone would voluntarily go to a 
country that thousands of people are trying desperately to get out 
of 
kuenz who is 50 years old said he and his wife decided to move 
because they had inherited property from his wifes aunt who lived 
just outside oranienburg about 30 miles northwest of berlin 
the twostory stucco house the couple inherited contained a 
modest restaurant bar and dance hall the couple have been 
operating the anchor restaurant as a private enterprise for two 
years now 
small heavily regulated private enterprises are tolerated by 
east germanys communist authohrities on a limited scale 
kuenz said he and his wife had planned the move for several 
years as the departure date of july 1 1986 approached kuenz 
quit his job as a painter and his wife gave up her position as a 
sales clerk 
i worked until the day before we left kuenz said 
our decision to move was based on personal not political 
considerations said ingeborg kuenz 49 who grew up outside 
oranienburg with her aunt until she left east germany illegally in 
1956 to join her mother 
i always considered this place my home 
but the kuenzes acknowledge that they have risked much for an 
uncertain future 
we wouldnt be able to stand it if we couldnt leave for 
visits werner kuenz said referring to east germanys strict 
limits on travel to the west 
so far all of our requests have been granted 
he said he was allowed to go to his class reunion in west 
germany 
we had a little trouble with that one at first because it 
isnt included in the government travel categories 
he said the familys trips to the west depend on the good will 
of the authorities 
kuenz said the family also had to get used to living in a 
society where consumer goods are sometimes scarce or difficult to 
get on short notice 
but we get by pretty well mrs kuenz said 
she said the couples 10yearold son udo had also adapted well 
to their new environment 
werner kuenz said it took a while for their east german 
neighbors to adjust to them 
after arriving in 1986 the couple set to work renovating the 
house and the restaurant 
people here arent used to seeing people invest the amount of 
time and energy into work he said they dont put that kind of 
a day in down at the peoples diner 
now nearly finished the establishments colorful table 
settings potted plants and cheerful atmosphere set it apart from 
the drab staterun restaurants down the cobbled road toward town 
i wouldnt mind seeing a little free market economy around 
here kuenz said referring to the strict price guidelines he is 
required by the state to charge 
kuenz admits that to keep the menu tasty the family sometimes 
has to dash to the hard currency intershop store in east berlin 
for ketchup spices and other essentials 
kuenz said customers continue to visit the bar just to ask why 
the family had turned its back on a western lifestyle many east 
germans would eagerly embrace 
no one really comprehends it kuenz said shrugging his 
shoulders

after appearing in the illfated broadway run of 
chess ann crumb is on much firmer ground for her leading role 
in andrew lloyd webbers new megasmash aspects of love 
the eagerly awaited musical opened april 17 at the prince of 
wales theater to an advance sale of 85 million and is sold out 
through 1989 based on a littleknown novel by english writer david 
garnett aspects of love spans 17 years and much of europe 
it casts crumb as rose vibert a volatile french actress 
enmeshed in romantic liaisons involving her husband an expatriate 
painter named george kevin colson his nephew alex michael 
ball and georges italian mistress giulietta kathleen rowe 
mcallen 
its the biggest exposure yet for the darkhaired petite 
actress who keeps her age secret but looks 30ish a chorus 
performer in chess and an alumna of les miserables both on 
broadway and on the road crumb finds herself tackling what she 
calls the rangiest piece ever written in the musical theater 
the singing stretches her voice higher than chess and her 
performance has won critical approval with jack tinker in the 
daily mail calling her work vibrantly intelligent and 
commanding 
crumb described the tempestuous rose as a woman who lives on 
the edge all the time 
shes the one who screams and cries and all that crumb 
said you cant say isnt she pathetic or shes so sweet 
thats the challenge of carrying it 
crumbs performing savvy comes naturally her father george is 
the noted contemporary composer her mother elizabeth teaches 
music crumb intended to be a violinist but had to give up when an 
accident put her arm in plaster for two years singing seemed like 
the next best bet but she found herself daunted by her 
surroundings 
the irony was i was embarrassed to sing in a house where id 
only heard some of the finest classical singers she said i 
never opened my mouth in the house 
during college and graduate school at the university of michigan 
at ann arbor crumb performed on the side while preparing for a 
career in clinical medicine it was only later while working as a 
clinician in her hometown of philadelphia that she took a job in 
the national tour of el grande de coca cola 
she was hooked 
crumb went into medicine because she wanted to help people now 
she says in an interview over lunch shes finding that the theater 
is also a way of giving something to people 
crumb is contracted to aspects for six months as part of an 
exchange agreement between new york and london branches of the 
actors union equity she said she was the tradeoff for sarah 
brightman lloyd webbers wife who appeared in the broadway 
production of the phantom of the opera last year 
she finds acting a fraught profession theres really so 
little work and so many terrific people 
however shes pleased with the quantity of london theater 
which she said surpasses new york and hopes to have a head start 
when aspects makes the inevitable move to broadway 
still despite sharing an apartment in londons posh hampstead 
district with her boyfriend an american screenwriter crumb said 
occasional pangs for new york do creep in 
at first i thought it was going to be hard to go back because 
the quality of life here for the average person is much gentler and 
kinder 
but i must say in the last few weeks ive gotten a little 
homesick she said the other night after the show we were 
trying to find a place to eat and there was no place to go

eleven days after a central park jogger was 
raped and left for dead by a pack of marauding youths david 
bruskin stepped into the last car of a subway train because he 
didnt want his piccolo music to annoy others 
it was a mistake 
two other people were in the car when he got on at 14th street 
five stops later at 42nd street they had unwelcome company more 
than a dozen youths looking for trouble 
they found bruskin 
like swarming bees the teenagers surrounded him snatched his 
jacket punched and bloodied his face grabbed his wallet and broke 
his tiny 500 instrument into smithereens 
then they marched through the train chins jutting out eyes 
darting left and right 
with the laughter of three female members of the gang still 
ringing in his ears bruskin yanked the cars emergency cord 
forcing the 530 am broadway local to a halt at the 59th street 
station 
the 39yearold teacher knew he was lucky to escape with just a 
gash over one eye that was closed with three stitches 
i feel very fortunate he said 
he knew about the 28yearold woman who was jumped by a gang of 
youths april 19 as she trotted through central park on her evening 
run 
she was dragged into the woods beaten with a brick and a pipe 
raped repeatedly and left to die her blood draining into a mud 
puddle after more than a week in a coma she regained 
consciousness but a full recovery is questionable 
some authorities view these incidents as isolated extremes the 
acts of a few city teenagers who find strength and anonymity in 
numbers others say the ultraviolence perpetrated by youth 
gangs in a clockwork orange has arrived in new york 
all agree something is very wrong with these teenagers with 
the juvenile justice system or both 
usually teenagers join the loosely knit gangs spontaneously 
police say they often strike in daylight after school wreak havoc 
for a few hours and disband they have little more in common than 
their age and lust for excitement 
the city is still searching for a buzzword to describe them the 
youths are said to go wilding or wiling they are wolf 
packs or posses 
tourists are frequent targets the head of the police 
departments midtown robbery squad once called them walking 
statistics 
the tourists are often alone and vulnerable wearing jewelry or 
carrying thick wallets they are outnumbered by roving columns of 
teenagers who have been known to parade through upscale stores 
grabbing what they like 
last year 622 robbery cases and 140 attempted robbery cases 
referred to family court involved two or more teens and more than 
100 cases of robberies assaults and larcenies involved groups of 
five or more said peter reinharz chief prosecutor for the city 
law departments family court division 
in light of the escalation and severity of the incidents it 
appears that were doing something wrong reinharz said 
rita kramer author of at a tender age violent youth and 
juvenile justice noted in an interview the ineffectiveness of a 
juvenile justice system that was set up to handle wayward youths 
rather than young hardened criminals 
she said many youths report having committed about 10 serious 
crimes for every one for which they are arrested 
were not doing a very good job of deterring or rehabilitating 
kids said james payne a former probation commissioner now in 
private legal practice theyre not deterred and theyre not 
cured 
kramer and payne cited another central park attack in 1984 when 
three youths aged 12 14 and 16 beat and raped a homeless woman 
near the conservatory pond at 74th street 
she survived but police later learned the same youths had raped 
and killed another homeless resident of the park a month later 
the 14yearold was sentenced to five years to life as a 
youthful offender after being tried as an adult the 16yearold 
who was convicted and sentenced as an adult is serving 15 years to 
life in a state prison 
the 12yearold identified as the ringleader was sent to camp 
tryon an unlocked facility in upstate new york for up to 18 
months payne said the youth remained incarcerated through his 13th 
birthday but then escaped 
the boy would now be 17 hes out there someplace and what 
hes doing is not much different than what he was doing before he 
was arrested payne asserted 
reinharz said the system is too soft on children who commit 
grisly crimes 
the 12yearold who commits a homicide is going to get the 
same disposition as a 12yearold who stole credit cards 
reinharz said 
bruskin recalled that his attackers were so matter of fact 
about it it was obvious they were used to what they were doing 
they looked at my possessions as things they were entitled to 
the piccolo player found two transit police officers in the 
station and pointed out three or four members of the group that 
attacked him one youngster had been miraculously transformed in 
place of the tough glare and muscleflexing march was the soft 
wideeyed demeanor of a child 
these youths were released they were members of the gang but 
bruskin said they were not among those who threw punches or robbed 
him 
two witnesses were on hand one handed bruskin his wallet 
discarded after the teenagers stripped it of 115 but the two 
officers joined within minutes by at least eight others never 
questioned the witnesses bruskin said 
the arriving officers handcuffed and took away one boy bruskin 
said was in the group he was later released when bruskin said he

did anybody who wasnt down a well miss the 
masspublicized rescue of little jessica mcclure the texas toddler 
for those who missed it or just want to relive it abc offers a 
dramatized replay sunday in everybodys baby the rescue of 
jessica mcclure 
roxana zal who won an emmy award two years ago for something 
about amelia plays cissy mcclure the young mother who realizes 
that her 18monthold baby has disappeared into an 8inch opening 
in the ground will oldham plays her husband chip veteran film 
actor pat hingle is nononsense goodolboy fire chief james 
roberts beau bridges plays richard czech the overly optimistic 
chief of police patty duke plays carolyn henry a victims 
assistance volunteer who stayed with the mcclures through the 
ordeal 
the movie is a wellacted welldirected straightforward 
retelling of the drama in fact during the first hour we may 
wonder why we must engage in this seemingly pointless recreation 
exercise 
but the rescue of the tot who in october 1987 fell down an 
abandoned water well in her aunts midland texas backyard 
catches hold in the second hour when the drama escalates and the 
filmmakers purpose begins to emerge as we begin to suspect and 
are assured in a tagline message at the conclusion the movie is a 
tribute to volunteerism 
scriptwriter david eyre jr and director mel damski capture 
moments of humor as well as the horror of the situation and such 
subleties as cissys fear of informing her housepainter husband 
that she lost the baby down a well eyres dialogue is pretty 
credible west texasese pet peeve zal tells duke at one point 
yall dont look old enough to have a grown daughter yall 
aint singular it means you all as in two or more of you 
except for a few scenesetters filmed in midland the movie was 
shot in bellflower calif the set designers did such a good job 
recreating the scene it might be hard to tell if they were shown 
side by side which is the real footage of the rescue and which is 
the movie viewers of the movie get to go where they did not during 
the news coverage down the shaft rescuers dug through solid rock 
alongside the well 
there was some bickering in midland last year over who should 
get the rights to the story eventually those involved settled on 
interscope productions in association with the campbell soup co 
the reallife folks in midlandodessa who are depicted in the film 
ought to be pretty happy with the results since theyre portrayed 
as goodhearted rightthinking people ready to do absolutely 
anything to save someone elses baby 
the chamber of commerce might not be overly delighted with the 
opening establishing shots of rusting oilfield equipment but the 
scenes effectively depict the state of the oil economy at the time 
down a dry hole itself that underlines the generosity of the oil 
industry that brought in experts and equipment to help save 
jessica at no small cost 
the rescue was the biggest media event of the year but as 
usual the news media are a faceless mass of shouting imbeciles 
blinding decent folk with flashbulbs and tv lights as they no 
doubt appeared to the mcclures at the time there is one exception 
kmidtv reporter rodney wunsch who plays himself stays on the 
story so long without sleep he gets into a hysterical shouting 
match with one of the police officers and has to be sent home for 
awhile 
most touching is the portrayal of emergency medical technician 
robert odonnell whip hubley who must confront his fear of the 
gravelike shaft then cant quite reach the child on the first try 
and has to come up emptyhanded a doctor on the scene warns him 
before his second attempt that the childs time is running out and 
if he has to break her bones to get her out he should 
at the conclusion when cissy is sitting in the waiting 
ambulance and hears the cheers go up from the crowd in the 
backyard its almost like watching the real scenes that the 
networks interrupted primetime for in 1987 its not a bad moment 
to recreate

elsewhere in television 
youre in trouble now abc has ratted on 3 million women it 
says watch soap operas at work the networks motive was not 
tattletale but rather to make the point that the nielsen ratings 
dont necessarily reflect all the viewers of daytime drama abc 
said a survey it conducted showed that 8 percent of women who watch 
soap operas do so at their place of business that comes out to 28 
million working women sneaking peeks at daytime dramas while the 
boss isnt looking unless of course theyre the boss in which

factors helping to restrain inflation today are 
the experience of the 1970s the lingering pains associated with it 
and a determination not to let it happen again 
you can see it in the marked resistance to price increases these 
days especially in the automobile market but also in retailing 
housing insurance travel and several other product and service 
areas 
the 1980s are not like the 1970s in that respect back then an 
attitude prevailed that existing prices were the best that would be 
seen for a while so why not buy todays consumer prefers to wait 
and see 
in the 1970s many consumers and producers too didnt care as 
much about holding the price line for consumers automatic pay 
raises took care of higher living costs for businesses price 
increases were regular 
in the 1980s automatic costofliving adjustments are less 
common than before unions arent as strong and businesses are more 
intent on keeping down labor costs they have to 
the reason is competition todays markets are much more global 
in nature and that means a manufacturer must keep prices in line 
or a foreign competitor will undersell him its happened before 
and it might again 
that same factor prevents foreigners from raising their prices 
in the united states with the decline in the value of the dollar 
american producers are more competitive foreigners therefore 
must fight for markets here 
in general these foreign producers have been good fighters 
many in fact have chosen to hold prices low by eating some of 
their expenses rather than passing them on that is they have 
voluntarily cut their margins 
third parties were a big factor in consumer or demand 
inflation during the 1970s americans learned from that 
experience particularly in regard to health insurance and many 
contracts now limit the role of the third party 
the most specific example of this change is the tendency of 
employers today to lower their involvement in paying for health 
policies from 100 percent with workers picking up the difference 
when you pay for a service yourself if only partially you are 
less likely to overuse it or at least thats one of the 
conclusions at work today based on the experience of the 70s 
unfortunately health care remains an inflation problem in the 
80s and probably will continue to be so in the 1990s the reason 
isnt a mystery if you consider the question how do you control 
spending when lives are at stake 
still another similarity exists between the 70s and the 80s 
the inability of consumers to resist price increases dictated by 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
but in those other respects the american challenge to inflation 
this decade is a sharp contrast to its acquiescence to inflation in 
the prior one history at least recent history hasnt been 
ignored

a group that organizers contend is the largest coalition of 
christians ever mobilized to deal with an urgent moral concern is 
targeting television advertisers in a campaign to reduce sex and 
violence on the small screen 
christian leaders for responsible television or cleartv 
recently put advertisers on notice if they are among the top 10 
sponsors of sex violence and profanity on network television 
during the may sweeps period when ratings determine rates for 
advertisers they may become boycott targets 
well pick one or two corporations out of that list and were 
going to boycott them said the rev billy melvin chairman of 
cleartv by early june well announce whos going to be 
boycotted 
with more than 1600 christian leaders backing it cleartv is 
no ordinary pressure group the coalition features top officials 
from 70 mainline and conservative protestant denominations and more 
than 100 roman catholic bishops including such heavyweights as 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago and archbishop john l may of 
st louis president of the national conference of catholic bishops 
the group relies on the monitoring system of the rev donald 
wildmons tupelo missbased american family association hes a 
united methodist 
i think its an idea not only whose time has come but its 
long overdue said the rev milton efthimious a founder of 
cleartv and executive director of the department of church and 
society of the greek orthodox church of north and south america 
a lot of the things you see on television today would never have 
been shown 15 years ago 
melvin said the coalition turned to advertisers after network 
executives ignored an appeal to voluntarily reduce the portrayals 
of sex violence and profanity on the small screen 
the coalitions last attempt two years ago at a boycott of 
advertisers was successful melvin said with both noxell corp and 
mazda motor of america inc dropping out of cleartvs top 10 
list of advertisers sponsoring offensive programs 
melvin said the boycott of noxell maker of cover girl 
cosmetics was lifted within two months and the boycott of mazda 
was dropped after four months 
both companies said cleartv made them more sensitive to the 
type of programs they were sponsoring but said the actions they 
took conformed to their own standards 
albert goldberg of the mazda information bureau in los angeles 
said the company stopped advertising on miami vice and 
hunter two shows criticized for excessive violence on our 
own accord 
he added it is true it was brought to our attention by 
cleartv 
deborah a alford manager of corporate communications for 
noxell said after discussions with cleartv the company 
formalized what was an existing policy to steer away from 
programming that is overly violent or contains gratuitous sex and 
profanity 
earlier this year tambrands inc proctor amp gamble co 
mcdonalds corp and kimberly clark corp decided not to advertise 
on fox broadcasting corps married with children the 
corporate decisions followed a letterwriting campaign by terry 
rakolta a michigan woman who objected to the sexual innuendo and 
the treatment of women in the popular comedy about a bluecollar 
family 
melvin of wheaton ill who also is executive director of the 
national association of evangelicals said advertisers are saying 
for crying out loud give us something decent to present to the 
american public 
the networks have taken a low profile toward groups such as 
cleartv and some advertising agencies say they face a dilemma in 
balancing concerns about sex and violence while meeting their 
clients needs 
abc has chosen not to comment on the operations of this 
organization said janice gretemeyer director of press relations 
for abc 
thomas somerset an executive at the advertising firm handling 
mazdas account said it is a sensitive issue because viewers tend 
to be attracted to things that are sensational but companies do 
not want to run the risk of being targeted by groups such as 
cleartv 
do these groups have an influence in what goes on yes is it 
right im not sure said somerset a senior vice president of 
foote cone amp belding 
leaders of cleartv such as efthimious expressed mixed opinions 
about the tactics of pressuring advertisers but he said the 
networks have to take repsonsibility for the slime and sleaze 
sent into american homes 
the thing im uncomfortable about is i dont think the church 
or the synagogue should be an inquisition efthimious said 
but by the same token i dont think the media should hide 
behind the first amendment 
roman catholic bishop stanislaus j brzana of ogdensburg ny 
a member of the executive committee of cleartv said the religious 
community is exercising its own right to free speech 
we are also citizens of this country the airwaves belong to 
everybody he said we are trying in a fair way to exert our 
influence we dont know how far we will get but we are trying we 
are trying

with a finger pointed to the rear of the church 
the minister commanded a young man to stand 
michael stone said the rev johnny ray youngblood before 
1000 witnesses im goin a tell you what my mama once told me 
at the rate youre goin someones goin a kill you man you got 
a baaaaad attitude you hear me 
and friends of michaels if you see him in trouble you jack 
his ass right up you deal with him you hear me 
the st paul community baptist church congregation heard all 
right punctuating his scolding with amens and yessirs 
youngbloods words were daring but his daring has a solid 
record 
as cochairman of the east brooklyn congregations a group of 
55 churches and a synagogue he led an effort that turned an 
abandoned section of eastern brooklyn into a community of 
workingclass families by building 1250 homes the project called 
nehemiah after the biblical prophet who rebuilt the walls of a 
burnedout jerusalem has inspired similar plans in baltimore and 
los angeles congress recently passed a nehemiah law that 
provides incentives for cities to copy the brooklyn project 
he formed an alliance two years ago with city banks to secure 
jobs for black high school graduates 300 now have entrylevel 
positions 
and the church located in one of new york citys toughest 
areas was surrounded by storefront drug operations until he 
lobbied police to enforce a law that locked up buildings in which 
people were arrested for drugs then the church bought 14 
properties the church now rents 11 stores and three houses 
we need a whole new culture the 40yearold youngblood said 
in an interview and i think the church might have to become the 
incubator 
politicians community activists and preachers from more than 
100 cities have made pilgrimmages to nehemiah homes many then go 
to hear youngbloods gospel 
hes a new type of leader said gov mario cuomo one of 
those escorted by youngblood to the homes hes good at putting 
together coalitions and working cooperatively theres none of 
the demagogue in him 
hes making the old testament come alive said michael 
gecan the new york area organizer for the industrial areas 
foundation a group founded by the late saul alinsky to train 
community organizers and build citizen groups hes becoming a 
national leader quietly 
some black leaders say too quietly 
as a clergyman hes a premier example of the strong new 
black clergy today said the rev calvin butts pastor of the 
abyssinian baptist church in harlem and a civil rights activist 
but in terms of whether hes had a profound impact on the major 
issues this city faces today i say he has no public presence 
on the issue of police brutality when you look at the number 
of people who took radical stands johnny ray youngblood is not 
there when you think of the lack of proper health care for the 
poor johnny ray youngblood is not there and at a time when we 
need new leaders in this city to improve the climate of racial 
tension he has not spoken out butts said 
speaking out said youngblood is not always the best way 
to get results i think i am involved in the vital issues housing 
is one education is one 
and yet youngblood has found that his behindthescenes work has 
not led to more nehemiah homes elsewhere in new york and hes 
starting to speak out 
we will build in the south bronx youngblood told a crowd of 
5000 at a recent rally at a 42acre bronx site that is now all 
rubble and broken glass 
the demonstration came after mayor edward koch had rebuffed 
nehemiah backers who wanted to build homes there koch favors a 
developers plan to build 350 condominiums starting at 95000 
while nehemiah wants to build 90 homes beginning at 57000 
nehemiah depends on interestfree loans from a 10 million 
church fund large tracts of land donated by the city property tax 
abatements and city grants of 10000 a house 
you will own homes in the south bronx youngblood vowed 
the south bronx may look like a graveyard but all resurrecting 
takes place in graveyards 
youngblood is a southerner raised in a threeroom house in new 
orleans by a godfearing mother and a stern father in his youth 
he liked to go out with the guys run with the girls but his 
mother set him straight her word was like the echo of god he 
said 
he earned a masters degree in divinity in rochester ny and 
in 1974 st pauls deacons hired him 
he was 26 married with an infant son 
we were looking for a leader recalled william brandon a 
church member since 1934 and a deacon in 1974 we had been 
through a lot of crises with different ministers we decided to 
turn him loose 
then the congregation had only 72 people 
but youngbloods oratory and community work drew scores of 
newcomers in 1979 the congregation moved to a bigger building 
which they expanded this year 
now st paul has 4500 members 
the church has a 25 million budget 27 staff members 400 
volunteer workers and an elementary school about 45 percent of the 
families are tithers meaning they pledge 10 percent of their 
salaries to the church 
crowds of 1000 or more pack the two sunday services which 
begin the instant music director eli wilson hits the keys of an 
electronic keyboard the 80member choir two drummers and 
congregation are a beat behind and in seconds people are up 
clapping their hands and stamping their feet the floor bounces 
from the pulpit youngblood is part entertainer and part 
teacher he is funny at times fiery at times straighttalking all 
times 
he asks the black men to stand visitors to stand and children 
with report cards to come to the front as their grades are read 
there is calculation in this he wants more men to come more new 
members and better grades for the children 
the reverend pays special attention to young people we are 
rallying around the african proverb that it takes a whole village 
to raise a child he said in an interview 
michael stone knows 
it was hard to hear what he said the 17yearold said a few 
weeks after youngblood disciplined him from the pulpit for getting 
into a fight after bible class 
but ive been controlling my temper better these days he 
said his doing that made a lot of people keep an eye out on me 
it helped

there may be fewer and smaller leveraged buyouts 
these days but lbos are still a thriving investment and a popular 
way to finance corporate acquisitions economists say 
wall street is awash in funds said robert b reich 
professor of political economics and management at harvard 
universitys john f kennedy school of government 
financial entrepreneurs are at this moment cooking up a 
variety of schemes for those funds lbo lovers will be among 
them he said monday 
reich and other economists disagreed with a statement by federal 
reserve board chairman alan greenspan that lbos in which 
companies are acquired primarily with borrowed funds have reached 
their peak 
the fed chairman who spoke over the weekend to a group of top 
corporate executives in hot springs va said the number of 
debtfinanced takeovers will decline because the easiest obvious 
ones already have been done 
greenspan is being overly optimistic said reich referring 
to the fact that the fed chairman like many other critics of lbos 
would like to see highlyleveraged transactions subside 
donald ratajczk director of economic forecasting at georgia 
state university in atlanta also disagreed with greenspan saying 
i wouldnt say they have peaked i would say theres a lull 
recent statistics support the theory that lbo activity has 
slowed somewhat the number of leveraged buyouts declined during 
the first quarter to 40 deals of 10 million or more from 57 in a 
year earlier according to securities data co a new jerseybased 
research firm 
lawrence chimerine president of the economic forecasting 
service wefa group in bala cynwyd pa said rising prices and 
interest rates and the slowing of the economy may have dampened lbo 
activity 
but lbos are still attractive to investors and takeover 
strategists many analysts say 
the thing that motivated lbos in large part was the tax 
system said richard rahn chief economist with the us chamber 
of commerce noting that corporate acquirers enjoy hefty tax 
deductions for the interest they pay on lbo loans 
that situation still persists rahn said i would not 
think you would have a fundamental change until we had a more basic 
change in the tax law 
rahn agreed with greenspan that after lbos were developed 
prospective buyers looked around for the best targets and with 
those companies most notably rjr nabisco inc there are fewer 
buyouts to be made 
but david wyss chief financial economist with drimcgraw hill 
in lexington mass disagreed theres still some big ones out 
there that they could do theres rumors about almost everything 
flying around 
no one thought about rjr till it happened wyss said 
adding im not as convinced as greenspan is that the 
enthusiasm is over 
the 2453 billion rjr nabisco deal engineered by lbo 
specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co focused public attention 
on leveraged buyouts and raised concerns among economists 
including greenspan about the high level of corporate debt in 
this country 
critics say that in the event of an economic downturn both the 
boughtout company and the financiers of the transaction could be 
jeopardized 
some economists say large issues of junk bonds used to finance 
deals like the rjr nabisco buyout have temporarily glutted the 
market but they expect demand to increase once the new issues are 
fully absorbed into the system 
with the success of rjr well see activity back up again 
said georgia states ratajczk 
junk bonds have high yields and institutional investors are 
still eager to buy them ratajczk said in the process these 
investors help keep the lbo boom alive

prime computer inc the embattled minicomputer 
maker is challenging hostile suitor bennett s lebow to put his 
money where his mouth is 
talk is cheap mr lebow prime chairman david j dunn said 
in fullpage newspaper ads appearing today addressed to the new 
york investor whose mai basic four inc has launched a 
20pershare offer for primes outstanding stock 
primes board sent the same feisty letter to lebow on monday 
mai has had more than six months to obtain the necessary 
financing to consummate its tender offer can you deliver on your 
offer mr lebow we do not believe that you can the ads said 
in a gamble that could backfire the ad said prime would 
temporarily remove all legal obstacles to lebows offer if he can 
complete the cash offer by june 2 the ad said it would allow the 
deal to go through 
but if he cannot the ads and letter said we trust that you 
will finally withdraw your offer and let prime go on with its 
business 
mai basic spokeswoman toni lee said only that the company was 
evaluating the situation 
the tender offer by mai a tustin califbased computer firm 
about onefourth the size of prime is valued at about 970 million 
primes board said last month it was seeking a friendly buyer 
willing to pay a higher price and would vigorously defend itself in 
a proxy battle with lebow at its annual meeting scheduled for june 
14 
wall street analysts said monday it appeared that prime had been 
unable to find a white knight to outbid lebow and decided to 
take a bold gamble instead 
what primes management is gambling on is that lebow wont be 
able to come up with the financing and prime will win the proxy 
fight as a result said jay p stevens an analyst for dean 
witter reynolds inc 
theyre giving him a couple of weeks to put up or shut up 
stevens added 
primes letter signed by dunn on behalf of the board said the 
company would disarm all its takeover defenses including its 
socalled poison pill to allow mai basic or any bona fide 
bidder to purchase the company for 20 a share in cash before 
june 2 
in addition prime said it would exempt the purchase from a 
delaware law that requires hostile buyers to obtain at least 85 
percent of the outstanding stock of a target company or wait three 
years before making any significant changes in the business 
finally prime told lebow that promptly upon your purchase 
the company would withdraw without predjudice its legal challenges 
to the takeover bid 
analysts said the letter amounts to a broadside at both mai 
basic and its investment bank drexel burnham lambert inc which 
is arranging financing for the 20pershare offer

seymour cray will break from the company he 
founded in 1972 to finish building what he says will be the worlds 
fastest supercomputer a project analysts say became too risky for 
industry giant cray research inc 
under a restructuring announced monday cray research will split 
into two companies with the formation of cray computer corp cray 
chairman john rollwagen will discuss the decision at todays annual 
shareholders meeting 
the new company will be formed around cray3 operations in 
colorado springs colo where seymour cray has been busy designing 
a machine that uses gallium arsenide instead of silicon to speed 
computations 
seymour will once again be in the kind of environment in which 
he thrives and in which he and his team can aggressively pursue 
completion of the cray3 and bring it to market rollwagen said 
seymour cray will become chairman of the new company which will 
receive up to 50 million in equipment and 100 million in 
operating funds over the next two years from its parent company 
said john swenson a company spokesman 
the split comes in response to the overwhelming cost of 
developing new generations of supercomputers the race for 
supremacy has become even fiercer recently with the emergence of 
japans hitachi ltd fujitsu ltd and nec corp as strong 
competitors 
control data corp a twin cities neighbor of cray last month 
announced it was shutting down its own supercomputer operation eta 
systems because of the financial drain seymour cray worked for 
control data before founding cray research in 1972 
rollwagen said the split will allow work to proceed on two 
development thrusts the cray3 in colorado springs under the new 
company and the c90 in chippewa falls wis under the existing 
company 
the c90 is the next generation of the companys 
breadandbutter xmp machines of which about 150 are in place 
the ymp is a recent successor to the xmp 
the announcement was made after the close of trading on the new 
york stock exchange but rumors of the restructuring prompted a 
price increase of 262 a share to 5575 the stock traded around 
48 early last week 
analysts said the move appears to be designed to cap the amount 
of money cray spends on the development of the cray3 which could 
be running behind schedule 
what it does is if this cray3 continues to run over budget 
and 100 million is not sufficient then the new company cray 
computer corp has to go out and find new money said stephen 
cohen of soundview financial group of stamford conn 
seymour crays new company almost certainly will have to raise 
more money probably by going into partnership with another 
computer company said jeffrey canin a san franciscobased 
computer analyst 
the cray3 using the gallium arsenide metal alloy as a 
semiconductor instead of the traditional silicon will be a 
successor to seymour crays cray2 
the cray3 and cray2 are designed to have at least four times 
as much memory as the other cray machines and compute at a faster 
rate but only about 20 of the cray2 machines have been sold 
if seymour has any trouble with the cray3 it doesnt 
endanger the other part of the business george lindamood of the 
gartner group in stamford conn said i think its a good 
move 
but peter zidek a supercomputer analyst from the minneapolis 
suburb of apple valley questioned the move even though plans call 
for the sharing of some technology the two companies will become 
rivals he said 
it seems like maybe there was a spat between seymour cray 
who stepped down from his administrative post in 1980 to devote 
himself to research and company administrators zidek said 
cray is the largest supercomputer maker in the world not 
counting international business machines corp which sells 
attachments to some of its mainframes that allows them to work like 
supercomputers 
this is one american industry that is not walking away from 
global competition rollwagen said rather were in effect 
redoubling our effort 
cray will seek internal revenue service and regulatory approval 
to distribute 90 percent of the stock in the new company to 
shareholders of cray research inc on a taxfree basis cray 
research will retain the other 10 percent 
the two companies will enter into crosslicensing and technology 
transfer agreements involving both hardware and software the 
approximately 200 employees in colorado springs will become 
employees of the new company cray has a total of about 5400 
workers

the paytelevision programmer home box office 
inc said today it plans to launch the first advertisersupported 
channel devoted entirely to comedy starting this fall 
the new service which would be offered to cable operators for 
inclusion at no extra charge to subscribers to their basic service 
would represent the time inc units first venture into basic cable 
programming 
the new service will have to fight for channel space with 
several other recently launched cable networks among the newcomers 
are turner broadcasting system incs turner network television 
the national broadcasting cos consumer news and business channel 
and an array of regional sports networks 
michael fuchs home box office chairman and chief executive 
said in a news release disclosing the plans that his company has 
presented the concept of a comedy network to cable operators across 
the country over the past several months and that the idea has 
received strong support 
we anticipate demographics that will attract strong advertiser 
attention consistent programming that will score well with 
consumers and a new basic service that will generate a healthy cash 
flow for the cable operator he said 
home box office could face competition from the mtv networks 
division of viacom inc which also is considering launching an 
allcomedy network 
home box office currently operates the hbo and cinemax paytv 
services which already include comedy shows within their lineup of 
movies sports music drama documentaries and other special 
programs 
fuchs said the concept of a comedy channel appealed to a 
number of motion picture distributors who he said liked the 
promotional opportunities the channel offers for generating 
awareness of their comedy programs 
the channel will feature comedy hosts who will have their own 
shows incorporating a variety of programming ranging from 
promotional clips from standup performances current comedy films 
classic tv shows and theater to fulllength motion pictures there 
also will be live comedy features and visits by established and new 
comedians 
programming would originate from studio facilities in new york 
fuchs said home box office has already established strong 
professional relationships with the comedy community through hbos 
involvement dating to 1976 with its on location series that has 
featured comedians such as rodney dangerfield robin williams and 
steve martin 
he said hbo research indicates comedy programs maintain higher 
ratings even over repeated viewings than noncomedy programs and 
that 64 percent of cable subscribers between ages 18 and 34 have 
expressed interest in a comedy channel 
barry kluger a spokesman for mtv networks said mtv has been 
looking into whether a comedy channel could make it for five years 
and may make a decision soon on whether to launch an allcomedy 
service 
we have tried to put together a business plan we are active 
in that its something that is on front burner but the key is 
distribution he said 
he said there is so little space these days on cable systems 
that a waiting list of cable networks has developed at some of them 
but he noted that mtv already has considerable experience in 
running basic cable services including its mtv music television 
vh1 and nickelodeon networks

us sales of cars and light trucks fell 82 
percent during early may from the same period last year when 
procrastinating customers headed to showrooms to take advantage of 
incentives 
the eight major companies making cars and light trucks in north 
america said monday they sold a combined average of 36480 vehicles 
a day during the may 110 period this year that compared with an 
average of 39771 during the same time last year car sales were 
down 98 percent and truck sales were off 53 percent 
but yeartoyear comparison was colored by one of the strongest 
10day periods last year the secondbest selling year in auto 
industry history a large portion of the incentives in effect in 
early may last year expired may 11 prompting buyers who had waited 
to head to dealerships to take advantage of the enticements 
incentives also were in effect during the period this year ford 
motor cos program expires may 31 general motors corps dies 
june 5 and chrysler corps runs indefinitely all offer buyers the 
option of cash rebates or lowinterest financing 
despite the statistical drop dealers said monday that business 
was good 
we had a very good march april and may last year said joe 
matts new car sales manager at joneswest fordmitsubishi in reno 
nev if you compare it to last year its off but that was a 
very good year 
herb adcox owner of herb adcox chevroletgeo in chattanooga 
tenn agreed saying incentives helped sales 
most of them are taking the money he said of the rebates 
were doing little or none on financing 
the automakers began the incentive programs at the start of the 
second quarter after sales during the first three months came in 
below expectations production continued at an ambitious pace 
meaning swelling inventories 
incentives have helped trim inventory levels but analysts now 
say that production cuts in the third period are likely 
for the year the companies reported car and truck sales running 
41 percent behind last years pace with car sales off 61 percent 
and truck sales down 05 percent 
gms car sales fell 95 percent during the may 110 period and

all cigarette packets sold in the 
european economic community will have to carry specific health 
warnings from jan 1 1993 the eec decided tuesday 
in addition they will have to carry a general warning that 
tobacco seriously damages health which will also have to be 
carried by products such as pipe tobacco 
smoking causes cancer smoking causes fatal diseases 
pregnant women smoking harms your baby and smokers die 
younger are some of the specific warnings which will have to 
appear on cigarette packs 
ministers from the 12 eec member states also agreed at a meeting 
on tuesday that the warnings should be clear and legible printed 
in bold letters and should not be printed on external wrappers or 
where they would be damaged when the package is opened 
the new law specified that the warning must cover at least 4 
percent of the packet in countries where there is one official 
language if there are two official languages 6 percent of the 
surface must be covered and where there are three official 
languages 8 percent must be covered 
tar and nicotine levels must also be clearly indicated on 
cigarette packs and must take up the same surface as the health 
warning 
britain although bound by the majority decision was the only 
eec member state to vote against the new law saying that it went 
beyond the eecs powers to adopt legislation to complete the 
internal market by the end of 1992 
by this date all barriers to the free movement of goods 
capital people and services between the 12nation trade bloc 
should be dismantled 
but the eec commission argued that all tobacco products must be 
labeled in the same way otherwise countries could refuse their 
entry on the grounds that they were incorrectly labeled 
the world health organization estimates that 440000 eec 
citizens die every year from diseases caused by smoking

seven otters pulled from oilpolluted 
prince william sound nearly two months ago have become the first to 
be returned to the waterway and are tagged with radar clips for 
monitoring 
the otter release came as commercial fishermen opened the 
halibut season monday and a day before todays start of hearings 
into the nations worst oil spill 
the tanker exxon valdez ran aground march 24 on a charted reef 
25 miles south of valdez it leaked nearly 11 million gallons of 
oil polluting hundreds of miles of shoreline and killing countless 
birds fish and marine mammals 
the four male and three female otters were freed monday into 
simpson bay about 25 miles northwest of cordova 
thats something very measurable said coast guard vice adm 
clyde robbins the federal cleanup coordinator everybody can see 
that and understand that and thats why i like it 
the first otter was released at the shore of a shale and 
shellcovered beach she waddled into the water turned around and 
lifted a paw as if to wave at the 30 onlookers who cheered at the 
sight 
the animals had been undergoing treatment at an exxonfunded 
rehabilitation center in valdez where 45 other otters remain under 
observation 
its the happiest day for the otter rescue center director 
randall davis said 
simpson bay was chosen because it was untouched by oil has a 
stable food source and has a large otter population davis said 
despite the radar tracking wont be easy biologist chuck 
monnett said the signals can be picked up only while the flippers 
are out of the water but wildlife watchers hope the flippers 
movement during swimming will provide an adequate signal 
this will be an excellent opportunity to learn more about the 
animals behavior once they are returned to the wild biologist 
gary sonnevil said 
the seven otters were selected because they appeared fully 
rehabilitated blood samples appear normal and the otters fur 
once again will fully insulate the animals davis said 
the first 24hour halibut season of the spring opened with coast 
guard pilots guiding fishermen away from oil 
very few areas where halibut fishing takes place had any free 
floating oil and it looks good coast guard cmdr mike donohoe 
said 
state and federal inspectors will check the catch to ensure no 
tainted fish wind up on anyones table said bob trumble a 
biologist with the international pacific halibut commission in 
seattle 
the number of halibut fishing periods set by the commission 
depends on how many fish are caught the yearly quota could be 
caught in just three openers more than 60 million pounds of the 
large flounderlike fish were caught off alaska last year and sold 
for 745 million 
because of the pollution the state earlier canceled or 
postponed herring black cod and shrimp harvests in the sound and 
closed some herring fishing grounds 
mild weather helped more than 125 workers finish cleaning up 
green island in time for the sea lion calving season there 
monday was the deadline for exxon to clean oil from rookeries on 
the northwest corner of the island 
it looks a lot better than last week robbins said after 
viewing the area which was cleaned with peat moss and absorbent 
pads 
im very pleased with the peat moss robbins said it 
absorbs the oil thats under the rocks it washes off and is 
biodegradable 
in anchorage officials gathered for a week of hearings by the 
national transportation safety board 
crewmembers of the exxon valdez were the first scheduled to 
testify before a panel that includes representatives from the ntsb 
the state exxon coast guard and alyeska pipeline service co a 
consortium of oil companies that runs the 800mile transalaska oil 
pipeline 
more than two dozen witnesses were expected to testify 
including coast guard personnel and exxon executives the boards 
report on the probable cause will take up to a year to complete 
said drucella andersen an ntsb spokeswoman 
the vessels fired captain joseph hazelwood will not testify 
but has offered written testimony to the board andersen said 
hazelwood who is free on 50000 bail has been charged with 
operating a vessel while drunk and goes on trial june 20 he faces 
two years three months in jail and 11000 in fines if convicted

normally at this time of year the reservoirs are at 100 percent 
of capacity 
the recovery made by our reservoirs is nothing short of 
amazing koch said its the miracle of may 
suburban westchester county which gets 85 percent of its water 
from the city reservoir system also announced monday that 
mandatory water restrictions were being eliminated though 
industries were urged to continue conserving water voluntarily 
the citys restrictions had limited business use of water

lawns flowers and washing cars and had also urged personal 
conservation 
they are lifted go out and shower koch said

in a clash of entertainment industry giants 
rupert murdochs satellite television company has sued the walt 
disney co for 15 billion claiming disney backed out of a 
landmark paytv venture 
sky television owned by murdochs news corp alleged in the 
suit filed monday that disney and several of its subsidiaries 
refused to follow terms of a joint venture announced last year to 
provide two subscription satellite television services to britain 
and ireland 
the first of several satellitetohome television services 
expected in the united kingdom in coming years the international 
venture was to have been up and running this month or in june 
but the lawsuit filed in los angeles superior court maintains 
that disney has failed to start up the service as agreed the court 
action also alleges that disney refused to reimburse skys costs 
and that disney has threatened to withdraw from the agreement if 
not granted more favorable financial terms 
the suit asks for 500 million in general damages and 1 billion 
in punitive damages it further requests that disney be prevented 
from signing a new agreement with another television subscription 
service in the united kingdom 
tom deegan disneys director of corporate communications would 
not comment on the specifics of the suit 
we have great regard for mr murdoch and the accomplishments 
of his organizations deegan said but we are surprised at this 
suit which has absolutely no merit 
under the original agreement announced in a splashy news 
conference last november viewers in britain and ireland with 
satellite dishes were to receive news corps sky movies a new 
feature film and entertainment service and the disney channel on 
two separate channels 
both companies declined to say how much they were investing in 
the deal 
disney was to have supplied 18 hours of daily programming with 
childrens shows in the day and family entertainment and mainstream 
programs at night sky movies started earlier this year features 
movies from 20th century fox another of murdochs news corps 
subsidiaries 
the venture was to have given disney a foothold in a new market 
as it expands globally including the planned 1992 opening of a 
european disneyland near paris sky television was to have 
benefited from the namebrand recognition of a familyoriented 
production company 
the two pay channels were to be sold as a package with 
subscribers charged a monthly fee of about 22 for the service 
subscribers also needed to purchase or rent a satellite decoding 
device 
news corp chief executive murdoch said at the ventures launch 
that he hoped 1 million satellite dishes would be in use in britain 
and ireland by early 1990 and that he expected the pay service to 
become profitable within two to three years 
murdochs fox broadcasting corp while hardly a rival for the 
three us television networks has enjoyed some steady audience 
growth in recent months the disney channel a domestic pay 
television service now claims more than 4 million us subscribers

housing construction declined 27 percent in april to the lowest 
level in more than six years reflecting the upward trend in 
interest rates the government reported today 
last months drop marked the first time housing construction had 
fallen for three consecutive months since the pace of activity 
slowed for five months in a row from february through june 1987 
according to the commerce department 
housing construction was off 45 percent in march and 127 
percent in february 
new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 136 million units in april the slowest pace since 
the 130 million pace of december 1982 
the housing industry has been among the sectors of the economy 
hardest hit as interest rates have edged upward over the past year 
on monday the federal reserve reported that us industry 
operated at 839 percent of capacity in april a slight increase

government bond prices slipped after fridays powerful surge 
but corporate and municipal bond prices finished slightly higher 
the news on factory use was seen as less significant for the

federal reserve policymakers are likely to pause in their

fed policymakers will be sifting through the economic evidence 
today when they meet behind closed doors to set monetary policy 
through june the 12member federal open market committee 
comprised of the seven federal reserve board members and five 
regional fed bank presidents meets eight times a year to set 
interest rate policy and money growth targets 
although the federal reserve boards factory use report monday 
showed industry using more of its capacity last month it revised 
its figures for the first three months of the year to show less 
activity than previously reported 
this fits in with the general pattern of slowness said lyle 
gramley chief economist of the mortgage bankers association of 
america

to shortages and price increases 
in a second report monday the federal reserve said the pace of 
industrial production rose 04 percent in april after holding 
steady in march and falling 03 percent in february the first 
decline in a year

sears roebuck and co has been offered an 
incentive package worth more than 100 million to keep its 
merchandise group in chicago but 72 million more may be needed to 
convince the retailing giant to stay according to a published 
report today 
the chicago suntimes quotes unidentified sources as saying the 
city and state offered sears a 12year 40 million property tax 
abatement and an agreement to designate a relocation site at ohare 
international airport as an illinois enterprise zone 
the incentive package also includes 16 million in 
transportation improvements 80 acres of virtually free land valued 
at 48 million and 10 million in investment tax credits and other 
tax breaks the newspaper reported 
but the newspaper reported that an official familiar with the 
negotiations between sears and government officials said the 
present ohare offer is not enough to prevent the states largest 
private employer from moving the merchandise group involving 
6700 jobs to the sun belt 
the deal may have to be sweetened by up to 72 million more the 
newspaper said 
sources said the city has offered to lease sears 80 acres at the 
airport site for 10 a year for 99 years the newspaper said 
but the city has demanded that the retailer pay market value 
or about 72 million for 140 acres adjacent to the ohare site 
that sears wants to develop for other purposes the newspaper said 
a government source said the city must discount the cost of the 
140 acres sharply to keep the chicago site alive 
the official said other states have offered sears up to 400 
acres of free airport land plus lucrative tax breaks and employee 
training 
last winter the company announced a restructuring plan that 
would relocate the merchandise group from the sears tower and put 
the worlds tallest building up for sale 
it has been reported that sears has been eyeing sites in 
charlotte nc denver dallas and elsewhere for its merchandising 
center a final decision has been promised next month 
jay hedges executive director of the illinois department of 
commerce and community affairs refused to discuss specifics of the 
offer laid out to sears last week by gov james r thompson and 
mayor richard m daley 
the ball is clearly in sears court hedges said its up 
to them to come back to us and tell us what it would take to strike 
an agreement 
thompson expressed optimism monday that sears would keep the 
merchandise group in chicago he said the city and state were 
offering the retailer the largest incentive package we have ever 
put together to retain a company 
neither john parsons the sears official in charge of the move 
nor john schmidt daleys acting chief of staff would comment on 
negotiations

shopping for a new medical insurer after being refused hospital 
treatment and spending four hours to get care following a bicycle 
accident a newspaper reported today 
city health commissioner dian sharma 41 suffered a broken 
right arm and had five front teeth shattered after she said a car 
ran her off the road friday

three hospitals for her medical emergency one hospital turned down 
her insurance and another couldnt provide the proper care

there after an hours drive she learned that her citypaid 
insurance program group health plan would not pay for treatment 
of her injuries 
after about a halfhour they said we cant see you here 
group health plan wont authorize us to set your arm because you

sharma said 
sharmas injuries were finally treated at deaconess hospital

care system as she this could obviously happen to anyone 
lawrence said i dont blame dian sharma for being upset

monday 4000 more than the districts estimate 
monday morning attendance showed that 430000 of the 590000 
students were in class but hundreds left junior and senior high

would not be punished for truancy 
all were gonna do is sit and vegetate complained maureen

schools 
california schools chief william honig accused the teachers 
union of using grades to pressure a settlement

cray research inc will sell its 
supercomputers to customers of control data corp which dumped its 
own supercomputer business a month ago the companies announced 
today 
the joint marketing agreement also will allow the corporate 
neighbors to explore possible product links between control datas 
cyber mainframes and crays supercomputers 
the objective is to offer a seamless network of computing 
power including supercomputers mainframes information servers 
network servers and work stations the two twin cities companies 
said in a news release 
control data closed its eta supercomputer subsidiary april 17 
saying it could not afford to continue funding the moneyloser 
which was competing with industry leader cray 
how much money control data will receive for selling crays 
machines is not known said thomas charland a control data 
spokesman he said there are no plans for cray to take a stake in 
control data as part of the deal 
its strictly a joint marketing arrangement charland said 
james ousley control datas computer products group president 
said the arrangement will help solve the future supercomputing 
requirements of control data customers 
when eta based in st paul minn was shut down 3100 people 
lost jobs control data chairman robert price has said the 
supercomputer venture was too expensive it ate up at least 238 
million over its approximately sixyear lifespan when control data 
was having trouble paying its shortterm bank loans the shutdown 
will cost the company about 350 million and result in a huge 
operating loss for the second quarter in which additional 
writedowns of 140 million will occur price said 
meanwhile the expense and risk of a supercomputer design 
project by cray founder seymour cray has been cited by analysts as 
one reason cray announced monday that it would split into two 
companies seymour cray and his 200member staff in colorado 
springs colo will form a new company in which cray research inc 
will hold a 10 percent stake the company announced 
seymour crays company will continue to develop the cray3 
which he says will be the fastest supercomputer in the world cray 
research will concentrate on its breadandbutter machines the 
ymp and its successors 
ousley said bloomingtonbased control data and minneapolisbased 
cray already have strong product ties in several areas control 
datas cyber work stations are compatible with cray supercomputers 
and cray also uses disk products from imprimis a control data

paying the mortgage has replaced writing checks 
for the monthly bills as the main financial worry of americans 
according to a new study 
in a survey of 1000 us households conducted for the 
international association for financial planning 19 percent listed 
payments on the house among their two or three biggest 
financial concerns making it the most frequent response in the 
study 
in an iafp survey last year house payments ranked third at 9 
percent behind monthly bills and taxes the organization said 
in a related survey of 300 households with income of 50000 or 
more house payments also ranked no 1 at 21 percent according to 
the report 
the survey on financial attitudes was conducted for the iafp by 
the gallup organization the results were released monday in 
atlanta

retirement programs

about outliving their retirement money a drop from 49 percent last

citizens can now buy a europillow 
emblazoned with a circle of 12 gold stars on royal blue but 
founding fathers are tossing fitfully over their dream of a single 
europe 
halfway between the single european act of 1986 and the target 
date of jan 1 1993 european economic community officials insist 
they can blur internal borders enough to forge economic union 
but few people are talking about a united states of europe in 
sharp contrast to the first days of europhoria 
in full flower the dream was to spring beyond economics to a 
blend of social philosophy public policy and shared culture that 
created a new extranational being the european 
reality has muscled aside rhetoric 
at cafe des amis in london on the surface a sign of cultural 
shift a french waiter was asked what coffee he had espresso 
cappuccino and he concluded with a sharp sniff english soup 
early this year the eec commission president jacques delors 
exhorted the european parliament we must give this community 
more flesh and why not a measure of soul 
but he has toned down the enthusiasm that prompted prime 
minister margaret thatcher of britain to remind him in a stinging 
speech that concepts like social gains were not on the table 
there is no question of a new personality replacing individual 
cultures said pascal lamy chief aide to delors 
threequarters of britons and italians speak no second tongue 
eec figures show community business is done in nine languages in 
most of the 12 countries the predominant second culture is 
american 
the process was never supposed to be quick but officials now 
talk in terms of generations lord young british secretary of 
state for trade and industry suggests 500 years 
even such tangible secondstage aspects as a harmonized foreign 
policy seem beyond reach in light of acrimony over the fundamentals 
of national currencies border controls and tax policies 
britain recently bounced back delors plan for a monetary union 
to take measured steps toward a common currency 
mrs thatchers conservative government also rejected talk of 
uniform workers rights and labor practices calling that a 
throwback to the 1970s 
but president francois mitterrand of france a socialist 
earlier this year defined backward as refusing to protect wages 
and workers 
the most regressive and unjust laws must not prevail he 
told a crowd france will not give its consent 
out of the public eye officials struggle to balance sales taxes 
which now vary from 0 to 38 percent a prerequisite to open borders 
an even greater obstacle to free movement are concerns for 
security especially in britain and france where authorities watch 
closely for possible terrorists or drug runners 
the last time i went through british customs they took my car 
apart like a bloody lego toy observed val gardner a british 
motor engineer living in amsterdam in the netherlands that is 
not likely to change 
few leaders are prepared to entrust security to any form of eec 
police force which in any case could not be established without 
complex new jurisdictional accords 
enthusiasm is mixed for the basic idea among eec members and 
each is coolly assessing what it stands to lose every politician 
knows whatever his stance in brussels he faces voters at home 
a museum tour of any european capital shows the vast cultural 
wealth behind the dream a shared sense of pride in the art 
literature and music which shaped the western world 
but a glance at the daily headlines suggests that a millenium of 
conflict has merely been refined by modern times 
in april for example the annual french yacht race across the 
atlantic was stalled by fishermen in the port of lorient demanding 
that a warship chase off an interloping spanish fleet 
the greens a loose amalgam of european ecologist parties are 
gaining fast on platforms that argue the single market will smash 
flat all the bumps and edges that make up european life 
they warn that small farmers and businessmen will perish if they 
cling to traditional ways or even if they try to keep up in many 
cases 
they tell us we will gain 5 million jobs but well lose 20 
million german candidate friedrichwilhelm graefe zu baringdorf 
told the greens congress in paris to a tumult of applause

forecasts of rain for some of the drier growing areas 
corn futures also were pressured by the weather services 6 to 
10day forecast for increased precipitation however corn prices 
may be helped by the agriculture departments announcement 
yesterday that the soviet union has purchased 450thousand metric

in brussels belgian capital and eec headquarters site such 
pessimism is shrugged away 
that assumes labor is a single ball that cannot be shaped in 
other ways said geoffrey fitchew eec directorgeneral for 
financial institutions who predicted incalcuble new opportunities 
the questio he acknowledged was how much sacrifice individuals 
and national governments were willing to make during the inevitable 
shakedown period 
some signs are ominous in frances perigueux young farmers 
protesting eec price levels bricked up the local prefecture 
labeling their concrete barrier the wall of rural rage 
the trend toward fast big and uniform is clear last year 
takeover prices in western european corporate mergers came to 70 
billion 
mass marketing means little unsettling changes as it stands 
for example rules sound the death knell for the pink dye in the 
sausages vital to a proper english breakfast or to danish hotdogs 
even in spain and portugal where eagerness is palpable across a 
broad sweep of society many people fear a tide of northern 
europeans and their money will wash over what is left of cherished 
old ways 
already a powerful lobby in the european parliament an arm of 
the eec is seeking to ban bullfighting 
west germans who have cut unemployment to below 8 percent fret 
at a spanish jobless rate approaching 20 percent after 1992 the 
communitys 155 million unemployed could pitch up anywhere 
german opinion polls indicate a steadily growing skepticism over 
rushing into a single europe 
in france where delors is from authorities pushed hard for a 
single europe which originally was the dream of frenchmen jean 
monnet but more than most eec citizens the french worry out loud 
a recent poll for the daily le monde showed only 30 percent of 
frenchmen queried felt building europe was a crucial priority a 
drop from 43 percent when the idea was first debated in 1984 
in a briskly selling book called la grande illusion the 
french financierphilosopher alain minc dismissed the whole idea as 
a a darwinian nightmare 
he warns of a wave of xenophobia and extreme nationalism across 
europe as aggrieved sectors feel the pinch 
almost every day some french publication points out that after 
1992 any danish dentist or belgium barber who has seen a cezanne 
can set up shop in provence 
jacques chirac paris mayor and a former premier said a single 
europe was essential but he warned france would suffer until it 
retooled its industries and services to be more competitive 
he warned that a real estate boom would drive rents out of reach 
for frenchmen whose earnings lag behind those of richer eec 
neighbors 
i am convinced paris will be the capital of europe the 
gateway for its location communications and other attributes 
said chirac tempering pride with trepidation 
europes capital now is brussels home to 13000 eec officials 
and employees although the european parliament still meets in 
strasbourg and some administration is done in luxembourg 
the old belgian city is an apt microcosm of a future single 
europe 
brussels residents are split between the little nations two 
official languages which are a source of occasionally violent 
conflict along the borders between wallony and flanders 
the eecs glasspaneled berlaymont building rising above the 
snapping colors of 12 separate states and their common standard of 
stars on blue symbolizes the grand dream 
but most visitors prefer the grand place a timeworn square 
lined with elaborate renaissance officemansions that housed guilds 
of fiercely independent craftsmen who did things the old way 
brussels receives television broadcasts from seven countries 
and viewers cringe when a british broadcasting corp newscaster 
says a british cabinet minister is going to europe 
in the spirit of things the telephone book is thick with 
private businesses that prefix their name with euro one sells 
48 kinds of eurokitsch including jogging pants and pillows 
another a sandblasting company draws chuckles from those who 
have grown dubious of the dream eurofacade

the landmark 1973 supreme court decision but also portrayed 
sympathetically the prosecutors who argued the other side 
the national right to life committee urged nbc affiliates not to 
run the movie while the american family association a 
mississippibased religious group encouraged advertisers not to 
buy time on the program both claimed the movie took a proabortion 
stance 
in a letter earlier this month nbc president robert wright told 
the 100 biggest national advertisers that the movie presented a 
balanced view of the abortion issue and he would run it even if no 
advertisers bought time 
only one of nbcs 208 affiliates had notified the network that 
it intended to preempt the movie spokesman curt block said 
monday the exception was the affiliate in kansas city which was 
committed to a baseball game nbc found another station in the 
market to run the movie he said 
block admitted the network cut its normal advertising rate 
during the past four or five days to find paid sponsors but he 
declined to say how much time was sold at a discount or how deep 
the discounts were 
one ad agency media expert speaking on condition of anonymity 
said rates were cut as much as half for about 4 minutes of 
commercials 
industry sources say the going rate for a 30second commercial 
in that time period is about 180000 
block said the movie probably will lose money but he was unable 
to confirm a published report that placed the anticipated loss at 
about 1 million 
networks usually dont have to discount prices for commercials 
in prime time block said if a network fails to find paying 
sponsors it will often fill the time with public service 
announcements run for free 
block said that calls to the nbc switchboard in new york ran 163 
to 22 in favor of showing the movie during the two hours the 
program was on and the 15 minutes afterward 
less than 200 calls isnt that much but it is unusual to have 
an eight to one ratio praising a product people are more apt to 
voice their complaints rather to praise we are pleased with it 
he said 
at knbctv in los angeles a switchboard operator reported 40 
calls in favor of the show and five against between 945 pm and 
11 pm pdt 
knsdtv in san diego received nearly 50 calls and a majority

it was not the type of response we expected he said the

the us treasury is losing billions of 
dollars because employers including the government itself fail 
to withhold taxes from the paychecks of workers who are erroneously 
designated as independent contractors the general accounting 
office said today 
gao placed a good share of the blame on congress which in an 
effort 10 years ago to curtail the internal revenue service made 
it more difficult to crack down on employers who violate the 
withholding provisions 
paul l posner a gao associate director told a house 
government operations subcommittee that the failure of workers 
designated as independent contractors to report some or all their 
income is at the root of the revenue loss 
in turn gao found employers are not complying with 
requirements that they file reports with the irs on payments made 
to individual contractors even when auditing business tax returns 
the report said the irs is not identifying businesses that fail to 
file such reports 
the importance of employers filing required information 
returns on payments made to independent contractors cannot be 
overemphasized posner said irs officials estimate that 
billions in taxes are lost because independent contractors do not 
report all income 
posner told the subcommittee on consumer affairs that in 1984 
alone the irs estimated it lost 16 billion because about one of 
every seven employers misidentified employees as independent 
contractors 
michael j murphy the acting irs commissioner said the agency 
shares concern about such noncompliance and has taken several 
steps to combat it he added the current rules are confusing to 
employers and difficult for irs to administer 
independent contractors are companies or individuals who supply 
services to a business or government agency but do not have an 
employee relationship with the business or agency there are 
numerous tests to determine whether a worker is an employee or 
independent contractor including who controls working hours 
if a supplier is classified as an employee a business must 
withhold income and social security taxes from his or her paycheck 
and pay an employers share of social security taxes 
however if that supplier is said to be an independent 
contractor the business withholds no tax and pays no employers 
share of social security tax the treasury loses again when the 
contractor claims business deductions 
the law requires that payments for services supplied by 
independent contractors that are partnerships or sole 
proprietorships be reported to the irs but not those supplied by 
corporations 
the independentcontractor issue is not new the irs has been 
battling in the courts for years in an effort to require sellers of 
goods and services such as some distributors of amway products to 
pay taxes as employees 
the bulk of the report from gao an arm of congress focused on 
the failure of government agencies to file irs reports on payments 
to independent contractors 
the report cited a finding by the treasury department that 12 of 
14 federal agencies surveyed failed to report 9 billion in 
payments to independent contractors in 1984 and 1985 gao conducted 
its own spot survey of state and local governments and found 16 of 
17 state agencies checked and 7 of 10 local units were not in full 
compliance 
in reviewing 9 million in payments to independent contractors 
by the sampled government units that were subject to information 
reporting we found that 8 million had not been reported posner 
said 
many state and local officials did not fully understand the 
reporting requirements and irs has not done enough to clear up the 
confusion gao concluded 
gao spotchecked business tax returns that had been audited by 
the irs and found that in 50 percent of the cases at least one 
information return was missing furthermore the report stated irs 
auditors failed to detect the missing returns which involved 
payments of 6 million to independent contractors 
irs officials say they already are taking steps to correct such 
deficiencies but it will take action by congress to correct a 1978 
law restricting the authority of the irs to reclassify workers who 
have been identified by employers as independent contractors gao 
said

insider trading charges today against a 24yearold former 
paralegal and five others who allegedly made more than 800000 
from her tip about a leveraged buyout of a department store chain 
the sec alleged that the paralegal kerry a hurton learned 
from confidential documents that hooker corporation ltd planned to 
announce a proposed buyout of birmingham alabased parisian inc 
in july 1987 
ms hurton worked in the boston office of the major new york law 
firm skadden arps slate meagher amp flom 
she allegedly passed information to her boyfriend eric laboz of 
new york city and directly or indirectly to several other people 
who made a total of 823825 in profits by trading in parisian 
stock the sec said 
one of the alleged illegal traders is a deputy us marshal 
bernard stone of norwell 
the civil complaint filed in us district court in boston 
seeks to force the defendants to return the alleged profits and pay 
up to three times the amount in penalties

massachusetts plans to use undercover agents 
aerial surveillance and search warrants in a pollution crackdown 
environmentalists and state officials today predicted will be the 
broadest in the country 
escorted by dozens of uniformed enforcement officers gov 
michael s dukakis today stood between the shore of the charles 
river and a new jail to underscore massachusetts desire to hit 
polluters with criminal penalties 
these are violent crimes they do violence against others 
against houses against neighborhoods and against the water we 
drink and the air we breathe dukakis said 
a 33member strike force of lawyers scientists and police 
officers will be used to find polluters and build cases against 
them 
dukakis was joined by attorney general james shannon and the 
states entire environmental establishment but not by federal 
officials dukakis aides said however that they plan to 
coordinate with the us environmental protection agency and the 
local us attorney 
the state is thinking big and thinking properly said elissa 
parker policy director at the environmental law institute in 
washington 
she said maryland ohio and pennsylvania have strike forces that 
concentrate on toxic dumping and water pollution while 
massachusetts will include the protection of wetlands and other 
habitats 
except for those three states there arent any statewide 
initiatives that even come close to what massachusetts is doing 
she said 
a lot of people viewed previous environmental enforcement as 
an acceptable risk of doing business you could live with civil 
penalties and a slap on the wrist shannon said 
were saying if you violate these laws you run the risk of 
criminal prosecution a prison sentence and damn heavy fines 
daniel greenbaum who heads the state department of 
environmental quality engineering said up to 50 percent of people 
discharging pollutants into sewers or the air do not have required 
permits and many who have permits violate them 
state secretary of environmental affairs john devillars said 
polluters have ruined 103 water supplies in the state created more 
than 1000 toxic dumps and cost the state 90 million a year in 
losses from contaminated shellfish beds 
he said state laws generally are tough enough but have not been 
enforced adequately he also said dukakis will file legislation 
this year for tougher penalties 
but joseph duggan of the greater boston chamber of commerce said 
that the strike force is all stick and no carrot 
people who are intentionally disobeying the law fouling the 
land and atmosphere should be cracked down on and made to pay 
he said 
but others find out after buying property that it was 
contaminated and are told youre responsible clear it up we 
are objecting to that we dont think its the right approach he 
said 
the environment became a focal point in last years presidential 
campaign when thenvice president george bush toured boston harbor 
to criticize dukakis the democratic candidate for delaying a 
cleanup of the harbor

all regions of california will post 
population gains of more than 20 percent by the year 2000 and 
sacramento will be the fastest growing area according to a new 
study 
the study released on tuesday by the center for continuing study 
of the california economy said the states population will add 
nearly 6 million people in the next decade to reach 35 million by 
2000 
san diego will be the states second fastest growing region 
while the los angeles basin will add nearly 3 million residents 
the san francisco bay area will grow by around a million 
the forecast was higher than those by most state and regional 
agencies the study by the center projected a statewide population 
more than 2 million higher than the state department of finance 
slow growth is not realistic said stephen levy the 
centers director the choices are either planned growth or 
unplanned growth so we need to stop wishing and start preparing 
the study said foreign immigration plays a key role in the 
states growth with nearly 1 in 2 new residents a recent immigrant 
the center predicted the trend will continue with the addition of 
more than 250000 foreign immigrants each year 
in 1988 ethnic minorities accounted for 40 percent of the 
states residents the study said by 2000 the share will be 
nearly 50 percent 
the demographics underlying the housing market should remain 
strong the forecast added 
household growth is projected to range from 190000 to 275000 
a year depending on income growth and the behavior of recent 
immigrants much of the growth wil be in the 3554 age group which 
has the highest income levels

a new york investment group began a hostile 
tender offer for cnw corp today worth more than 700 million but 
management of the large midwest railroad company said it was trying 
to assemble a competing bid 
chairman robert schmiege told about 300 shareholders at cnws 
annual meeting that management was working with financial experts 
and an unidentified outside party to devise an offer that would 
derail the 44ashare offer by japonica partners which already 
owns about 88 percent of cnws stock 
we are reasonably optimistic we will succeed in this effort 
schmiege said 
cnw is parent of the 6000mile chicago amp north western 
transportation co an important freight hauler in the midwest and 
one of the largest freighthauling railroads in the country it 
also provides passenger service in the chicago area 
japonicas offer was timed to coincide with the annual 
shareholders meeting and an effort to oust cnws board through a 
proxy contest 
the tender offer is to purchase 139 million shares of common 
stock at 44 a share in cash or about 612 million and 27 
million shares of convertible preferred stock at 3411 a share in 
cash or about 92 million 
japonica said in a statement issued today that it wants to run 
cnws freight operations but would sell the railroad holding 
companys commuter line 
the offer expires at midnight edt on june 13 unless extended by 
japonica 
we sincerely believe that our offer and the experience and 
competitive culture japonica partners will bring to cnw is in the 
best interests of the company its employees customers and the 
communities it serves said the japonica statement 
cnws common stock closed monday at 4375 a share down 87 
cents in composite trading 
japonica said it intends to acquire all of cnws stock the 
tender offer would potentially give it 90 percent of cnws common 
shares and preferred shares 
meanwhile a delaware federal court was due to rule today on a 
motion by japonica to delay todays scheduled shareholder vote on 
the grounds that cnw had violated proxy solicitation rules cnw 
officials have denied the allegation 
japonica a 1yearold partnership headed by former goldman 
sachs amp co vice presidents paul kazarian and michael lederman 
began courting cnw in march with an unsolicited offer to negotiate 
a buyout 
cnw chairman robert schmiege termed the offer nonsense 
since then japonica has repeatedly declared its intention to 
acquire cnw 
cnws board of directors has formed a special committee to 
solicit other offers the company has said it is negotiating with 
at least one potential bidder 
in a statement issued today cnw said the auction process is 
continuing despite japonicas latest move 
other potential bidders have already signed confidentiality 
agreements and are in discussions with representatives of the 
special committee set up to consider alternatives to to maximize 
stockholder value the statement said 
cnw urged stockholders to focus on the fact that it remains 
important that the special committee of cnws board of directors 
remain in control of the acution process 
the committee would meet promptly to consider japonicas 
offer the cnw statement said 
in japonicas statement the partnership said we intend to 
manage all the freight operations of cnw while working 
cooperatively with the employee unions to maintain and improve 
operations and service for cnws customers the assets we are 
considering selling are only those not essential to cnws freight 
business such as certain real estate excess equipment and the 
commuter line 
congress and the interstate commerce commission have been 
watching japonicas actions with an eye toward stepping in to 
prevent any disruption of rail service

grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade in reaction to forecasts of 
rainfall in crop producing states hurt recently by dryness 
the drop in soybean prices also was attributed to technical 
selling and softness in the export market 
everyone was negative from the start of trading said jerry 
gidel an analyst with lit america inc in chicago 
national weather service forecasts of rain in the southern 
plains were augmented by private forecasters who predicted heavy 
rains would spread to kansas and nebraska and other states in the 
uppermidwest plagued by dry conditions the forecasts put the 
market on the defensive 
gidel said soybean futures sellstops were activated early in 
trading pushing new crop soybean prices below 7 for the first 
time in weeks he said rumors of interest in soy oil by the soviet 
union had little effect on the market 
corn prices were not helped by the agriculture departments 
announcement monday that the soviets would buy 450000 metric tons 
of corn 
reports of an aboveaverage yield in the indiana michigan and 
ohio soft red wheat crop caused a selloff in wheat futures gidel 
said

the stock market moved lower today amid selling 
to collect profits amassed during the previous two strong sessions 
basically what were seeing is a bit of a pullback after two 
very strong days said gordon l smith a managing director at 
the investment firm alex brown amp sons inc in baltimore this is 
quite normal the market took quite a run and needs to pause 
the selling which was spread through most major market sectors 
appeared to be motivated mainly by the desire to collect profits 
he said 
market operators decided the time was right to sell because the 
government is due to release some potentially marketmoving 
economic figures on wednesday and thursday said peter vandenberg 
a senior vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc 
selling in front of a couple of closely watched economic 
numbers makes sense to me vandenberg said 
on wednesday the commerce department is scheduled to report on 
the countrys merchandise trade performance in march and the 
following day the labor department is to release its april consumer 
price index 
meanwhile analysts said federal reserve policy makers meeting 
today already have abundant evidence of slower economic growth to 
sift through as they plot their monetary policy course for the next 
six weeks 
a commerce department report today said housing construction 
fell for the third straight month in april analysts said the 27 
percent drop furnished a fresh sign of the impact higher interest 
rates are having

longterm financial anxieties such as retirement 
and oldage health care are taking a back seat to immediate worries 
about paying the mortgage a study shows 
in a survey of 1000 us households conducted for the 
international association for financial planning 19 percent listed 
payments on the house among their two or three biggest 
financial concerns making it the most frequent response 
in an iafp survey last year the monthly house payments ranked 
third in frequency at 9 percent the organization said behind 
monthly bills and taxes 
the survey also suggests americans are worrying less about 
inflation with only 2 percent of the respondents expressing 
concern about rising consumer prices in last years iafp survey 
inflation was listed by 9 percent of the respondents 
if you look their concerns are short instead of longterm 
iafp president charles finn said tuesday 
finn said rising interest rates are behind the heightened 
concern about mortgage payments 
the force that drives that the most is adjustable rate 
mortgages he said i think youll see that the concern about 
the mortgages as long as the interest rates are up 
the survey conducted by the gallup organization and released 
monday in atlanta also included a related study involving 300 
households with income of 50000 or more in that group house 
payments also ranked no 1 at 21 percent as a primary worry 
the survey found that worries about making the mortgage payments 
may be leading some people to divert attention from retirement 
planning and longterm health care 
the survey found 25 percent of respondents didnt have plans for 
retirement of those that did the largest percentage 35 percent 
intended to rely on employee retirement programs 
saving for retirement was listed by only 3 percent of the 
respondents and was ranked nexttolast above inflation 
survey data indicates americans have been distracted from this 
longterm financial worry by nearterm mortgage woes the survey 
said 
only one in 10 in the survey said they would use their own 
savings or earnings to pay for a family members longterm health 
care 
if people do not make adequate arrangements for their retirement 
or elderly health care finn said they will have to rely on 
government social programs 
with the increases in life expectancy and the larger elderly 
population this has dramatic implications for the country finn 
said the message we are trying to get across is they should plan 
for the future 
the iafp is an atlantabased professional organization for the 
financial planning industry 
gallup conducted the main survey in april using a random sample 
described by the iafp as representative of the us as a whole 
scott larsen an iafp spokesman said the survey had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 31 percent

the head of ogilvy group inc said tuesday he 
investigated every reasonable alternative but could not find 
anything to beat wpp group plcs record 864 million buyout offer 
for the advertising giant 
kenneth roman ogilvys chairman said he also was confident 
there would be few if any client defections in the wake of the 
buyout agreement reached late monday under which ogilvys board 
unanimously approved wpps proposal for a 54 a share tender offer 
for all of ogilvys stock 
martin sorrell chief executive of londonbased wpp said at a 
news conference that he intended to keep ogilvy and its management 
intact as part of the deal he signed an agreement that guarantees 
ogilvy will be run autonomously 
the deal the largest takeover ever in the advertising business 
comes less than two years after wpp broke onto the us advertising 
scene with a hostile 566 million buyout of the parent of another 
huge ad agency j walter thompson the thompson buyout had been 
the previous ad industry record 
the addition of ogilvy the worlds fifthlargest advertising 
company to the arsenal at wpp the thirdlargest ad concern last 
year creates the worlds second largest advertising and marketing 
services company the new company has billings of about 135 
billion a shade below industry leader saatchi amp saatchi plc 
sorrell had proposed a friendly buyout at 45 a share in late 
april sweetened the proposal to 50 a share early last week and 
boosted it to 54 a share this past weekend 
the ogilvy board approved the latest offer late monday night 
the two sides announced early tuesday roman and sorrell appeared 
together at a midmorning news conference to discuss the deal and 
roman later presided at the previouslyscheduled ogilvy annual 
shareholders meeting 
sorrell said ogilvy fit his plan to build wpp into a group of 
quality name brands we are not the largest nor do we want to 
be he said 
wpp will pay for ogilvy stock by raising about 350 million with 
an issue of securities that can be converted into wpp stock the 
rest will come from bank loans 
roman said ogilvy which was founded 41 years ago and has such 
bluechip clients as american express co american telephone amp 
telegraph co and unilever nv would have preferred to remain 
independent 
he said the company pursued every reasonable course to do so 
but found the wpp offer was far and away the best for ogilvy 
clients shareholders and employees roman will remain chairman of 
ogilvy 
at the shareholders meeting roman said management considered 
everything from white knights to white squires to 
recapitalization to leveraged buyouts but found it could not beat 
wpps allcash offer 
roman declined to identify any of those he talked with about 
alternatives 
the shareholders meeting attracted about 250 people and lasted 
some 35 minutes including a 12minute presentation of the 
companys commercials shareholders asked only three questions and 
none voiced an opinion on the deal 
ogilvy stock traded in the mid20s a share a year ago and 
closed at 32 a share the day before wpps initial proposal was 
disclosed ogilvy closed at 5312 a share tuesday down 12 cents 
from mondays close 
david ogilvy the ogilvy founder who has been named chairman of 
wpp as part of the takeover deal and had reportedly been critical 
of wpps initial advances attended the meeting but did not address 
it he also declined to discuss the takeover with reporters 
burt manning the head of j walter thompson said he welcomed 
ogilvys addition to wpp and said the buyout improves wpps 
chances for competing in the marketplace 
he said thompson would nonetheless compete fiercely with 
ogilvys main agency ogilvy amp mather worldwide for clients 
some analysts have said wpps acquisition of ogilvy could prompt 
some advertisers to take their business elsewhere 
thompson works for eastman kodak co for instance while ogilvy 
works for rival polaroid corp 
greg ostroff who follows advertising stocks for goldman sachs amp 
co said there may be potential conflicts involving as much as 
650 million of the new companys billings but he declined to 
estimate how much business the two companies may lose by sharing 
the same corporate parent 
ostroff said the friendly tone of the ogilvy buyout contrasts 
with the hostility of the deal for thompsons parent jwt group 
several sizeable clients left thompson after that takeover 
dissatisfied with turmoil in agency management

international business machines corp driving 
to overcome the incompatibility of its computers announced tuesday 
a major package of software that will run the same way on ibm 
machines of all sizes 
analysts described officevision as an important part of ibms 
attempt to duplicate and go beyond the successful strategies of 
rivals such as digital equipment corp and apple computer inc 
it is the largest applications software announcement in ibms 
history nothing else is close said joseph m guglielmi ibm 
vice president and president of the application systems division 
officevision conceals the differences between computers from 
users harnessing midsized computers and big mainframes to work in 
tandem with personal computers 
officevision will be welcomed most by companies that are heavy 
users of ibm computers while providing fewer advantages to 
companies with a mix of machines analysts predicted 
its a muchneeded announcement said bob djurdjevic of 
annex research inc in phoenix who attended the announcement in 
new york i think they took a page out of decs book 
officevision is another step in overcoming the problems ibm 
created for itself in the 1960s and 1970s when it introduced a 
bewildering variety of machines that could not run the same 
software 
digital ibms nearest rival disparaged the announcement in 
advance saying the capabilities ibm is beginning to introduce have 
long been available on its own vax series of computers 
but guglielmi said officevision is superior in its ability to 
mix and share data between programs and in its capacity to plug in 
programs that are developed by other companies and have the same 
look and feel 
fourteen software companies including microsoft corp and lotus 
development corp said today they would develop new versions of 
their programs that would snap in to the officevision family 
according to ibm officevision will make it possible for someone 
to tap all the computers of a company simply by manipulating 
pictures on a workstation screen 
for example ibm said someone could get humanresources figures 
out of a mainframe and salary figures from a midsize computer 
then combine them all on the screen of a personal computer without 
needing to know where the information originated or how it was 
delivered 
programs written for officevision all will have the same look 
and feel saving users from having to relearn basic functions 
every time they try a new program that sameness is one of the keys 
to success of apple computer incs macintosh 
to take full advantage of the new officevision software 
customers will have to buy a new version of the baselayer software 
for personal computers known as operating system2 extended 
edition 12 
so far ibm is the only company that makes personal computers 
capable of using that particular version of baselayer software 
other companies have indicated they intend to clone the ibm 
machine using ibm patent licenses 
by linking its own brand of personal computers more tightly with 
the rest of its product line ibm is encouraging companies that 
rely on ibms big machines to buy ibm personal computers as well 
the new pc base software will be available this fall the 
officevision software will be available this year and next 
depending on the computer 
prices of officevision range from a onetime charge of 210 for 
a personal computer in a lowcost network to a onetime charge of 
51000 and annual charges of 9000 for the version that goes in 
ibms biggest mainframes

financial service conglomerate southmark corp 
reported tuesday that it lost 104 billion in the first quarter 
due largely to problem real estate loans 
the loss for the three months ended march 31 compares to a 123 
million shortfall the same time a year ago revenue totaled 406 
million down from 431 million in the 1988 period 
included in southmarks quarterly results was an 829 million 
provision for losses from its real estate portfolio and 104 
million in losses from discontinued operations involved in the 
anticipated sale of the companys insurance holdings 
susan seiter southmarks vice president for investor relations 
said the loanloss provision was the result of a reevaluation of 
the companys 8 billion in assets undertaken by new management 
southmarks assumptions have been changed to reflect that 
depressed conditions in important real estate markets have 
continued longer than previously anticipated said chairman 
arthur g weiss a georgia businessman brought in to run the 
company after directors fired chairman gene e phillips and vice 
chairman william s friedman in january 
real estate is a cyclical business weiss said the real 
estate depression has lasted much longer that anyone expected and 
southmarks financial capacity is not sufficient to carry all of 
its assets and investments until a better day 
within the past several weeks the company has sold or reached 
agreements to sell various assets for 167 million all but 7 
million in cash 
one of southmarks largest holdings is san jacinto savings and 
loan association one of texas many troubled thrifts although the 
company said the houstonbased thrift currently meets federal 
capital requirements it has estimated additional loss reserves 
below those requirements although the institution would remain 
solvent 
southmark also is continuing to seek a buyer for integon corp 
its north carolinabased insurance subsidiary 
the 104 billion quarterly loss puts southmark in technical 
violation with agreements with holders of about 11 billion in 
junk bonds although the company said it has enough cash to 
maintain operations and to remain current with its suppliers 
vendors and creditors for some time to come 
in the past nine months stockholders equity has dropped from 
701 million on june 30 1988 to a minus428 million on march 31 
the earnings announcement comes as southmarks top executive 
face a proxy fight with investor herbert b parks of greensboro 
nc 
parks who has complained that weiss is in way over his 
head originally sought to replace the entire sevenmember 
southmark board but has had to reduce that to just three members 
because of federal banking regulations 
a special shareholders meeting is scheduled for friday in 
atlanta where southmark is incorporated 
southmark also has scheduled a meeting next week with 
bondholders to discuss the companys plans and future

lift an order blocking south africacontrolled minorco sa from 
acquiring consolidated gold fields plc

the dollars sharp ascent stalled tuesday as the 
rally ran up against nervousness over government reports on foreign 
trade and inflation 
the federal reserve sold some dollars but traders were divided 
on whether the central banks intervention was an important factor 
in halting the currencys rise 
the dollar finished higher against the french franc and italian 
lira but slightly lower against other major currencies 
on monday the dollar had reached its highest point against the 
west german mark since the end of 1986 and its highest point 
against the japanese yen since november 1987 in one week the 
dollar had tacked on 22 percent against each currency 
the market is still bullish customers are willing to buy the 
dollar and are looking for numbers to buy it said frank conte a 
vice president at barclays bank plc in new york 
the commerce department was scheduled to report on the march 
merchandise trade deficit on wednesday and the labor department was 
to announce figures on april consumer prices on thursday 
although currency traders largely have ignored trade figures in 
recent months a particularly large deficit figure might be enough 
to puncture the bubble of the recent speculative runup in the 
dollar some traders believe 
a big increase in consumer prices might actually help the dollar 
by increasing the chance the federal reserve would push up interest 
rates something that makes dollardenominated investments more 
attractive 
in london the dollar fell against the british pound it cost 
16398 to buy one pound more expensive than 16385 late monday 
later in new york the dollar also lost ground as the pound rose to 
16435 from 16410 
in tokyo the dollar closed up 020 yen at 13700 yen despite 
reported intervention by the bank of japan later in london the 
dollar was quoted at 13728 yen by the end of the trading day in

supercomputer wizard seymour cray bid 
farewell tuesday to shareholders of cray research inc vowing to 
compete against the company he founded with technology his 
successors in management passed up 
the spinoff of seymour crays latest research project into a 
separate company announced late monday prompted cray research 
stock to plunge 6 a share to 4975 in heavy trading tuesday on 
the new york stock exchange 
seymour cray said he does not intend to take on additional 
investors in forming cray computer corp the company will start as 
a wholly owned subsidiary of cray research and evolve within a year 
into a company owned by existing cray shareholders 
the new company will receive 100 million in operating funds and 
50 million in assets in the next two years from cray research 
what im getting is all the money i wanted said cray who 
will be chairman of the colorado springs colo company i dont 
think i can spend more than 100 million 
in another development tuesday minneapolisbased cray research 
announced plans to sell its supercomputers to customers of twin 
cities neighbor control data corp control data on april 17 shut 
down its fledgling eta systems supercomputer subsidiary after it 
lost 238 million in five years 
how much money control data will receive for selling crays 
machines under the new joint marketing agreement is not known said 
thomas charland a control data spokesman 
seymour cray gave birth to the supercomputer industry in 1972 
after he was pushed out of control data another company he helped 
found because his research was getting too expensive he said he 
had gone to control data in 1957 because his role at a st paul 
computer maker was shrinking in an expansion fueled by his 
innovations the company was a forerunner to univac corp which 
has evolved into unisys corp 
its been a circular career path cray told a crowded 
auditorium at the companys annual shareholders meeting once 
again im hearing youve got a nice little project there heres 
some money now go start youre own company 
under the restructuring cray research will be able to focus on 
its breadandbutter ymp machines which are produced in chippewa 
falls wis cray chairman john rollwagen said tuesday that it had 
become too costly to fund both computer projects cray devoted 30 
million last year to the cray3 which wont be unveiled until 
1990 he said 
rollwagen also said customers were sometimes perplexed about the 
competition within the company some were frustrated with having to 
choose between the ymp and the cray3 he said 
the textbook solution rollwagen said would have been to settle 
on one technology and shut down the other but such a move would 
have stifled americas competitiveness in an industry targeted by 
the japanese especially because of etas failure he said 
by having two companies at least we have more odds 
rollwagen said theres a backup plan if one fails 
marcelo gumucio president and chief operating officer at cray 
said nec corp is the most formidable of three japanese 
competitors but by crays calculations japans three 
supercomputer makers account for only about 14 percent of all 
installed central processing units in the world crays 485 central 
processing units account for 76 percent and eta machines account 
for 10 percent gumucio said 
seymour cray said he had mixed feelings about leaving but he 
denied rumors that he was at odds with management 
i wasnt dissatisfied cray said we both have had all the 
resources we needed up until now 
he said the cray3 the first supercomputer to use the gallium 
arsenide metal alloy as a semiconductor will be demonstrated by 
the end of this year sales should begin by 1990 but at a slower 
pace than cray reserach had projected he said 
the two companies will enter crosslicensing and technology 
transfer agreements involving both hardware and software but by 
the mid1990s they should be allout competitors rollwagen said 
i think we have two fearless organizations here cray said 
so may the best technology win in the longterm i think 
technology will rule the day 
before the spinoff can occur approvals on the stock offering 
are needed from the internal revenue service and securities and 
exchange commission existing cray shareholders would receive at 
least 90 percent of the stock in the new company rollwagen said 
the rest would be held by cray research and officers of the new 
company

authorities in the township of parsippany 
are girding for exxon corps annual shareholders meeting on 
thursday where the 111member police force expects to face a crowd 
of hundreds coming to demonstrate against the giant oil company 
at this point i have no idea what its going to cost but the 
mayor said hes going to send exxon the bill for overtime and 
taxpayer costs parsippany police chief michael filippello said 
tuesday after a meeting with township officials 
expected to attend the meeting and gather outside are hundreds 
of demonstrators protesting exxons cleanup of the march 24 oil 
spill that followed the grounding of an exxon tanker in alaskas 
prince william sound and polluted 800 miles of shoreline 
the company already has been criticized harshly by consumer 
advocates environmentalists and others as having responded too 
slowly and ineffectively to the spill 
parsippany located about 35 miles west of exxons manhattan 
headquarters was chosen for the annual meeting partly because 
35000 of exxons 713000 shareholders live in northern new jersey 
the largest such concentration in the country exxon officials said 
also 5500 of exxons 100000 employees live and work in the 
region said exxon spokesman bill smith 
edwin rothchild energy policy director of the washingtonbased 
consumer rights group citizen action said he expected several 
hundred people to gather at the aspen manor hotel to hear speeches 
and show shareholders their displeasure with the companys handling 
of the cleanup 
were not going to let them off the hook he said we have 
a number of points we want to make and we plan to be heard 
rothchild said he and more than 30 coalition members own exxon 
stock and plan to attend the meeting 
national environmental and consumer organizations also plan to 
return about 20000 exxon gasoline credit cards turned in by 
consumers responding to a mailin protest campaign said rob 
stuart legislative program director of the 70000member new 
jersey public interest group 
smith said the company plans to do little differently during 
thursdays meeting and will hold its usual news conference 
afterward with exxon chairman and chief executive officer lawrence 
g rawl and president lee r raymond 
the only things were doing differently is were having pool 
coverage by camera crews and still photographers because of the 
apparent television interest he said we just wouldnt be able 
to fit all the network camera crews that want to go 
smith said exxon had received requests for 6300 tickets 
although only about 2200 people would get tickets to attend the 
meeting 
filippello said the township has seen such protests before 
specifically a sitin at the headquarters of general public 
utilities corp which owns the three mile island nuclear plant 
near harrisburg pa the site of the nations worst commercial 
nuclear accident 
our position is that these people have a legitimate right to 
make the point theyre trying to make and exxon has the right to 
its meeting filippello said were there as neutral 
observers 
filippello said he has spoken with groups representing 
demonstrators who were trying to keep police informed of their 
plans 
he said the township would bring in extra officers for crowd 
control and would try to keep demonstrators within the hotel 
parking lot in order to keep them from spilling over onto a nearby 
busy street

thinking machines corp a small supercomputer 
rival of cray research inc announced two new models on tuesday 
and said it had reached a marketing agreement with digital 
equipment corp 
the cambridge massbased company used a new york news 
conference to describe progress in getting its computers placed 
with industrial and academic customers who use it for complex 
problems such as aircraft design stress analysis and molecular 
biology 
danny hillis thinking machines founding scientist said in an 
interview that his company is the world leader in a style of 
computing known as parallel processing a field in which 
researchers say americans are far ahead of the japanese 
japans nec corp hitachi ltd and fujitsu ltd are chipping 
away at crays lead in supercomputer market share because they are 
better at building fast single processors that dont rely on 
parallel design 
the thinking machines are known as massively parallel computers 
because they harness thousands of relatively lowpowered processors 
to work on a single problem 
the company devotes 80 percent of its effort to the software 
that permits parallel processing to occur hillis said 
i dont subscribe to the view that the japanese are inherently 
no good at software he said but he added i think its a fair 
fight and were ahead 
the thinking machines supercomputers are distinctive for their 
shape large black cubes and the panels of blinking red lights 
visible through a dusky window on one side crays machines are 
shaped like horseshoes 
under the marketing agreement announced tuesday thinking 
machines and digital will market supercomputing systems made up of 
computers from both companies selling them at discounts to as many 
as 25 universities thinking machines said 
the smaller of the two new systems the cm2a comes with either 
4096 or 8192 processors it can perform 1 billion or 2 billion 
operations a second depending on its size and costs 500000 or 
1 million 
the cm2as relatively low price makes it suited for academic 
customers that have previously not been able to afford a 
supercomputer thinking machines said first deliveries are 
scheduled for june 1989 
the more powerful system is an upgrade of the older 
64000processor cm2 it has the same number of processors but 
more internal memory prices range from 2 million to 10 million 
and first deliveries are scheduled for june 1989

four european nations will ban 
commercial flights by boeing cos new 747400 series jetliner 
unless the us company makes design changes to improve safety a 
dutch spokesman said tuesday 
in seattle boeing commercial airplanes said it would discuss 
certification with a dutch regulatory official on wednesday one 
day before the scheduled delivery of the first of 13 boeing 
747400s to klm the dutch state airliner 
transport ministry spokesman harald hameleers said boeing was 
asked to implement some minor modifications in the 400 series 
design 
we think the 747400 is a safe plane but there is always room 
for improvement he added 
hameleers said the dutch demanded modifications months ago 
in concert with civil aviation agencies in britain west germany 
and france which together form the joint airworthiness 
requirements committee 
we will not issue a full certificate of airworthiness unless 
boeing adopts our requirements hameleer said in an interview 
alain monnier an official of frances directorate general of 
civil aviation said the netherlands spoke for all four member 
countries the committee meets in paris on monday to discuss 
boeings response hameleers said 
boeing said in a statement that the company has worked hard to 
satisfy certification requirements of the fournation committee 
on a derivative 747400 airplane it said the 747400 the largest 
commercial jetliner in the world has received full certification 
from the us federal aviation administration 
a representative of the netherlands regulatory agency will meet 
with boeing to review certification of the 747400 for operation by 
klm the statement said 
the statement said boeing expected the plane would be delivered 
on schedule after those discussions 
klm expects to receive its first 747400 at amsterdams schiphol 
airport on thursday the carrier has ordered 13 of the airplanes 
costing an estimated 15 billion according to klm spokesman peter 
wellhuener 
at issue are changes in the design of floor beams supporting the 
400 series upper deck and better separation of certain electrical 
circuits said hameleers 
its nothing earthshattering but boeing has been making 
trouble on the issue hameleers said he claimed the circuitry 
changes could be made in a few hours while the floor beam 
modifications would probably require some study 
boeing spokeswoman elizabeth reese was quoted by the seattle 
times as saying that the upperdeck structure design was not part 
of the faas certification process because it is built the same as 
on previous 747 models 
wellhuener said the airline planned to use the new planes from 
early june 
the dutch carrier was to be the first european airline to fly 
the 747400 other european customers include british airways west 
germanys lufthansa and air france

as the season to spray washington state 
apple trees with alar arrives uniroyal chemical co confirmed 
tuesday that none of the controversial chemical has been purchased 
by farmers since january 
the middlebury conn company also disputed studies showing 
that over 30 percent of the nations apples contain alar a growth 
retardant that has been identified as a possible carcinogen in 
recent months 
if all 112000 pounds of alar sold to apple farmers in 1988 had 
been used at 3 pounds per acre it would have covered 76 percent 
of the nations 490000 acres of orchards said christopher exton 
a marketing manager for uniroyal 
the percentage should be even less for the 1989 crop 
sales have been zero from the beginning of february exton 
said in a telephone interview noting that demands by some 
politicians and consumer groups to remove alar from the market 
would accomplish little since none is being sold 
battered by low sales and slumping prices the apple industry is 
voluntarily backing off on alar use in an attempt to win back 
consumer confidence 
the growth regulator is sprayed on trees during the spring and 
summer and improves the color crispness and shelf life of red 
apples 
i know of no one who is planning on using it said chris 
schlect head of the northwest horticultural council in yakima i 
would be very much surprised in anybody intends to use it this 
spring 
washington produces half the nations apples and many growers 
have joined the call for an alar ban as a way to win back their 
markets 
a debate has arisen over exactly how much alar is used with the 
federal government and the industry initially contending it was 
about 5 percent and last week revising the figure to up to 15 
percent 
the cbs program 60 minutes on sunday said some studies 
indicated up to 38 percent of the crop is treated 
but exton said studies showing a high use of alar are 
statistically flawed 
alar is used to improve shelf life of stored apples so the 
number of alartreated apples is greater this time of year than 
earlier in the season exton said 
alar the marketing name for daminozide makes up less than 1 
percent of uniroyals 750 million in annual sales and sales have 
declined 75 percent since 1985 when the controversy first came to 
light exton said 
the chemical is also used on peanuts and some cherries and on 
nonedible trees and plants he said 
the controversy began when the private natural resources defense 
council issued a report in late february that concluded that 
consuming apples or apple products treated with alar increased 
cancer risk in children

black workers on tuesday 
expanded a strike protesting mobil corps failure to negotiate 
with their union prior to announcing the sale of its south african 
holdings 
the chemical workers industrial union which represents about 80 
percent of mobils 1500 black employees in south africa said 350 
workers were on strike at depots throughout the johannesburg region 
and at the ports of east london and port elizabeth 
the union had said 240 workers were involved when work stoppages 
began monday around johannesburg mobil officials confirmed the 
strike but released no details about the impact on operations 
the union plans to poll its members this week to determine if 
they support a nationwide strike against mobil because of its 
refusal to negotiate the terms of its disinvestment 
the us company announced on april 28 that it was selling its 
holdings in south africa to the general union mining corp a 
conglomerate known as gencor that owns a petroleum subsidiary 
mobil said gencor would honor all existing arrangements with the 
union but union officials said mobil had lied when it rebuffed 
previous attempts to open negotiations by insisting there were no 
plans for divestment 
jacques franken industrial relations manager for mobils south 
african operation said tuesday that the south african management 
had informed the union about the disinvestment as soon as the news 
was received from us headquarters 
the disinvestment has nothing to do with mobil south africa 
as it is the us corporation that is disinvesting he said 
the union had approached mobil and several other foreign 
companies in south africa asking for oneyear advance notice of 
any pullout guarantees of job security and disclosure of the terms 
of sale 
scores of us companies have withdrawn from south africa in the 
past five years citing economic considerations and pressure from 
the antiapartheid movement
