british ambassador harold walker has 
returned to iraq two months after his recall to britain in protest 
of the execution of londonbased journalist farzad bazoft 
a british diplomat expressed hope walkers return thursday would 
help improve ties strained by the bazoft case and british charges 
that iraq tried to import nuclearbomb triggers and parts for a 
giant gun 
his return is evidence of the british governments desire to 
rebuild dialogue with iraq and try to solve some of the outstanding 
problems between the two countries said the diplomat who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
walker returned to baghdad in time for an anticipated summit of 
arab leaders at the end of this month which will discuss among 
other things a campaign of threats to iraqs security 
iraq and other arab countries have said that the british and 
western arms allegations against iraq are a plot to deprive it of 
advanced technology and pave the way for an israeli attack on iraqi 
factories 
the british embassy in baghdad has been the site of virtually 
daily demonstrations by iraqis and arabs invited by the iraqi 
government denouncing the british position 
analysts here said the decision to send walker back was prompted 
in part by the imminent arab summit which is expected to be asked 
to take a unified position against the antiiraqi british and 
western stand 
bazoft an iranianborn reporter for the weekly observer of 
london who traveled on british papers was executed march 15 on 
charges he was an israeli spy 
he was arrested after visiting the area of an iraqi 
militaryindustrial complex where he was investigating reports of 
deaths and injuries in an explosion at the site 
iraqi authorities said bazoft was using his job as a journalist 
as a cover for espionage his newspaper vehemently denied he was a 
spy and said an alleged confession was extracted under duress

boiled elephant trunk has not been a big 
hit but crocodile tail roasted warthog and hippo burgers are 
being snapped up by tourists on the african circuit who want a menu 
as exotic as the surroundings 
tourists like to return home and boast they ate a crocodile 
its better than the other way around says jan de haast a 
director of zimbabwes sun hotel chain 
ever sensitive to tourist appetites and the revenues they 
generate hotels safari lodges and bush camps are heeding the 
call of the wild when it comes to cuisine 
hungry for a little snack safari guide garth thompson of harare 
suggests flying ants fried in fat from their own oily wings just 
like popcorn he says 
quelea a native bird smaller than a quail makes a nice 
casserole as do field mice according to thompson if thats not 
enough to make the mouth water there are the succulent 
caterpillars found on the indigenous mopani tree best when fresh 
thompson says but just fine sundried 
he also recommends spicing up the local cornmeal staple a 
porridge known as sadza with grasshopper gravy 
then theres marc cosyns the belgianborn head chef at harares 
sheraton hotel listing his menu offerings he sounds like a cross 
between julia child and wild kingdom 
his roast warthog he says a bit immodestly is very nice 
indeed the legs roasted with mint or apple sauce are 
particularly good he says 
not every wild food idea works out 
elephant trunk hotelier de haast concedes regretfully presents 
problems even for the most resourceful of chefs 
for one thing the average sixfoot trunk is tough and muscular 
takes six hours to boil and frankly isnt all that tasty for 
another few diners want to confront a pair of nostrils on their 
plate 
it just looks too unappetizing says de haast the idea 
was doomed from the beginning 
one menu standard is african antelope such as kudu and eland 
the flavor is similar to that of venison 
game meat needs only simple preparation to bring out its 
delicate taste says cosyns it can be tough so you marinate 
it first and eat it with a sauce like garlic mint bernaise or 
marsala 
little of the exotic food served up to tourists is actually 
killed in the wild however much of it is farmbred 
john white a top official of the hararebased wildlife 
producers association says the associations 460 members try to to 
conserve wildlife by breeding species like zebra waterbuck and 
white rhinoceros for food hunting or game viewing 
most game dishes sell for about the same price as ordinary fare 
although crocodile is a bit more expensive its much in demand 
though 
the pinkishwhite meat from the tails of young crocodiles 
tastes a little like lobster or maybe chicken anyway it can be 
grilled broiled or smoked and served with wild mushroom sauce 
cornmeal patties or rice 
such offerings are more popular with visitors than locals 
zimbabweans rarely eat game meat because of traditional african 
totem worship known as mutopo many wild animals are depicted 
in totem symbols 
but biltong a kind of jerky consisting of sundried 
salted and spiced impala is a popular snack throughout eastern 
and southern africa 
if all this sounds a little unappetizing harare writer sam 
munyavi says consider some of the icons of french cuisine 
escargot frogs legs 
one mans meat is another mans poison munyavi says

christian brando son of marlon brando and 
his first wife anna kashfi was a child of turbulence from his 
earliest years 
on thursday the younger brando 32 was booked for 
investigation of murder after a man identified as dag drollet 26 
was shot to death at the brando estate 
according to authorities christian brando admitted shooting 
drollet described as a boyfriend of brandos pregnant sister 
tarita cheyenne brando but said he fired the gun because of the 
way drollet was treating her 
christian brando is the son of the actor and anna kashfi an 
exoticlooking actress who played an indian girl in the 
mountain starring spencer tracy brando whose passion for 
foreign beauties became legendary wooed the girl who claimed to be 
the daughter of an indian devi kashfi 
then came reports from england that although she had been born 
in calcutta her real name was joan ocallaghan and she had an 
irish father and french mother 
anna became pregnant and brando married her in 1957 they 
separated the next year and were divorced in 1960 later he 
testified that he married her with the primary purpose of getting 
a divorce within a year 
miss kashfi was granted custody of christian but in 1965 
custody was withdrawn because a judge decreed miss kashfis 
reliance on drugs and alcohol contributed to her uncontrollable 
temper 
many of her outbursts against her exhusband resulted in 
violence witnessed by their son the court said christian then 6 
would live with marlons older sister 
brando next married mexican actress movita who had appeared 
opposite clark gable in the 1935 mutiny on the bounty he later 
said the marriage was for the purpose of giving a name to their 
son miko and the pair never lived together after his birth 
in 1960 brando was cast in the gable role of a remake of 
mutiny on the bounty his leading lady was tarita a tahitian 
beauty with whom he had two children simon teihotu and tarita 
cheyenne brando and tarita were later married 
anna kashfi continued her struggle to regain custody of 
christian in 1973 she accused brando of spiriting christian out of 
the country to avoid her lawsuit 
my son has been subjected to ridicule and embarrassment over 
the performance of his father she declared referring to the 
xrated last tango in paris her suit claimed he had played a 
sexually maladjusted and perverted person 
finally in 1974 miss kashfi canceled her lawsuit saying that 
her exhusband had cooperated in visitation rights christian then 
13 grew up under his fathers supervision attending private 
schools and keeping out of the spotlight in keeping with brandos 
tradition 
little is known about christians adult life but he was 
reported to be employed for a time as a tree surgeon and most 
recently worked as a welder

a group of eastern european filmmakers on 
their first pilgrimage to cannes is getting a closeup look at the 
glitter and hype that surround a major western film festival 
its an amazing spectacle said soviet director pavel 
lunghin his first film taxi blues is contending for the top 
award the golden palm 
my only problem is renting a tuxedo said lunghin it will 
make me look ridiculous 
amid the spectacle of cannes his selfconsciousness seems 
misplaced 
during the 12day festival ending monday cannes normal 
population of 72000 has swelled by an least 25000 
the visitors include powerful producers glamorous stars and 
dedicated fans 
the sights and sounds of the festival can be astonishing in 
their contrasts arnold schwarzenegger is mobbed by paparazzi as he 
tangos at poolside with sylvester stallone gypsies beg in front of 
posh cafes 
street performers strut in silver robocop costumes ambling 
musicians and kids selling roses compete for attention and francs 
along the sidewalks 
dozens of films are shown daily in the mammoth harborside palais 
des festivals including at least two entries in competition for 
the golden palm each evening crowds gather to salute their 
favorite stars in evening dress entering the daily gala film 
showing an elaborate dinner usually follows in a tent behind the 
palace 
among those making appearances recently were lauren bacall 
anthony quinn grace jones and dennis quaid actress anjelica 
huston daughter of late american director john huston is on the 
10member jury of the festival headed by italian director bernardo 
bertolucci 
the stars are wellprotected from pickpockets and other trouble 
police chief jeanjacques moniez has doubled the citys force to 
600 in anticipation of anything from petty crime to bomb threats 
the festival palace itself is searched every morning for explosives 
hotel rooms are scarce many journalists and film professionals 
make do with accommodations that few vacationers would tolerate 
innkeepers swear prices dont rise for the festival but with a 
vodkatonic costing about 11 at a top hotel terrace one wonders 
almost everywhere there is speculation about who will win 
prizes 
in the case of several of the 18 eastern european films at the 
festival including the interrogation from poland and the 
ear from czechoslovakia western viewers were able to see works 
that had been made many years ago 
under the nowousted communist regimes the films circulated 
privately and developed cult status 
one soviet film matj which means mother is a threehour 
20minute epic based on a maxim gorky novel a coproduction with 
soviet and italian companies directed by gleb panfilov it 
revolves around a young man who joins a socialist group during 
czarist times is imprisoned and tried for his subversive acts 
panfilov told a news conference that he started to think about 
the film before soviet reforms but was glad that the new openness 
enabled him to make it the way he wanted to 
he said the reforms have led to more soviet filmmaking 
weve gone from 150 films a year to 300 in the past two 
years he said however quantity doesnt guarantee quality

counterfeit crack cocaine made to fool 
unwary street buyers also suckered police who heralded a 12pound 
seizure of wax as the citys largest drug haul 
after the march 21 raid sheriff jim mcmillan said the seizure 
was worth more than 250000 but only four grams of cocaine were 
found in the suspected crack police said wednesday 
the actual value of the cocaine was about 400 said assistant 
state attorney john merrett 
tests revealed the cache contained 014 to 017 of an ounce of 
cocaine but police said the substance was still dangerous 
people will kill each other over one fake rock said police 
lt david sembach 
the wax had been mixed with benzocaine a topical anesthetic 
said police capt herschell connell users would have had a hard 
time smoking the mixture because the wax would have melted the 
benzocaine could have caused respiratory failure if inhaled

raid merrett said they are glenn schofield 32 charged with 
armed possession of cocaine and patricia ann reese 41 charged

an iranian accountant now living in england 
came back from the brink of disaster twice thursday to outlast a 
reno nev poker player and win the 835000 first prize in the 
world series of poker 
mansour matloubi used an anticlimatic pair of sixes on the 
final hand to top a pair of fours held by hans tuna lund and 
win the final texas holdem event in the competition that crowns 
the worlds poker champion 
the final hand win capped a remarkable comeback that saw 
matloubi playing in his first championship game twice draw the 
card he needed to stay in the game on the final draw after he had 
each time put all his chips into the pot 
i was dead matloubi said but when the chips went in 
every time i had the best hand 
lund had appeared to have the edge after 192 of the players who 
put in 10000 apiece to enter the event had lost their chips and 
only he and matloubi were left to go headtohead 
matloubi trailed by about 300000 in chips but the turning 
point came when he put all his chips in and he and lund were 
suddenly playing one hand for a 16 million pot 
with only one of the five flop cards left to be turned over 
lund appeared to be on his way to the title with a pair of aces to 
matloubis pair of 10s 
but the last card was a 10 and matloubi was not only still in 
the game he held a commanding lead that he used to whittle lund 
down until the final pair won the marathon contest 
i never thought i would win it said the 37yearold 
champion i came here basically with the intention of only 
playing in the cash games not this game 
matloubi who left iran in 1972 was an accountant in wales 
before a love for poker prompted him to turn into a professional 
player about three years ago 
it was his first time in the poker series and only his second 
trip to las vegas 
lund 39 received 334000 for finishing second 
matloubi entered thursdays final round with 403000 in chips 
the most among nine players making it to the final cut in the 
annual poker classic at binions horseshoe in downtown las vegas 
lund entered thursdays final round in eighth place in money 
rankings with 170000 in chips 
the remaining seven players were eliminated throughout the day 
thursday 
dave crunkleton 56 a salesman from dallas nc finished 
third winning 167000 
jim ward 43 anchorage alaska was fourth with 91850 
followed by 1986 world champion berry johnson 54 oklahoma city

rod peate 42 portland ore finished seventh with 50100 in 
prize money john bonetti 61 houston texas finished eighth

along with corn wheat and pork iowa is 
exporting infants to affluent couples from the coasts seeking 
country fresh babies from the heartland adoption officials say 
people in california and new york think of iowa as a field of 
babies waiting to be reaped said nancy lee ziese adoption 
supervisor for hillcrest family services a private agency in cedar 
rapids they think no one here does drugs were all the 
farmers daughter 
scores of advertisements seeking a healthy white infant 
appear in the personal columns of iowa newspapers every week 
adoption officials in the state say the ads used to arrange direct 
contacts between wealthy couples and natural mothers deprive less 
wellheeled iowans of adoption opportunities 
the ads directed at mothers promise to ease your heartache 
through this difficult time and offer a life with much 
love warmth and laughter and a lifetime of opportunities 
they tender a happily married couple stable values and 
a secure home with a large yard 
the ads allow wouldbe parents to bypass stringent adoption 
regulations and increase their odds of success according to the 
national committee for adoption in a given year 2 million 
applicants are seeking 25000 available infants 
marg corkery adoption program manager for the iowa department 
of human services said her agency tells outofstate couples we 
have people waiting in line right here in iowa 
but the agency has no control over independent adoptions 
arranged through advertisements and state figures show up to 500 
children have been adopted in the last six years by parents 
completing the legal work out of state 
andrea charlow a professor who teaches family law at drake 
university in des moines thinks prospective parents see iowa as a 
source of country fresh farm girls and farm babies 
people are turning to iowa because of their desire for white 
babies she said because 975 percent of iowa residents are white 
the chances are if someone answers your ad it would be a white 
person charlow said 
i think thats terrible a baby is not a commodity for sale 
corkery said 
mary beth seader of the national committee for adoption agreed 
advertising makes children a commodity it devalues them 
seader said couples can find howto books on adoption with 
suggestions on placing ads or searching high schools and shopping 
malls for young pregnant women 
the private adoption handbook by stanley b michelman and 
meg schneider tells prospective parents how to word advertisements 
and lists newspapers that accept adoption ads 
newspapers in other states carry such ads for example nine of 
the 11 entries in the personals section of the april 16 omaha 
neb world herald were adoption ads 
michael goldstein a new york city lawyer who has handled 
adoptions of iowaborn children for clients said adoption by ad 
gives a pregnant woman control of who rears her child allows her 
and the adoptive parents a chance to set the adoption terms and 
speeds the process 
his clients have waited an average of five to six months between 
placing an ad and bringing home a baby said goldstein who is paid 
an average of 3500 
corkery said the average waiting time for couples at her agency 
is five to eight years with no fee private agencies in iowa cited 
average fees of 5000 with waiting periods of two months to 
several years for healthy infants 
goldstein who has three adopted children likes the flexibility 
of private oneonone adoption 
the birth parent can meet with the adoptive parent if they 
choose that theyre able to have an adoptive parent present at 
birth if they want to go that far goldstein said 
he said mothers also can be assured their children will not be 
placed in foster care while the adoption clears the courts private 
agencies said temporary foster arrangements can last several weeks 
to a year 
birth mothers have rejected the agencies goldstein said 
they dont give the mothers the options that birth mothers are 
looking for

the united states in a bow to the lessened 
threat of war in europe is dropping its longstanding but rarely 
met demand that nato allies hike defense budgets by 3 percent a 
year above inflation 
the decision is expected to be ratified next week at a meeting 
of nato defense ministers in brussels pentagon sources said 
thursday 
europe is being transformed said the senior official who 
spoke of the decision on condition of anonymity basically its 
a statement of reality 
few countries met the target in recent years given the shift 
toward improved relations with the soviet union adopted by many 
western european democracies even before the fall of the berlin 
wall in november 1989 
the policy reversal comes as north atlantic treaty organization 
members begin a major review of the pacts military and political 
strategy in light of the evaporation of its longtime foe the 
sovietled warsaw pact 
president bush called for the reassessment when he suggested a 
meeting of nato leaders which will be held in london during the 
first week of july 
nato defense and foreign ministers have scheduled a series of 
meetings to prepare for the summit and evaluate the alliances 
strategy as well as its conventional and nuclear weapons policies 
although the decision to drop the budget target apparently was 
being readied for announcement at next weeks meeting in brussels 
the pentagon released the information in a written statement 
thursday afternoon in response to a reporters query 
given the changes in european security requirements we are no 
longer asking our allies to increase their defense budgets by 3 
percent the statement said 
instead of meeting the longstanding spending target the 
statement said the united states is asking that the allies 
contribute to the military force structure required by the nato 
military command 
the spending target stated in terms of real or 
inflationadjusted spending was set under president carter in 
1977 primarily in response to congressional demands that the 
wealthy nations of europe take up more of the burden of their own 
defense 
from 1980 through 1986 growth in real us defense outlays 
exceeded 3 percent each year peaking at a 9 percent increase from 
1984 to 1985 but since then there has been little growth and 
outlays are expected to decline by 6 percent in real terms this 
year 
defense secretary dick cheney has projected a 2 percent annual 
decline through the mid1990s and many influential congressional 
figures have called for much steeper declines 
a pentagon study released last month showed that only six nato 
nations denmark greece italy luxembourg portugal and turkey 
boosted their spending in 1988 by 3 percent or more 
the same review showed that besides the united states only four 
of the 15 members of natos military alliance canada luxembourg 
norway and spain met or exceeded the 3 percent goal on average 
for the 19781989 period in that period us defense spending grew 
by about 5 percent per year averaging the large pre1986 increases 
with the nearstagnation after 1986 
even though the pentagon made the announcement outside the 
normal nato setting defense officials who insisted on anonymity 
insisted the decision was an alliance one 
normally the alliance takes great pains to portray its 
decisionmaking as taking place amid much consultation 
one pentagon source said the last formal reference to the 3 
percent target was made at last springs defense ministers session 
in brussels the nato headquarters 
following that meeting the allies decided to review their 
security requirements and the 3 percent goal was scheduled for 
review at the next defense ministers meeting in brussels next 
tuesday and wednesday 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said he believed the united states had not expected its 
allies to meet the 3 percent goal since 1981 when ronald reagan 
became president the decision is not hot news he said 
sen john warner rva ranking minority member of the 
committee said the decision was a very pragmatic move in light 
of receding threat of the warsaw pact 
cheney has argued repeatedly that the united states cannot allow 
its defense budget to fall precipitously amid the changes in the 
soviet union and europe warning that the move toward more liberal 
systems could be reversed 
only last month cheneys annual report to congress assessing 
the defense spending of nato nations and japan faulted luxembourg 
denmark and canada for below par contributions to the common 
defense 
these nations have by and large relatively prosperous 
economies and relatively high standards of living yet devote 
relatively small proportions of their resources to defense the 
report complained

a threejudge federal panel on thursday 
upheld the authority of the us army corps of engineers to 
determine the level of discharges from a missouri river reservoir 
in south dakota and north dakota 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals panel overturned a lower 
court order that releases from the oahe reservoir be reduced as 
had been requested by the droughtstricken states 
the appeals panel said it had serious reservations about whether 
courts have jurisdiction over such decisions by the corps in a 
brief order the panel said it would spell out its legal reasoning 
later in a formal opinion 
the tugofwar over water rights pitted the corps and the states 
of iowa nebraska kansas and missouri against north dakota south 
dakota and montana over whether water flow should be reduced from 
the reservoir which stretches from pierre sd to near bismarck 
nd 
us district judge patrick conmy in bismarck had ordered the 
corps to reduce the discharges by onethird until june 1 so the 
hatch of walleye pike could be completed in the 232mile long 
reservoir the appeals panel granted an emergency stay of that 
order last friday 
the corps said the lower water level would threaten barge 
traffic between sioux city iowa and st louis a 730mile 
shipping channel and also would jeopardize two species of birds 
protected by the endangered species act

hopes of easy congressional passage of major 
civil rights legislation for the disabled faded on a house vote 
that critics say shows the triumph of fear over fact about aids 
by a 199187 vote the house approved an amendment thursday that 
lets employers reassign workers with contagious diseases to 
prevent them from handling food 
the vote came despite lastminute opposition to the amendment by 
the bush administration both sides agreed during debate that the 
amendment refers mainly to people with aids which spreads through 
sexual contact or other exchange of bodily fluids or by sharing 
hypodermic needles 
even supporters of the amendment said they were responding to 
what they believed were public misconceptions about aids and not 
what medical evidence has shown that casual contact does not 
spread the disease 
perception is reality said rep charles g douglas iii 
rnh we run election campaigns on perceptions its reality to 
our voters 
douglas had introduced the amendment to the americans with 
disabilities act in the house judiciary committee where it was 
defeated rep jim chapman jr dtexas offered it on the house 
floor 
approval of the amendment means the bill must go to a conference 
committee to be reconciled with a senatepassed version backers 
had expected to avoid that because the house and senate versions 
were nearly identical 
douglas said restaurateurs know the medical truth about aids 
but dont trust their customers 
we understand that you cant get aids because the cook cuts 
his finger and bleeds into the roast beef when hes preparing it 
he said but the customers out there may not buy that and when 
they all leave and the restaurant goes out of business what have 
you done for the restaurants of america now youve put everybody 
that works there out of business 
the amendment was sought by the national restaurant association 
and the national federation of independent business 
opponents of the amendment argued that the same logic was used 
to fight equal employment opportunity for blacks a quartercentury 
ago rep steny h hoyer dmd chief sponsor of the bill called 
the change the jim crow amendment of 1990 
we ought to act on fact not on perception hoyer said 
the amendment is not about the reality of contagious disease 
it is about the fear of contagious disease said rep james a 
mcdermott dwash a medical doctor lets be honest its about 
the fear of aids this is what happens when you make public policy 
on the basis of fear and ignorance 
the disabilities act which cleared the senate in september on a 
768 vote aims to guarantee the rights of an estimated 43 million 
disabled people to equal employment access to stores restaurants 
and other commercial establishments transportation and 
telecommunications service 
the bill has been hailed as the most significant piece of civil 
rights legislation since the 1964 civil right act which opened 
opportunities to blacks other minorities and women 
the white house has endorsed the bill despite its objections to 
certain provisions hoyer said he was disappointed that the 
administration did not take a stronger stand on the aids amendment 
he said the measure would have been defeated had the white house 
acted sooner however 79 of hoyers fellow democrats voted for the 
amendment while 31 republicans voted against it 
the administration position came thursday in a letter to house 
speaker thomas s foley from health and human services secretary 
louis sullivan 
food service workers infected with hiv human immunodeficiency 
virus which causes aids need not be restricted from work unless 
they have other infections or illnesses for which any food service 
worker should be restricted sullivan said 
since the act limits coverage for persons who pose a direct 
threat to others relaxing the antidiscrimination protection for 
food service workers is not needed or justified in terms of the 
protection of the public health he added 
the amendment says theres a prejudice out there and lets 
pander to it said frank mccloskey dind he invoked the memory 
of ryan white the indiana youth who recently died as a result of 
aids acquired through a blood transfusion 
debate on the bill resumes tuesday

we want to be able to stand on our own two 
feet were tired of being dominated by foreigners 
well now who spoke those words 
the list of potential candidates is long this is after all a 
leavemealone era a time when ethnicity tribal identity and a 
yearning for selfdetermination seem to outweigh everything else 
especially ideology 
there arent many lithuanians latvians or estonians these days 
who believe that socialist solidarity is an acceptable excuse 
for remaining part of the soviet union 
they want to run their own lives free of outside control the 
same holds true for many armenians azerbaijanis georgians and 
moldavians in 1989 eastern europeans showed what they thought of 
two generations of unelected sovietbacked marxist rule 
how about palestinians in the israelioccupied territories or 
the more than 20 million disenfranchised black south africans they 
have shown time and again the desire to shape their own destiny 
for a change 
it is a sentiment that extends to people as diverse as quebecers 
and kurds lebanese muslims know the feeling and so do eritreans 
the concept of national selfdetermination has turned the political 
map of africa upside down over the past generation the last of the 
continents colonies namibia became independent just two months 
ago 
it is an issue over which rivers of blood have been spilled 
george washington was motivated by it so was ho chi minh 
the united states itself has been both a proponent and a target 
of this kind of sentiment independence from the united states has 
been a major rallying cry of the cuban revolution and of some 
nicaraguan and panamanian nationalists many puerto ricans albeit 
a minority yearn for nationhood for their island 
so who did say those words 
they were uttered recently in the philippines before mondays 
start of talks on whether the united states will continue its 
4decadeold military presence in the philippines 
the speaker was socorro diokno chairman of the antibases 
coalition the issue is a quest for finding out who we are 
diokno declared can the filipino stand on his feet without 
having to rely on america 
the philippines of course is not a classic case of unfettered 
imperialism the leadership is elected and there is popular 
sentiment for working out an agreement with the united states 
because the subic bay naval base and clark air base mean about 1 
billion annually to the philippines economy more than a quarter 
of a million filipinos depend on the bases for their livelihood 
but the loudest voices lately have been those who advocate that 
the 40000 americans working in baserelated activities be sent 
home 
we will not stop until us imperialism has been finally 
driven from our shores the communist new peoples army said in a 
statement tuesday after confirming that it had assassinated two 
american servicemen on the eve of the talks 
dissidents within the philippines armed forces have vowed to 
take military action against the bases if the americans refuse to 
vacate them 
the sentiment against the bases is so vocal that the philippines 
government cannot ignore it the sessions thus far between the two 
countries ostensibly military allies have been acrimonious 
the respective delegates have been arguing over how large the 
us economic aid shortfall is the united states says its 96 
million and the philippines figure is 222 million 
things are such that the mood between manila and washington is 
focused less on asian security than on price and pride as a 
recent report by a house armed services subcommittee put it 
the issue may drag on for a while the current usfilipino 
military base agreement expires in september 1991 president bush 
wants to keep the bases but adds if were not wanted there 
were not going to be there

the house agriculture committee is accepting 
budget limits and voting to freeze target prices for crop subsidies 
in the 1990 farm bill starting with cotton and rice 
chairman kika de la garza dtexas called the move thursday 
painful but said the committee had no choice 
there had to be some serious surgical intervention he said 
the committee vote follows several days of meetings among 
agriculture subcommittee chairmen and ranking republicans who have 
been looking for ways to cut back on promises made earlier when the 
legislation was going through the subcommittees 
what we do here will affect the other commodities rep dan 
glickman dkan chairman of the subcommittee on wheat soybeans 
and feed grains said before the committee voted 
glickman said the committee was feeling pressure from throughout 
congress to avoid new spending in the farm bill its an attitude 
that we are going to be a little more under siege than before he 
said 
the freeze on cotton and rice target prices applies to all five 
years of the farm bill 
currently target prices for cotton and rice are higher than 
market prices which means the government must pay the farmer the 
difference this has been the case during the last five years 
the cotton target price is 729 cents a pound last years 
market price was 556 cents a pound the market figures for this 
year are not yet available 
the rice target price is 1071 per hundred pounds compared 
with last years market price of 683 
de la garza said he hoped the action was not misconstrued as 
lack of support for the farmer 
we are committed to enhance farm income he said noting 
that the battle over the farm bill was not over he also indicated 
that the marketplace was a better place to improve income than the 
government 
de la garza has said many times however that the committee 
could not go to the house floor with a bill that was over budget 
all in all this is a major improvement said john campbell 
deputy undersecretary of agriculture we are pleased that they 
are moving in this direction 
the bush administration wants a freeze on all target prices 
the senate agriculture committee is still working on its target 
price programs the democratic majority has presented a plan to the 
republicans that calls for a 1 percent increase in 1991 to be 
continued through the life of the bill 
the democrats also have proposed tying increases in the last 
four years of the bill to the consumer price index under the plan 
the agriculture secretary would be able to reduce that increase by 
four percentage points if he so chose

villagers waving palm fronds welcome him 
as a savior rebel pamphlets call him the hope of liberia the 
bureaucrat turned guerrilla leader says he is a godfearing baptist 
who will not become another african dictator 
useducated rebel leader charles taylor is still wanted in 
massachusetts for breaking out of a jail to avoid extradition to 
liberia but says he wants better relations with the united states 
taylor presented himself at his first international news 
conference this week as a friend of the capitalist west a leader 
who can restore democracy honest government pride and christian 
values to a nation destroyed by 10 years of corrupt rule under 
president samuel doe 
but taylor said his plans for democracy do not include elections 
for at least three and maybe five years until then he said he will 
go to hell rather than share power with other opposition 
leaders who have not joined his fight against doe 
dont think we are going to turn government over to someone to 
screw up taylor said 
pointing to his ragtag group of armed guerrillas most wearing 
jeans and tshirts he added we have political ambitions too 
taylor invited nine foreign journalists to tapeta in the heart 
of rebelheld territory about 100 miles northeast of monrovia the 
capital reporters were driven to an americanowned rubber 
plantation in rebel hands just 45 miles east of monrovia to 
dramatize taylors threats that he will attack the city soon 
taylors promises of elections in a few years are similar to 
pledges that have led to dictatorships in other african countries 
including liberia doe promised democracy when as an army master 
sergeant he seized power in a bloody 1980 coup toppling an elite 
group of descendants of freed american slaves who founded liberia 
in 1847 
at the time of the coup taylor said he had been chairman for 10 
years of the usbased national liberian liberation movement that 
helped doe overthrow president william tolbert 
that boy was supposed to return his little self to the 
barracks and he reneged said taylor referring to doe 
taylor said he was inducted into does army as a major in 1980 
and placed in charge of a bureau that disbursed government funds 
he said he fled to the united states later because of disagreements 
with doe who accused him of stealing 1 million 
he was arrested in boston and held for extradition to liberia in 
1984 but escaped from jail and still is wanted in massachusetts 
he did not appear to be troubled by that 
i skipped from jail to escape does lies he said adding he 
believed all charges will be dropped 
taylor said his national patriotic front of liberia has 
constantly sought contacts with the us government until recently 
a strong supporter of doe 
the united states has permanent interests in liberia and not 
permanent friends i would hope that we would have a real good 
marriage and a real good honeymoon taylor said 
the bearded rebel leader who has a degree in economics from 
bentley college in waltham mass described himself as a 
diehard capitalist and churchgoing christian whose few 
vices include occasionally enjoying a good cigar 
he says does rule has led liberians to break with their 
traditional christian values 
before liberians were interested in school in church 
nobody thinks of going to church any more everybody talks of 
ritualistic killings he said 
taylor wears two woven juju amulets around his neck aides 
refused to comment on them rebels who wore similar magic charms 
said they were protection against bullets 
many liberians believe in black magic recently former defense 
minister gray allison was sentenced to death and his wife 
angeline to life imprisonment for a ritual murder aimed at 
empowering them to topple doe 
as a civilian taylor insists he is different from doe who made 
his career in the military he says he is leading a grassroots 
civilian uprising to get rid of a dictator but harbors no 
dictatorial ambitions himself 
it is so easy to make a dictator in liberia and i am not 
going to permit myself to be one he said

military stonewalling and lying 
obstruct prosecution of the slayings of six jesuit priests their 
housekeeper and her daughter according to foreign sources 
following the case 
the bush administration says the outcome of the case will be a 
major factor in future relations washington provides more than 1 
million a day in aid to el salvador more than to any other country 
in the western hemisphere 
judge ricardo zamora has been handling the case since shortly 
after the bodies of the six educators and two women were found nov 
16 at their central american university residence 
zamora says there is not yet enough evidence to try the four 
army officers and four soldiers in custody a ninth defendant is a 
fugitive 
president alfredo cristiani says there may not be enough 
evidence to convict col guillermo benavides charged with ordering 
the assassinations benavides headed the military college from 
where the detail that killed the jesuits set out 
the slayings came five days after leftist rebels launched their 
biggest offensive of a 10yearold civil war the right had long 
considered the six jesuits marxists 
benavides is the highestranking officer ever indicted on human 
rights charges only one other officer has been indicted and he 
has yet to stand trial 
between 40 and 60 men took part in the killings and several 
more likely knew about it soon afterward but no military man has 
voluntarily come forward to testify 
its total stonewalling said a source very close to the 
case who refused to be identified further it demonstrates 
eloquently the militarys willingness to close ranks 
a european diplomat whose country has helped in the 
investigation said what were dealing with is omerta a 
reference to the sicilian mafias code of silence he and other 
diplomats also refused to be identified further 
the salvadoran armed forces the us embassy and a us 
congressional panel agree someone is lying 
earlier this year us army maj eric buckland who was 
attached to the embassy informed his superiors that a salvadoran 
colonel had told him benevides was responsible 
the embassy confronted the salvadoran militarys chiefofstaff 
with the allegation and named col carlos aviles as the informant 
aviles later denied telling buckland that benavides was 
responsible 
both aviles and buckland failed lie detector tests neither has 
been questioned by judge zamora and buckland has been transferred 
out of el salvador 
three lieutenants have admitted their participation in the 
massacre in testimony given jan 1314 to ustrained 
investigators two of those officers told of an explicit order from 
benavides to kill the jesuits 
the case against benavides is particularly weak the colonel has 
been implicated only by codefendants the two lieutenants in 
salvadoran law testimony from a codefendant is inadmissable 
all three lieutenants reneged on earlier testimony when taken 
before zamora jan 16 
cristiani and defense minister humberto larios have pledged full 
support for the investigation 
several members of the military commission of honor appointed by 
cristiani in january to investigate the murders have testified 
before zamora 
the head of the special investigative unit a separate 
policeled body told us lawmakers the honor commission 
questioned implicated soldiers who confessed 
that ostensibly was what permitted cristiani on jan 13 to name 
the nine alleged culprits 
but the honor board members who have appeared in court this week 
said they limited themselves to reviewing evidence and to simply 
telling the soldiers to tell the truth 
the us congressional task force said in an april 30 report 
neither us nor salvadoran officials with whom the task force 
spoke could explain how president cristiani was able to announce 
the names of those to be charged if those names were not 
provided to him by the honor board and yet the honor board denies 
doing anything of the kind 
among the us task force findings all information provided 
to the honor board by any of the soldiers involved should be 
available to the judge and the prosecution instead there is 
currently no record of its actions and no admission on the part of 
the honor board that it gathered any information at all this is 
not credible and in a serious investigation not acceptable 
the court has been told that military college log books which 
reportedly were reviewed by the special investigative unit and the 
honor board have been lost 
there are people in highlevel political and military realms 
who are blocking this case said another diplomat whose 
principal occupation for the past six months has been the jesuit 
investigation

the chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee says senate adoption of a bill to combat chemical and 
biological weapons puts the united states in the forefront of 
countries fighting the deadly weapons 
this puts us firmly on record in favor of a strong us policy 
against the use and proliferation of chemical and biological 
weapons sen claiborne pell dri said thursday night shortly 
after passage 
by a 920 vote the senate approved the legislation that 
requires us sanctions against countries that violate 
international agreements against the use of chemical and biological 
weapons 
the overwhelming vote came despite the threat of a possible veto 
by president bush the measure was sent to a conference for 
compromising with a version passed earlier by the house 
the legislation also comes as the united states and soviet union 
are negotiating cuts in the superpower stockpiles of chemical 
weapons and reductions in strategic and conventional forces 
but lawmakers said they are concerned about the proliferation of 
the weapons among third world countries 
its clear that the inhibition against the use of chemical 
weapons is slipping pell said 
the legislation which had bipartisan support was prompted by 
the use of chemical weapons in the iraniraq war and iraqs use of 
the weapons last year against its kurdish minority 
in addition iraqi president saddam hussein has vowed to use 
chemical weapons against israel in retaliation if his country is 
attacked 
many months ago i said that the evil genie of chemical 
weapons is already out of the bottle said senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas its even more critical today that we 
do everything we can to see that the genie does not spread its 
poison more widely 
the bill says that as many as 20 nations are capable of 
producing chemical weapons and that by the year 2000 at least 15 
developing countries will have the ability to produce ballistic 
missiles capable of delivering the weapons 
the sanctions in the bill would call for a cutoff of arms sales 
an embargo on imports from violating countries an end to credit 
guarantees from the exportimport bank a halt to financial 
assistance from us banks and an end to military and economic 
assistance 
the sanctions would apply to countries as well as foreign 
companies that help the nations get the chemical and biological 
weapons 
administration officials said they would recommend a veto of the 
senate legislation because it would limit the presidents ability 
to conduct foreign policy 
senators who did not vote on final passage were william 
armstrong rcolo phil gramm rtexas gordon humphrey rvt 
james jeffords rvt joseph lieberman dconn don nickles

efforts to slow the spread of nuclear weapons 
technologies are likely to fail unless the united states and other 
nuclearcapable nations stop adding to their own arsenals says a 
former us arms negotiator 
gerard c smith director of the arms control and disarmament 
agency in the nixon administration and a former chief us 
negotiator at the strategic arms limitation talks said the nuclear 
nations should accept a freeze on their own nuclear testing and 
deployments as well as production of nuclear arms materials 
if the majority of nations are to be expected indefinitely to 
forgo nuclear arms should not nations already deploying them 
also accept some constraints especially now that the cold war is 
over smith told the house foreign affairs subcommittee on arms 
control and international security on thursday 
meantime late thursday the senate approved 920 and sent to a 
conference with the house a bill aimed at halting the proliferation 
of chemical and biological weapons 
the measure which has drawn a veto threat from the white house 
would require sanctions against countries that use the weapons and 
against foreign companies that help the countries get them 
we have learned anew in recent years of the ghastly and 
indisputable horror of the use of chemical weapons in violation of 
international law said sen claiborne pell dri chairman of 
the foreign relations committee we must not apply a lesser 
standard against chemical weapons use than the use of nuclear 
weapons 
president bush opposes the bill on the ground it would limit his 
authority to conduct foreign policy 
in addition the administration opposes a total ban on nuclear 
weapons testing it is negotiating with moscow on ways to verify an 
existing but unratified ban on underground nuclear tests the two 
sides are hoping to announce an agreement on verification during 
the superpower summit that begins may 30 
the administration also is against banning all future nuclear 
arms deployments although it is pursuing a strategic arms 
reduction treaty to reduce us and soviet longrange nuclear 
missile arsenals by about onethird 
in addition to the five declared nuclear powers the united 
states the soviet union britain france and china smith said 
israel pakistan and india are believed to have nuclear weapons 
capability south africa argentina and brazil are believed to be 
on the threshold of developing the capability he said 
any of these nations could bring on a major crisis by testing 
deploying or threatening to use nuclear weapons smith said 
he said the us government has perpetuated a misconception that 
the 1968 nonproliferation treaty aimed at limiting the nuclear 
club to the five declared powers is working the treaty is due 
to expire in march 1995 an international review of the 140nation 
pact is to begin this summer in geneva 
david albright senior staff scientist at the federation of 
american scientists an arms control advocacy group told the panel 
that even some signatories to the treaty such as iraq libya 
taiwan and north korea may be attempting secretly to gain nuclear 
weapons 
smith also urged that the bush administration negotiate a ban on 
production of plutonium and other nuclear weapons materials 
albright concurred saying a halt would limit the number of weapons 
that could be built and prevent nations without such materials from 
producing any weapons at all 
the administration told congress last year that it opposed such 
a ban

chinas top leader says he has no regrets 
about the way troops handled prodemocracy demonstrators in 
tiananmen square mowing down hundreds of protesters last june 
communist party chief jiang zemin also said the wests anger 
over the killings was like much ado about nothing 
jiang spoke in an interview with barbara walters to be aired 
tonight on abctvs 2020 program his decision to grant the 
interview his first with a foreign television reporter since he 
assumed office last june appeared aimed at dissuading the united 
states from revoking trade concessions for china 
president bush who imposed some economic sanctions against 
china to protest the crackdown has until june 3 to decide whether 
to extend chinas mostfavorednation or mfn status by one year 
mfn which is granted to most us trading partners reduces 
tariffs significantly on exports to this country 
bush said wednesday that while he did not want to send a signal 
to beijing that he approves of the governments human rights 
record removing mfn would adversely affect hong kong the british 
colony that funnels 70 percent of chinas exports to the united 
states 
in the interview jiang warned that revoking chinas trade 
concessions would work against the interests of our two 
countries and those of the entire southeast asian region i 
hope that the us government would consider this matter from a 
longterm perspective he said 
jiang who was handpicked by the countrys retired leader deng 
xiaoping as his successor after the tiananmen square killings said 
he doesnt have any regret about the way in which we dealt with 
the events which took place last year in beijing 
but he added chinese leaders learn by our mistakes so 
similar demonstrations in the future may be handled with nonlethal 
force we have made adequate preparations in terms of 
strengthening the police force and storing of nonlethal weapons 
he said 
nonetheless jiang said he would not brook any opposition to 
socialism and would combat bourgeois liberalization 
china is not opposed to everything about capitalism however he 
said we want to learn from the knowhow and even buy knowhow 
from western countries he said 
providing a rare glimpse of the internal workings of chinas 
aging leadership jiang conceded there were different opinions 
within the top chinese leadership and that was the crucial point 
in the decision to resort to lethal force to quell the protest 
when the hardliners triumphed the communist partys secretary 
general zhao ziyang was deposed for supporting the protesters 
jiang said that at the start of the student unrest in april 
1989 had we adopted resolute measures for example by declaring 
a ban on assembly in tiananmen square then it would have been 
easier for us to deal with the problem at a later stage 
jiang was mayor of shanghai at the time and he said he dealt 
with protesters there by persuasion rather than force 
after the beijing crackdown he said some kind of 
misunderstanding lack of understanding or even notsofriendly 
attitudes towards china occurred in the west 
therefore to give you a chinese proverb i would say its 
like much ado about nothing he said 
outside estimates of the number of demonstrators killed have 
ranged from 700 to thousands 
jiang said no protesters were executed as a direct result of the 
tiananmen events even though chinas official press reported 20 
executions 
he said 431 people are still in detention in connection with 
their activities in the prodemocracy movement among them 42 
students 
according to unofficial estimates 10000 or 15000 people were 
detained after the tiananmen killings although many have since 
been released last week china announced it had released 211 
prisoners including several prominent academics

lawmakers removed a major obstacle in their 
drive to provide emergency aid for nicaragua and panama by 
stripping an abortion provision that president bush had threatened 
to veto 
today housesenate negotiators trying to iron out differences 
in a supplemental appropriation bill planned to tackle the last 
part of the legislation defense spending 
but negotiators dropped a senatepassed provision that would 
have allowed the district of columbia to use local tax dollars to 
pay for abortions for poor women 
even though bush desperately wants congress to hurry up on the 
package that contains 420 million for panama and 300 million for 
nicaragua he vowed to veto the money bill if it contained the 
abortion provision the president vetoed a similar abortion measure 
last year 
in a flurry of dealmaking lawmakers abandoned the abortion 
provision along with a republicansponsored measure that would have 
permitted use of the death penalty for drugrelated murders in the 
district of columbia 
sen brock adams dwash sponsor of the abortion provision 
said the issue was gone but not forgotten we will be back to 
pass prochoice legislation he said weve got the votes 
while aid to nicaragua and panama are the centerpieces of the 
money bill it is full of extra provisions and porkbarrel projects 
that total 33 billion 
all week administration officials have prodded congress to move 
on the supplemental bill 
former house speaker jim wright dtexas joined the chorus on 
thursday 
when i retired from congress last year i vowed i would never 
lobby or harass my old colleagues about anything he said in a 
letter to house minority leader robert michel rill 
please indulge me one exception it involves an area in which 
ive had a consuming interest latin america wright said he 
said it was extremely important for congress to act as 
swiftly as possible on the nicaraguapanama aid 
bush has said that new nicaraguan president violeta chamorro 
urgently needs the money because her country is bankrupt and has 
been rocked by antigovernment strikes 
once negotiators have reached final agreement the spending 
package must be approved by the full house and senate 
and the money cannot be spent in central america until a 
separate authorization bill is passed by the house debate is set 
for monday 
among the host of items in the spending bill are 110 million 
for the 1990 census about 162 million for the head start program 
for poor children 400 million in housing loans for israel to 
build homes for soviet emigres 45 million for peru and bolivia 
705 million for the food stamp program 10 million for natural 
disasters 5 million for children in cambodia and roughly 60 
million for flood control 
conferees removed 10 million proposed for a us embassy in 
lithuania 
there was friction between the house and some senators over the 
amount of free mail house members have sent this year 
the house postage account will be about 44 million in the red 
by the end of the year lawmakers said rep vic fazio dcalif 
asked and senators conditionally agreed to let the house use 
25 million in unspent funds from an operations fund to help make 
up the postage deficit 
sen don nickles rokla said the house should reform its mail 
system 
the houses refusal to disclose each members mass mail costs 
has resulted in a taxpayerfunded mass mail frenzy in the house to 
which no individual member is held accountable he said

new jerseys legislature has passed the 
nations toughest ban on assault weapons despite intense pressure 
from hundreds of vocal gun supporters 
some of the bill opponents apparently smashed a window in the 
assembly chamber during the debate thursday assembly leaders said 
it was broken inadvertently and national rifle association 
lobbyist richard manning took a collection to pay for the damage 
california is the only other state to ban assault weapons 
supporters of the new jersey bill said this ban would be tougher 
because it would not exempt current owners of the weapons 
gov jim florio praised the bill and promised to sign it as 
early as next week the state senate approved the bill 2117 the 
assembly passed it 4333 after nearly five hours of debate 
the state can take a great amount of pride that we will have 
the strongest such law on the books in the nation said florio 
surrounded by democratic lawmakers at a news conference 
everyone has the right to be safe and secure on the street and 
in their homes florio said these military weapons are 
specifically designed to go out and kill as many people as possible 
as quickly as possible 
the bills supporters said assault weapon possession had no 
justification in peacetime but gun lovers said the measure was an 
affront to arms provisions in the us constitution 
a plateglass window also was broken early thursday morning at 
the toms river legislative office shared by state sen john russo 
assemblywoman marlene lynch ford and assemblyman john paul doyle 
all democrats and strong supporters of the bill 
the dover township police said the lawmakers may have been the 
target of vandalism by gun supporters 
in trenton gun supporters rallied outside the statehouse annex 
swarmed around lawmakers following morning committee meetings and 
loudly chanted against florio the bill and its sponsors in the 
halls 
youre not going to intimidate us responded assemblyman 
michael adubato you make me sad and angry 
under the bill owners of assault firearms would have a year to 
sell them outofstate or surrender them to police 
collectors would be able to keep their weapons if they rendered 
them inoperable by removing firing pins or bolts target shooters 
would be allowed to keep their weapons if they could prove they 
were used in target competitions the bill would require these gun 
owners to register the weapons every two years 
those arrested for illegally possessing the firearms would face 
three to five years in jail and a fine of up to 7500 
supporters of the bill said it was drafted in response to the 
murder of five children and the wounding of 30 others by an assault 
weaponwielding gunman at an elementary school in stockton calif 
in january 1989 
how can anyone in good conscience wait for such a tragedy 
before we decide to act said sen daniel j dalton it could 
happen here 
opponents of the bill said it is too restrictive and costly for 
target shooters and collectors they said the bill was a misguided 
attempt to stem the use of such weapons by criminals who wont 
respect the law 
the people youre going after the drug dealers youre not 
going to do a thing to them said sen raymond zane youre 
going after lawabiding citizens

first lady wants to go there ms perez said 
the two first ladies will travel together to wellesley on the 
second day of their husbands fourday summit at the white house 
and camp david md 
some 150 students at wellesley onequarter of the graduating

president bush says he wants a bill that would 
eliminate bias in the american workplace but not one that would 
usher in hiring quotas and end up as some lawyers bonanza 
we can and will make america open and equal to all bush 
said thursday at a ceremony in the rose garden 
i want to sign a civil rights bill but i will not sign a 
quota bill he told an audience gathered to honor the us 
commission on civil rights 
on capitol hill the major civil rights bill before the senate 
gained support from two republicans and six democrats after 
sponsors bowed to critics in the business community and softened it 
a bit they said the move should put to rest concern that the 
measure might bring in hiring quotas 
but sen orrin hatch rutah said the changes would not solve 
the problem the white house said it was withholding judgment 
the bill is designed to overcome six supreme court decisions on 
job discrimination last year provisions range from a ban on racial 
harassment in the workplace to procedures aimed at making it easier 
to win lawsuits against employers in hiring discrimination cases 
we will leave nothing to chance and no stone unturned as we 
work to advance americas civil rights agenda bush said 
we will tolerate no barriers no bias no inside tracks no 
twotiered system and no rungless ladders 
attorney general dick thornburgh threatened last month to 
recommend a veto of the bill he told the house judiciary committee 
this week that changes being made in the measure were for the good 
but he stopped short of support 
bush met with civil rights leaders and others three times this 
week in an effort to reach agreement on the legislation 
he said thursday that the law must obliterate consideration 
of race color religion sex or national origin from hiring and 
he said it should protect against harassment in the workplace 
based on race sex religion or disability and should ensure a 
speedy end to such discriminatory practices 
our civil rights laws however should not be turned into some 
lawyers bonanza encouraging litigation at the expense of 
conciliation mediation or settlement the president added 
benjamin hooks jr executive director of the naacp joined 
senators in announcing the changes in the bill he said it was a 
very happy day because it would end the question of quotas which 
he said had become a bugaboo 
the bill would expand the ability of minorities to win monetary 
damages for job discrimination it also would force employers named 
in lawsuits to either end discriminatory hiring practices or prove 
that they constituted a business necessity 
proving business necessity in such cases had been up to 
employers for 18 years before a supreme court decision last year 
that put the burden on those who claimed to be victims of 
discrimination 
as initially introduced the bill would have required to 
employers to prove that discriminatory practices were essential 
to job performance 
the revised version would require only proof that such practices 
had a substantial and demonstrable relationship to effective job 
performance 
a house committee made the same change two weeks ago at the 
urging of rep augustus hawkins dcalif 
becoming sponsors following the change were sens john c 
danforth rmo john heinz rpa lloyd bentsen dtexas charles 
s robb dva daniel k akaka dhawaii bob graham dfla jay 
rockefeller dwva and harry reid dnev 
danforth said he thought bush eventually would sign the bill 
but he said he was prepared to vote to override a presidential veto 
sen edward m kennedy dmass told the news conference that 
the senate would pass the measure within a month he said the 
house is on a similar course and now the white house seems to be 
too 
hatch however issued a statement saying the amendment in no 
way solves the severe quota problem in the bill 
bush and his advisers are too smart to be taken in by this new 
language the right of employers to hire the most qualified 
employees ought to be maintained hatch added

a twotime killer who shot a louisiana state 
trooper to death was executed early friday despite international 
outcries that he was nearly mentally retarded and a mere teenager 
at the time of the crime 
dalton prejean who had won 10 previous delays of scheduled 
executions was pronounced dead in the state electric chair at 
1221 am cdt 
the us supreme court voted 72 thursday night to deny a stay 
for prejean 
warden john whitley said prejean had been relatively calm 
throughout the day 
prejeans execution was the nations third in 24 hours texas 
and missouri each executed killers early thursday his death was 
the 128th in the nation and the 19th in louisiana since capital 
punishment resumed in 1977 
there were two small protests prior to prejeans execution one 
by death penalty opponents outside the governors mansion in baton 
rouge and another by supporters outside the penitentiarys main 
gate 
earlier gov buddy roemer said he would not stop the execution 
twice in the past year roemer rejected his own handpicked pardon 
boards recommendations that he commute the sentence to life in 
prison 
im never happy with these things but i do not as a 
representative of the people have a choice said roemer 
prejean 30 acknowledged he shot the trooper but said it would 
not serve justice to execute him 
not since the earliest of executions has a pending death 
sentence brought so much protest 
defense lawyers said prejean had an iq of 71 barely above 
retardation doctors said he suffered brain damage as a child 
apparently at the hands of an abusive aunt who raised him 
i doubt that in documented recent world history there is an 
execution that has such a pile of reasons not to do it said 
steve herrick southern regional director for amnesty international 
he took part in a protest on the steps of the capitol in baton 
rouge where a dozen people marched in a circle and chanted death 
penalty must go and tell roemer stop the execution 
other antideath penalty vigils were held across the state 
herrick said 
the national association of black police officers went on record 
against prejeans execution as did the american civil liberties 
union and numerous other civil rights organizations 
in strassbourg france the european parliament on thursday 
called for commutation of prejeans death sentence and a review of 
the evidence in his case 
prejean was 14 when he killed a taxi driver and 17 when after a 
stint in reform school he gunned down state trooper donald 
cleveland in lafayette 
cleveland was married and the father of two his widow candy 
denounced efforts to stop the execution 
a black man prejean was tried by an all white jury for killing 
the white trooper 
prejeans age and race the allwhite jury his mental state 
his use of alcohol and drugs at the time of the killing all have 
been factors in numerous unsuccessful state and federal appeals 
in one of the latest appeals the louisiana supreme court on 
wednesday rejected arguments that prejean should be spared his 
attorneys argued that a psychiatric evaluation before his 1978 
trial was inadequate and that the jury therefore never learned 
prejean was retarded 
prejean had blamed racism and politics for the failure of 
efforts to call off the execution 
he told the pardon board earlier this year that he was truly 
remorseful for the two murders and would be willing to stay in 
prison for life to pay for his crime but his death would not serve 
justice he said 
in thursdays executions leonard laws 40 was put to death by 
injection in missouri for the robbery and shotgun slayings of an 
elderly couple 
in texas 30yearold johnny ray anderson was executed by 
injection for a 1981 slaying that was part of a scheme to collect 
67000 in insurance money

advisers to the bush administration are 
bickering over a proposal to halt radio free europes broadcasts to 
eastern europe if democracy takes root there 
the debate burst into the open this week after the us advisory 
commission on public diplomacy urged that planning begin now to let 
the voice of america take over from radio free europe when 
conditions are right in the former communist bloc 
at some stage you have to ask yourself what justification is 
there for the us government to be reporting whats going on 
inside poland for example and competing with 20 or 25 independent 
polish broadcast stations said edward fuelner chairman of the 
advisory panel 
the commission said radio free europe could be terminated when 
the move to democracy becomes irreversible and when independent 
private broadcast operations are flourishing in eastern europe 
free of state control 
but malcolm forbes jr chairman of the board for international 
broadcasting which operates radio free europe took strong 
exception to the proposal 
given that radio free europe enjoys several times the audience 
of the voice of america in eastern and central europe it is 
premature to call for an end to rfe broadcasts to countries in the 
region he said 
the advisory commission advises the united states information 
agency which operates the voice of america and forbes said the 
relationship had influenced the panels proposal 
the motives of such a recommendation concerning rfe must be 
questioned in light of the commissions close relationship with 
usia said forbes who called for the creation of an independent 
presidential commission to review the issue 
forbes is president of forbes inc and deputy editor of forbes 
magazine fuelner is president of the politically conservative 
heritage foundation 
fuelner replied that forbes statement was a cheap shot at the 
commission im surprised and disappointed by the tone of it 
they took one specific recommendation that we worded carefully 
and reworded it in such a way as to make it sound like we are on 
opposite sides and we are not fuelner said 
he noted the commission said the change would be premature now 
but could be made eventually 
im a free enterpriser fuelner said and i dont think 
the us government ought to be competing with private internal 
domestic news services all were saying is plan for those 
days 
us officials say the future of us broadcasts to eastern 
europe and the soviet union is under intensive review inside the 
government 
but they say that while changes in format or content may be 
recommended no one is predicting the early demise of either radio 
free europe or radio liberty which broadcasts to the soviet union 
radio free europe was established in 1950 with funds from the 
cia control was transferred to the independent board for 
international broadcasting in 1951 
the mission of the rfe operation has been to report news of 
eastern europe not being reported by staterun media organizations 
the voice of america reports us news from an american perspective

a report to veterans secretary edward j 
derwinski sharply criticizes the government for its longstanding 
refusal to compensate vietnam veterans for illnesses linked to 
agent orange exposure 
the report by admiral elmo r zumwalt jr was released the same 
day an advisory panel to the department of veterans affairs paved 
the way for compensation to vietnam veterans suffering from a rare 
cancer known as softtissue sarcoma 
derwinski is expected to decide in late may or early june 
whether to award compensation for that form of cancer 
i hope this is the beginning of the end of the nightmare agent 
orange victims have suffered said sen thomas a daschle 
dsd a cochair of the vietnamera veterans in congress caucus 
the va advisory committee on environmental hazards made its 
recommendation thursday after reviewing scientific studies on the 
connection between dioxin and herbicide exposure to soft tissue 
sarcoma 
zumwalt one of four lay members of the 15member panel 
criticized the committee wednesday for its previous handling of the 
agent orange question the panel was created by congress in 1984 to 
investigate the link between exposure and a host of ailments 
largely cancers that vietnam veterans have been complaining about 
since the 1970s 
a federal court order last year which derwinski declined to 
appeal forced the panel to begin its work anew although the last 
agent orange was sprayed in 1971 the va has awarded only a handful 
of agent orange claims and those were all for a skin condition 
called chloracne 
derwinski decided in march that all vietnam veterans with 
nonhodgkins lymphoma should be compensated 
the american legion the vietnam veterans of america and outside 
scientists commissioned by the two groups have long criticized the 
governments refusal to acknowledge health hazards associated with 
agent orange the herbicide was contaminated with dioxin labeled a 
probable human carcinogen by the environmental protection 
agency 
on thursday the va released a report that zumwalt compiled for 
derwinski 
were the faulty conclusions flawed methodology and noticeable 
bias of the advisory committee an isolated problem correcting the 
misdirection would be more manageable zumwalt wrote 
but experience with other governmental agencies responsible 
for specifically analyzing and studying the effects of exposure to 
agent orange strongly hints at a discernible pattern if not 
outright governmental collaboration to deny compensation to 
vietnam veterans associated with exposure to dioxin he wrote 
zumwalt referred to the federal centers for disease control 
given responsibility by congress for conducting agent orange 
studies because of evidence of vas footdragging 
zumwalt repeated allegations raised in a congressional hearing 
last summer that cdc sabotaged its agent orange study suggesting 
that political pressures once again interfered with the kind of 
professional unbiased review congress had sought to obtain 
compensation for agent orange will cost nearly 90 million for 
only a few of the ailments linked to the herbicide the 
congressional budget office says 
cdc has maintained it cannot establish who among vietnam 
veterans was exposed to agent orange making further study 
impossible 
zumwalt said his own review of the scientific evidence suggests 
28 ailments mostly cancers can be linked to agent orange exposure 
zumwalt commander of naval forces in vietnam ordered the 
spraying of the defoliant in vietnam and lost a son a vietnam 
veteran to a cancer linked to agent orange exposure zumwalt has 
said he nonetheless would have ordered the spraying because it 
ultimately saved more lives than it cost 
zumwalt said the herbicide was used in undiluted form to remove 
enemy cover destroy enemy crops and clear vegetation around 
military installations landing zones fire base camps and trails 
he said more was sprayed than records indicate because of 
unofficial uses of the herbicide

most americans oppose cutting the social 
security payroll tax according to a nationwide survey released 
today 
the gallup poll conducted for the employee benefit research 
institute found that 57 percent of those surveyed dont want to 
see the payroll tax cut and 69 percent said they would oppose it 
if other taxes would be raised 
of the 25 percent who said they were aware of sen patrick 
moynihans proposal to cut the tax 51 percent were in favor 37 
percent were opposed and the rest were undecided 
moynihans proposal also would prohibit the social security 
reserves from being used to reduce the size of the federal budget 
deficit 
more than half of those polled said the deficit is the most 
important issue or a very important issue to them 
but 81 percent said the governments practice of loaning social 
security funds to pay for federal programs was inappropriate 
the poll also found concern over the future solvency of the 
system with 47 percent of those surveyed who are not retired 
saying they do not think the system will pay them benefits when 
they retire and 77 percent said higher taxes will be needed to

renoirs joyful depiction of an openair dance 
hall in paris au moulin de la galette was auctioned thursday 
for 781 million days after a haunting portrait by van gogh sold 
for a record 825 million 
the worlds two most expensive paintings were bought by the same 
man japanese industrialist ryoei saito japans kyodo news 
service reported friday 
van goghs portrait of dr gachet was purchased tuesday by 
the kobayashi gallery of tokyo for saito the 74yearold owner of 
the daishowa paper manufacturing company kyodo reported friday 
that saito also bought the renoir 
prior to its sale five of the 11 most expensive paintings sold 
at auction have been bought by japanese bidders 
the renoir was among 58 of 70 works of impressionist and modern 
art bought at sothebys auction house for a total of 286 million 
a record sale in any way that you want to count it said 
auctioneer john marion 
the bidding for the pierre auguste renoir started at 25 million 
and went up in increments of 1 million as it got beyond 40 
million the audience started gasping the price which included a 
10 percent buyers premium was the secondhighest in art auction 
history 
the large canvas of an afternoon crowd of revelers in a 
sunfilled garden framed by acacia trees had a presale estimate of 
40 million to 50 million the same as vincent van goghs 
recordsetting portrait of dr gachet 
marion called the final price marvelous 
au moulin de la galette was the highlight of the sale but 
paintings by kandinsky and chagall also set records for works sold 
at auction by those artists 
even so bidding for some of the rest of the 69 lots reflected 
the scaling back of the art market the trend was also evident at 
tuesday nights sale at christies where dr gachet was the 
star painting and last weeks contemporary art sales 
despite the new record for a single auction 17 of the offerings 
at sothebys sold for less than the presale estimate and 12 were 
not sold at all because thy failed to reach a minimum sale price 
set confidentially by the seller 
the christies sale had brought a total of 2694 million only 
67000 under the previous record for an art auction also held by 
sothebys but 24 of the 81 offerings there went unsold and some 
that did sell went for significantly less than their presale 
estimate 
marion however said he felt thursdays prices were strong 
overall it is a very solid market he said the auction house 
had expected the sale to bring in 2127 million to 2846 million 
when you have a tremendous painting like the van gogh or the 
renoir thats coming up youre going to get extraordinary 
prices said milton esterow editor and publisher of artnews 
otherwise he said the market is correcting to a more 
realistic level after the frenzied buying of recent years 
although renoirs have not fetched the top prices achieved by van 
goghs art experts said no renoir of the caliber of au moulin de 
la galette has been on the auction block 
art historian john rewald has described it as the finest work 
renoir painted 
before thursdays auction the highest price paid for a renoir 
was 177 million in april 1989 for la promenade it was bought 
by the j paul getty museum of malibu calif 
esterow noted that more renoirs have been on the market than van 
goghs and that their quality is less consistent moreover he said 
renoir does not have the glamour the romance the drama of the 
troubled van gogh 
renoir painted two versions of au moulin de la galette in 
1876 the one offered for sale at sothebys was the property of 
betsey cushing whitney widow of john hay whitney the financier 
publisher and former ambassador to britain a larger version hangs 
in the musee dorsay in paris 
the whitney picture is painted in a more fluid manner than the 
paris version however the two are so similar even the ribbons 
on the womens dresses are faithfully repeated that art experts 
dispute which one was painted first 
other important works put up for sale at sothebys were three 
paintings from the solomon r guggenheim museum kandinskys 
fugue sold for a record 200 million modiglianis boy with 
a blue shirt sold for 1155 million and chagalls 
anniversaire sold for a record 1485 million 
their total presale estimate was 22 million to 31 million 
the art institute of chicago consigned monets seascape 
saintgeorges majeur estimated at 7 million to 9 million 
all prices include a 10 percent buyers premium

the bush administration treating cigarette 
exports as a trade rather than health issue has signalled that 
congress should do likewise 
assistant health secretary james mason who has accused us 
tobacco companies of peddling their poison abroad was 
cancelled as a scheduled witness before a congressional panel 
thursday 
the panel chairman rep henry a waxman dcalif charged at 
the hearing and in a letter to masons boss health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan that mason was being muzzled 
sullivan wrote waxman that his own and masons antismoking 
views would not be silenced but that it was appropriate for the 
administration to be represented at a hearing on exports by the 
office of trade representative 
the general accounting office a congressional watchdog agency 
meanwhile said in a report that government trade and health 
policies appear in conflict with priority going to export 
promotion 
the gao said if congress agrees with this then it should do 
nothing to alter the current trade policy process 
it added however that if that congress believes that health 
considerations should have primacy or should be factored into 
trade policy it has the option of writing laws giving 
responsibility to health authorities at least one such bill has 
been introduced 
tobacco trade negotiations with four asian countries have been 
sensitive the report said but so far there seem to be no 
longterm adverse implications for us relations with the four 
talks with south korea japan and taiwan have boosted us 
cigarette sales to those countries negotiations with thailand are 
continuing 
the 50page report was issued at a fivehour congressional 
hearing on the escalating dispute between the tobacco industry and 
antismoking groups over government efforts to expand foreign 
markets for us cigarettes 
waxman told his house subcommittee on health and environment 
that two days ago the administration informed us they would not 
allow mason to testify 
it appears there are officials in the administration who place 
greater importance on the export of tobacco a product estimated 
to kill 25 million people annually than on the promotion of 
international health waxman said 
industry representatives and legislators from tobaccogrowing 
states maintained that the issue is one of trade in a legal 
product rather than health and cited tobacco as one of the few 
american exports earning a surplus 42 billion last year 
they described the current case in thailand as a matter of 
unfair protection for a government tobacco monopoly that is 
increasing its own production and exports while using help from the 
antismoking lobby to ward off foreign competition

the same japanese businessman who set a record with 
his price for a van gogh painting has purchased a renoir 
masterpiece for the secondhighest price ever recorded a japanese 
news report said today 
industrialist ryoei saito bought renoirs au moulin de la 
galette on thursday for 781 million at an auction at sothebys 
in new york the kyodo news service reported 
van goghs portrait of dr gachet was purchased tuesday by 
the kobayashi gallery of tokyo for saito the 74yearold chairman 
emeritus of the daishowa paper manufacturing co 
i havent heard yet from the art dealer but if i won the 
auction i couldnt be happier kyodo quoted him as saying after 
news of the sale reached japan this morning 
works by van gogh or renoir rarely go on sale so im very 
fortunate in addition i think it is wonderful that they will come 
to japan kyodo quoted him as saying 
prior to its sale five of the 11 most expensive paintings sold 
at auction have been bought by japanese bidders 
saito could not independently be reached for immediate comment 
and daishowa officials refused to confirm or deny the reports 
saying saitos activities on the art market were his private 
affair 
the somber portrait by vincent van gogh of his doctor was sold 
for 825 million the highest purchase price ever for a single 
painting 
though gallery owner hideto kobayashi refused to name his

last year 
known as a veteran art collector saito amassed a substantial 
collection during the postwar era however he had to sell off many 
works after the oil shocks of the 1970s when his paper concern hit 
bad times profits have since revived japanese newspapers said 
enabling him to indulge in his favorite hobby 
following the van gogh purchase saito told the yomiuri 
newspaper it cost 5 billion yen 33 million more than i 
expected but thats nothing next i want the renoir

after leading a sixday strike by 
government employees that nearly paralyzed the country the 
sandinistas have proven their claim that they can govern from 
below despite their defeat at the polls 
after prous presidential candidate violeta barrios de 
chamorro won the feb 25 election to end 11 years of sandinista 
rule leaders of the leftist movement said the could tie her 
hands at any moment 
and they did just that with the strike which began barely two 
weeks after mrs chamorro took over april 25 as president from 
sandinista leader daniel ortega 
the strike by an estimated 150000 government employees 
disrupted most public services government offices schools banks 
and the international airport were closed 
the crisis for mrs chamorros fledgling government ended 
thursday when the strikers vacated government buildings and 
returned to work but the government paid an economic and political 
price for the settlement by giving in to the most important demands 
of the sandinistaled strikers 
we were losing 3 million a day in a country that is in 
bankruptcy said central bank president francisco mayorga when 
asked to justify the government concessions to strikers 
it wasnt the workers or the government that won but 
nicaragua mayorga said 
the chamorro government promised not to fire those who walked 
off their jobs and agreed to double salaries for the public 
employees as part of the strike settlement 
that was about half what the sandinistadominated unions 
originally asked but higher than the 60 percent mrs chamorro 
initially offered 
but there was more at stake in the strike than another blow to 
nicaraguas battered economy it represented a challenge to the 
stability of the new government 
this was a coup attempt headed by assailants and 
adventurers who checkmated mrs chamorros democratic government 
said alejandro solorzano a prochamorro labor leader 
during sandinista rule strikes were banned under a law dealing 
with treason imperialism and foreign aggression 
the strike ostensibly for a 200 percent pay raise turned 
political when mrs chamorro suspended a civil service law passed 
in the last days of the sandinista government that guaranteed job 
security to public employees a majority of them sandinistas 
the chamorro government then declared the walkout illegal and 
threatened to fire strikers if they didnt return to work but the 
threats proved empty 
at attempt to use the police still basically a sandinista 
organization to break the strike failed miserably when they 
essentially sided with the strikers 
we showed that we govern from below said denis silva a 
union leader at the ministry of industry and commerce 
it was a victory of the workers and the sandinistas so why not 
call it that said lucy savadra a union leader at the ministry 
of agriculture 
although the sandinistas won only 40 percent of the vote in 
februarys elections they showed they can shut down the country 
when they want 
thousands of nicaraguans who supported mrs chamorro at the 
polls stood by as the sandinistas successfully challenged the 
governments authority 
the striking government workers got pay raises of 100 percent 
plus an increase in june pegged to inflation 
they government also nullified its repeal of the civil service 
law promised not to punish strikers and retracted its decree 
declaring the strike illegal 
despite the settlement the sandinistas are likely to bump heads 
again soon with the government which is in the process of revising 
property confiscation laws passed by the sandinistas and overseeing 
the disarming of the usbacked contra rebels 
the contras are supposed to turn in their weapons and disband by 
june 10 but only about 1000 of an estimated 12000 contras have 
disarmed so far under a program supervised by the united nations 
the contras are demanding a reduction in the size of the army and 
the resignation of humberto ortega the former sandinista defense 
minister as head of the armed forces 
if the contras dont disarm by the deadline the sandinistas are 
almost certain to put pressure on the government to take action 
against the rebels 
the government is all the more vulnerable to sandinista 
pressures because it inherited a virtually bankrupt treasury the 
chamorro administration says the sandinistas left a paltry 3 
million in the state treasury and a foreign debt of 11 billion 
the countrys cash crisis has been deepened by us failure to 
provide the emergency aid requested by mrs chamorro 
a proposed 300 million aid package from the united states is 
tied up in congress and the bush administration recently said it 
cannot legally provide an urgent 40 million bridging loan to help 
tide the country over until the package is passed

the key index on the tokyo stock exchange erased 
its early gains and edged down friday and the dollar rose against 
the yen 
the dollar closed at 15290 up 090 yen from thursdays close 
the currency opened at 15230 yen and ranged between 15225 yen and 
15315 yen 
the 225share nikkei stock average lost 4788 points or 015 
percent ending the day at 3201372 the index which had gained 
9398 points thursday rose about 140 points in early trading 
before falling back 
as market players constantly shifted their target from one 
issue to another trading became directionless and the index began 
falling said kozo hasunuma a trader with yamaichi securities co 
the yens slip as well as investors reluctance to make major 
moves ahead of the weekend also prompted the fall he added 
on the foreign exchange market the us currency was pushed 
up by scores of dollarbuying by japanese institutional 
investors said yutaka hayashi a dealer with the mitsui taiyo 
kobe bank 
as soon as the dollar jumped over the 152yen line which was 
one of the resistance points for investors it also jumped over 
153yen line another barrier he said 
hayashi said the yens slip showed the markets indecisiveness 
over which direction the dollaryen rate should go followed the 
us currencys sharp decline last week and early this week 
traders said there was little effect on the dollar from a 
widerthanexpected 845 billion us trade deficit in march 
announced in washington thursday the march figures were within the 
range of earlier expectations they said 
meanwhile finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said friday that 
the yen is gradually regaining stability in foreign exchange 
markets and that it will contribute to reducing trade imbalance 
with the united states 
in the bond market the price of benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bond fell to 8753 from thursdays close of 
8780 that drove the yield up to 7055 percent from 700 percent

the main question in romanias first 
free elections in 53 years is not who will win but what the victors 
will do to unite their land 
will they embrace democracy and capitalism or will they as 
opponents allege find ways to block progress by maintaining the 
corrupt and often sinister nomenklatura that ruled for decades 
the national salvation front and its leader ion iliescu are 
expected to emerge victorious from sundays elections polls of 
uncertain accuracy show iliescu winning up to 70 percent of the 
vote for president and the front an absolute majority in parliament 
the front a loose coalition of intellectuals and former 
communists assumed power in the bloody december revolution that 
toppled dictator nicolae ceausescu it has dominated the interim 
government and makeshift parliament 
iliescu is a popular 60yearold former minister who was 
demoted in the communist hierarchy after falling out with ceausescu 
in 1971 after ceausescus fall he was named interim president 
his standing and the fronts popular identification with the 
revolution that at least nominally ousted the communists lend them 
a certain legitimacy lacked by reformed communist parties losing 
elections elsewhere in eastern europe 
unlike poland hungary or czechoslovakia romania had no 
organized dissent under communism 
the main challenge to the front has come from two reconstituted 
preworld war ii parties the national peasants party and the 
national liberal party they claim a total of 14 million members 
on thursday the last official day of the election campaign 
about 70000 front supporters held a rally in north bucharest 
where iliescu pledged to guarantee the future of democracy in 
romania 
meanwhile an estimated 30000 antiiliescu demonstrators 
rallied in university square in downtown bucharest where speakers 
branded iliescu a neocommunist it was the largest crowd yet 
in a demonstration that has blocked the square and the capitals 
main central thoroughfare 24 hours a day since april 22 
iliescu and two challengers for the presidency the national 
liberal partys radu campeanu and the national peasants partys ion 
ratiu held the nations firstever televised debate between 
presidential candidates thursday night 
eightytwo parties are vying for the votes of 168 million 
registered voters but only six the front the peasants party 
the liberals the ecological party the democratic agrarian party 
and the social democrats are actually expected to win any of the 
506 seats up for grabs in the bicameral parliament 
because all parties back democracy and a free market to rescue 
romanias backward economy the election campaign centered around 
one issue pro or antifront 
massing tens of thousands of supporters chanting slogans similar 
to praises once sung of ceausescu the front presented itself as 
the party of revolution and guardian of poor people who might be 
hurt by a quick dash to capitalism the front urges a slower 
approach to a free market 
its challengers labored to convince voters that the front 
consists of neocommunists who usurped the revolution but the 
opposition failed to agree on a single challenger to iliescu 
both of the opposition candidates campeanu and ratiu are 
elderly returned exiles vulnerable to front charges they dont 
know todays romania 
whatever the result the violent election campaign has divided 
romania where tensions with the ethnic hungarian minority already 
had exploded in march leaving at least six dead 
those who powered the revolution the western city of 
timisoara students and intellectuals elsewhere have largely 
abandoned the front and have become a beleaguered minority 
cries of death to the intellectuals have been heard at 
front rallies 
both ratiu and campeanu suffered physical assaults for which 
their parties blamed the front the peasant party claims 60 attacks 
against it supporters including two fatal assaults 
all this has fostered pervasive suspicion and mistrust in a 
traditionally byzantine land 
hardly anyone knows where the country is headed after the 
elections and few are sure of what has really happened so far 
iliescu prime minister petre roman and other leading front 
figures claim to have first met during the revolution 
most romanians accept this version and iliescus repeated 
declarations that a return to communism is impossible 
many romanian intellectuals their suspicion sharpened by 
decades of harsh communist rule believe the front was in effect 
formed months ago by disaffected communists who wanted to dump 
ceausescu and waited for the right moment 
the intellectuals note that while the 4 millionmember romanian 
communist party disbanded seemingly overnight former communists 
still run the country at all levels 
unlike other former communists in eastern europe iliescu does 
not shy away from or apologize for his communist past he knows he 
cuts a favorable contrast with ceausescu 
in a recent tv interview he said he understood suspicions of 
his background but added such feelings are part of the wider 
atmosphere of distrust that we will all have to overcome somehow

the humane society has prodded the us 
department of agriculture into investigating complaints that a 
soviet circus tour that went bust left some animals cooped up in 
undersized cages 
bears chimpanzees and dogs from the great circus bim bom are 
barely able to move in their cages in newburgh ny according to 
lisa landres an investigator with the humane society of the united 
states 
so on thursday the groups regional office in flanders nj 
asked the government to look into the case she said 
seven handlers from the circus are caring for the 59 animals 
many of them horses the company that contracted to transport the 
animals is paying to feed them 
the broke circus performers are stranded at a pair of suburban 
atlanta hotels 
ms landres said the cages are very ramshackle old and 
dilapidated and far too small she said a 7foottall grizzly 
bear weighing about 1000 pounds is bent over in a cage and other 
animals are even more cramped 
its really sad the three lions are in there like sardines 
the primates are in cages just about the size of their bodies 
she said the same with the dogs 
agriculture department spokeswoman marlene stinson said a report 
on the case will be completed next week if conditions are found to 
be unacceptable the animals could be moved to better quarters she 
said 
ms landres said the humane society holds the tour operator 
responsible and not the animals current guardians the alex 
nichols agency inc of elmont ny 
for its part the nichols concern disagreed with the societys 
view of the animals treatment 
operations manager ed hayes said the agency has spent up to 
5000 a day to care for the animals and to house their russian 
handlers he said all but the lions are allowed out of their cages 
for exercise 
you just dont take a lion out and walk it around in the 
middle of newburgh hayes said 
hayes said hes offered to place the animals in bigger cages if 
the humane society can find some 
he blames the predicament on the tour operator international 
showbusiness inc of clearwater fla saying it failed to promote 
the shows properly and seek the right backing 
they were not prepared for this circus he said 
andy trueman the circus managing director has attributed the 
problems to the tours original kuwaiti backers waleed aa ahmad 
and his father khoorsheed ahmad 
they withdrew after losing 331000 and a promised 10 percent of 
the receipts said their lawyer brooks savage they never intended 
to back the whole tour savage said 
the bim bom circus performed just two shows before canceling a 
scheduled 32week us tour two weeks ago after running out of 
money 
the 138member allstar circus which includes performers from 
60 soviet circuses arrived in the united states march 31 
it performed in hershey pa and knoxville tenn then 
canceled the tour in johnson city tenn after the trips backers 
withdrew their support the circus performers and production staff 
moved to suburban atlanta where their stays have been supported by 
benefactors 
the animals were trucked from johnson city to a newburgh 
facility run by the nichols agency 
they would have been out on the side of the road tied on a 
guardrail somewhere if we didnt come along said hayes 
the agency is owed 47000 plus about 30000 more in animal care 
expenses he said

the bensonhurst murder was new york at its 
worst young men worried about a young woman and turf turned into a 
mob when four other youths of a different race walked into their 
path 
a gun was fired a black teenager slain his mistake was to 
have entered a mostly white neighborhood on a night when some 
frightened toughs were full of adrenaline 
thursday partial resolution of the aug 23 killing of 
16yearold yusuf hawkins came with the conviction of joseph fama 
19 on charges of second degreemurder and 12 other counts 
a second jury is still out considering charges against keith 
mondello for allegedly organizing a gang of 30 friends because a 
woman he was interested in dated nonwhites four other alleged 
members of the gang were to be tried later 
yusuf hawkins death was one more terrible episode for the city 
to absorb 
since that death mayor david dinkins has taken office the 
first black to run city hall elected to be a healer he called for 
healing after the verdict 
more than 20 years ago dr martin luther king jr 
envisioned a promised land where people would be judged by the 
content of their character rather than the color of their skin 
dinkins said 
i can think of no greater tribute to yusuf or to his family 
nor a nobler quest for the people of our city than for us to use 
this opportunity to try to make dr kings dream a reality 
it was dinkins third call for racial harmony during a week when 
the jurys deliberations had hung like a cloud of question marks 
over a city that seemed to be whipped by new racial and ethnic 
conflicts each day 
last week wellknown newspaper columnist jimmy breslin was 
temporarily suspended from newsday for a racial slur against a 
koreanamerican colleague on saturday night a vietnamese 
immigrant was badly beaten by black youngsters administrators at 
city college are dealing with two controversial professors one a 
black supremacist the other a white supremacist 
in the flatbush section of brooklyn blacks have picketed two 
koreanamericanowned grocery stores for months dinkins called 
last week for the boycotts to end but the black activists leading 
them say he does not represent the interests of the citys black 
population 
the exposure of racial and ethnic wounds is alarming but its 
nothing new in the nations largest city 
yusuf hawkins died of racism in the first degree dinkins 
said thursday that is a crime far more common than most of us 
are willing to admit 
the gorgeous mosaic that dinkins celebrated when he was 
inaugurated in january has not always held together but the fama 
verdict helped bring some of the feeling of unity that dinkins had 
sought 
demonstrators who have gathered outside the brooklyn courthouse 
since deliberations began last week erupted in cheers when the 
fama conviction was announced 
you can smile now one demonstrator ronald anthony told a 
police chief who was standing before a line of officers the chief 
smiled 
a smile is only showing that theres harmony anthony said a 
moment later it made me feel that we can get along 
thats an important feeling in new york but not everyone shares 
it 
last weekend as moses stewart and diane hawkins walked in a 
memorial march past the corner where their 16yearold son was shot 
to death white neighborhood teens shouted not guilty not 
guilty and do the white thing 
as dinkins said recently 
we have a long way to go

at least three people were killed when 
police fired on a mob that thwarted the arrest of a popular 
legislative candidate sought in the slaying of a political rival 
news reports said today 
thursdays violence in haryana state and the fatal shooting of 
the candidate prompted the election commission to cancel a special 
election scheduled for may 26 
it was the second time the election was delayed in the state 
constituency where om prakash chautala son of indias deputy 
prime minister needs voter ratification to keep his job as haryana 
states top official 
no new voting date has been set 
united news of india said the trouble started after police 
arrived in the town of medina to arrest anand singh dangi an 
independent candidate and major rival of chautala dangi was sought 
in connection with the killing of another independent candidate 
amir singh whose body was found early thursday in a neighboring 
vilage 
dangis supporters hurled stones at police blocked traffic on a 
highway and burned a stateowned bus the news agency said police 
filed killing three people and injuring 10 reports said 
the independent hindu newspaper today quoted medina residents as 
saying chauthala was responsible for singhs murder because he 
feared he would lose and wanted the elections canceled 
chautala is running as the candidate of the janata dal a 
national party headed by prime minister vp singh chautala was 
appointed chief minister of haryana state late last year when his 
father devi lal resigned to become singhs deputy prime minister 
in order to keep the chief ministers job chautala must be 
elected to a state legislature seat before june 2 
the first scheduled election was feb 28 but a partial 
reballoting was ordered the next day after chauthala was accused 
of vote fraud voter intimidation and violence 
at least eight people were killed when the violence continued 
during the march 1 vote indian newspapers again blamed chauthala 
and the election commission threw out ballots in the entire 
constituency 
the newspapers said chauthala resorted to vote fraud because 
dangi had enormous support 
the ensuing media criticism eroded chauthalas popularity and 
boosted dangis chance to win the may 26 election 
dangi has not been arrested the hindu said his whereabouts were 
unknown 
violence and fraud during elections are common in india last 
years national elections that brought vp singhs national front 
coalition to power were the bloodiest in indian history at least 
137 people were killed throughout the country

soon after joseph fama was convicted of killing 
a black youth in brooklyn storm clouds that had hung around the 
courthouse for two days moved away and a shaft of sunlight struck 
the building 
demonstrators who had angrily chanted themselves hoarse for the 
last week hugged each other and smiled at what they seemed to 
interpret as a sign from the heavens 
the weather is no joke said niamah muhammad one of about 
150 demonstrators outside the brooklyn courthouse since the 
verdict came the sun came out were all calm and happy were all 
at peace 
this is a victory for the people said dave walker an 
investigator for a brooklyn civil rights group the tensions 
high throughout the city throughout the whole country all 
communities needed the verdict 
when it was announced some demonstrators erupted in cheers and 
highfives while others hugged each other and vowed to return to 
the courthouse to await verdicts in the trials of six others 
charged in the death of 16yearold yusuf hawkins 
activists who had warned of unrest in the event of an acquittal 
greeted the conviction warmly 
about 150 police officers were on the street outside the 
courthouse and 150 on other streets nearby with perhaps 150 news 
reporters before word of the verdict arrived the mood was somber 
but it quickly turned to glee 
you can smile now one demonstrator ronald anthony told a 
police chief who was standing before a line of officers the chief 
smiled 
a smile is only showing that theres harmony anthony said 
it made me feel that we can get along 
i think its the start of some kind of change in america 
said demonstrator melanie stewart i think this is the start of 
something progressive 
still she spoke of compassion for fama i kind of feel sorry 
for him he made a stupid move there were other ways to deal with 
the situation there may have been peer pressure

more french jews have sought to emigrate to israel 
in the week since vandals desecrated a jewish cemetery in southern 
france than in the more than fourmonth period preceding the 
incident the jewish agency said 
vandals broke 34 tombstones at the jewish cemetery in carpentras 
and dug up the body of an 81yearold man and impaled his remains 
on an umbrella pole 
since the desecration was discovered may 10 2000 emigration 
requests have been received jewish agency official claude laloum 
said thursday between jan 1 and may 9 there were 1800 such 
requests 
the agency which has offices in many countries helps make 
arrangements for jews seeking to settle in israel 
since the desecration at carpentras there have been almost 
daily incidents of vandalism 
in the latest incident about 100 graves at a roman catholic 
cemetery outside the atlantic coast city of nantes were damaged or 
painted with graffiti one slogan said carpentras will be 
avanged and another said death to le pen referring to 
farright leader jeanmarie le pen who has been widely accused of 
promoting racial and religious animosities 
in the paris suburb of clichysousbois police said 12 people 
most with farright connections had been detained in connection 
with the painting of swastikas on 32 graves at a jewish cemetery 
late sunday or early monday 
in canada meanwhile the desecration of a jewish cemetery in 
stefoy outside quebec city was discovered thursday 
vandals painted swastikas and white power slogans at the 
cemetery police said 
laloum said the possibility of moving to israel exists in the 
minds of all jews at all times it crystallizes when there is an 
emotional shock as is the case with carpentras 
the decision to leave france for israel is not a way of 
protesting against antisemitism he said jews have had the 
illusion that antisemitism was disappearing but with a shock like 
carpentras the illusion shatters 
he said the jewish agency receives about 4000 to 5000 requests 
yearly about 1200 people actually leave france and settle in 
israel

a twotime killer went to his death in the 
louisiana electric chair today despite worldwide protests that he 
was dying for a crime he committed as a braindamaged teenager 
in a rambling barely audible final statement dalton prejean 
said his death would serve no purpose 
one mistake 13 years ago and thats a long time he 
said nothing is going to be accomplished i have peace with 
myself 
prejean 30 was condemned for the 1977 murder of donald 
cleveland a louisiana state trooper who was shot in the face when 
he stopped prejean for driving with a broken tail light 
to the cleveland family they say it wasnt for the revenge 
but its hard for me to see to understand prejean said i 
hope theyre happy 
he was pronounced dead at 1217 am the execution was the 
nations third in 24 hours texas and missouri each executed 
killers early thursday since capital punishment resumed in 1977 
128 prisoners have been executed in the nation 19 in louisiana 
prejean was the first to die under the supreme courts ruling 
last year that allowed the death penalty for crimes committed by 
16 and 17year olds 
he had been on the louisiana death row 10 years longer than any 
other inmate in his persistent legal fight which reached the us 
supreme court four times he went through a dozen attorneys and won 
10 delays of execution 
the way was cleared for the execution about 7 pm when the 
us supreme court refused to step in again 
gov buddy roemer also refused to intervene he rejected the 
recommendation of his pardon board who had voted to commute the 
sentence to life in prison 
when prejean was 14 he shot and killed a taxi driver for that 
he spent 30 months in reform school he was released without 
supervision and six months later he shot cleveland 
prejeans case captured widespread attention opponents cited 
his youth at the time of the crime they said he shot the trooper 
after a night of alcohol and drugs 
they argued he had an iq of 71 and was brain damaged apparently 
from abuse by an aunt who raised him they noted he was black 
convicted by an allwhite jury 
i doubt that in documented recent world history there is an 
execution that has such a pile of reasons not to do it said 
steve herrick southern regional director for amnesty international 
more than 1000 letters flooded the state capital this week 
many from overseas 
in strasbourg france the european parliament on thursday 
called for commutation of the sentence and a review of the evidence 
two state troopers were among the witnesses for prejeans 
electrocution no one from clevelands family was present 
outside the prison gates a group of 10 supporters of the death 
penalty held a quiet vigil several were relatives of murder 
victims 
the warden gave the signal and alternating blasts of electricity 
were sent through prejeans body 2000 volts for 10 seconds 500 
for 20 seconds 2000 for 10 and 500 for 20 
in thursdays executions leonard laws 40 was put to death by 
injection in missouri for the robbery and shotgun slayings of an 
elderly couple in texas johnny ray anderson 30 was executed by 
injection for a 1981 slaying that was part of a scheme to collect 
67000 in insurance money

jurors said prosecutors failed to prove joseph 
fama shot yusuf hawkins as they had charged but said they believed 
his role as a member of the white mob that surrounded and killed 
the black teenager was enough to convict him of murder 
i feel that he had the choice if he knew what was going on 
to leave the area to act with a mob is depraved indifference to 
me ive seen mobs and it becomes one entity as opposed to 
individuals said the jury forewoman tonya bailey 
i was personally convinced that he was the shooter but there 
was not enough evidence for me to convict him of that she added 
as bailey a professor at brooklyn technical college delivered 
her verdict about 7 pm thursday several jurors wiped away tears 
the sympathy that we feel for both families made it very 
difficult said kelley freer a young bank employee an hour 
after the verdict was delivered her eyes still were red from 
weeping 
bailey and the 11 other jurors in the brooklyn court convicted 
fama a day after judge thaddeus owens had instructed them that the 
19yearold defendant could be found guilty of seconddegree murder 
even if he only took part in the attack 
he is just as liable if he contributed to the realization of 
the plan if he helped or made it possible owens told the 
jurors 
nine of the jurors agreed to speak with reporters after 
delivering their verdict 
steven berquist a telephone company worker was the last 
holdout on the jury and agreed to vote for a guilty verdict on the 
murder count on thursday morning as the panel entered its 11th day 
of deliberations 
if i had any reasonable doubt i wouldnt have convicted he 
said 
debbie cose and michele gardner two of the three black jurors 
said while the case was one of the most racially charged in the 
city race played no role in the difficult deliberations 
we put that aside in the jury room said cose a secretary 
in an accounting firm 
we were family for 11 days said gardner 
the jury went as long as seven days without taking a vote while 
they deliberated a report in todays daily news said

a toy maker announced today that it plans to sell 
gorby dolls beginning next month and a similar model you can 
really bank on 
one doll which tokyobased avanti co is basing on soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev is about 10 inches tall and dressed in a 
fake leather or denim jacket or a sweat shirt when its stomach is 
squeezed the doll slightly opens its mouth and makes a squeaky 
cry the price 25 
a simpler 8inch gorby bank model in orange green red or 
black will cost the equivalent of about 12 a spokesman for 
avanti said 
i hope we can make politics more of an everyday thing by 
introducing such toys said avanti spokesman tomoki kajiwara 
although we made this gorby look cute in order to attract 
children and young women i think intellectuals or male college 
students will be mainly interested we are quite curious to know 
who would buy them 
he said 500000 of the dolls would be produced initially with 
additional production for sales in the united states and europe 
later this year

a car bomb exploded at a shopping center 
in the resort city of cartagena and its mayor said at least 35 
people were injured 
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing 
thursday but the government has blamed all of the more than 200 
bombings nationwide since august on drug traffickers those attacks 
have resulted in the deaths of 259 people 
cartagena a city of 300000 on the caribbean coast was a 
popular tourist resort for americans until a bomb set off by drug 
traffickers exploded last year in the hilton hotel killing two 
people it remains one of colombias top local vacation spots 
thursdays bomb exploded at the boca grande shopping center in 
the heart of the highrise hotel and condominium district gov 
guillermo pinazo of bolivar state said in an interview with the 
radio network rcn 
at least 35 were injured by the blast which cut off electricity 
and telephone service to much of the downtown area in that city of 
300000 residents said cartagena mayor manuel domingo rojas 
twelve vehicles were also destroyed by the bomb which was placed 
in a car stolen hours earlier 
earlier thursday in the capital bogota police discovered a 
truck bomb with 660 pounds of dynamite the device capable of 
leveling a large residential area was found buried in a cargo of 
beans in the back of a truck police said 
three car bombs exploded saturday two outside shopping centers

federal health officials say the bigcity 
outbreaks which have fueled a fourfold jump in measles in the 
united states will continue if urban child vaccination efforts are 
not more successful 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
at least 2621 measles cases have occurred in chicago since 
valentines day 1989 eight patients have died and the outbreak is 
continuing 
seventyfive percent of the chicago cases in 1989 occurred in 
children under 5 too young to be covered by school vaccination 
laws 
we have a way of confidently assuring that everybody is 
immunized by the time they go to school said cdc director 
william l roper we do not have a similar mechanism for rounding 
up every 15monthold this is not a police state 
three out of four chicago measles patients in 1989 had never 
been vaccinated 
blacks accounted for 71 percent and hispanics accounted for 23 
percent of the patients the outbreak has centered on preschool 
children in poorer innercity neighborhoods as did outbreaks last 
year in houston and los angeles 
if coverage with at least one dose of vaccine is not increased 
among innercity preschoolaged children additional outbreaks of 
measles and other vaccinepreventable diseases can be expected 
the cdc said 
together the houston los angeles and chicago outbreaks 
accounted for 35 percent of the 17850 cases reported nationwide in 
1989 that total was up dramatically from 3411 cases in 1988 
the problem with measles roper said is its an 
immunization delivered at 15 months of age the challenge we 
face is how as a nation to reach particularly inner city 
particularly poor particularly young particularly single mothers 
to bring their children to get them immunized when getting that 
immunization at 15 months of age is surely not the number one item 
on their minds at that moment 
the chicago department of health reported that vaccination 
levels among 2yearolds in high innercity measles areas averaged 
just 49 percent 
the preschool population in such areas often has limited 
contact with the healthcare system the cdc said urging 
stronger efforts to make vaccinations available 
measles had dwindled to 1497 us cases in 1983 before an 
upswing in recent years and the large increase in 1989 
the availability of measles vaccine in the past three decades 
has reduced the disease by 95 percent or more however some 
vaccine failures do occur nearly 40 percent of the cases last year 
occurred in people who had been vaccinated 
to combat that the cdc now recommends measles vaccine at 15 
months with a booster shot at school age

president carlos menem has 
refused to discuss widely published reports he moved out of his 
official residence because of a rift with his wife who has 
increasingly criticized his government 
reports that menem 59 plans to divorce or permanently separate 
from his 46yearold wife zulema took frontpage headlines in 
most argentine newspapers wednesday and thursday 
questioned during a meeting thursday with foreign 
correspondents menem refered reporters to an official communique 
which said he would abstain from any public statements on the 
matter 
im not a man who has gone through life on a bed of roses 
menem added as he left the meeting ive been through everything 
in my life and im galvanized strengthened spiritually to be able 
to put up with any kind of situation 
the furor over the future of the marriage was touched off 
wednesday by the weekly newsmagazine somos which said menem had 
moved out of the residence on may 8 and planned a de facto 
estrangement from his wife 
menems departure from the official residence somos said was 
provoked by a crisis in his 24year marriage that threatens to 
become a question of state 
presidential aides refused to officially confirm or deny the 
reports 
menem who led the labobased peronist party to victory in may 
1989 elections has surprised many argentines including party 
members with efforts to exchange the heavily statecontrolled 
economy for a free market economy as a means of ending decades of 
inflation and recession 
zulema menem described publicly by her husband as one of my 
harshest critics has frequently spoken out in support of a 
peronist faction that opposes menems plans to relax government 
controls sell moneylosing state companies deregulate monopolies 
end subsidies and lower trade barriers 
mrs menem who claimed recently that she had received anonymous 
death threats also has charged that her husband is surrounded by 
corrupt or untrustworthy aides and advisors and has accused several 
top officials of unspecified misdeeds 
the first lady maintains close friendships with several of her 
husbands leading political foes including labor leader saul 
ubaldini and col mohamed ali seineldin leader of a rightwing 
army faction that opposes the army heirarchy and staged three 
barracks revolts in 1987 and 1988 
the couple has two children zulema eva 19 and carlos 21

the son of a former panamanian president 
was found innocent of threatening to kill president bush but he 
was loath to talk about the verdict 
talking is how i got into this mess otto lakas said 
thursday as he left us district court 
lakas was accused of threatening to kill bush while talking with 
the managers of a pawnshop where he was looking at a gun the 
21yearold architecture student at lubbock christian university 
admitted making the menacing comments but said they were made in 
jest 
jailed since his april 17 arrest by the secret service he could 
have faced a fiveyear prison term if convicted 
i am very happy lakas said i dont want to comment any 
more than that but i am glad to go back home to panama 
demetrio lakas president of panama from 1972 to 1978 testified 
thursday that death threats in panama are a way of expressing 
ourselves 
after hearing the jurys decision he cried and hugged his wife 
elizabeth 
prosecutors refused to comment about the decision 
during testimony thursday the younger lakas told jurors he did 
say i have a bullet with bushs name engraved on it while 
talking to pawnshop managers stacy and tracy nichols last month 
i apologize for making the statement lakas said under 
crossexamination thursday i didnt mean it 
lakas lawyer tommy turner told jurors in closing arguments 
that his client made the threat after the pawnbrokers teased him 
about the us invasion of panama last december 
the nicholses said during testimony wednesday that they had 
refused to believe lakas father was a former panamanian president 
and taunted lakas when he told them us troops entered his home 
and confiscated his fathers gun collection 
otto used an exaggeration to make a point turner told the 
jurors but you cant throw a man in jail for shooting his mouth 
off 
bush sent us troops into panama in december which resulted in 
the arrest and removal of panamas dictator gen manuel noriega 
lakas father was a figurehead president of panama when it was 
ruled by gen omar torrijos noriega was a follower of torrijos who 
rose to power after torrijos died in a 1981 plane crash

organizers of the goddess of democracy 
radio ship today accused the taiwanese and us governments of 
scuttling the project to beam prodemocracy messages to china 
the ship will leave the northern port of keelung within the next 
few days for japan where organizers hope to obtain necessary radio 
equipment that taiwan has refused to allow onto the vessel 
nicholas druz chairman of the project said taiwan stymied it 
by refusing to allow chinese to board the ship to make broadcasts 
not allowing the ship to return for provisions and stopping the 
transmitter from clearing customs 
he also said the united states has long been putting pressure on 
taiwan not to assist the ship but he did not explain why 
washington might do that 
a spokesman for the us representative in taipei refused to 
comment 
the taiwanese government issued a statement reiterating its 
stance that the radio equipment would not be allowed aboard the 
ship because the planned broadcasts would violate international law 
taiwan is without exception supportive of efforts to foster 
democracy on the chinese mainland government spokesman shaw 
yuming said but even for a worthy end the republic of china 
taiwan cannot support an illegal means 
organizers deny that the broadcasts would violate international 
law 
the 1200ton vessel which left france on march 17 arrived in 
keelung on sunday to take on provisions before sailing into 
international waters to make the broadcasts the departure has been 
delayed several days because of all the difficulties organizers 
have encountered 
although taiwans governing nationalist party is the rival of 
the beijing government tension between the two sides has eased in 
recent years and taiwan is anxious not to anger the communists who 
have refused to rule out the use of force to stop the broadcasts 
china has repeatedly warned taiwan not to help the goddess of 
democracy 
druz and other organizers speaking at a news conference said 
they felt betrayed by the government they claimed assurances were 
made that they would have had a more favorable reception here 
he acknowledged the project was about 500000 in debt and 
organizers made an appeal for radio stations around the world to 
help find a transmitter to be loaded onto the boat in japan he 
said the equipment was needed to make the broadcasts 
we dont want to terminate this project said druz who 
fought back tears as he answered questions we still hope we can 
broadcast before the fourth of june 
he was referring to the first anniversary of the military 
crackdown of the prodemocracy movement in beijing in which 
hundreds and possibly thousands of civilians were killed the ship 
is named after the statue erected by demonstrators in tiananmen 
square that was crushed that night by tanks

moscow police are preparing to snoop on american 
law enforcers from new york to california from squad rooms to back 
yard barbecues 
thirteen of the moscow men in blue are scheduled to arrive in 
the united states today for a weeklong visit being billed as the 
first official bilateral law enforcement exchange with the soviets 
they are basically interested in everything we have to show 
them said cynthia dickstein president of the organization for 
americasoviet exchanges a private nonprofit agency that 
arranged the visit the programs set up for them are pretty 
inclusive drugs canine units all the equipment ballistics 
courtrooms jails crime labs 
the 13 soviet officers are men between the ages of 27 and 45 who 
hold executive positions in what amounts to the moscow bureau of 
the soviet national police force they include the colonel in 
charge of moscows criminal investigation unit officers who police 
the black market and a captain in the traffic department 
the soviet officers who will stay in the homes of local police 
will visit police departments in albany amsterdam and rochester in 
upstate new york new london conn deland fla and larkspur 
calif 
this fall 13 us officers will make a similar visit to the 
soviet union 
soviet officials last year said their country had the 
fastestgrowing crime rate in the world but still trailed behind 
the united states in overall crimes 
in the first eight months of 1989 more than 15 million crimes 
were reported in the soviet union a 332 percent jump over the 
same period the year before soviet officials said 
still soviet officials said there are only 59 murders per 
100000 soviets compared with 89 per 100000 in america 
the visits are expected to combine socializing with a 
demonstration of local police work 
volusia county sheriffs sgt bob matusick in deland fla 
plans to treat col vt bobryashov to a back yard cookout and 
swings to disney world and kennedy space center along with visits 
to the state crime lab in orlando and the blue lightning strike 
force in miami 
matusick who led american law enforcement officers on a 
twoweek trip to the soviet union last month said bobryashov and 
his colleagues will likely be amazed by us law enforcement 
technology 
while in moscow he felt as if he had stepped back in time to 
the 1950s matusick said there are no computers in common 
use 
steretypes probably will be broken on both sides said dickstein 
she said us police who visited the soviet union found common 
ground with police officers there 
on both sides they groused about low pay inadequate benefits 
low prestige in the community she said 
the benefit of the exchanges she said is that they give people 
the chance to see for themselves what they only imagined 
it breaks down the stereotypes theres so much mystique about 
police dickstein said police in the soviet union saw police 
academy a slapstick comedy about training and they wanted to 
know if that was what its really like 
the americans expected their soviet counterparts to be less 
friendly and more stern she said you had visions of soviet 
police taking people off to the camps 
instead the officers squared off for a game of basketball in 
lithuania the soviets were gracious enough to let the american 
lose by only a little she said

a lebanese shiite militia has contacted the red 
cross concerning an offer to swap the bodies of two israeli 
soldiers for israeliheld arab prisoners a red cross spokeswoman 
said today 
i can confirm that amal a shiite militia has resumed 
contacts with us on the subject said spokeswoman martine 
haemmerli 
she said the militia and israel first contacted the 
international committee of the red cross on the proposed swap some 
time ago she refused to elaborate 
an israeli defense official said in jerusalem on thursday that 
israel wants proof that amal is holding the bodies of the two 
soldiers killed in south lebanon before considering a swap 
such an exchange with the mainstream amal militia could 
encourage more releases of western hostages held in lebanon by 
proiranian shiite radicals there are now 16 western hostages 
including six americans 
after two us hostages were freed last month iran and allied 
groups in lebanon demanded a goodwill gesture such as the release 
of prisoners held by the israelibacked south lebanon army which 
has more than 300 prisoners 
the israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
amal had been claiming for some time that it was holding the bodies 
but had never produced evidence most of the seven israeli 
servicemen missing in lebanon are believed to be in the hands of 
radical iranianbacked or palestinian groups 
as far as we know the amal organization does not have the 
bodies of any of our soldiers he said if amal believes the 
bodies are those of israeli soldiers let it first submit evidence 
to this effect only after we are convinced the bodies are in fact 
those of israeli soldiers will there be room to negotiate the 
matter 
un sources in south lebanon disclosed thursday that in early 
1989 amal leader nabih berri approached united nations officials 
and offered to return israeli bodies given to them by the palestine 
liberation organization 
in exchange berri sought the release of shiite prisoners held 
in alkhiam a prison controlled by the south lebanon army 
the sources who demanded anonymity said berri never identified 
the bodies of the soldiers he was offering to trade they said 
israel demanded proof and suggested evidence be given to 
representatives of the international red cross 
the negotiations were halted after battles broke out between 
rival shiite groups and israel captured shiite sheik abdul karim 
obeid in july 
last week the commander of the south lebanon army gen antoine 
lahad refused to make prisoner releases solely to help western 
hostages 
he said three captured israeli soldiers and missing militiamen 
from his own army would have to be part of any deal 
the longest held of the 16 western hostages is terry a 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985

found guilty of entering the country without a visa and violating 
foreign exchange regulations

key said that although he was well treated he witnessed daily 
beatings of other prisoners and saw firsthand evidence of torture 
at a detention center in the town of maungdaw near the 
bangladesh border where he was held for a month key said he saw 
one prisoner in a state of acute shock after interrogation by 
military intelligence personnel the 20yearold man had what 
appeared to be electrode burn marks on his back and said he was 
given shocks to his head and body key said 
all the prisoners considered torture so routine that they 
found it amusing when i told them that it was not normal elsewhere 
in the world key told the associated press in an interview in 
bangkok 
it was taken for granted that they wire you up when you walk 
through the door he said 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights group in a 
may 2 report said torture of civilians in burma was widespread and 
anyone suspected of opposing the government was at risk the us 
embassy in rangoon the burmese capital has said some people have 
died as a result of torture 
the military government has routinely denied all torture reports 
by amnesty international and other groups since it took power in 
september 1988 
key said prisoners who were members of insurgent groups received 
the harshest treatment and moslem prisoners were the most frequent 
victims of maltreatment by burmese prison trustees and guards 
a farmer in his 30s said he and two other moslem arakanese 
insurgents had received electric shocks to their backs heads and 
genitals and been beaten on their knees by guards key said 
another prisoner told key that a plastic sheet had been wrapped 
around his face and his head was ducked under water so he would 
slowly suffocate 
other prisoners described being bound and having water dripped 
slowly on their heads apparently to make them think they were 
going insane key said 
none of these people appeared to be of any significance except 
that they were members of an insurgent group key said 
he said that during his own interrogation he was asked if he had 
any connection with burmese politics and whether he knew michael 
aris the british husband of burmas main opposition figure aung 
san suu kyi ms suu kyi who heads the national league for 
democracy was placed under house arrest by the military government 
in july 
key said he was transferred to a jail in the town of sitwe in 
arakan state on april 9 where he encountered dozens of prisoners 
held for taking part in the 1988 prodemocracy uprising 
the movement was crushed after the army killed thousands of 
people and western diplomats in rangoon estimate the military has 
detained several thousand dissidents since then 
also today a burmese government spokesman said it has rejected 
us rep stephen solarzs request to observe the may 27 election 
because of his notorious record for creating unrest in burma 
solarz dny has strongly criticized the military government 
and expressed doubts that the election will be free and fair

germans who once joyously embraced at the 
broken berlin wall are now checking to see if they still have their 
wallets 
the wistful dream of creating a greater germany has been 
overshadowed by grim estimates of the costs both human and 
economic of merging a strong economy and a desperately weak one 
in the past eight days east german teachers train workers 
farmers and textile workers have held sporadic strikes to demand 
job protection as the nations are unified 
the strikes were the latest in a growing tide of labor unrest in 
the country where many people want free market wealth but are 
worried about giving up socialist subsidies 
meanwhile west germans who once invited their eastern neighbors 
into their homes are now upset by the appetite of their dinner 
guests 
voters in two west german states last weekend dealt west german 
chancellor helmut kohl a stunning setback that was seen as a 
minireferendum on unification 
not only did his governing coalition lose both states it lost 
control of the upper house of parliament which must ratify some of 
the laws that will be passed for unification 
the opposition social democrats who favor a slower pace of 
unification won both states and control of the upper house 
west germans fear higher taxes deflated buying power and rising 
interest rates as the cost for bailing out the ailing east german 
economy and converting it to a free market 
east germans fear widespread unemployment westernstyle prices 
for basic necessities and secondclass citizenship in a united 
germany 
with this backdrop west germany and east germany today signed a 
treaty billed as a blueprint for economic and social unification 
that is to take place july 2 
the centerpiece is the circulation of the west german mark as 
the official east german currency 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere secured a major 
victory by getting bonn to agree to a 11 conversion for wages 
pensions and small savings accounts of east germans 
but east germans still will make only about onethird of the 
salaries of west germans 
economists also estimate that 500000 to 2 million workers will 
lose their jobs as east german factories now run by the state are 
forced to deal with operating losses and foreign competition 
the treaty intentionally leaves vague many of the key aspects of 
unification including how property and factories that now are all 
stateowned will be converted to the public sector 
some east germans fear west german investors will buy up the 
nation after july 2 
kohl wants western investors to have an incentive for investing 
in east germanys moribund industrial sector while de maiziere 
wants some limits on how much property west germans can own 
kohl would like to speed the unification process before his 
popularity at its peak just a few months ago erodes any further 
the leftleaning social democrats in west germany want to slow 
it hoping that the inevitable pain of converting a socialist 
system to a capitalist economy will increase their chances in the 
dec 2 west german elections 
de maiziere like kohl would like to see unification come 
quickly and has been at odds with east germanys social democrats 
who are part of his governing coalition 
but de maiziere also has pressed the west germans for more than 
they are willing to give perhaps not enough to completely satisfy 
the social democrats but enough to drag out the talks 
in the meantime the term german unification is increasingly 
mentioned in the context of german disunity 
we are one people was the slogan for the unification 
movement that followed last years revolt against communism 
we are one stupid people read a sign at a labor rally two 
weeks ago near the berlin wall 
while the next decade may produce a nation that is one big 
happy community of good wages and high living standards germans on 
both sides of the border are focusing more now on the pain they may 
have to endure to reach the end of the rainbow

women cant be banned from jobs that could 
harm a fetus the states highest court ruled upholding a 
challenge to a company policy that affected even women who have no 
plans to have children 
the state supreme court on thursday let stand a lower court 
ruling that a battery companys fetal protection policy keeping 
fertile women away from jobs that could expose them to low levels 
of lead amounts to sex discrimination 
the company johnson controls inc also has a case pending 
before the us supreme court over the same policy 
the california appellate desicion had called the policy 
blatant overt genderbased discrimination based on 
unfounded unscientific stereotypic notions about women 
we are in an era of choice a woman is not required to become 
a victorian brood mare said the 4th district court of appeal in 
its 30 ruling feb 28 in a case from fullerton 
but in a case stemming from a johnson controls plant in 
minnesota a federal appeals court had upheld the policy the us 
supreme court is expected to rule on the issue by mid1991 
however that turns out thursdays action involving state fair 
employment law should settle the issue for california a state 
lawyer said 
california courts are competent to decide whats in the public 
interest in california without regard to what happens in federal 
courts said deputy attorney general manuel medeiros 
gerald griffin a lawyer for the company said it was very 
surprising that the state high court declined to consider the 
appeal especially since the us supreme court is reviewing the 
same issue 
johnson controls argued that the appellate ruling gave short 
shrift to an employers legitimate interest in protecting the 
health of unborn children 
but the appeals court said research has shown that exposure to 
lead could affect male workers who become fathers as well as women 
who become mothers a finding disputed by the company johnson 
controls policy excludes only women from production jobs 
i think it has implications for all women who are trying to 
get jobs in traditionally maledominated industries said 
catherine ruckelshaus of san francisco legal aids employment law 
center 
federal and state work safety agencies ban workers both male 
and female from job sites if their blood tests above certain 
levels for lead johnson controls policy is based on lower 
exposure levels 
the suit was filed by a woman named queen elizabeth foster who 
was denied a battery assembly job in johnson controls globe 
battery co plant in 1983 although she wasnt pregnant or planning 
to have a baby 
the companys policy adopted three months earlier denied all 
battery production jobs to women of childbearing age who couldnt 
prove they were infertile

the two german nations today signed a 
historic treaty that will make them a single economic entity in 
less than seven weeks and introduce fragile east germany to the 
rigors of capitalism 
the signing means that as of july 2 when the treaty takes 
effect the fourdecade division of germany will come to an end in 
many ways 
however the thorny issue of the military status of a united 
germany remains to be resolved especially the soviet unions 
rejection of proposed nato membership for the new germany 
flanked by west german chancellor helmut kohl and east german 
prime minister lothar de maiziere the finance ministers of the two 
merging nations signed the treaty inside the federal governments 
opulent palais schaumburg 
this is a historic hour in the life of the german nation 
kohl said during the ceremony 
we have come here together to sign a treaty after 45 years of 
painful division a treaty with which we are completing the first 
significant step toward the restoration of germanys state unity 
what we are living through here is the birth of a free and 
united germany kohl said 
de maiziere said that not all flowery dreams of east germans 
will be fulfilled with the treaty but no one will be worse off 
than before 
which other country gets such a good starting position as we 
with this treaty 
the ceremony was loaded with symbolism 
west german finance minister theodor waigel and his east german 
counterpart walter romberg signed the treaty inside the former 
office of konrad adenauer and at his writing desk 
adenauer was west germanys first chancellor and helped guide 
the nation from postwar ruin to the present affluence and its place 
in the western alliance on one wall of the room is a tapestry of 
moses who led his people across the desert 
kohl has made no secret that he would not mind having a place in 
history next to the revered adenauer as the architect of a 
reunited germany 
the socalled state treaty between east and west germany is the 
crowning achievement so far of kohls fastforward unification 
efforts 
the signing comes just two months after east germanys first 
free elections and a little more than six months after the berlin 
wall was opened by east germanys prodemocracy revolution 
under provisions of the document east germany will get massive 
assistance from west germany in exchange for scrapping its moribund 
centrally planned economy for capitalist principles 
the east german government has opted for annexation of its 
economy by west germany rather than face possible economic collapse 
nonetheless there are widespread concerns in east germany the 
changes could trigger enormous problems such as massive 
unemployment from the close of factories unable to keep up in a 
competitive economic system 
west germans are also worried about the effects of economic 
merger fearful they will have to bear awesome costs to rescue 
their east german cousins 
under the treaty west germanys mighty deutsche mark will 
become east germanys legal tender all monetary affairs will be 
controlled by west germanys central bank the bundesbank 
east germany will be required to start selling off stateowned 
property under the treaty to help cover reconstruction costs 
on wednesday west germany unveiled a 70 billion german unity 
fund to be used in the east german reconstruction effort costs of 
the fund will be covered by borrowing and savings in west germanys 
federal budget

indochinese refugees ended today with the united states rejecting a 
call to set up a refugee center for vietnamese boat people on us 
soil delegates said 
delegates at the conference of the un high commissioner for 
refugees committee on indochinese refugees had urged nations that 
oppose the forced repatriation of vietnamese boat people such as 
the united states to set up refugee centers of their own 
the socalled countries of temporary refuge where boat people 
land first also urged vietnam to take effective measures to 
prevent its people from leaving their homeland illegally 
philippines delegate herman laurel told reporters today that 
southeast asian nations and hong kong will jointly protest to the 
united states and vietnam over their refugee policies 
all embassies and missions of these first asylum countries

of guam 
the us delegate allan jury told reporters he was not 
authorized to agree to such a change in us refugee policy he

sergio vieira de mello the conference chairman said he hoped a 
meeting in geneva later this year will resolve issues raised in the

tens of thousands of demonstrators 
clashed with police today and thousands of other people prayed and 
wept before altars in memory of the victims of the worst rebellion 
in modern south korean history 
ten years ago today a widespread civilian uprising for 
democracy began in this southern provincial city by the time 
military forces quelled it 10 days later at least 200 civilians 
had been killed 
in todays protests police reported many arrests and injuries 
but gave no nationwide figures one report said that in seoul alone 
about 500 people were arrested in a preventive police strike 
nationwide 70000 police were deployed to prevent violence 
officials said in seoul 12000 riot police were posted around 
government offices public buildings and foreign legations they 
said 
in kwangju 150 miles south of seoul 100000 people held a 
nighttime rally in the city center and shouted for the ouster of 
president roh taewoo organizers claimed 200000 people turned out 
but police said only 50000 did 
punish roh taewoo the crowd shouted waving blue red 
yellow banners in an intermittent rain yankee go home 
protesters also screamed 
radical leaders shouted over loudspeakers that the souls of the 
kwangju victims can never rest in peace until roh is overthrown 
roh was one of several army generals in control of the martial law 
government that crushed the 1980 revolt militarily 
the speakers also demanded an end to the us military presence 
in south korea claiming that washington condoned the crushing of 
the kwangju uprising by korean military forces about 43000 us 
troops are stationed in south korea under a mutual defense treaty 
after the threehour rally protesters marched through downtown 
streets waving banners and shouting slogans protesters in groups 
ranging from 500 to 2000 people clashed with police in various 
parts of kwangju 
in several encounters police were outnumbered by swarms of 
protesters hurling hundreds of firebombs at a time some police 
were overpowered by demonstrators and beaten many onlookers on the 
sidewalks cheered protesters and booed riot police marching with 
shields in front of them 
in seoul 2000 students hurling rocks and firebombs fought riot 
police in scattered street battles demanding the disbandment of

clothes rubbing a gray tombstone bearing the name of her slain 
17yearold daughter 
a few yards away 20 youths put down a bundle of yellow flowers 
in front of a tomb and made deep bows they sang antigovernment 
songs and shouted remember kwangju and fight for 
democracy 
down the hill weeping mourners treaded their way to the 
graveyard along muddy fields holding umbrellas 
organizers of the memorial service said 50000 people visited 
the cemetery named today by dissidents as a democratic 
sanctuary 
the tragedy in kwangju a city of 1 million began may 18 1980 
when hundreds of thousands of citizens rose up against the central 
government to protest a crackdown on political dissent the 
protesters drove out police and took control of the city for 10 
days before being crushed by tankled troops by official count 
200 people were killed and more than 1700 injured or wounded 
dissidents claim the death toll was much higher 
many kwangju citizens believe washington condoned the harsh 
military attack on the prodemocracy revolt the united states has 
denied the accusation

physicians are pleased with the progress of 
freed hostage robert polhill whose cancerous vocal cords were 
surgically removed a spokesman for walter reed army medical center 
said today 
polhill was resting in an intensive care unit at the medical 
center the day after a fourhour operation characterized by 
surgeons as successful his next challenge is learning to speak 
with no voice box 
his condition is listed as good said jim stueve a 
spokesman for walter reed we will continue to monitor him 
closely because of his diabetes physicians are generally pleased 
with his progress 
stueve said it was not known how long polhill would remain in 
intensive care 
polhills wife ferial and mother ruth waited at the hospital 
during the operation and were with him afterward said another 
spokesman ben smith 
the former hostage who was released by shiite moslems 
kidnappers last month after 39 months in captivity in lebanon was 
expected to remain in intensive care for some time because he is 
diabetic the spokesman said 
doctors were expected to provide an update on polhills 
condition today 
polhill 55 could speak barely above a whisper when he arrived 
in the united states on april 27 a warning sign of larynx cancer 
the business and accounting professor had lost 25 pounds while 
in captivity physicians waited until last week to perform a biopsy 
so that he could regain the weight and strength needed for general 
anesthesia 
the tumor probably had been growing at least a year when it was 
diagnosed col russ zajtchuk deputy commander of clinical 
services at the army hospital said in disclosing polhills cancer 
wednesday if caught earlier it possibly could have been treated 
with radiation alone he said 
instead the growth was extensive involving both vocal 
cords and other parts of the larynx and necessitating radical 
surgery zajtchuk said there was no evidence it had spread to the 
lymph nodes he said 
larynx cancer is related to smoking and polhill was a cigarette 
smoker who continued the habit while in captivity zajtchuk said 
smokers are by far the highest risk group and male victims 
outnumber females by a ratio of almost 5 to 1 said a leading 
specialist on larynx cancer dr allan abramson chairman of the 
otolaryngology department at the long island jewish medical center 
in new york 
abramson said polhill would awaken from surgery to find himself 
unable to talk with a permanent breathing hole in his throat 
called a stoma 
polhill must still undergo radiation therapy and will have to 
learn how to communicate without a voice box zajtchuk said 
abramson said there are three options for laryngectomy patients 
an electronic device the patient puts against his neck to 
transform the movement inside into a metallicsounding voice 
esophageal speech involving use of air pushed up from the 
stomach to vibrate in a way that produces a gutteralsounding 
speech 
surgery to insert a breathing valve in the throat against 
which air vibrates and produces a sound similar to the human voice 
zajtchuk said polhill had begun working with a speech therapist 
to discuss what he will do after treatment

emperor akihito today became the first 
japanese monarch to pay tribute at a monument to the 70000 people 
who died in the atomic bomb blast that devastated nagasaki 45 years 
ago 
a steady rain fell as akihito accompanied by empress michiko 
bowed deeply and placed a bouquet of white flowers on a dark 
granite cenotaph before the monument 
mayor hitoshi motoshima led akihito to the site motoshima was 
shot in the chest in january by an ultrarightist for saying the 
late emperor hirohito could have helped end world war ii sooner and 
spared nagasaki 
japan surrendered six days after the aug 9 1945 atomic bombing 
though hirohito now known in japan as emperor showa visited 
nagasaki for a sporting event in 1969 his son akihito is the

horses for rodeos began its annual hurrah today the excuse for a 
threeday cowboy mardi gras that brings thousands of cowpokes into 
this high plains cowtown 
everybody that ever was a cowboy or ever wanted to be a cowboy 
is there said don jacobs a great falls mont rodeo stock 
contractor who has attended every sale since it started in 1950 
advance ticket sales for the event modestly titled the world 
famous miles city bucking horse sale topped 15000 by last week 
said susan sanderson secretary for the sales board of governors 
as always all 400 motel rooms in miles city have been reserved 
for months motels in towns up to 80 miles take up part of the 
overflow private homes trailer parks and campgrounds absorb the 
rest 
miles city has about 10000 people and the population doubles 
over the weekend sanderson said 
local merchants especially the two westernwear stores are 
delighted but sanderson said i would say the bars benefit more 
than anybody 
the sale draws more than just cowboys we get a lot of college 
kids sanderson said we do get a lot of older people though 
its a very nice mix of people 
and its not as rowdy as might be expected arrests hit a record 
low last year 22 all for misdemeanor charges 
previous to 64 it used to be just a bucking horse sale they 
didnt have that much that went with it said wes tibbets who 
runs the sale at the miles city livestock center on the custer 
county fairgrounds 
now the weekend includes parimutuel horse racing a parade 
street dances a gun and coin show a barbecue an ice cream social 
and a trade exposition 
most of all there is cowboy talk 
the sale started in 1950 out of simple necessity tibbets 
recalled 
the guy who owned and operated the livestock auction got into 
a trade and ended up with a bunch of horses he said he put on 
a bucking horse sale and it was fairly successful 
back in the 50s and even the early 60s when there used to 
be a lot more horses in the country there used to be 500 600 
even 700 horses that would go through the sale 
the counts have dwindled in recent years sliding from 431 in 
1983 to 220 last year tibbets estimated this years sale would see 
250 to 300 horses strut their stuff for 10 to 15 rodeo stock 
contractors from around the country 
most will sell for a few hundred dollars but some may go much 
higher neil gay of mesquite texas set a new record last year 
when he paid 6750 for a rodeowise mare named shotgun

had threatened reporters with arrest if they published the names of 
people involved in the march trial of two juveniles 
gov george mickelson has acknowledged that his son david was 
one of the two 
youngs order was illegal because he failed to hold a hearing

however the justices declined to rule on the constitutionality 
of the state law on which the circuit judges order was based

a 74yearold japanese paper magnate owns the 
worlds two most expensive paintings after landing pierre auguste 
renoirs shimmering au moulin de la galette for 781 million 
the renoir was sold thursday at sothebys to ryoei saito who on 
tuesday paid 825 million at christies for vincent van goghs 
melancholy portrait of dr gachet 
saito is the chairman emeritus of japans secondlargest paper 
company the daishowa paper manufacturing corp 
saito told the associated press in a telephone interview today 
that he had not expected to win the auctions 
they are worldclass wonderful works he said 
after the van gogh purchase saito had told the yomiuri shimbun 
newspaper it cost 5 billion yen 33 million dollars more than i 
expected but thats nothing next i want the renoir 
the bidding for the renoir started at 25 million and went up in 
increments of 1 million applause broke out as the winning bid 
received by telephone was announced 
auctioneer john marion called the final price marvelous 
the large impressionist canvas framed by green and yellow 
trees depicts a sunny garden in montmartre filled with dancing 
couples the men in black frocks and yellow hats and the women in 
pink and blue gowns 
art historian john rewald described the 1876 painting as the 
finest work renoir painted 
renoir painted two versions of au moulin de la galette in 
1876 the one offered for sale at sothebys was the property of 
betsey cushing whitney the widow of john hay whitney the 
financier publisher and former ambassador to britain a larger 
version hangs in the musee dorsay in paris 
the final price eclipsed the presale estimate of 40 million to 
50 million 
the renoir was the highlight of a sale of 70 impressionist and 
modern paintings and sculptures at sothebys 
seventeen of the 70 lots sold for less than the presale 
estimate and 12 were not sold because they failed to reach a 
minimum sale price set confidentially by the seller 
the total for the night still was 286 million which marion 
described as a record sale in any way that you want to count it 
marion rejected reports that the high prices paid for paintings 
in recent years may be softening it is a very solid market he 
said 
milton esterow editor and publisher of artnews disagreed 
when you have a tremendous painting like the van gogh or the 
renoir youre going to get extraordinary prices esterow said 
otherwise he said the market is correcting to a more 
realistic level after the frenzied buying of the past few years 
at the christies sale where the van gogh was sold 24 of the 81 
offerings went unsold 
before thursdays auction the highest price paid for a renoir 
was 177 million in april 1989 for la promenade it was bought 
by the j paul getty museum 
but art experts said no renoir of the caliber of au moulin de 
la galette has been on the auction block 
six of the 12 most expensive paintings sold at auction have been 
bought by japanese bidders who are especially interested in the 
impressionists 
other important works sold thursday at sothebys were three 
paintings from the solomon r guggenheim museum wassily 
kandinskys fugue sold for 200 million amedeo modiglianis 
boy with a blue shirt sold for 1155 million and marc 
chagalls anniversaire sold for 1485 million 
the kandinsky and chagall set records for works sold at auction 
by those artists 
the paintings were sold at sothebys upper east side galleries 
in front of a standingroomonly crowd of art dealers and 
socialites buyers in the room raised paddles to make bids while 
bids from buyers elsewhere came in on a bank of telephones at the 
front of the room

nelson mandela said today that any 
government that wants to lift sanctions against south africa now 
either supports apartheid or is totally ignorant 
the african national congress leader said that although progress 
is being made toward winning black rights it is too early to ease 
international pressure on the south african government 
mandela spoke at a news conference as he ended a threeday visit 
to algeria before going on to libya the black nationalist leader 
said he would urge european leaders next month not to lift 
sanctions because apartheid is still in place despite the reform 
initiatives of president fw de klerk 
in an apparent reference to the policies of british prime 
minister margaret thatchers policies mandela said any country 
that argues the time has come to lift sanctions is totally ignorant 
of what is going on in south africa or is a supporter of 
apartheid 
mandela freed in february after 27 years in prison declined to 
answer when asked whether he would meet mrs thatcher on his 
upcoming european tour mrs thatcher has opposed most sanctions 
against south africa arguing they would hurt the countrys black 
majority more than the white minority 
mandela said de klerks government is trying to take advantage 
of conflict among south african blacks in order to eliminate 
members of those organizations whom the authorities regard as a 
threat 
but he said the anc is prepared in forthcoming talks with the 
government to compromise on all matters except the principle of one 
person one vote 
we are prepared to address the fears of whites that this 
principle will bring onesided rule said mandela we are 
prepared to guarantee the basic rights of all people black and 
white 
no one goes to a negotiating table if he is not prepared to 
compromise he added we are prepared to meet the governments 
wishes in a compromise which is in the interest of the population 
of the country as a whole 
mandela had a long meeting thursday with president chadli 
bendjedid during which he thanked the algerian leader for support 
during his imprisonment mandela was due to meet libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi in tripoli then go to cairo to meet egyptian 
president hosni mubarak

president mikhail s gorbachev said today the 
kremlin is prepared to examine any possibility to resolve the 
dispute over lithuanias independence provided the soviet 
constitutional process is observed 
the prime minister of the baltic republic kazimiera prunskiene 
met with gorbachev on thursday and later said significant progress 
was made toward settling the dispute but their main difference 
remained unresolved 
mrs prunskiene met this afternoon with secretary of state james 
a baker iii who has said the baltic impasse was casting a shadow 
over the summit to be held later this month in washington between 
gorbachev and president bush 
mrs prunskiene said later she was convinced that baker supports 
lithuanias independence drive baker said he hoped the discussion 
between gorbachev and mrs prunskiene would lead to full 
negotiations 
tension was reported in lithuania however as soldiers shot a 
youth trying to enter a military compound and military helicopters 
dropped leaflets saying down with the government of separatists 
long live soviet lithuania 
supporters of independence gathered around the lithuanian 
parliament building to block any attempt by prosoviet forces to 
occupy it as occurred in the secessionist republic of estonia on 
tuesday said eduardas potashinskas an editor at lithuanian 
television 
gorbachev has condemned the independence declarations of 
lithuania latvia and estonia and until his meeting with mrs 
prunskiene on thursday night had refused to open talks with baltic 
leaders 
baker arrived at spaso house the home of us ambassador jack 
matlock an hour and 45 minutes late indicating that his earlier 
meeting with gorbachev had gone into overtime 
his meeting with mrs prunskiene lasted for more than an hour 
twice as long as planned and the prime minister told reporters she 
told baker about lithuanias compromise plan and her talks with 
gorbachev 
i became convinced again that the usa as well as other 
governments support the restoration of independence and the path we 
are taking she said 
baker said we had a full discussion on the situation with 
respect to the baltics particularly lithuania we are very 
hopeful as we have been for some time that a dialogue can begin 
it remains to be seen the degree to that which will be continued 
gorbachev speaking to reporters before meeting with baker this 
morning said through the constitutional process we are ready 
to consider any possibility any question 
mrs prunskiene after meeting gorbachev said progress had been 
made but that neither side suggested that the dispute had been 
settled 
the meeting late thursday followed a lithuanian offer to suspend 
laws made following its declaration of independence march 11 if 
negotiations could begin with the kremlin to resolve the standoff 
gorbachev had not met with lithuanian representatives in the 
more than two months since the republic declared independence 
instead he applied economic pressure that includes a virtual 
blockade of fuel other raw materials and manufactured goods 
the official soviet news agency tass said the lithuanian 
proposal for a compromise was a sign that certain steps had been 
made toward the normalization of the situation 
but it added prunskienes attention was drawn to the 
indispensible necessity that the lithuanian supreme soviet cancel 
or at a minimum suspend this act the independence declaration 
and all the legislative measures following it that contradict the 
soviet constitution 
mrs prunskiene speaking with reporters at the lithuanian 
mission in moscow said the republics parliament will on saturday 
consider formalizing the offer to suspend implementation of the 
declaration of independence 
this does not mean we are returning to the situation of march 
10 she told reporters underlining the lithuanian determination 
not to back away from the declaration of independence 
longinas vasiliauskas press attache of the lithuanian mission 
in moscow said mrs prunskiene called the meeting an 
introduction to coming negotiations 
mrs prunskiene declined to speculate on the exact terms that 
the lithuanian parliament would offer moscow but she said if the 
kremlin found them acceptable the two sides could name negotiating 
teams to work out hundreds of concrete problems associated with 
the declaration of independence 
earlier thursday mrs prunskiene said lithuania was willing to 
make another major concession agreeing to remain part of the 
soviet security system 
soviet authorities forcibly annexed lithuania and its sister 
republics of estonia and latvia in 1940 and the three have 
declared independence this spring

the energy department said today it agreed to 
make public the health and occupational records of 200000 people 
who have worked in the most dangerous plants in the governments 
nuclear weapons production complex 
the action which had been anticipated for several months marks 
a turning point in a long battle over government efforts to keep 
secret the data on which its own scientists have studied the health 
effects of exposure to low levels of radiation 
its a historic development said daniel berger an attorney 
for the three mile island public health fund which sued the energy 
department for release of the records in 1987 the fund was formed 
to study the health effects of radiation after the 1979 accident at 
the three mile island nuclear power plant in pennsylvania 
an agreement to settle the suit out of court was reached in late 
march and took effect today berger said 
its a done deal said mj jamison a department 
spokeswoman doe is virtually giving up all the data they were 
asked for she said 
the information was collected starting in 1965 by department 
researchers at its installations at oak ridge tenn richland 
wash and los alamos nm berger said 
the data is at the center of an international scientific debate 
about the effects on human health of chronic exposure to small 
amounts of ionizing radiation 
under terms of the settlement the department on june 18 is to 
release the health and occupational records on 50000 men and women 
who worked at the hanford nuclear weapons plant at richland which 
made plutonium for the first atomic bombs 
the records are to be released to dr alice m stewart a 
british epidemiologist and the principal investigator for the three 
mile island public health fund 
by aug 18 the department is to release data on workers at the 
oak ridge national laboratory the oak ridge gaseous diffusion 
plant and the savannah river site at aiken sc berger said 
within six months additional data is to be released for workers 
at the rocky flats plutonium processing plant near denver colo 
the mound laboratory near miamisburg ohio the pantex weapons 
assembly plant near amarillo texas the los alamos weapons design 
laboratory in new mexico and a los alamos maintenance facility 
in addition data is to be released within one year for workers 
at the fernald ohio uranium processing facility and the defunct 
mallinckrodt chemical works in st louis which purified uranium for 
the first atomic bomb berger said 
the 200000 workers represent about onethird of all the people 
who have worked at nuclear weapons plants since the 1942 
organization of the manhattan project to develop and build the 
first atomic bombs dropped on japan in 1945 
the two sides have agreed that the department may withhold 
individual identifications such as names and social security 
numbers berger said these identifications had been sought in the 
original lawsuit but he said the three mile island group decided 
to defer that issue in order to get the data quicker 
the department announced last december that it intended to 
settle the three mile island suit and release the records 
following the recommendation of a special advisory panel appointed 
by energy secretary james d watkins the panel said release of the 
records was important to restore credibility to the weapons program

a federal court ordered reuters to continue 
exchanging photographs with united press international until 
lawsuits between the news agencies are resolved 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in issuing the injunction 
thursday said upi had shown that it would suffer irreparable harm 
if the photoexchange arrangement were discontinued 
the request for the injunction stemmed from a counterclaim by 
upi to a reuters lawsuit that seeks to void the picture exchange 
the three judges of the appeals court reversed a decision made 
in march by us district judge peter k leisure denying the order 
which upi appealed leisure was directed to issue the injunction 
we believe the district court exceeded its discretion when it 
concluded that upi would not suffer immediate irreparable harm were 
the preliminary injunction denied the appeals court said in a 
written opinion 
the pictureexchange contract was made in 1984 and called for 
upi to supply reuters with photographs from the united states and 
for reuters to provide upi with pictures from other countries the 
agreement was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985 
reuters remains confident of its position we are anxious to 
get to trial where the merits of the case can be addressed 
robert crooke director of media relations for reuters america 
said 
reuters claimed the agreement is not living up to its 
expectations upi said it would lose clients and possibly go out of 
business without foreign photos from reuters 
reuters headquartered in london planned to establish its own 
network of photo gathering in the united states 
the appeals court found that leisure in denying the injunction 
had incorrectly relied on a commitment by the french news service 
agence francepresse to supply upi with foreign pictures for three 
months 
news and pictures are the lifeblood of the wire service 
industry so that interrupting the flow of pictures even briefly 
threatens a wire service companys continued viability the court 
said 
the appeals judges who ruled in the case were thomas j meskill 
richard j cardamone and lawrence w pierce

solidarity leader lech walesa today told 
workers protesting low pay that the world will turn its back on 
them unless they try to resolve disputes by discussion rather than 
demonstrations 
the shipyard workers who make an average wage of 79 a month 
briefly left their jobs today to rally in front of the managers 
office to protest higher salaries for whitecollar employees 
walesa urged them to give their own representatives and shipyard 
officials time to work things out 
if we are anarchical like this the entire world will turn its 
back on us as for not being serious he said you elected your 
representatives and you should give them a chance to solve the 
problems 
walesas talk was impromptu and came after solidarity leaders 
noticed him standing in the crowd 
the previous communist government planned to close the giant 
gdansk shipyard the birthplace of solidarity because of its 
unprofitablity but the new solidarityled government is trying to 
keep it open 
the current plan is to sell shares in the stateowned shipyard 
to private investors reserving up to 20 percent to be sold to 
employees at a discount 
the economic reforms instituted by the new government have 
caused consumer prices to soar and triggered fears of widespread 
joblessness 
the government expects 400000 to become unemployed this year 
but the actual number of jobless is expected to be much higher 
labor minister jacek kuron has said he agrees with world bank 
estimates that up to 17 million poles could be put out of work 
currently 360000 people or 2 percent of the workforce are 
unemployed

if president bush cant cut the deficit 
without a tax increase then he and his advisers should return 
their republican cards says gov judd gregg a longtime ally of 
the president 
republicans are sent to manage they are not sent to say 
lets raise taxes when we get into tough economic times gregg 
said in an interview published today in the manchester union 
leader 
the bush administration has been meeting with congressional 
leaders to map out a budget strategy for fiscal 1991 despite his 
read my lips campaign promise to avoid new taxes bush is 
believed ready to consider a tax hike 
gregg and his father former gov hugh gregg have been bush 
champions since he began seeking the presidency 
gregg who was elected governor two years ago on an antitax 
platform supported and signed into law millions of dollars worth 
of tax and fee increases earlier this year when a state budget 
deficit loomed 
gregg spokesman brian grip said today that those taxes were only 
adopted after spending cuts and moneysaving measures were taken 
gregg compared bushs budget approach unfavorably to that of 
former president reagan 
this president has had some inordinate good luck gregg 
said when ronald reagan arrived at the white house he faced an 
economic crisis of huge proportions with inflation at 12 percent 
interest rates at 22 percent and the country going into a recession 
so he had to take very tough action antagonize a lot of 
people dramatically cut spending then he came in with the 
kemproth tax cut on top of that 
gregg served four terms in congress during the reagan years 
before being elected governor in 1988 he succeeded gov john 
sununu who became bushs chief of staff 
gregg said the white house is talking about whether they can 
reduce the deficit by taking about 40 billion of spending 
out of a trilliondollar budget now if they cant do that on the 
spending side of the ledger then quite honestly they should 
return their republican cards

a waiter fired from an expensive restaurant was 
awarded 60000 in back wages by a jury that found he was the 
victim of aids discrimination 
jurors deliberated less than three hours thursday before ruling 
in favor of ronald gardner who was dismissed from the rainbow 
lodge in 1987 a judge must still approve the jurys verdict 
i hope its another tool that will be used to teach people 
theres no reason people with aids should not be treated fairly 
said rick levy an attorney for gardner 
gardner still physically capable eight years after being 
diagnosed with the deadly disease beamed after announcement of the 
verdict 
hopefully it will set a precedent with other pwas people with 
aids and any other person handicapped with any disease gardner 
said 
howard r king attorney for the rainbow lodge declined to 
comment the restaurant maintained that gardner was fired not 
because of aids but because he was late for work and sometimes 
overcharged patrons 
the lawsuit which received an expedited hearing because of 
gardners medical condition alleged violations of the texas 
commission on human rights act protecting handicapped persons and 
federal law related to an employees right to receive insurance 
benefits 
though jurors ruled the firing was discriminatory they rejected 
the argument that the restaurants actions were designed to 
interfere with gardners efforts to secure insurance benefits 
the same day the jury made its ruling the us house of 
representatives narrowly approved an amendment that if it becomes 
law could affect similar cases in the future 
by a 199187 vote the house approved an amendment thursday that 
lets employers reassign workers with contagious diseases to 
prevent them from handling food the amendment was passed despite 
opposition from the bush administration which stressed that casual 
contact does not spread aids

the army will not force a gay man 
expelled from rotc to repay a 25000 scholarship but it denied 
his request to be commissioned and serve in the military his 
lawyer said today 
the army emphasized that its decision in the case of james 
holobaugh was based solely on the merits and circumstances of 
this particular case according to a memo sent to his attorney in 
new york 
holobaugh 24 was informed thursday by telephone of the armys 
decision and a written confirmation was received today said bill 
rubenstein an attorney with the aclus lesbian and gay rights 
project 
holobaugh graduated today from washington university in st 
louis where he had been a top performer in the reserve officers 
training corps he even had appeared in an army rotc recruiting ad 
after his superiors recommended in january that he be denied his 
commission and be forced to repay his scholarship he decided to 
fulfill his remaining course requirements at the university of new 
haven 
while i am pleased i will not have to repay the money i am 
terribly disappointed that the army has not seen fit to grant me a 
commission and to allow me to serve my country holobaugh said in 
a statement released by his attorney 
my case only serves to underscore the wastefulness of the 
militarys ban on lesbians and gay men he said 
holobaugh said he intended to continue to pursue his commission 
and his efforts to have the military abandon a policy that is 
rooted in ignorance and prejudice 
the victory is significant because it shows that there are 
limits to the militarys meanspiritedness rubenstein said 
an engineering student holobaugh was scheduled to receive his 
army commission last may a year before his graduation but after 
informing his superiors a month earlier that he had come to realize 
he was gay no commission was forthcoming 
earlier this month the navy announced it was dropping its bid 
to force repayment of tuition from two cadets expelled from its 
officer training program in that case too the navy emphasized 
there had been no change in the pentagons ban on homosexuals in 
the military 
rubenstein said the decision in the holobaugh case was the 
result of pressure generated by 24 congressmen who wrote to the 
army on holobaughs behalf and a number of colleges including 
washington university

secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze reported progress today 
toward reaching an agreement to reduce strategic nuclear weapons 
i have always believed the main points will be agreed upon 
shevardnadze said things are moving in that direction 
baker also gave an upbeat assessment after nearly five hours of 
talks with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev we made some 
progress we still have a number of issues that are still out 
there he said 
on another arms control front shevardnadze told reporters that 
major progress has been made on a ussoviet accord to end 
production of chemical weapons 
baker took time out to meet with prime minister kazimiera 
prunskiene of lithuania and then returned to the bargaining table 
with shevardnadze 
the goal is agreement on reducing us and soviet longrange 
missiles bombers and submarines in time for gorbachevs summit 
with president bush in washington may 31june 3 
we did a lot shevardnadze said we accomplished a lot 
today 
bush last week offered to halt us production of chemical 
weapons if the soviets were willing to schedule the destruction of 
their poison gas stockpiles shevardnadze gave no details of the 
emerging accord 
asked whether an agreement on key issues would be ready for the 
summit baker replied we keep hoping we can accomplish that 
earlier in the kremlin gorbachev said his side was doing its 
best to stitch together an agreement he had been accused of 
backsliding by the bush administration before bakers arrival here 
tuesday 
the soviet leader said he did not know if the goal would be met 
but told reporters i think we are moving closer 
similarly mixed signals came from the us side where officials 
spoke both of continuing gaps and of hopes for accord without a 
compromise on air and sealaunched cruise missiles and other 
disputed weapons the summit will lack the dramatic centerpiece 
president bush and gorbachev anticipated 
after the gorbachev meeting baker saw mrs prunskiene thereby 
giving at least symbolic us support to lithuanias independence 
drive 
we are still very hopeful as we have been for some time that 
a dialogue can begin baker said of the longheld us hope that 
the soviets would negotiate terms for independence with the baltics 
mrs prunskiene met thursday with gorbachev who then discussed 
the situation in the baltics with baker 
it remains to be seen the degree to which that will be 
continued baker said without explanation 
gorbachev is trying to keep the soviet union from splintering as 
he struggles to vitalize the economy and expand political freedom 
asked to respond to analysts who say he is having trouble 
keeping his head above water gorbachev shot back they should 
follow closely what is happening in the soviet union and they 
should objectively reflect on what is happening in this country 
they should not panic more than the soviets do he said with 
a smile 
turning to arms control gorbachev said he did not know if key 
issues in a strategic arms reduction talks start treaty could be 
concluded by the summit 
we are doing our best to make sure that we agree gorbachev 
said we have to do this together 
bakers meeting with mrs prunskiene drew no apparent objections 
from the soviet leader 
we are not seeking to send any message by meeting with her 
a senior us official said thursday night it obviously gives us 
a chance to hear more about her concerns 
the official said baker would extend his visit beyond saturday 
after there was a chance of an arms accord 
the work is intense right now said the official who 
briefed reporters under rules guaranteeing him anonymity we are 
really slogging through a lot i think it is fair to say that if 
the gap was seen as being unbridgeable we wouldnt be working 
intensively 
when baker told shevardnadze that he would see mrs prunskiene 
his reaction was a nonreaction the official said 
the prime minister saw gorbachev in the kremlin thursday 
evening reversing the soviet leaders refusal to meet with the 
leaders of the secessionist republics of lithuania latvia and 
estonia 
gorbachev had demanded that lithuania revoke its march 11 
declaration of independence but on thursday he asked merely for a 
suspension mrs prunskiene told reporters 
even so the senior us official insisted the soviets had not 
met bakers demand for a dialogue with the baltic leaders 
it is not enough simply to talk about a need for dialogue 
he said you have to do something that makes it happen and they 
are continuing to stick to a position that accepts dialogue but 
only under certain conditions 
when baker arrived tuesday from washington the request from mrs 
prunskiene for a meeting was given to him by us ambassador jack 
f matlock jr she had earlier met in washington with bush but her 
talk with baker in the soviet capital amid summit preparations 
put an interesting twist on the situation 
baker has already informed the soviets that failure to resolve 
the dispute with the baltics could interfere with an improvement in 
ussoviet relations at the summit

the state department today won the right to 
use evidence gathered through electronic surveillance in 
proceedings to dismiss suspected spy felix s bloch from the 
foreign service 
a federal judge said in an order released today that the 
electronic surveillances were conducted lawfully under the foreign 
intelligence surveillance act 
us district judge stanley harris rejected a contention by 
blochs attorneys that the surveillances were illegal and could not 
be used in the state department dismissal hearing 
the proceeding had been scheduled to begin last week but was 
postponed pending court action on the case 
while not charged with any crime bloch has been suspected by 
the fbi of selling secrets to the soviet union when he was posted 
in europe as a diplomat most recently at the us embassy in 
vienna 
bloch a 30year veteran of the diplomatic corps was placed on 
administrative leave last june after the investigation began 
on feb 8 the state department said it had suspended blochs 
annual salary of 80700 and would seek to dismiss him from the 
foreign service 
the fbi conducted extensive surveillance of bloch last summer 
while the case was under active investigation 
the surveillance ended late last year after the bureau decided 
it was unlikely it could prove that bloch passed classified 
information to the soviet union according to law enforcement 
sources 
the judge also denied a request by blochs lawyers to inspect 
all tapes and transcipts of conversations recorded during the 
surveillance 
the justice department had argued that giving bloch more 
information about the surveillance would hurt national security 
harris found that bloch is not entitled to any further secret 
information obtained by or related to the electronic surveillance

about 40 domestic flights were canceled

traffic controllers refused to work overtime friday officials said 
at the moment it is impossible to say for how long this 
situation will continue said rune andersson chief of air 
traffic control at arlanda airport outside stockholm 
the controllers are negotiating for higher pay for the extra 
hours saying they are shortstaffed because authorities failed to 
anticipate increased air traffic 
the negotiations could last through the month andersson said 
andersson said a 1983 study had predicted air traffic would 
decline and fewer controllers were trained 
instead the air traffic has increased tremendously and that is 
why we have problems now andersson said he said it takes four 
years to recruit and train a controller

the city is moving its fourth of july 
celebrations to july 3 because of higher overtime rates in a new 
contract to police officers 
the switch will save about 16000 in police salaries and 4000 
in pay to other city workers said james turner the citys chief 
administrative officer an arbitration panel in february awarded 
the fraternal order of police a 5 percent salary increase for each 
of the next two years along with substantial increases in overtime 
pay differentials 
we realize there will be some pain in the short notice we had 
to give this year on the switch but the fop arbitration award was 
beyond our wildest nightmare coming in at double what we had 
projected turner said 
the contract requires the city to compensate 16 hours of pay to 
officers called to work on their day off the former contract 
mandated only six hours as long as we have to live with an 
arbitration award like this the fourth of july is going to be on 
the third of july mayoral spokesman albert j neri said there 
actually was serious consideration given to scrapping the 
celebration 
patrick mcnamarah president of the police union said there are 
190 officers working on the fourth of july and 160 officers on 
july 3 he said the city will not save money by moving the 
celebration but in fact will spend more because they will have to 
call at least 30 more officers into work on july 3 
parks director louise brown said the switch will encourage 
people to remain downtown for the celebration and spend money at 
restaurants and other businesses before the concert 
and since most offices are closed the following day the 
public can celebrate during the july 3 evening and still have the 
following day to spend with friends and family ms brown said 
tom casciotti manager of the georgetowne inn atop mount 
washington which overlooks downtown pittsburgh said the change 
may cause the restaurant to rethink its plans 
the restaurant was to be closed on july 4 when hordes of 
sightseers come to mount washington to view the fireworks 
the change will be more trouble than its worth casciotti 
said i really think the fireworks should be on the fourth 
the fourth is the fourth everybodys off on the fourth

a prosecutor said today he wont press 
charges against a man whose rubbish fire allegedly touched off a 
forest fire last week that left scores of people homeless 
crawford county prosecutor john huss said he believes a fire the 
homeowner set march 16 smoldered underground for two months before 
rekindling once on april 16 and again may 8 the day of the forest 
fire 
the cause involved an incredibly bizarre set of circumstances 
and leads me to conclude that there was no criminal 
violation huss said 
huss made his decision thursday afternoon and notified 
department of natural resources officials in lansing before making 
it public today 
dnr agents investigating the may 8 fire had asked huss for a 
criminal warrant said regional division supervisor capt hr hill 
in roscommon 
michigan foresters from the beginning said the blaze likely 
started with flying embers from a rubbish fire 
the fire destroyed 81 homes 115 other buildings and 37 boats 
and vehicles it cut an eightmile path through the woods burning 
about 6000 acres of woodland including about 300 acres of nesting 
ground for the endangered kirtlands warbler 
about half the people who lost their homes were yearround 
residents many of them elderly and underinsured authorities said 
red cross officials said thursday they still are determining how 
many people were left homeless 
crawford county officials estimate the loss is 35 million 
excluding timber value they said property values in the region 
will remain depressed for years

federal agents who suspected that 
smugglers had developed an underground pipeline crossing the 
mexican border found a tunnel today like something out of a james 
bond movie a customs spokeswoman said 
the tunnel was about the length of a football field and 30 feet 
underground judy turner a customs spokeswoman in houston said in 
telephone interviews 
she said it was 5 feet high 4 feet wide well lighted and had 
concrete piers for support at various points were compartments 
where up to five tons of drugs could be stashed 
one entrance was in a douglas warehouse about 200 feet north of 
the border and the other was in a house in agua prieta mexico 
only 73 feet south of the fence that separates the border cities 
ms turner said 
the house featured a compressoroperated system of hydraulic 
jacks that raised and lowered the entire floor of the structure for 
entrance to the tunnel 
it was just an exceptionally professionally engineered 
tunnel ms turner said it was something that you and i in the 
ordinary world would only find in the movies it was like something 
out of a james bond movie 
it also points up the fact of why the southwest border is

the leftist 
presidential candidate claimed he was trailing in the vote count 
because of election fraud and called for street protests today but 
dominicans returned to work instead 
with nearly 80 percent of the polling stations reporting 
conservative president joaquin balaguer led his leftist opponent 
juan bosch by more than than 11000 votes according to the 
central electoral board 
bosch on thursday charged colossal fraud in vote counting 
and said he would call for street protests today no matter what 
the consequences 
but former president jimmy carter one of 30 international 
election observers said thursday he saw no evidence of fraud or 
manipulation in the vote count he urged the candidates to remain 
calm and wait for final results 
there were no signs early today that police were preparing for 
any protests and there were no large gatherings at boschs party 
headquarters 
but there was a disturbance when bosch arrived at the 
headquarters 
army sources said a military intelligence agent was disarmed and 
roughed up by boschs followers but there were conflicting reports 
about what happened 
boschs followers said the man drew a revolver as the candidate 
stepped out of his vehicle an army spokesman confirmed the man was 
a military intelligence agent but denied that he had drawn a weapon 
the spokesman said the agent was disarmed and beaten by boschs 
followers when they noticed he was armed he said the man was 
slightly injured and rushed to a hospital in a police car bosch 
then met with party officials 
for the first time since wednesdays vote commuters filled the 
streets although the day after an election is not an official 
holiday dominicans traditionally stay home to await the returns 
bosch 80 a former president overthrown by a 1963 military 
coup called a news conference to protest the vote count after 
losing a narrow early lead to balaguer the blind 83yearold 
incumbent 
he accused both balaguer and the election board of fraud 
the electoral board announced on television thursday night that 
election law barred any public demonstrations while the vote count 
continued the announcement was repeated several times 
the election pis the rivals for the presidency of the caribbean 
nation against each other for a fifth time balaguer has won three 
of those races 
with 5522 of the 6663 polling stations reporting balaguer had 
543610 votes and bosch 532340 official results showed jose 
francisco pena gomez a former bosch protege was a distant third 
with 356593 
about 32 million people were registered to vote nationwide 
on thursday bosch said the central electoral board and dr 
balaguer committed a colossal fraud 
we are announcing that pdl is going into the streets because 
the people have been cheated bosch said referring to his 
dominican liberation party what remains of my life has no 
meaning if this fraud takes place 
but pena gomez a former socialist mayor of santo domingo said 
the election board had agreed to review each polling stations 
tally sheet he said he proposed the review to balaguer 
president balaguer accepted the proposal and said he was 
disposed to accept that international observers participate in the 
verification of the sheets pena gomez said 
he earlier urged bosch to withdraw his call for street protests 
which he said could cause a bloodbath 
and i ask balaguer not to bring out the armed forces to 
confront protesters pena gomez told reporters 
balaguer made no immediate comment he has remained out of 
public view since casting his ballot wednesday soldiers guarded 
his residence 
officials of boschs party met thursday with six of the 30 
international observers monitoring the election oscar ayerve of 
ecuador said there was concern over the slow vote count but he did 
not elaborate 
before the election bosch said his party had information that 
balaguers social christian reformist party had prepared 300000 
phony ballots to rig the election a charge denied by balaguer 
party officials 
bosch an author intellectual and selfdescribed marxist ran 
on a moderate platform endorsing capitalism as the best way to 
improve his countrys economic plight 
balaguer was first elected president in 1966 and served three 
consecutive fouryear terms before losing in 1978 he was 
reelected in 1986 
over the past four years he has presided over a 2 billion 
publicworks project to transform centuriesold santo domingo the 
project has created thousands of jobs but economic problems

east german worker alfons domke is 
already worried his 8monthold daughter will one day be tempted by 
illegal drugs like those plaguing the west and he fears 
unification might cost his wifes job 
hotel executive gabriele gaertner says she worries that 40 
percent of east germanys workers will lose their jobs as the 
coming merger with west germany forces a widespread economic 
shakeout 
talks with ordinary east germans reveal growing fears among a 
people who for 40 years lived a nearly cocoonlike existence that 
some west germans scornfully call the sleep of sleeping beauty 
its a long way from last falls scenes of east germans 
clamoring for freedom and a chance to follow western ways 
things are just going too quickly said ms gaertner public 
relations manager at one of east germanys most successful hotels 
before people said they needed to travel or have a car but 
thats not so important now now existence is whats important 
increasingly there are nationwide signs of those concerns 
for more than a week east german teachers railroad workers 
farmers and textile workers have held sporadic strikes to demand 
job protection as the nations are unified 
east german voters march 18 gave the conservatives the upper 
hand in this country of 166 million people after hearing west 
german chancellor helmut kohls stump speeches and promises of 
prosperity 
now east germans are learning that prosperity wont come 
easily and there have been estimates that hundreds of thousands 
will be out of work and living on unemployment benefits for several 
years 
ms gaertner an executive at the elegant schloss cecilienhof 
hotel in potsdam just outside berlin said one of her neighbors got 
caught in a double squeeze related to unification he will lose his 
job at an outmoded business on july 1 and a west german has shown 
up to reclaim the property where he lives 
the 37yearold woman bristles at west german suggestions that 
their east german cousins are lazy and unwilling to put in the long 
hours needed to rebuild their country 
some of the things you hear from the west germans at the 
reception desk on the weekends just arent that nice she said 
ms gaertner said she fears 40 percent layoffs in many sectors 
particularly in the creaking and antiquated factories in the south 
she said that could lead to dissatisfaction and possibly unrest 
a department chief in one of east germanys government 
ministries agrees despite west german promises of investments and 
new jobs 
yes with 25 percent unemployment i fear there could be a lot 
of unrest said the government worker who spoke on condition of 
anonymity he told the associated press that whole businesses 
likely will start to go under within weeks after east germany 
adopts the west german currency on july 2 
domke works 12 hours a day as a parking lot attendant in 
potsdam his dream is to open a private taxi business that one day 
will expand into a bus company 
this is a time of great uncertainty because no one knows 
whats really coming but its also a time of great joy now that we 
can travel freely to the west the 24yearold father said in 
between collecting money from drivers 
but he too has worries 
domke said illegal drugs are already coming in from west berlin 
and he fears they could become a scourge by the time his baby 
nancy grows up 
drugs yes thats my first worry for her he said then 
of course crime is up 
his wife nicole who is about to turn 21 is enjoying a 
governmentguaranteed paid year off after nancys birth but she is 
afraid the shop where she worked as a hairdresser wont need her 
when she returns in august 
domke says potsdam a town of 150000 has 20000 unemployed 
people official statistics say there were about 65000 people out 
of work nationwide last month although the actual number is 
believed to be far higher than that 
helmut knerich a stateemployed building engineer from the 
nearby town of werder is careful to say he is worried but not 
afraid about his continued future employment 
knerich 53 claims the former communist party and the social 
democrats are trying to drive up the fears the former because of 
opposition to unification and the latter in hopes of slowing down 
the pace 
the leftistleaning social democrats are part of east germanys 
coalition government but have hinted at a pullout if the headlong 
rush to unification goes unchecked 
the government has tried to calm the fears 
prime minister lothar de maiziere during the signing of a 
treaty that will bring the two nations closer together said friday 
the pact will not fulfill all of east germans flowery dreams 
but he pledged that no one will be worse off than before

the unfolding processes in the baltic states simply cannot be 
reversed any more goncz said he told bush 
the two leaders spoke as soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and lithuanian officials appeared to be making progress on a 
dialogue to resolve the volatile situation lithuania appears to be 
toning down its effort to secede from the soviet union

agreed that soviet troop withdrawal from czechoslovakia and 
hungary and other countries of the region should proceed as 
concluded in the different bilateral agreements and we also agreed 
that this topic would be discussed at the summit

dialogue between soviet and lithuania leaders as a prerequisite 
for creating a stable environment in which the countries of central 
and eastern europe can consolidate their democratic reforms

presence in europe including a military presence as a guarantee of 
stability white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said in a

status by the soviet union which wants a unified germany to be 
neutral or a member of both the north atlantic treaty organization 
and the warsaw pact

but he also urged that the alliance concentrate more on its 
political role rather than its military one

battlescarred labor movement veterans say the 
greyhound drivers strike may be languishing because their union 
wasnt fully prepared when it struck the nations largest bus line 
march 2 
union leaders say however that their 6300 members were 
wellequipped when they walked off their jobs drivers were forced 
to strike because they had taken wage cuts for a decade and the 
company was trying to implement horrendous wage rules they say 
anybody can be that monday morning quarterback and say youre 
not prepared but if you have no choice you have to strike said 
ellis b franklin vice president of the amalgamated transit union 
greyhound has hired 3000 replacement workers and declared the 
strike over 
as the union now struggles to keep the walkout alive its 
facing critics from inside organized labor at the same time it 
confronts management 
here we have a company that relies on workingclass people for 
its riders yet we havent gotten the message out hey dont ride 
greyhound nobody wins when a company treats its workers like 
this said one union official who asked to remain unidentified 
critics note that the amalgamated transit unions quick decision 
to walk out contrasts with the pittston coal strike last year when 
miners worked without a contract for more than a year before 
walking out 
at the aflcios annual retreat last february in bal harbour 
fla striketested organized labor leaders cautioned the greyhound 
union about the perils of striking say sources familiar with the 
private meeting 
there was a concern that these guys just werent ready for 
allout war said a source speaking anonymously 
earlier this week the union won a key national labor relations 
board decision that could eventually force the company to hire back 
strikers but greyhound plans to appeal the ruling which could 
drag out the dispute for months or even years 
the labor movement trying to rebound from a loss of stature in 
the 1980s has been pushing unions to use more sophisticated 
strategies to avoid strikes yet gain new and better contracts 
in last years pittston strike for example miners worked 
without a contract for 14 months while building support among 
communities church groups and other unions 
miners eventually won key bargaining issues after a 10month 
strike that sparked sympathy strikes in several states 
greyhound drivers in contrast walked right into the hands of 
the company by striking the day their contract expired one union 
official said 
victor kamber a labor public relations specialist said the 
drivers union should have had a strategy rather than sitting at 
a table pounding your fists and saying were going to walk 
union officials acknowledge they were caught somewhat off guard 
in the weeks leading up to the strike but say it was because they 
underestimated managements resolve not to bargain 
i guess said edward m strait president of the amalgamated 
council of local greyhound unions we didnt want to believe it 
greyhound drivers could have moved more quickly to enlist help 
from the rest of the labor movement as workers at the new york 
daily news have done analysts said 
even though daily news employees are still working as they try 
to resolve a contract dispute the aflcio already has printed 
bumper stickers in support of the unions involved 
daily news workers have dealt with kambers public relations 
company since november the greyhound drivers did not retain help 
for publicity until a few days before the strike 
union leaders who defend the strike note that in past disputes 
such as the pittston strike pundits were quick to declare a 
management victory only to see the situation reverse itself later 
everybody was writing the mine workers epitaph a few months 
into that strike too its real easy to secondguess and say 
they shouldnt have struck they should have done this said 
john duray of the united mine workers 
greyhound spokesman george gravley denied that the company tried 
to break the union and said the company was forced to look for 
other workers when union members refused a what he called a 
fairwage proposal 
they priced themselves right out of the market gravley said

a 19yearold was convicted in the shooting 
death of a black teenager set upon by a white gang last summer a 
murder that brought simmering racial tensions to a boil in the 
nations biggest city 
joseph fama was convicted thursday of seconddegree murder by 
depraved indifference for the aug 23 death of 16yearold yusuf 
hawkins a mob of 30 batwielding youths attacked hawkins when he 
entered the mostly white bensonhurst neighborhood of brooklyn with 
three friends to buy a used car 
the bensonhurst case has been watched closely by the city it 
may have contributed indirectly to the election of new yorks first 
black mayor and many feared an acquittal in the case could have 
led to violent outbreaks 
fama shook his head slightly then stared at the floor as the 
jury convicted him of the murder charge and 12 lesser charges 
he was acquitted of seconddegree intentional murder and 
criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree jurors said 
they convicted fama despite a disagreement over whether he fired 
the gun 
fama faces 25 years to life in prison when sentenced june 11 by 
judge thaddeus owens 
a second panel deciding the fate of codefendant keith mondello 
resumed deliberations late this morning for an 11th day about half 
an hour later the jurors asked the judge for a definition of 
unlawful imprisonment one of the lesser charges mondello faces 
and owens listed seven criteria 
mondello also 19 is charged with two counts of seconddegree 
murder manslaughter and other crimes in the attack four other 
youths face trial later 
we hope that this is the last time we ever have to try one of 
these cases said assistant district attorney james kohler but 
something tells me that well be back here again trying another one 
of these cases until people learn how to get along with one 
another and stop all of this racial hatred 
many said the shooting helped end the 12year reign of mayor ed 
koch by convincing democratic voters to select david dinkins his 
more softspoken opponent in the september primary dinkins went on 
to become the citys first black mayor 
although fama was accused of pulling a 32caliber automatic 
pistol and firing four shots two of them through hawkins heart 
jurors said they were not convinced that he was the triggerman 
but they said his decision to join the white mob in the attack 
was sufficient to find him guilty of murder for participating in 
the slaying 
if he wasnt an active participant he could have gone home 
said steven berquist a telephone company employee who said he was 
the last one of the 12 panelists to be convinced of famas guilt 
hawkins parents moses stewart and diane hawkins sat holding 
hands as jury forewoman tonya bailey delivered the verdict in the 
packed fourthfloor courtroom 
when the first guilty verdict was read stewart let out a quick 
yeah several of the 12 jurors who had deliberated for 10 
days wiped tears away as the forewoman spoke 
dinkins said the verdict was an occasion to begin healing the 
citys racial wounds 
yusuf hawkins died of racism in the first degree he said 
more than 20 years ago dr martin luther king jr envisioned a 
promised land where people would be judged by the content of their 
character rather than the color of their skin 
i can think of no greater tribute to yusuf or to his family 
nor a nobler quest for the people of our city than for us to use 
this opportunity to try to make dr kings dream a reality 
famas defense lawyer david depetris blamed the verdict on 
owens instructions to the jury which he called substantially 
onesided he said he planned an appeal 
famas family retreated to a thirdfloor corridor refusing to 
speak to reporters fama was led away in handcuffs and returned to 
the brooklyn house of detention where he has been held since a 
week after the murder 
the hawkins family and friends holding hands with their 
adviser the rev al sharpton quietly walked out of the courtroom 
outside stewart raised a clenched fist to the croud of about 150 
supporters who shouted yusuf yusuf 
this is a victory for the people said dave walker an 
investigator for a brooklyn civil rights group the tensions 
high throughout the city throughout the whole country all 
communities needed the verdict 
famas bensonhurst neighbors were defensive 
he was a good boy ive known him 20 years said famas 
nextdoor neighbor a woman who refused to be identified we all 
felt sad that the kid died but they didnt have enough evidence 
prosecutors allege mondello assembled a gang from the 
neighborhood because he was afraid that black and hispanic friends 
of a young neighborhood woman gina feliciano were coming to beat 
him up

us courthouse conducting the first days work of the grand jury 
no witnesses were called before the panel immediately

poindexter was convicted of five felonies last month in the 
irancontra scandal and faces sentencing june 11 north is

compel their testimony before a new grand jury in connection with 
walshs probe

prosecuted excongressman pat swindall for perjury gillen 38 
worked in the us attorneys office in atlanta for 11 years

formula manufacturer 
ricky irby sr 29 could face the death penalty lake county 
associate judge harry hartel who presided over a twoweek 
nonjury trial set a sentencing hearing for june 29 
irby and the childs mother sheila smith both were charged in 
the death of quinten irby the infant who was 3 months old when he 
was forcefed sulfuric acid may 31 1984 lived for 27 months at 
childrens memorial hospital in chicago he died aug 26 1986 
ms smith already has pleaded guilty in return for a 20 to 
65year prison sentence 
irbys attorneys contended that the father had nothing to do 
with the crime prosecutors contended that the couple poisoned the 
baby with the intent of suing a baby formula manufacturer

which had been tested by a toxicologist was discovered missing

the catastrophic eruption of mount st 
helens 10 years ago taught scientists and ordinary citizens lessons 
that can save lives geologists told a symposium near the volcano 
today 
it caught our attention and the worlds attention and we 
learned a great deal said robert christiansen chief of volcano 
hazards for the us geological survey it raises a lot of 
awareness of volcanism 
christiansen told a ten years later symposium on the 
anniversary of the blast that lessons from mount st helens apply 
to other volcanos especially in the cascade mountains of the 
northwestern united states 
before mount st helens volcanos were seen as something from 
the dinosaur era interesting but something that happened 
somewhere else it caught everyone by surprise even the 
geologists who work on it christiansen said 
this is the first time weve had a real laboratory in modern 
us history to study volcanos emergency reponse to eruptions and 
the rebirth of a blast zone said cowlitz county commissioner van 
youngquist 
our entire state is in a better position now whether its 
st helens or another cascade volcano that erupts he said 
scientists recounted the earthquake pattern before mount st 
helens erupted may 18 1980 with the fury of 2500 hiroshima bombs 
the eruption which killed 57 people and scarred a oncelush 
landscape still evokes searing memories but the commemoration also 
celebrates natures recovery power 
about 400 people who participated in the rescue and recovery 
operations were expected at a reunion dinner here tonight 
the southwest washington hamlet of toutle is staging a special 
edition of its volcano daze festival on saturday and sunday hoping 
for thousands of visitors 
us rep jolene unsoeld dwash and other dignitaries planned 
to dedicate a 500 million dam saturday on the north fork of the 
toutle river the dam is designed to keep 258 million cubic yards 
of volcanic sediment from clogging rivers and flooding lowlands 
the weyerhaeuser co which says it lost 68 million worth of 
its trees in the eruption is giving dignitaries tours to show the 
greening of more than 45000 acres it has replanted 
youngquist toured the volcano area by air thursday 
going back now i can never forget what it looked like when i 
got a helicopter tour the morning after the eruption he said 
it was very eerie a strong sulfur smell from the crater 
vehicles with victims in them it was a shocking feeling one can 
never forget 
but there is also a sense of renewal you can see insects 
and birds and wildlife 
federal state and local governments have spent more than 1 
billion on rescue recovery and reconstruction since the blast 
officials at the main visitor center at castle rock are girding 
for a major tourism boom as the slumbering volcano returns to the 
front pages and news broadcasts about 500000 visitors come each 
year about 50000 have scaled the 8363foot peak since it was 
reopened to climbers three years ago 
most folks seem to remember precisely where they were on that 
quiet sunday morning when the mountain erupted a few months after 
waking from a centurylong slumber the mountain blew its top at 
832 am on may 18 1980 
with the energy of a nuclear warhead of as much as 50 megatons 
the eruption ripped off 1315 feet of the previously coneshaped 
peak 
the eruption sent ash plumes miles into the atmosphere and ash 
clouds turned day into night in eastern washington the blast 
devastated more than 230 square miles in a fanshaped swath north 
and northwest of the volcano 
although part of the new 110000acre national volcanic monument 
looks like a lunar landscape life is returning some trees planted 
after the eruption are 30 feet tall

japanese magnate ryoei saito says van goghs 
portrait of dr gachet cost about 33 million more than he had 
expected but it did not rattle him he already had another huge 
art buy in mind 
saito made artworld waves with his purchase tuesday of the 
haunting van gogh portrait for 825 million the highest price 
ever paid for a painting at auction 
he followed up thursday by buying renoirs au moulin de la 
galette for 781 million the secondhighest auction price for a 
painting 
the 74yearold saito is one of japans wealthiest men but the 
public knows little of his private life 
still the few available glimpses offer some intriguing 
contrasts 
he believes the two paintings are among the most beautiful to be 
found anywhere but says they will probably spend several years 
locked up in a storeroom before being put on public display 
he wields immense power as a businessman but his sons not he 
are formally in charge of his company 
art is his passion but he once sold off a large part of his 
collection to help his ailing company 
and while he is casual now about spending millions in a single 
stroke he resigned the presidency of his company eight years ago 
to take personal responsibility for its sagging fortunes 
saito said in a rare telephone interview friday night that he 
had long ago set his heart on the two paintings 
au moulin de la galette a shimmering impressionist canvas 
depicts a sunny garden in montmartre filled with dancing couples 
the men in black frocks and yellow hats and the women in pink and 
blue gowns 
dr gachet is a melancholy portrait of the doctor who 
treated the artist in the weeks before his suicide 
they are worldclass wonderful works saito said 
even so the stratospheric prices stunned participants at spring 
auctions in new york this week auctioneers had expected the works 
would sell for 40 million to 50 million each 
before the auctions saito reportedly told his representative 
gallery owner hideto kobayashi that no price was too high to pay 
but he told newspaper reporters after buying the van gogh it 
cost 5 billion yen 33 million more than i expected but thats 
nothing 
saitos nonchalance about the price paid for the paintings may 
not sit well with japanese government officials and business 
leaders who are calling on compatriots to keep a lower profile 
when it comes to big buys overseas 
the japanese were worried by american reactions to sonys 
purchase of colombia pictures and mitsubishi estates buy of part 
of rockefeller plaza in new york city they feared such purchases 
could provoke an antijapanese backlash 
but saito is far from shy about displaying his wealth he said 
official fears of how highrolling japanese are viewed would not 
affect his purchasing plans 
im not concerned because this is all one big world he 
said 
saito chairman emeritus of japans secondbiggest paper 
company is often on lists of japans wealthiest people he has 
vast holdings in real estate and his financial assets should be 
more than enough to pay for the works analysts say 
saito is the patriarch of a powerful family that controls the 
daishowa paper manufacturing co he was its president from 1961 to 
1982 when he resigned to take responsibility for a business slump 
and subsequently sold off much of his art collection to revive the 
paper concern 
now he is said to be the companys de facto chief with two 
sons acting as president and chairman his younger brother is state 
governor of shizuoka prefuecture where the saito clan resides and 
daishowa has one of its corporate headquarters 
by the late 1980s the business had revived sufficiently to 
allow saito to move into collecting circles again but he says he 
owns only a few artworks including a chagall and an andrew wyeth 
painting 
although he plans to keep the paintings under wraps initially 
saito promises they will someday be on public view perhaps he 
says in new yorks metropolitan museum or perhaps in a small 
museum in his home prefecture

the popular head start preschool program 
celebrated its 25th anniversary friday with officials saying they 
were closer than ever to their dreams of obtaining full federal 
funding 
head start is an american success story for millions of 
children said eugenia boggus president of the national head 
start association which released a report marking the programs 
anniversary 
it is time that this very successful program receive the 
financial support it needs to ensure quality and to serve all 
eligible children ms boggus said 
the report called for full funding for the program with some of 
the money earmarked for staff training increased wages 
transportation and maintenance of facilities 
head start was signed into existence by president lyndon johnson 
to provide education meals and health screening for youngsters 
aged 3 through 5 
over the years more than 11 million children and their families 
have received head start services in all 50 states the district of 
columbia puerto rico the virgin islands and the pacific 
territories 
ms boggus said two of her seven children now ranging in age 
from 12 to 25 had been enrolled in head start and the difference 
between those who attended and those who did not was remarkable 
she said the head start enrollees entered regular public school 
with positive selfesteem and confidence her daughter now in the 
fifth grade is a top student and welladjusted socially she said 
sharon kagan director of a child development center at yale 
university and a member of head starts silver ribbon panel said 
there are about 2 million eligible children ages 35 who need head 
start yet the program only serves 450000 children in that age 
group 
the house passed a bill wednesday that would expand head start 
fivefold over the next four years to include all eligible 
children the legislation passed 40414 and sent to the senate 
would authorize up to 24 billion for head start in the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 thats 1 billion more than the current 
years spending level 
we feel very positive about it project director joan 
lombardi said of the legislation but acknowledged that 
authorization of funding does not mean congress will actually 
appropriate the money 
she said head start programs have a harder time recruiting and 
retaining qualified staff due to low wages and need to serve an 
increasing number of multiproblem families in addition costs of 
facilities transportation and other nonpersonnel items are 
escalating 
additional funding also is critically needed to allow local 
programs to provide fullday services she said as more and more 
head start parents are working fullday head start programs become 
essential the report said 
only 15 percent of head start programs are fullday 
the percentage of children in poverty has escalated and the 
problems of poor children today are more complex than those of a 
quartercentury ago more and more children must deal with 
problems of drugs and violence in their communities and with 
homelessness child abuse and teenage parenthood said sen 
edward kennedy dmass 
for millions of these children head start is their best hope 
for the future

tires and hurling rocks at police on the 10th anniversary of the 
nations bloodiest uprising 
down with roh taewoo the crowd screamed waving red 
yellow and blue banners yankee go home they shouted in an 
outpouring of rage against president roh and the us military 
forces stationed in south korea 
nationwide about 70000 police were deployed in a show of force 
to prevent violence officials said in seoul about 12000 riot 
police guarded government offices public buildings and foreign 
legations 
the violence erupted after some 100000 people rallied downtown 
to mark the may 18 1980 prodemocracy uprising in this provincial 
city which seared the pysche of koreans more than any incident 
since the 1950 korean war 
kwangju police reported arrests and injuries friday but gave no 
details one man with blood over his face was rushed to a hospital 
in an ambulance 
a threehour nighttime rally began peacefully people demanded 
the ouster of the roh government and the 43000 american troops in 
south korea under a mutual defense treaty 
roh a former army general is extremely unpopular in kwangju 
because of his alleged role in crushing the 1980 revolt militarily 
he was a key member of the thenmartiallaw government that quelled 
it 
that uprising began when hundreds of thousands of citizens rose 
up against the central government to protest a crackdown on 
political dissent protesters drove out police and took control of 
the city for 10 days before being crushed by tankled paratroopers 
by official count about 200 people were killed and more than 
1700 others injured or wounded kwangju citizens claim the death 
toll was much higher 
antius sentiment is also strong among kwangju citizens 
because many believe washington condoned the ruthless crushing of 
the revolt 
after the initial nighttime rally about 7000 people marched 
along downtown streets shouting antigovernment and antius 
slogans when blocked by squads of riot police near a district head 
office of rohs ruling party protests turned violent 
protesters broke sidewalks into fistsized rocks and threw them 
at riot police who responded with barrages of tear gas onlookers 
gagged by the choking tear gas rushed for cover 
demonstrators piled dozens of tires on several intersections and 
set them ablaze belching smoke billowed over much of the city 
center 
elsewhere in the city groups of protesters ranging from 500 to 
2000 clashed with riot police hurling rocks some protesters 
broke telephone booths and ripped apart street signs no firebombs 
were used 
in several encounters police were outnumbered by swarms of 
protesters hurling hundreds of rocks at a time some police were 
overpowered by demonstrators and beaten 
the clashes continued for more than two hours until after 
midnight 
in seoul about 2000 students hurling rocks and firebombs 
fought riot police in scattered street battles about 500 students 
were arrested in a preventive police move against violence but most 
were released later 
disband the dlp students shouted referring to rohs ruling 
democratic liberal party formed early this year in a controversial 
political merger involving two opposition groups 
the rallies in kwangju followed a memorial ceremony at 
mangwoldong cemetery a hillside graveyard where victims of the 
revolt are buried thousands braved downpours to offer prayers to 
the memory of the victims and burn an effigy of roh clad in a 
military uniform 
my child my child cried an old woman in white mourning 
clothes rubbing a gray tombstone bearing the name of her 17year 
daughter killed in the revolt 
a few yards away about 20 youths placed a bundle of yellow 
flowers in front of a tomb and made deep bows one by one they 
sang antigovernment songs and shouted remember kwangju and 
fight for democracy 
down the hill hundreds of weeping mourners many wearing white 
funeral clothing held umbrellas and walked to the graveyard along 
muddy fields

god for 
the council representing 32 denominations with 42 million

while the two german leaders were signing a 
highstakes economic treaty east germans who are gambling their 
future on its success got their first casino friday 
west german bankers opened the doors to a flashy gaming house 
complete with a pricey drink list jacketsonly dress code 30 slot 
machines and a clutch of gaming tables lined with blue velour 
the pocket of glitz in this workingclass country is perched on 
the 38th floor of the luxury hotel stadt berlin which overlooks 
east berlins main square alexanderplatz 
the casino is the first in the country the product of a joint 
venture between the government hotel chain and a subsidiary of the 
west german landesbank 
it represents not only the western investment that already is 
moving into the former socialist nation but the wide economic gulf 
that separates east germans from their wealthy western neighbors 
eightyfive percent of the people will be denied this thing 
michael feistkorn a bartender at the hotel stadt berlin said of 
the casino 
a cola at the casino will cost 3 
winfried hollenberg an official with the landesbank subsidiary 
westdeutschen spielbank acknowledged that foreigners and tourists 
also were being targeted by the casino 
we fear that in the coming time the great want of the east 
german citizens may not be gambling he said 
the casino was opened the same day the two german leaders signed 
an economic agreement in bonn west germany the pact will merge 
the economies of the two nations july 2 when the west german mark 
will become the currency of east germany 
but it leaves vague many areas of east germanys shift from a 
planned socialist economy to the free market uncertainty over the 
future and the threat of widespread unemployment in east germany 
has triggered a wave of labor unrest 
east germans who will still only make about a third of their 
west german neighbors in average salary also fear higher prices 
set by the free market 
karlheinz bringer manager of westdeutschen spielbank said the 
casino exists only for amusement 
he said he expects it to bring in about 600000 a year 80 
percent of which will go into the city to finance social and 
environmental programs 
casino officials say they hope to move the relatively small 
gaming house to its own larger quarters on leipziger street the 
nowgrim avenue that runs parallel to the remains of the berlin 
wall 
eventually casinos will be opened in the industrial towns of 
leipzig dresden erfurt rostock magdeburg und karlmarxstadt 
backers said 
the landesbank subsidiary owns 49 percent of the operation and 
the newly formed east german casino corp owns the rest 
the east berlin casino will have 26 croupiers all west germans 
east germans are to be added later after they are trained to run 
roulette wheels and deal blackjack

the state department revived charges friday 
that romanias ruling party has used violence and intimidation 
against opposition groups during the campaign for sundays national 
elections 
serious concerns have been raised about how free and fair the 
electoral process has actually been said deputy spokesman 
richard boucher 
the bush administration he said would hold the romanian 
government responsible for an honest election 
the national salvation front assumed power in december after 
president nicolae ceausescu was ousted and executed ion iliescu 
leader of the front is heavily favored to win the election 
boucher acknowledged that iliescu and the front have been 
credited with beginning the process of democratization and economic 
reform and with expanding freedom of expression religion and 
travel 
but he said the administration shares many of the concerns that 
have prompted demonstrations in bucharest and elsewhere in recent 
days 
boucher made no specific reference to a demand of many romanian 
students that would bar former communist party members from 
politics for six years most of the front leadership falls into 
that category including iliescu who broke with ceausescu 20 years 
ago 
boucher said concerns about the campaign include organized 
acts of intimidation and violence directed primarily against 
opposition candidates and parties especially the national liberal 
party and the national peasant party which are the two principal 
opponents of the front 
he said the concerns also include an imbalance of campaign 
resources that favors the ruling party and discrimination in media 
access against opposition candidates 
the administration signaled its concern over the romanian 
process last week by recalling ambassador alan green to washington 
for consultations he has returned to bucharest for the elections 
gov garrey carruthers rnm will head a us delegation 
appointed by president bush to observe the elections

when ninthgraders learned that a world 
war ii pow camp once stood across the street from their school 
they knew they had found the right topic for a class writing 
project 
but jeff stephens class never guessed when they began 
researching and writing a historical novel that they would share 
the bittersweet memories of an old german soldier and mourn his 
comrades slain by a crazed american guard 
i thought we were just going to write a book but we found out 
we have history right here that we didnt know about said corey 
slater one of the 28 english students at wahlquist junior high who 
collaborated on german brothers in a foreign land 
the 103page novel is based on the experiences of herbert 
barkhoff a german soldier who spent more than two years in us 
prisoner of war camps after being captured in 1943 
barkhoff came here to camp ogden shortly after he was wounded by 
an army private who machinegunned germans as they slept in their 
tents at the salina pow camp 160 miles to the south in all nine 
germans were killed and 19 wounded in the attack july 8 1945 
the attacker pvt clarence bertucci was declared insane and 
committed to an asylum he died in 1969 
the students wrote of the massacre from the viewpoint of 
barkhoff 
stephens got the idea of having his class write a book from a 
fellow teacher while attending a writing conference last summer 
the class received the assignment in september to create a 
historical novel based on a local historical event of national or 
global significance 
within a few weeks one student recounted her grandparents 
story about a german pow camp in the area 
from research in books old newspaper clippings college 
historical collections and military records they learned that the 
county fairgrounds across the street from their school once held 
4500 axis prisoners in a barbedwire compound 
kent powell of the utah historical society who has written a 
nonfiction book on german pows in utah suggested barkhoff as a 
literary focal point 
the class put barkhoffs story in the form of a novel complete 
with reconstructed dialogue in addition to their other research 
the pupils used letters and journals provided by barkhoff and 
translated by a german teacher 
most germans didnt want to be here but they looked to 
america as a chance to live and learn the students wrote 
i didnt write one word of it stephens told 100 parents and 
teachers thursday at a celebration of the printing of the novel 
his students proved that where magic is allowed for magic will 
occur he said 
it far far and away exceeded my hopes stephens said 
barkhoff now 70 recently suffered a stroke and could not 
attend but the class signed a copy of the book to be delivered to 
his home in hollingen west germany he sent word he was very 
touched and honored to have been selected for the book other 
copies 200 were printed are being distributed to the students 
parents and other teachers 
paul wollborm barkhoffs neighbor represented him at the 
celebration speaking through an interpreter wollborm said the 
book is an indication of continuing close relations between a 
resurgent reunifying germany and america 
i was amazed you selected such a theme he said i hope 
the friendship between the united states and germany continues to 
deepen 
it is a feeling shared by the writers who say their novel 
taught them about the folly and horror of war 
at one point stephens class visited a salt lake city cemetery 
where the nine germans slain at salina are buried some wept at the 
simple tombstones 
it made us feel bad that the germans were treated bad over 
here even though they treated our guys bad too said alex wood 
i felt remorse theres history right next door and no one knew 
alexs classmate joie hill said the project and especially the 
cemetery visit made the past startlingly real 
the germans were just like us they had their feelings she 
said but i wouldnt call them germans i would call them our 
friends

police on friday barred protesting 
students from the national assembly building where deputies were 
debating limits on universities academic and administrative 
freedom 
the unrest comes on the heels of a strike by public employees 
and is the latest problem to plague the 3weekold government of 
president violeta barrios de chamorro 
the government claims current law gives the universities too 
much independence and it wants to change it 
about 500 college students blocked off two avenues by the 
assembly building popping firecrackers chanting antigovernment 
slogans and demanding the law be allowed to stand 
police in riot gear stopped the students from entering the 
government complex grounds 
mrs chamorro has asked the national assembly to temporarily 
suspend the elections of officials at nicaraguas four state 
universities while deputies revise the autonomy law elections are 
set for next week 
during their 10year rule the sandinistas appointed state 
university officials they said if the universities had autonomy 
conservatives would entrench themselves and have too much influence 
but after losing the feb 25 elections to mrs chamorro who 
took over april 25 the sandinistas hurriedly passed the autons in the 
elections 
government officials accused the sandinistas of engineering the 
strikes to destabilize the government 
mrs chamorro is trying to cope with an array of problems 
including prices sent soaring by devaluations of the national 
currency the cordoba 
workers at state sugar mills threatened to strike unless they 
get a 160 percent pay raise 
the united states recently lifted an economic embargo imposed in 
1985 against the sandinista govenment and began importing 
nicaraguan sugar the sugar is being purchased at preferential 
prices under a quota system designed to benefit some third world 
sugar producers

senate armed services committee chairman sam 
nunn and sen john glenn have asked for an independent 
investigation of complaints about the way the us naval academy 
dealt with midshipmen who handcuffed a female student to a urinal 
rear adm virgil l hill jr superintendent of the academy at 
annapolis md already has ordered special inquiries into the 
widely publicized incident 
in a joint letter to comptroller general charles bowsher the 
two senators asked the general accounting office which bowsher 
heads to expand a review already underway to include how well the 
service academies are being managed 
the senators said they were concerned about the naval academys 
response to the hazing incident as well as irregularities in the 
processing of certain disciplinary cases and a breakin at the 
engineering department and possible theft of final examinations 
together these incidents suggest the possibility of problems 
at the naval academy and insensitivity by its leadership with 
regard to academic integrity the overall treatment of women and 
fairness in disciplinary proceedings wrote nunn a georgia 
democrat and glenn an ohio democrat 
glenn chairman of the armed services subcommittee on manpower 
and personnel released the letter friday 
gwen dreyer 19 recently resigned from the academy saying she 
was frustrated by the way officials handled the investigation of 
her complaint that two male midshipmen handcuffed her to a urinal 
and taunted her as others snapped pictures 
the academy ruled that the assault wasnt premeditated and 
therefore couldnt be considered hazing 
two midshipmen received onemonth campus restrictions and 
demerits on their records after an academy hearing six others 
received written warnings 
dreyer the daughter and granddaughter of academy graduates has 
said she now plans to study engineering at california state 
polytechnic institute

for more than four decades the bitter 
memories of war and defeat clung to emperor hirohito that same 
ghost now haunts his son emperor akihito who on friday paid 
tribute to nagasakis atomic bomb victims 
about 3800 people stood in steady rain as akihito accompanied 
by empress michiko became the first monarch to remember the 
devastating aug 9 1945 attack at a monument to its 70000 victims 
the emperor bowed and placed a bouquet of white flowers on a 
dark granite cenotaph before the peace park monument 
the royal couple was greeted by loud yells of banzai a 
wish for long life when they arrived for the ceremony and as 
they left some in the crowd sang kimi ga yo japans 
unofficial national anthem 
the emperor and empress later visited a hospital for patients 
suffering from illness related to the bombing 
in a statement akihito said that seeing the park and hospital 
renewed my thoughts for peace and prayers for those who still 
are in pain because of the bombs effects 
in nagasaki that pain runs deep 
i think he has helped heal some of the wounds by coming 
said store clerk sachiko nagata who was seven years old when the 
bomb was dropped and now suffers from radiation sickness 
but it took too long for him to come to this park she said 
though the late hirohito visited nagasaki for a sporting event 
in 1969 his son akihito is the first emperor to present flowers 
at the peace park memorial 
mayor hitoshi motoshima was the emperors guide on the first of 
his fourday visit to southern kyushu island motoshima was shot in 
january by an ultrarightist for saying hirohito bore some 
responsibilty for the war 
motoshima made the comment at a city assembly meeting in 
december 1988 as hirohito lay dying of the cancer that ended his 
life one month later 
the mayor also said hirohito could have helped end the war 
sooner and saved nagasaki from the atomic bomb japan surrendered 
six days after the attack 
though many japanese share motoshimas opinions his candor 
angered ultrarightist groups for more than a year he received 
death threats 
since the shooting motoshima has become a symbol of freedom of 
speech 
though the mayor described akihito as a wonderful human 
being he also said the monarch should strive to understand and 
heal the wounds of the past 
i hope the new emperor will reflect on why that war occured 
and use his position to further peace motoshima said friday 
akihitos freedom to publicly reflect on the war will be tested 
three days after his visit to nagasaki ends when he is to meet 
south korean president roh taewoo in tokyo 
the question of how or even if akihito should apologize for 
japans colonization of korea from 1911 to the end of world war ii 
has become a major political issue between the neighbors 
though prime minister toshiki kaifu has said he plans to 
apologize as the elected representative of the japanese people 
several south korean officials have reportedly demanded akihito 
make the apology 
but many japanese officials say such a political statement 
by the emperor would violate the spirit of japans constitution 
which they say aims to limit imperial power by keeping the emperor 
off the political stage

something caused a black emory university 
freshman to wad her body into a tight knot and not speak to anyone 
even her own family for days 
her family said sabrina collins had been the victim of a 
monthlong campaign of racist threats and vandalism in her 
dormitory room news that set off a debate over race relations at 
the private university but by the time ms collins broke her 
silence she said investigators were trying to prove she staged 
everything 
the 19yearold premedical student said she sees little chance 
the mystery will be solved she said she hopes investigators will 
close the case 
that still doesnt make me feel good because that means there 
is still somebody out there who did this to me who got off 
scotfree she told the atlanta journalconstitution last week 
i have been punished for being the victim 
after two weeks in a hospital ms collins has retreated to her 
home in hephzibah in east georgia her attorney bensonetta tipton 
lane said ms collins did not want to be interviewed this week 
back in atlanta emory officials have said nothing critical of 
ms collins a deans list student and the only black member of the 
soccer team some students wore white armbands to show support for 
her at mondays commencement exercises 
until i see some hard evidence that sabrina collins is the 
perpetrator im going to stick with sabrina said state rep 
tyrone brooks a civil rights activist who has advised emory 
student leaders in the matter were going to continue to offer 
her our support but if its proven down the road that sabrina is 
the one who did this i would urge that sabrina be prosecuted 
ms collins was hospitalized after she collapsed and became mute 
april 10 her family said she had lifted a rug in her room and 
found the words die nigger die scribbled in nail polish on the 
floor 
ms collins earlier had reported incidents in which pictures 
were broken bleach was poured on some of her clothes stuffed 
animals were mutilated and the phrase nigger hang was found 
written on the wall in her closet 
emory police first said they couldnt understand how the 
incidents continued after they installed an alarm in ms collins 
room they later theorized that someone had entered the room only 
once concealing some of the vandalism so it would be discovered 
later 
but ms collins told the atlanta newspaper that the georgia 
bureau of investigation wants to implicate her so the case can be 
quietly closed 
she denied that she staged the attacks in order to have an 
excuse to leave emory the only college to which she applied 
i have nothing had nothing to gain in doing this she 
said i had everything to lose 
gbi spokesman john bankhead would not comment on the case 
at the time ms collins was hospitalized some students held 
silent protests and group meetings saying racism is a timehonored 
tradition at the serene college where 7 percent of the 9500 
students are black 
in response emory president james t laney came up with an 
extensive plan to create a support center for black students and 
develop programs to encourage faculty members to include more black 
perspectives in their teaching 
school officials also continue to look for leads in the case 
said emory spokeswoman jan gleason and laney is planning a summer 
retreat to pull together funding for the minority programs she 
said 
ms collins teachers sent coursework so she could finish the 
semester but she said she likely will leave georgia to finish 
college 
i feel so sorry for her brooks said i hope she stays at 
emory and not go off to some northern university and encounter 
the same thing you cant run and hide from racism

the two germanys on friday signed a 
historic treaty that will bind them into a single economic entity 
in less than seven weeks and all but formally end their fourdecade 
separation 
the treaty will also plunge fragile east germany into the rigors 
of capitalism starting july 2 many east germans fear unemployment 
and price increases could be the immediate result 
for the first time the two german governments convened in a 
single room witnesses to an event that in many ways will finally 
end their separation 
what we are living through here is the birth of a free and 
united germany said chancellor helmut kohl who has aspirations 
of becoming reunited germanys first leader 
this is a historic hour in the life of the german nation 
said the west german leader addressing members of both his cabinet 
and that of east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
nonetheless formal unification cannot occur until the thorny 
question of a united germanys military allegiance is settled the 
soviet union flatly rejects nato membership for the united country 
while the united states says the german nation should belong to the 
western alliance 
kohl has hinted he hopes full political unification will come in 
allgerman elections at the end of the year 
despite kohls jubilation german enthusiasm over the socalled 
state treaty was not unanimous 
west germanys leftist greens party boycotted the ceremony at 
the governments opulent palais schaumburg charging the treaty 
will leave east germans more impoverished than they already are 
we dont want to be dazed spectators of this consummation of 
subjugation the greens said in a statement 
neues forum the east german activist organization that started 
the fall revolution that ended four decades of hardline communist 
leadership had a similar assessment 
sacrificing all sovereignty the gdr east german government 
bows to the will of the victors in bonn whose power will triumph 
in a future germany over the dignity and interests of the gdr 
populace neues forum said 
hansjochen vogel head of west germanys main opposition social 
democratic party said the treaty on economic merger leaves open 
a whole series of questions 
vogel said it is still unclear for example how east 
germanmade products can be protected from competition by 
bettermade goods from west germany 
but the east german government has opted for annexation by west 
germanys own powerful economy as preferable to possible economic 
collapse 
flanked by kohl and de maiziere the finance ministers of the 
two nations signed the treaty under which east germanys economy 
and social structure will be absorbed by west germanys 
before the eyes of the world kohl said the leaders of two 
freely elected german governments were declaring their wish to 
build their joint future as one people one nation in one free 
and democratic state 
under the treaty west germanys deutsche mark will become east 
germanys own legal tender all monetary affairs will be controlled 
by west germanys central bank the bundesbank 
west germanys pension system will be introduced in east germany 
and bonn will assume responsibility for east german unemployment 
benefits 
east germany will be required to start selling state property to 
help cover reconstruction costs it will adopt west german 
monetary economic and tax policies on its road to a freemarket 
economy 
on wednesday west germany unveiled a 70 billion german unity 
fund to be used in the east german reconstruction effort costs of 
the fund will be covered by borrowing and savings in west germanys 
federal budget 
de maiziere said not all flowery dreams of east germans will 
be fulfilled with the treaty but no one will be worse off than 
before 
many east germans fear the economic overhaul will result in huge 
unemployment and price increases as subsidies are eliminated and 
there are west german worries they will have to bear awesome 
unification costs 
the weekly news magazine der spiegel reported last week that the 
east german government had asked bonn for extra riot gear in case 
disturbances erupt 
fridays treatysigning ceremony attended by about 60 
government officials from both germanys was loaded with symbolism 
west german finance minister theodor waigel and his east german 
counterpart walter romberg signed the treaty at the writing desk 
of konrad adenauer west germanys first chancellor adenauer 
helped guide the nation from postwar ruins to affluence and its 
place in the western alliance 
on one wall of the room was a tapestry of moses who led his 
people across the desert 
kohl has made no secret that he would not mind a place in 
history next to the revered adenauer as the architect of a 
reunited germany 
the treaty between east and west germany is kohls greatest 
achievement so far it comes just two months after east germanys 
first free elections and a little more than six months after the 
opening of the berlin wall

negotiators agreed friday to continue 
talks on the future of us military bases after filipino delegates 
accepted american promises to work for increased aid to their 
country 
the chief us delegate complained that firststage talks with 
president corazon aquinos government were too concerned with 
monetary issues and urged filipinos to ask themselves whether the 
six bases were important to their nation 
more than 100 people have been arrested in a series of 
antibases demonstrations in manila since the talks began 
foreign secretary raul manglapus the chief philippine delegate 
announced the decision to continue negotiations at the end of five 
days of exploratory talks on extending the lease beyond its sept 
16 1991 expiration the lease covers the subic bay naval base 
clark air base and four smaller usrun installations 
the two panels have decided to move on to discussions of the 
nature of usphilippine relations in the future the two sides 
said in a joint statement 
these discussions could include consideration of a new 
agreement concerning friendship cooperation and security on the 
basis of a new relationship between the philippines and the us in 
the light of the changing global environment 
no date was announced for further talks us panel spokesman 
stanley schrager said the united states hoped to resume talks the 
sooner the better 
the two governments agreed to continue despite differences over 
whether the united states failed to make full aid payments for use 
of the bases and when the facilities would actually have to close 
if no new agreement can be reached 
philippine authorities claimed the united states owed nearly 
2226 million in back payments for use of the bases 
in 1988 the reagan administration agreed to provide 962 
million over two years in return for use of the bases through 1991 
us officials acknowledged that congress had cut 96 million 
from the bush administrations aid request for the philippines but 
refused to concede there was any shortfall in payments for the 
bases 
they said the administration had only promised its best 
efforts to meet the aid target 
manglapus said the us panel agreed to work for more aid 
including medical equipment military supplies and food he said 
the pledge was sufficient to enter into discussions on future 
relations 
richard armitage chief us delegate expressed disappointment 
that compensation had dominated the first stage talks he said 
money alone cannot cement friendships or confirm friendship of 
alliances 
the future of these bases hinges on how the filipinos 
themselves resolve the following questions of what value are these 
facilities to the philippines if the answer is expressed only in 
monetary terms the american military presence cannot be 
sustained 
the compensation issue reflected the differences between 
washington and manila in viewing the bases the united states 
maintains the installations are vital for the defense of the 
philippines and the far east 
filipinos sensing no immediate external threat view the bases 
as a business proposition any agreement must be ratified by 
twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition is strong 
in the communique the two sides agreed that differences in 
interpretation of the termination date of the current agreement 
need not stand in the way of future negotiations 
manila says the lease on the installations expires in september 
1991 but the united states says the bases could remain open one 
year longer under the current agreement 
on the eve of the talks communist rebels killed two american 
airmen near clark and threatened further attacks on americans until 
all 40000 us troops defense department civilians and military 
dependents leave the philippines 
a regional military commander said friday troops had arrested 
three suspected members of the marxist new peoples army one of 
whom may be involved in the killing of the americans 
early friday police said three masked men dressed in black 
fired two grenades today from a taxi at a us information service 
cultural center only one grenade exploded causing minor damage 
and no injuries

guests at torontos diamondside skydome hotel 
will have to keep their minds on baseball or draw the drapes the 
manager says 
a couple making love in one of the rooms overlooking the field 
in full view of some of the 40000 blue jays fans proved to be a 
great publicity boon for one of the citys more unusual hotels 
but hotel manager ray thompson says he runs a respectable place 
we are now going to post some simple rules and regulations in 
the rooms thompson said friday there also will be an 
acknowledgment by the guest that the room in effect becomes part of 
the stadium just as if it were a seat down below 
the skydome hotel is part of the domed baseball stadium complex 
it has 348 rooms 70 of which face the ballpark rooms range in 
price from 169 to 467 that includes tickets to the game if 
they want to watch the game thompson said 
on tuesday a woman wrapped in a towel and a naked man watched 
the blue jays play the seattle mariners from the window of their 
hotel room 
soon thousands of fans were watching them 
as the game wore on the couple apparently wearied of being 
spectators and opted for a more participatory sport giving new 
meaning to the seventh inning stretch 
the lights were off in the hotel room but the banks of ballpark 
lights revealed all 
thompson for one doesnt believe the offfield activity was an 
accident 
i believe the people for their own particular reason wanted 
to perform in front of 40000 people he said 
asked if he was angry thompson said no 
i wish theyd come back so i could thank them it certainly 
has created a lot of interest in the hotel and in that room many 
people want to rent the same room it has triggered a tremendous 
response from people interested in this hotel and its uniqueness 
nonetheless stern measures must be taken to prevent further 
such public displays he said as soon as they can be printed up 
documents will be presented to each new guest for signature 
we are going to have people sign a statement that they will 
conduct themselves in a proper fashion he said failure to do so 
could result in expulsion or even criminal charges 
its just common sense behavior we can be a traditional 
hotel but the fact that people are sitting below you in the stands 
means we cant have people doing things they shouldnt be doing 
and in the public eye 
baseball is after all family entertainment 
what if it had been cap day blue jays president paul 
beeston was quoted as saying obviously with tongue firmly 
implanted in cheek 
thompson said there have been some stuffy people who think 
its evil and awful but most people definitely have been 
looking at it from a humorous point of view we cant take that 
approach because we are responsible hotel operators and have a 
responsibility to 40000 people watching this room if people want 
privacy all they have to do is draw the drapes 
oh yes tuesday nights final score was mariners 4 blue jays 3 
in 10 innings when the teams met again thursday some fans looked 
to the hotel windows again during the mariners 146 rout of the 
blue jays wondering whether there would be a repeat performance 
not that anyone really needed an excuse to peek but by the 
time it was 90 what else was there to do a local sports

the united states and its nato allies 
tentatively agreed friday on a plan for cuts in tanks artillery 
and other weapons expected to be covered in an arms accord later 
this year an alliance source said 
the plan sets specific figures for five categories of 
conventional weapons likely to be limited in europe as part of an 
eastwest agreement under negotiation in vienna said the nato 
source who demanded anonymity 
he refused to reveal the numbers set for each country but 
indicated the largest share of cuts would be borne by the united 
states 
obviously those countries which had the most equipment would 
take the most cuts he said 
the final figures will not be settled on until an agreement is 
reached to slash conventional weapons in an area spanning the 
atlantic ocean to the ural mountains deep in the soviet union 
negotiators for the north atlantic treaty organization and the 
seven nations of the sovietled warsaw pact resumed bargaining 
monday to try to bring both sides to equal ceilings in main battle 
tanks armored combat vehicles artillery troops combat aircraft 
and combat helicopters 
western officials have in recent weeks complained that moscow 
has slowed progress toward reaching agreement still they are 
optimistic a deal can be wrapped up in the fall 
among the tough issues still to be resolved are agreeing on a 
ceiling for combat aircraft and on verification measures to ensure 
compliance with an accord 
since late last year representatives of the nato nations have 
been discussing how to distribute the reductions among themselves 
they used the western arms proposal as the basis for their work 
there are many elements to an arms negotiation and just 
accomplishing the treaty doesnt necessarily resolve all issues 
said the nato source there still remains the allocation 
of holdings within that overall ceiling 
he suggested there might be problems at the end if an 
overall ceiling were set for nato but individual nations did not 
know the effect on their arsenals 
to avoid any disputes he said a special task force of the 
alliance nations tentatively agreed not only on specific cuts for 
each nation but also on a way to allocate any changes in the final 
accord 
in drawing up the allocation plan the nato source said 
officials began by working out the overall percentage reduction 
that would be required in each category of western arms 
within the overall ceiling limits have been proposed for 
different zones or groupings of countries for example there 
would be a cap of 8000 tanks for nato countries in central europe 
the source said the officials also took into account the 
military requirements of both the alliance and each nation in 
coming up with the figures 
nato officials also are working on a cascading plan that 
would enable countries to transfer more modern weapons to countries 
with older equipment that way nato and presumably the warsaw 
pact would get rid of its oldest not newest arms 
the west has proposed an overall ceiling of 33000 artillery 
pieces and 60000 armored combat vehicles it also has suggested 
limits of 9400 combat aircraft and 3800 combat helicopters these 
ceilings would be split equally between the two sides

oldfashioned marching orders backed up by a 
18 million buyout rid st paul of its biggest sexoriented 
business but the unusual pornfighting tactic backfired on st 
pauls twin cities neighbor 
i dont think anybody thought they would come across the 
river said minneapolis city councilwoman jackie cherryhomes 
st paul mayor jim scheibel thinks his city was the first in the 
country to launch a hostile takeover of a porn shop flexing its 
powers of eminent domain and getting the principals to sign a 18 
million agreement 
the pact prohibited former faust theater operator jerry hafiz 
his family and former faust owner mic corp of detroit from selling 
pornography within city limits 
its like the sheriff coming out and saying you boys have 
given us some bad times and if youre not out of town by sunrise 
theres going to be trouble said attorney leland frankman who 
represented faust theater 
hafiz response was to pack up his peep shows topless dancing 
porn paraphernalia and other xrated wares and travel five miles to 
minneapolis 
the new porn marketplace will be called deja vu and was 
scheduled to open this summer in the citys trendy warehouse 
district 
it worked scheibel said the fact they are going to 
minneapolis is just a sad fact that pornography is a very 
profitable business 
ms cherryhomes said she doesnt blame st paul but lamented 
the planned porn establishment in her ward 
it just adds to the alienation and the blight she said i 
frankly wouldnt wish these businesses onto any community 
but she doesnt see minneapolis trying st paul tactics on deja 
vu 
it takes care of an immediate problem but it kind of feels 
like youre playing hostage she said i dont think people 
should be rewarded for those kind of financial dealings 
hafiz who operated the faust for more than 20 years before it 
was shut down in march 1989 has an unlisted number and in the past 
has declined to be interviewed 
randall tigue the lawyer who helped hafiz obtain licenses for 
deja vu said at least four other adult book stores and five bars 
in minneapolis feature topless dancing and peep shows can be seen 
at several locations in the city 
in st paul five establishments have licenses permitting 
topless dancers and there are a few adult bookstores and other 
places offering peep shows city records show 
but the faust had been the biggest porn outlet in the city by 
virtue of its diversity no longer can a business operate peep 
shows dancing adult books and paraphernalia under the same roof 
scheibel said 
tigue and frankman said st paul abused eminent domain powers to 
seize the faust they said the theater was operating within the law 
and there was no urgent public purpose served by closing it 
i think its a terrible waste of public funds and i think it 
has some serious first amendment consequences tigue said if 
someone is conveying a message that you dont like you essentially 
pay them to move out of town

pledged to work for his nations reconciliation with jews and 
accepted an invitation from the world jewish congress to visit the 
united states officials said friday 
for more than four decades the nowousted communist regime 
denied any role in the nazi massacre of 6 million jews the 
communists claimed that as antifascists they were not responsible 
for the holocaust 
but one of the first acts of the recently elected east german 
legislature was to apologize to jews a move that drew praise from 
world leaders 
de maiziere is expected to make his american trip early next 
month and there were indications the democratically elected leader 
would also meet with president bush in washington 
the christian democratic prime minister will become the first 
government leader from his country to make a us trip 
the united states refused to welcome longtime east german leader 
erich honecker in large part because of his communist regimes 
policy of shooting wouldbe escapees honecker was ousted in last 
falls peaceful revolution

britains prince philip said friday that 
people will begin to get serious about global warming when they 
realize its potential effect 
in a questionandanswer session at the national press club 
after a brief stop at the white house philip was asked about 
president bushs recent suggestion that global warning needed 
further study 
i am no expert on this philip said i suspect that as 
soon as people realize there is a chance of global warming and the 
fact that it is going to affect their livelihood i think they will 
put some pressure on 
if any of you live on the coast i would start taking an 
interest in global warming now or else start moving up into the 
mountains he said 
philip international president of the world wildlife fund was 
in washington to attend a friday night dinner winding up a north 
american conference on religion and ecology 
the white house said no public statement about philips private 
meeting with bush would be issued 
philip asked if the united states was doing its share to 
protect the worlds environment said he didnt think he was 
capable of answering that question i dont know for sure what 
the share ought to be 
scientists agree that manmade pollution especially the release 
of carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels is causing heat to be 
trapped and will result in a warming of the globe but the severity 
of the warming and how specific regions of the earth will be 
affected is not as clear 
some computer models have suggested the global temperatures 
could increase by as much as four to nine degrees fahrenheit by the 
middle of the next century causing coastal flooding and a shift of 
weather and agriculture patterns 
other scientists say the impact is uncertain because of a 
variety of factors such as the uncertain effect of clouds 
bush opened an international conference on climate change last 
month by saying that more research is needed to sort out the 
science of the effect of carbon dioxide and other socalled 
greenhouse pollutants 
speaking at the close of the conference after his remarks were 
sharply criticized by members of some of the european delegations 
bush said we have never considered research a substitute for 
action 
philip husband of queen elizabeth ii was to attend a saturday 
service marking the inauguration of the newly completed west front 
of washington national cathedral 
construction of the cathedral begun in 1907 is scheduled to be 
finished this year

the state department won court permission 
friday to use electronic surveillance of suspected spy felix s 
bloch in proceedings to dismiss the veteran diplomat 
us district judge stanley s harris ruled that the fbis 
electronic surveillances of bloch had complied with the 
requirements of the foreign intelligence surveillance act 
harris rejected blochs attempt to prevent the state department 
from using two conversations and an excerpt from a third as 
evidence in proceedings to fire the suspended diplomat from the 
foreign service 
the fbi has said it suspects bloch of selling secrets to the 
soviet union while he was posted in europe however he has never 
been charged with espionage 
the state department placed bloch on administrative leave last 
june and in february initiated efforts to fire him the 30year 
foreign service veteran who served most recently as a highranking 
official in the us embassy in vienna is challenging his 
dismissal 
papers unsealed in us district court indicate that blochs 
apartment telephone and car have been under electronic 
surveillance for as long as two years 
harris denied a request by blochs attorneys to obtain tapes and 
transcripts of all the conversations recorded by the fbi 
defense lawyers have been told the contents of two conversations 
and part of a third that the state department plans to use as 
evidence 
attorney general dick thornburgh signed an affidavit opposing 
the release of any further surveillance information saying its 
disclosure could jeopardize national security 
papers filed by blochs lawyers on may 2 indicate the fbi 
recorded conversations between the suspect and his wife 
such conversations could not be used as evidence in court 
because discussions between a husband and wife are privileged

farmland prices are going up again but 
consumer food prices probably will decline the rest of the year 
the agriculture department said friday 
nationally farmland values including buildings are expected 
to rise 3 percent to 4 percent average prices rose 4 percent in 
1989 
food prices are expected to rise an average of 3 percent to 5 
percent in 1990 after a 57 percent gain last year that has been 
the agencys forecast since last fall 
but the new report said consumer food prices jumped an annual 
rate of 137 percent in the first quarter of this year primarily 
the result of the december freeze damage to vegetables and fruit in 
florida and texas 
another such shock is unlikely and food prices probably will 
decline for the last three quarters of the year the report said 
analysts said the forecast on farmland values was tempered by 
uncertainty over the weather the 1990 farm bill in congress 
possible revisions in the capital gains tax and ongoing trade 
liberalization talks under the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade

bob hope is sitting in his spacious home 
surveying his vast estate and trying to explain just why after 50 
years of traversing the planet entertaining us soldiers he still 
does it 
after a long pause he finally says its kind of exciting 
must be at age 86 he has racked up 9 million miles on his 
frequentflier account going from newfoundland to greenland from 
north africa to south vietnam and stopping at nearly every place 
in between 
every place there is a war involving us troops that is 
except for this time on saturday night nbc will broadcast 
bob hopes uso road to the berlin wall and moscow marking the 
comedians 50th year of entertaining soldiers and the first time he 
has done such a tour where no combat was involved 
traveling with brooke shields rosemary clooney les brown and 
his band of renown latoya jackson and of course miss universe 
1990 hope took his show on the road this month to great britain 
germany and the soviet union 
it was the first time that hope had been back to moscow since 
1958 when the cold war was in full freeze and nikita khrushchev 
was in the kremlin 
with mikhail gorbachevs glasnost eastern europe turned on its 
ear and the berlin wall crumbling how did hope feel viewing it 
firsthand 
he ruminates on this for a while its very different he 
said 
the man with the trademark oneliners the comedian who has 
become synonymous with american comedy is strangely inarticulate 
when it comes to discussing his feelings about doing these shows 
rather he spins funny yarns oneline anecdotes and 
recollections about friends us presidents and generals who are 
long gone 
bing and i had an offer to become lieutenant commanders in the 
navy hope said of the late bing crosby but roosevelt said no 
he said wed be more valuable entertaining all the troops 
the man has been hauling comedians dancers gorgeous women and 
assorted joke writers across myriad battle lines since 1941 his 
most recent trip before this one was to the persian gulf in 1987 
where he performed on rolling battleships 
in 1984 he went to beirut a place that made him a little 
nervous he admits because you never know when theyre going to 
turn around and throw a bomb at you 
the moscow that hope found this month is very different from the 
one he left in 1958 when he became the first american comedian to 
do a show there in his justpublished book dont shoot its 
only me hope describes his experiences 32 years ago thusly 
i dont know if the rooms were really bugged but whenever we 
entered wed talk to the doorknob wed talk to the chair and to 
the pictures on the wall and when we left wed face the wall 
and shout that concludes our broadcast for this evening be sure 
to stay tuned for lawrence welk 
this time hope was more impressed by the growing capitalism in 
communism and the long line for the newly opened mcdonalds 
we did a bit at mcdonalds hope recalled i walked up to 
these people in line and said to one guy how long have you been 
here he answers four hours the guy behind him says i was 
born here

east germany on friday toughened its visa 
requirements for romanians in an effort to stop a flood of refugees 
from that troubled country an east berlin government official said 
the east german commissioner for foreigners however criticized 
the decision our historic and humanitarian responsibility 
demands more farsightedness said almuth berger 
in the last two weeks thousands of romanians have been pouring 
into east germany lured by its imminent unification with west 
germany and fleeing political strife and uncertainty in their own 
country 
romanians overthrew communist dictator nicolae ceausescu in a 
bloody december revolution they are scheduled to vote in national 
elections sunday after a campaign that has frequently turned 
violent 
in another move the east german government said it was lifting 
visa requirements for citizens of belgium france luxemburg and 
the netherlands the state news service adn reported 
adn said the government was taking the action to advance 
european unity 
a government spokesman said east germany will now require 
romanians to prove that they have a personal invitation from an 
east german before they are allowed to enter 
nearly 2000 romanian refugees have been housed at barracks 
buildings around east berlin thousands more are believed inside 
the country and train stations have become homes to hundreds 
the past few days have seen a marked increase in the number of 
romanians on the streets in both east berlin and west berlin many 
of them begging 
the government spokesman said the visa rules were stiffened 
because east germanys ability to house the impoverished refugees 
is being stretched the spokesman said the restrictions were made 
while officials prepare a new law dealing with foreigners seeking 
asylum 
an estimated 500000 east germans fled their own country over 
the past year to escape the former communist regime and seek 
prosperity in the west they were taken in by west germany 
their exodus gave rise to east germanys peaceful revolution 
that toppled four decades of communism and led to the nations 
first democratic government 
a flood of romanians poles and other groups into east germany 
in recent months has heightened german resentment of foreigners as 
the nation moves closer to a free market 
the two germanys signed an economic treaty friday and plan to 
merge their economies by july 2 the merger is expected to force 
many east german factories to close triggering widespread 
unemployment 
the new rules for belgium the netherlands france and luxemburg 
allow their citizens to enter without visas and stay for up to 
three months 
westerners had only limited travel privileges in the country 
under the ousted communist regime 
the government also was preparing to lift visa requirements for 
citizens of greece great britain ireland sweden norway malta 
portugal and switzerland adn said

the pacific northwest should prepared for the 
economic fallout that would result from listing the northern 
spotted owl as a threatened species an interior department 
spokesman said friday 
us fish and wildlife service director john turner insisted 
however that no decision to list the rare owl had been made 
interior secretary manuel lujan jr discounted reports that the 
decision already had been made 
thats just scuttlebutt grapevine and a rumor mill lujan 
said friday in boston 
the boston globe reported friday that lujan told interior 
department employees in boston a day earlier that the owl would be 
listed under the endangered species act on june 23 and that the 
pacific northwest timber industry would suffer as a result 
interior department spokesman steve goldstein said however 
that lujan was speaking theoretically he said lujan was outlining 
a series of what ifs for planning purposes 
officials with the us forest service and bureau of land 
management predict that if the owl is listed land setasides to 
protect its habitat would cause northwest timber harvests to be cut 
nearly in half that could costing the region as many as 28000 
jobs by the end of the decade they claim 
i think we have to look at these things realistically 
goldstein said in an interview 
we cant bury our face in the sand we are dealing with 30000 
jobs he added the secretary is saying that for planning 
purposes it is better to assume the listing might occur it is 
better to take steps to prepare for that

a man convicted of plotting to kill a boy 
as part of a movie was sentenced friday to 33 years in prison no 
child was actually harmed 
ive never had as heinous a crime as this us district 
judge ts ellis iii said in sentencing daniel depew the judge 
called the case as chilling and as evil as anything i can think 
of 
ellis rejected a contention by the 28yearold resident of 
alexandria a suburb of washington that talk of plans to kidnap 
torture and kill a boy were merely a fantasy 
theres no doubt in my mind that you intended to go through 
with it ellis said 
depew was convicted in march on two counts of conspiracy he 
could have been sentenced to a life prison term 
the judge recommended that depew who has aids be sent to a 
federal prison in buttner nc where medical and mental treatment 
facilities are available however a final decision on his 
placement remains with the federal bureau of prisons 
the sentence adequately meets the goals of deterrent and 
retribution the judge stated but he added that he did not 
believe rehabilitation was possible in depews case 
depew was silent at the hearing but his attorney james lowe 
noted that his client had presented a letter to ellis saying he had 
not intended to proceed with the scheme 
another man dean lambey 34 of richmond pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy and sexual exploitation charges in november and was 
sentenced to 30 years in prison 
they were arrested in august following a sixmonth investigation 
that began when undercover police in san jose calif contacted 
lambey through a computer bulletin board he used to advertise his 
interest in sex with children 
a statement of facts entered at lambeys sentencing said he told 
an undercover investigator he was considering abducting a teenaged 
boy he had seen riding a bicycle lambey and depew would then 
videotape the sexual molestation and murder of the boy according 
to the statement

now that barbara bush is bringing raisa 
gorbachev along to share the podium at the wellesley college 
graduation more students say they have someone with whom they can 
identify 
the big worry has become is the crush of reporters coming to the 
june 1 commencement 
the climate on campus friday had changed from last month when 
it was announced that mrs bush would give the commencement 
address some of the 600 seniors protested then that the first lady 
is likeable but doesnt cut it as a role model 
about 150 of wellesleys 2200 students signed a petition that 
said mrs bush gained recognition through her husbands 
achievements not her own which contradicts what we have been 
taught over our years at wellesley 
on friday it was mrs gorbachev the wife of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev who was the talk of cazenove hall a 
dormitory at the 120yearold womens college students said they 
liked the fact that mrs gorbachev a former college professor had 
a career independent of her husbands 
im really excited senior angie hickman 21 of new york 
city said as she chewed thoughtfully on her breakfast oatmeal 
she might have something more interesting to say 
she does seem to have a different identity from her husband 
said susan brandzel 21 of seattle this is making graduation 
better 
holly benton 22 of norfolk va called mrs bush the us 
representative wife 
having raisa is going to make it a lot more political ms 
benton said she has done her own thing its really exciting and 
its going to make a tremendous statement about how big this issue 
of role models has become 
her roommate and fellow senior molly spofford 21 of manhattan 
beach calif complained that mrs gorbachev is almost too good 
a superwoman 
she reinforces the idea that we should do it all ms 
spofford said still she added its ideal that we have both of 
them its emblematic of the last year of international events 
but like other students she said she was concerned about the 
graduates falling in the shadow of news media attention on the two 
older women 
ms spofford said she learned about mrs gorbachevs visit when 
a local television station thursday night promised full 
coverage 
who wants full coverage of our graduation she frowned 
the 58yearold mrs gorbachev is a former university lecturer 
with a doctorate in philosophy from moscow state university she 
met her future husband in a ballroom dancing class while he was in 
law school and she was a graduate student from siberia 
mrs bush dropped out of smith college after her freshman year 
in 1944 to marry bush then a navy pilot since then mrs bush 
who turns 65 on june 8 has been a career homemaker raising six 
children shes also been a lifelong volunteer 
in recent years she has gained recognitions for promoting 
literacy and other causes including the care of babies with aids 
wellesley granted mrs bushs request that she bring along mrs 
gorbachev to speak while their husbands are holding their summit 
meeting 
it became official thursday 
anna perez press secretary for the first lady said mrs bush 
was absolutely delighted that her soviet guest could come along 
the two first ladies will travel together to wellesley on the 
second day of their husbands fourday summit at the white house 
and camp david md 
it wasnt immediately known if mrs gorbachev would give her 
speech in english a call to the soviet embassy in washington was

a tentative us effort to upgrade relations 
with ethiopia suffered a setback friday when an ethiopian envoy 
failed to meet us conditions concerning famine relief and jewish 
emigration officials said 
kassa kebede a senior ethiopian official had been scheduled to 
meet with deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger but the 
state department postponed the appointment when it became clear 
that the us conditions would not be met 
us officials speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
they did not believe the setback had dealt a fatal blow to efforts 
to establish better relations with ethiopia 
in announcing the postponement friday state department press 
officer dave denney said kebede was returning home for further 
consultations 
we remain prepared for serious dialogue on famine relief open 
emigration and other issues with the ethiopian government he 
said 
the united states and ethiopias leftist government have had 
virtually no highlevel contact for more than a decade each has an 
embassy in the others capital but not an ambassador 
the officials said that kebedes visit held out the possibility 
that the united states would permit ethiopia to send an ambassador 
to washington 
eagleburger would have received kebede if he had pledged to work 
with united nations officials on opening the red sea port of 
massawa so that relief supplies could get through to famineplagued 
areas the officials said 
massawa is in the hands of eritrean rebel forces fighting the 
ethiopian government but insurgent leaders have said they would be 
willing to make it an open city for the purpose of relief aid 
besides the humanitarian aid issue the state department had 
conditioned kebedes meeting with eagleburger on assurances that 
ethiopia would allow an estimated 3000 ethiopian jews known as 
falashas to emigrate to israel 
for the administration to accept an ethiopian ambassador in 
washington both conditions would have to be met the officials 
said 
kebede is a half brother of ethiopian leader mengistu haile 
mariam and is described as a senior foreign policy official he had 
met earlier with top officials of the africa and human rights 
bureaus at the state department 
on the food issue state department deputy spokesman richard 
boucher said un secretary general perez de cuellar has reported 
that ethiopian authorities have said they are prepared to discuss 
use of additional relief routes 
were encouraged by this news and we hope that discussions 
will begin as soon as possible and will include the issue of 
massawa he said 
on thursday the house select committee on hunger said the lives 
of up to 5 million ethiopians were at risk because of civil war in 
ethiopia 
the committee urged president bush and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev to make ethiopia an urgent agenda item and to work 
jointly for a cease fire so that fullscale relief efforts could 
begin

the number of haitians heading to the united states 
in small boats has dropped by 90 percent this year because of a 
lull in political unrest and a 30 million coast guard highseas 
interception program officials said 
in the first four months of this year 242 haitians were 
intercepted by coast guard boats and returned to haiti compared 
with 2801 in the same period last year coast guard lt cmdr jeff 
karonis said friday 
the total number of people stopped on the high seas all of last 
year was 3706 since the program began in may 1989 the coast 
guard has doubled its patrols and increased surveillance flights 
most boats intercepted at sea are returned to haiti 
the goal has been to intercept as many haitians at sea before 
they reach the us as possible karonis said from that point 
of view interdiction has been a success 
susan clyde spokeswoman at the american embassy in 
portauprince said efforts to reduce the number of fraudulent 
documents used by those fleeing strifetorn haiti also helped 
cheryl little an attorney for the haitian refugee center in 
miami said easing social tensions on the impoverished carribean 
island nation about 600 miles southeast of miami also contributed 
weve seen rises and drops over the last few years because 
there is a correlation between political unrest and the number of 
people coming she said 
haitians are waiting to see what will be done by interim 
president ertha pascaltrouillot who took over after prosper avril 
resigned in march in the face of widespread unrest ms little said 
if pascaltrouillot was overthrown today youd see large 
numbers of people coming she said

federal health officials on friday announced a 
plan designed to speed aids patients access to promising 
experimental drugs 
the proposal would allow an experimental drug that has been 
tested for safety to be made available to patients who have no 
treatment alternative 
those patients would be getting the drugs at the same time as 
patients who are participating in the second phase of clinical 
trials when drugs found to be safe are tested to determine their 
effectiveness 
we are proposing this initiative because of its potential for 
prolonging lives said dr james mason assistant secretary for 
health in the department of health and human services 
officials cautioned that the plan would not replace or 
substitute for conventional drugtesting trials which are required 
for marketing approval by the food and drug administration 
we believe we have built sufficient safeguards to ensure 
that it neither compromises the drug approval and clinical trials 
process nor delays the speedy delivery of promising investigational 
agents from the laboratory to the bedside mason said 
officials said they didnt know which drug would be the first to 
be used as part of the plan called parallel track 
the plan is similar to the expanded access system set up for the 
antiaids drug ddi or dideoxyinosine 
however under the ddi plan patients who were not in the 
clinical trials were getting the drug faster than the patients 
participating in the controlled trials because of the time it takes 
to set up such testing 
with parallel track that wouldnt happen said james allen 
director of the national aids program office clinical trials 
would need to be under way or at least starting at the time the 
drug would be made available for the wider distribution 
the parallel track idea was initiated last summer 
the public health service which includes the national 
institutes of health and the food and drug administration is 
proposing that it be used at first only for people with aids or 
those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes 
aids 
but health officials said they would consider expanding the plan 
to make experimental drugs for other lifethreatening diseases 
available to patients earlier 
the proposal is to be published monday in the federal register 
the public health service is accepting public comments for the next 
60 days after which it can publish a final rule

washington the government said friday it will release the 
longsecret health records of 200000 people who performed some of 
the riskiest tasks in building nuclear weapons 
the information dating to the start of us atomic bomb 
building in the early 1940s is considered by experts to be the 
nations most detailed information about the longterm effects on 
human health of chronic exposure to lowlevel radiation 
the government has maintained that its weapons plant staffers 
are not exposed to appreciable health dangers although some recent 
studies have indicated that the workers may be developing unusually 
high rates of cancers related to radiation 
a courtsupervised group the three mile island public health 
fund sued the energy department for release of the documents in 
1989 after the department rejected an earlier request for the data 
under the freedom of information act the group was formed after 
the three mile island nuclear power plant accident in 1979 
an outofcourt settlement to release the data took effect 
friday it requires the department to turn over the information 
including death records medical records and data on workers 
historical exposure to radiation to the three mile islands main 
scientific investigators dr alice stewart and dr george kneale 
daniel berger an attorney for the group said other qualified 
researchers could join in analyzing the data but that it would not 
be made generally available to the public 
the energy department said in a statement that the three mile 
island group agreed to let the society for epidemiologic research 
a professional organization review its planned use of the worker 
records to determine if it has scientific merit 
dr ken lichtenstein an associate clinical professor at the 
university of colorado health sciences center said it was 
important that the government finally allow independent researchers 
to review data on the weapons plant workers 
this is the first time that people who do not have a vested 
interest in the weapons plants will be given a chance to review the 
data said lichtenstein also an expert on health issues at the 
rocky flats nuclear weapons plant near denver 
the department agreed to release on june 18 the health and 
occupational records of 50000 men and women who have worked at the 
hanford nuclear reservation in southcentral washington state the 
facility produced plutonium for the first atomic bombs 
by aug 18 the department is to furnish data on people who 
worked at the savannah river site near aiken sc which 
produces tritium gas used in warhead production the oak ridge 
national laboratory at oak ridge tenn and the nowclosed k25 
gaseous diffusion plant at oak ridge where uranium was enriched 
for reactor fuel 
berger said that within six months and possibly as early as 
three months the department will turn over worker records covering 
the rocky flats plutonium milling and reprocessing facility the 
mound laboratory near miamisburg ohio where tritium is recycled 
the los alamos national laboratory at los alamos nm which 
designs nuclear weapons a los alamos maintenance facility and the 
pantex final weapons assembly plant near amarillo texas 
finally the department has one year to supply data on workers 
at the fernald uranium processing plant in ohio and the 
mallinckrodt chemical works in st louis which purified plutonium 
in the early days of the bombbuilding program 
its a historic development said berger adding that the 
data cover onethird of all people who have worked in the nuclear 
weapons program since its inception he said the 200000 for which 
records will be disclosed were employed at facilities where 
operations entailed the largest amounts of radiation 
scientific interest in the data has grown since the national 
research council reported in a study last december that lowlevel 
exposures to xrays and gamma rays pose a cancer risk three to four 
times greater than previously believed 
in a related development the department on friday made public a 
report by a panel of governmentappointed scientists who sought to 
determine whether the national research councils conclusion should 
affect weapons plant operations 
the scientists in a report dated march 1990 said the risks 
cited by the national research council do not justify changing 
energy department limits on worker exposure to radiation peter 
brush acting assistant energy secretary for environment safety 
and health said the department is to issue its own assessment of 
the implications of the research councils study by the end of june

grain wheat cotton and rice in the 1990 program which 
represented 754 percent of the 2166 million acres in the national 
base for those crops the idled acres are part of the 1633 million 
acres that were enrolled

a new kind of fog shrouds the city by the 
bay 
uncertainty about the itinerary of soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev on his visit the san francisco bay area next month is 
causing headaches among those trying to plan everything from 
security to sightseeing 
anxious hosts reporters and wouldbe gawkers are among those 
scrambling to prepare for the twoday tour with little information 
about all thats known is that gorbachev will arrive in san 
francisco on june 3 and visit stanford university for at least two 
hours the next day 
will it be a sitdown dinner or a speech no one knows 
stanford spokeswoman kathy otoole said thursday 
a planned luncheon with former president reagan and area 
business leaders seems most likely to take place june 4 said harry 
oberlian who heads the international program of the san francisco 
chamber of commerce 
there number of guests could range from 150 to 500 oberlian 
said 
the event is designed to bring together officials from soviet 
and us high technology companies it could help further 
gorbachevs hopes of developing a business alliance between the 
eastern soviet union and the west coast he said 
thats been his dream all along and the best way to achieve 
that dream is to come over here said oberlian 
at city hall officials were as hazy about the details as 
anyone it was unclear what role mayor art agnos would play in 
hosting gorbachev 
whether its giving president gorbachev a personal tour or 
putting together a meeting with business leaders the mayor is 
ready to assist said agnos spokesman scott shafer 
gorbachev will require a security army made up of police 
university patrols the california highway patrol and the coast 
guard orchestrated by the secret service 
san franciscos tourist spots like the golden gate bridge and 
fishermans wharf are logical stops for gorbachevs first visit 
but like others bridge officials and business owners said they 
wont start preparing until the itinerary is confirmed

arab ambassadors met with state department 
officials friday to press for support of a un security council 
resolution branding as illegal the settlement of soviet jews in 
territory occupied by israel 
but clovis maksoud the arab league representative in the united 
states said no agreement had been reached on efforts to craft a 
mutually acceptable resolution 
we are still in an ongoing discussion on this matter 
maksoud said after emerging from a meeting at the state department 
with robert m kimmit undersecretary of state for political 
affairs 
maksoud who accompanied the ambassadors of egypt algeria and 
kuwait to the session said arab nations are insisting that the 
resolution clearly brand israels settlement policy as a violation 
of international law 
we think that if the resolution does not state that the 
settlements policy is illegal then israel will not be deterred from 
making more settlements maksoud said 
to us this question of massive soviet jewish immigration is a 
critical issue maksoud said 
he said arab nations currently have no guarantee that they 
israel are not going to continue these settlement policies 
arab nations have been seeking a resolution that would both 
criticize israel and not be vetoed by the united states 
they are concerned about prospects that the increasing flow of 
soviet jewish refugees would be resettled in territory seized by 
israel in the 1967 war with its arab neighbors that would make 
more difficult the fulfillment of the arab goal of establishing a 
palestinian state in those areas 
israel has said that only a tiny fraction of the refugees have 
been resettled in either the west bank or gaza strip or in east 
jerusalem 
the state department has generally sided with the arab position 
that soviet jews not be settled in the occupied territories 
while the bush administration has opposed all settlement 
activities in the territories it has stopped short of calling them 
illegal 
maksoud said that the us position is to support soviet 
immigration and oppose settlement in the occupied territories 
we wanted this policy to be synchronized and we hope the 
synchronization will take place in the form of positive support for 
our efforts at the un he said

housing secretary samuel r pierce jr made a brief appearance 
before the grand jury with seven assistant prosecutors 
adams who did not call any witnesses apparently made the visit 
to introduce his prosecution team 
additionally irancontra prosecutors from the office of 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh met for several hours with 
the grand jury which took testimony from an fbi agent 
walshs continuing investigation will attempt to determine the

investigation 
adams office also refused to comment on the progress of its 
investigation of allegations of political favoritism in the 
operation of a department of housing and urban development 
lowincome housing program 
adams a former federal appellate judge from philadelphia was 
recently appointed to investigate whether pierce and his top aides 
steered lucrative rent subsidies to politically connected 
developers under the moderate rehabilitation program 
the prosecutors appearance before the grand jury with seven 
assistants signaled that adams was prepared to start taking 
testimony and issue subpoenas for evidence 
pierce served as hud secretary for all eight years of the reagan 
administration a house subcommittee has been conducting a lengthy 
investigation into mismanagement of a number of hud programs 
including the moderate rehabilitation program 
the program which received a 225 million appropriation in 
1989 provided rent subsidies to developers who perform a moderate 
amount of rehabilitation on housing for lowincome people

as a result of the hud scandals jack kemp the new hud secretary 
suspended disbursement of most of the money allocated for the 1989 
fiscal year pending a review of the grant awards 
in testimony before congress pierce denied he participated in 
any hands on management of the program or that he applied 
political influence

amendment protection against selfincrimination 
the court that appointed adams assigned him to determine whether 
pierce or other hud officials committed the crime of conspiracy 
to defraud the united states or any other federal crimes while 
running the moderate rehabilitation program between 1984 and 1988

president bushs china policy has been a 
failure that will be compounded if bush continues 
mostfavorednation trading status for beijing senate majority 
leader george mitchell said friday 
bush sought to justify his cautious approach toward china a year 
ago after the massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators near 
tiananmen square by saying it was the best way to win human rights 
concessions mitchell said 
imposing sanctions would isolate china and lessen the chances 
for reform bush said 
the chinese government has sent no such signal and has not 
moderated its course mitchell said in a speech on the floor of 
the senate political prisoners still are being held and chinese 
students in the united states still are being harassed he said 
the outcome of the administrations china policy is a failure 
a failure that is clear and complete mitchell said 
bush must signal congress by june 3 the anniversary of the 
tiananmen square crackdown whether he intends to renew chinas 
favored trading status for another year 
lawmakers then would have up to 60 days to deny the status 
which provide the best available tariff treatment for imported 
goods 
it is time to abandon this failed policy not to embellish it 
with new concessions mitchell said 
if bush continues his china policy we will have traded our 
principles for the doubtful friendship of dictators and we will 
betray the trust of those who seek our support in their fight for 
freedom he said

hundreds of anticommunist 
demonstrators defied a ban on political rallies friday and swore to 
remain in central bucharest until romania has a government 
untainted by links to nicolae ceausescu 
our roundtheclock protest will continue until we get our 
liberty back until democracy is restored in our country protest 
leader dumitru dinca shouted to demonstrators in downtown 
university square bucharests main traffic artery 
thousands of protesters gathered on the square late friday 
close to midnight those remaining jeered loudly at a 
tvscreensized movie of interim president ion iliescu being shown 
on the wall of a building on the square 
demonstrators have occupied the square since april 22 demanding 
that iliescu and other former communists quit politics iliescu 
became interim president after the overthrow and execution of 
communist dictator ceausescu in december and is heavily favored in 
sundays presidential election 
iliescu had said the protesters should be cleaned out of the 
square after the campaign officially closed thursday campaigning 
and political rallies are banned the last two days of the campaign 
the turbulent and sometimes violent campaign officially ended 
thursday night with the firstever televised debate by iliescu and 
his two opponents in the presidential race radu campeanu and ion 
ratiu 
but premier petre roman said the government decided to tolerate 
the demonstrators violation of the law for the time being 
hundreds of foreign observers are arriving to observe romanias 
first free election in 53 years 
several told reporters friday evening they received reports of 
irregularities in the election campaign and were investigating 
no one has suggested that the election campaign has been 
carried out without difficulty said roy hattersley a member of 
the british parliament we cant tell the extent of the 
problems 
sen joseph i lieberman dconn told the news conference the 
fairness of the election was the threshold question for us 
authorities considering the future of relations with romania 
both men were part of a 60member international delegation 
sponsored by the us republican and democratic parties institutes 
for international affairs 
in washington the state department revived charges that the 
national salvation front which has dominated romanian politics 
since december engaged in violence and acts of intimidation 
against the opposition in the campaign 
dinca said if the government had tried to oust the 
demonstrators it would have been with violence because nobody 
in the square would have left this sacred place 
above our heads and above their heads a second revolution 
would have burst out he said 
i prefer to stay here and face a bulldozer than a 
dictatorship said dumitru duduman 30 a forestry worker who has 
been living in one of the dozens of tents pitched around the square 
the protest drew tens of thousands of people thursday night but 
iliescu and his national salvation front are heavy favorites in 
sundays elections for president and a 506seat twochamber 
parliament 
polls of uncertain accuracy indicate that iliescu a 60yearold 
former communist minister demoted after criticizing ceausescu in 
1971 is expected to get up to 60 percent of the vote 
the front expects a majority in parliament 
in timisoara cradle of the revolution a rally by more than 
1000 front supporters was abandoned thursday evening after 
fighting broke out 
gheorghe ilia front secretary in timisoara said opposition 
supporters with clubs and knives attacked the rally and 15 people 
were badly beaten 
but lumintia lepugeanu a spokeswoman for campeanus national 
liberal party said front supporters attacked opponents she said 
five people were hurt none seriously 
the conflicting reports were made by telephone to the associated 
press in bucharest 
the electoral commission said friday that 159 million romanians 
aged 18 or over are eligible to vote for most it will be the 
first time they can elect their representatives 
candidate campeanu 66 is a former political prisoner whose 
national liberal party draws most of its support from urban youth 
and intellectuals and advocates of rapid privatization 
ratiu 72 belongs to the national peasants party which gets 
most of its support from rural areas he left romania in 1940 and 
returned after the revolution

it was a buoyant and even poetic 
helmut kohl who came to the palais schaumburg on friday for the 
signing of a treaty to merge the economies of the two germanys 
its no wonder kohl was so openly happy because the document 
all but ensures the west german chancellors place in history as 
the man who choreographed the end of germanys fourdecade division 
kohl a large man whos gregarious with friends but is a 
lackluster orator beamed throughout the ceremony inside the 
opulent governmentowned palais schaumburg after finance ministers 
signed the treaty kohl broke into a jubilant smile and started a 
chorus of applause 
he cheerfully posed for photographers and television camera 
crews alongside lothar de maiziere dwarfing the east german prime 
minister 
members of the two cabinets then went onto the palace terrace to 
sip champagne and celebrate their accomplishment under brilliant 
sunshine 
reporters tried to corner kohl to ask when he thinks the first 
allgerman elections will occur kohl hinted earlier in the week 
the elections could come at the end of the year 
but kohl adroitly evaded the question 
we still have much work ahead of us in the twoplusfour 
negotiations said kohl referring to talks between the two 
german nations and the four world war ii victors on international 
aspects of unification 
he would only say that the date of elections is not far away 
kohl then struck a surprisingly poetic tone to express his 
belief that unification has always been a matter of destiny 
there flows the rhine said kohl nodding toward the 
legendary river streaming past the palais schaumburg 
it streams along on its way seeking the sea naturally you 
can stem its flow or make it detour and that would create much 
trouble on the river banks 
but the water reaches the sea and thats also how it is with 
the current of german history said kohl

the bush administration is proposing new ideas 
to solve several knotty issues holding up eastwest agreement on 
reducing conventional forces in europe defense secretary dick 
cheney said friday 
but he said he didnt expect a sudden breakthrough in the 
complex negotiations 
cheney in an interview with ap broadcast services confirmed 
the proposals were taken to moscow by secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
he gave no details about the proposals except to say they were 
developed by himself gen colin powell who is chairman of the 
joint chiefs and national security adviser brent scowcroft 
the conventional talks right now are complicated he said 
if you will we have a sense the soviets have slowed things 
down 
cheney was responding to a question about a report in the new 
york times that the united states had proposed to split the 
difference on such problems areas as limits on the number of 
tactical aircraft one of the major sticking points in the vienna 
talks 
the report said baker was prepared to discuss a limit in the 
range of 6000 aircraft a number higher than nato had been willing 
to accept 
the negotiations involve north atlantic treaty organization 
countries as well as warsaw pact nations 23 countries in all 
although president bush has expressed hope that a treaty would be 
concluded this year the pace of negotiations has lagged 
in moscow a senior official in bakers party speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the secretary had sent a letter to 
nato allies outlining the proposals about which he declined to 
give details 
negotiators for both sides are attempting to find equal ceilings 
in main battle tanks armored combat vehicles artillery troops 
combat aircraft and combat helicopters 
cheney said the negotiations were important to the 
administration and offer the most significant increase in 
stability for european nations because they could blunt the edge 
in conventional forces enjoyed by the warsaw pact nations 
so wed like to wrap it up cheney said 
however he said that given the complex nature of the talks 
its more likely to take longer i dont expect a quick or sudden 
breakthrough 
baker met in moscow with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze with the goal of finding agreement on cutting us 
and soviet longrange missiles bombers and submarines in time for 
gorbachevs summit with bush in washington may 31june 3 
baker agreed late friday to hold more talks saturday with 
shevardnadze and both said there had been progress 
as pressure has grown for cuts in defense spending one of the 
most favored targets for us and western governments are the 
costly forces and their equipment based in europe 
the times reported that other possible compromises were to be 
put forward on the maximum number of weapons any single nation 
would be permitted verification problems and the rate of 
destruction for military equipment 
the major sticking point in the talks have been the limits on 
combat aircraft and verification the problem of checking whether 
arms control goals have been met or not 
cheneys remarks came as the united states and the nato allies 
tentatively agreed on a plan for sharing cuts in tanks artillery 
and other weapons expected in an eastwest arms accord later this 
year an alliance source said in brussels 
since late last year representatives of the nato nations have 
been discussing how to distribute the reductions among themselves 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity declined to 
reveal the numbers roughed out for each country but indicated the 
united states would get the largest share

a mikhail gorbachev ally who is a candidate for 
president of the russian republic called friday for greater 
autonomy from the soviet union 
alexander vlasov who is now premier of the largest soviet 
republic said that radical resolution of the problems standing 
before the republic can be found only in its full economic and 
political sovereignty 
he is running against boris n yeltsin one of the countrys 
leading reformers for the newly created post of chairman of the 
congress of the russian federation popularly known as the russian 
president 
gorbachev is president of the soviet union which includes 15 
republics including the secessionminded baltic states of 
lithuania latvia and estonia 
yeltsin and other radicals have been urging greater 
sovereignty for russia a concept that falls well short of 
secession they argue that by securing greater control over the 
russian government they can institute drastic reforms that have 
been stalled at the national level 
the three baltic republics are trying to secede from the soviet 
union but gorbachev wants to keep them within a proposed soviet 
confederation that would allow greater autonomy to the republics 
vlasov a close ally of gorbachev called for russian 
sovereignty in a state of the republic speech to the 
russian congress 
it is our position that everything on the russian territory 
should belong to the russian people vlasov said 
he said the russian republic was not receiving an adequate share 
of soviet spending 
currently the central government takes all income from state 
businesses and allots money for operation of factories and cities 
the official tass news agency said this week that 61 percent of the 
profits from russian businesses is distributed to other republics 
some radicals were critical of vlasovs comments 
in that stream of words he said nothing concrete said 
mikhail bocharov a legislator and factory manager who has led 
gorbachevs experiments with workers leasing their companies 
in the national parliament gorbachev and his allies have 
defeated proposals to transfer ownership of natural resources to 
the republics but the breakaway baltic republics claimed them 
anyway 
vlasovs comments followed a key vote thursday when more than 
1000 russian legislators voted to move a discussion of sovereignty 
high up on their agenda 
later during the congress they are expected to demand a new 
union treaty which amounts to a renegotiation of the pact that 
formally created the soviet union in 1922 
gorbachev endorsed the idea of a new union treaty nine months 
ago but like many of his domestic reforms it remains only a vague 
suggestion

president saddam hussein of iraq proposed 
a summit meeting with irans president hashemi rafsanjani and got a 
positive reply iraqs deputy prime minister confirmed in a 
statement published friday 
the saudi newspaper alsharq alawsat quoted the official taha 
yassin ramadan as saying the developments came in a recent 
exchange of letters 
the newspaper circulated in bahrain quoted ramadan as saying 
no venue for such a summit was fixed and that aides would hold 
preliminary negotiations before saddam and rafsanjani meet to try 
to settle their 10yearold dispute 
a ceasefire halted the 8year iraniraq war on aug 20 1988 
european military analysts estimated 1 million people were killed 
and 17 million wounded on both sides in the conflict negotiations 
begun five days after the truce have been deadlocked mainly over 
the question of priorities 
iran wants immediate iraqi withdrawal from lands occupied in the 
final weeks of the war iraq wants the shattalarab waterway 
which formed a boundary between iran and iraq dredged of war 
debris before moving on to other issues 
iraqi foreign minister tareq aziz disclosed earlier this month 
that saddam sent a letter to rafsanjani calling for direct 
negotiations between the two leaderships to solve pending problems 
he did not say if saddam mentioned specifically a summit with his 
foe 
the official news media in iran said the iranian leadership was 
giving saddams letter serious consideration baghdad and tehran 
have not divulged details of saddams letter or the reply from 
rafsanjani 
ramadan said of saddams letter the truth about the contents 
is that after two years of a ceasefire without any progress toward 
a lasting peace there is no reason why we should complicate the 
issue 
we find that interest dictates there be a summit of the 
presidents of the two countries to agree on the basic principles 
for solving this problem since we are calling for peace and we 
agree that un security council resolution 598 is the basis 
ramadan said 
un resolution 598 calls for troop withdrawal to prewar 
borders exchange of prisoners and negotiations toward a lasting 
peace 
ramadan said the iranian reply reached baghdad a few days after 
saddams message and despite our reservations on many of the 
points it contains we shall reply that the meeting of the two 
leaders be preceded by a meeting of their representatives 
he said consultations are under way on the venue but would 
not give other details arab press reports and diplomats in baghdad 
said saddam suggested moscow as site of the meeting 
persian gulf press reports mentioned the saudi city of mecca 
islams holiest city as a venue 
however saudiiranian relations remain strained riyadh severed 
ties with tehran in april 1988 accusing iranian leaders of 
terrorism and subversion

president bush announced his intention friday to 
nominate veteran diplomat harry shlaudeman to be ambassador to 
nicaragua 
shlaudeman is a former ambassador to brazil peru argentina and 
venezuela and also served as special negotiator for central america 
under president reagan 
the administration had originally intended to appoint the 
ambassador to mozambique melissa wells to serve in managua but 
officials said they were concerned about possible delays in the 
senate confirmation process 
in 198687 senate conservatives held up ms wells confirmation 
as ambassador to mozambique for 11 months 
the officials insisting on anonymity said shlaudeman is 
expected to gain quick senate confirmation the administration 
wants an ambassador in managua without delay partly because the 
country is facing a difficult transition after 11 years of rule by 
the leftist sandinista government 
the united states and nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each 
others capital since july 1988 a reflection of the strain in 
relations until president daniel ortega was replaced three weeks 
ago by president violeta chamorro 
shlaudeman turned 64 on thursday he retired in 1989 but was 
called back to the state department during the latter part of the 
year to serve as liaison with representatives of the nicaraguan

the nations largest ecumenical group on 
friday criticized the israeli occupation of an east jerusalem 
shelter a south african state visit and a us supreme court 
ruling limiting religious freedom 
the national council of churches wrapped up a policymaking 
meeting with a resolution asking israeli leaders to remove jewish 
settlers from the greek orthodox shelter near the church of the 
holy sepulchre 
the council deplores and condemns this statesponsored 
provocation and attack upon these historical understandings 
that have served to preserve the peace of jerusalem the 
resolution said 
the resolution also criticized the brutal and aggressive 
reactions of the israeli police against the christian and muslim 
leaders and laity 
about 150 jewish settlers backed by 18 million from the 
israeli government moved into st johns hospice the week before 
easter israeli police later dispersed an antisettlement 
demonstration with tear gas and rubber bullets 
the hospice is across the street from the church of the holy 
sepulchre regarded as the burial site of jesus christ israels 
supreme court ordered the jewish settlers out last month but said 
it would allow 20 guards and maintenance staff to remain pending a 
final ruling on the dispute 
the church council which represents most major anglican 
orthodox and protestant religions comprises 32 denominations with 
42 million members 
at the meeting the council also endorsed the june 20 visit to 
the united states of south african antiapartheid leader nelson 
mandela it said however the white house shouldnt welcome south 
african president fw de klerk as long as apartheid remains in 
effect 
i am concerned that any signal of support of de klerk will 
send the african national congress a message we are backing away 
from our call for the dismantling of apartheid said the rev 
tyrone pitts of the progressive national baptist convention 
the council also criticized an april us supreme court decision 
that said drug use as part of religious rituals isnt protected by 
constitutionally guaranteed religious freedoms 
the court said said oregon could deny jobless benefits to 
american indians who used peyote in a religious ritual and allowed 
convictions of people who break laws while following their 
religious beliefs said dean kelley the councils director of 
religious liberty 
the council urges its member communions to alert their 
constituents to this incredible loss of protection for religious 
rights because of an aggressive and radical exercise in of judicial 
activism the resolution said 
council members late thursday asked nestle foods corp general 
foods corp and procter amp gamble co to stop buying coffee beans 
from el salvador where six jesuit priests were killed last year 
nine salvadoran soldiers are awaiting trials in the killings of the 
priests their maid and her daughter 
the church council also asked the defense department to withdraw 
troops and close bases in the philippines by 1996 
it recognized the upcoming 500th anniversary of christopher 
columbus arrival in the americas by noting the slavery of blacks 
and mistreatment of american indians during the five centuries 
since 
the board passed a resolution that was a compromise between 
those who wanted to celebrate columbus day and those who see it as 
an occasion to reflect on past wrongs the board approved several 
amendments denouncing slavery and the mistreatment of indians since 
columbus fleet reached caribbean islands in 1492

the israeli mission said friday the united 
nations paid 150000 to print and distribute copies of us human 
rights reports on nations that have denounced israels practices in 
the occupied territories 
israel requested the publication but described it as a waste of 
money 
it blamed the palestinian rights committee the un committee 
on the exercise of the inalienable rights of the palestinian people 
for provoking the costly publication by the world body which is 
hardpressed for money 
for years the committee has published the annual us state 
department report on human rights covering what it calls israels 
abuses in the occupied territories the west bank and the gaza 
strip captured by israel from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle 
east war 
in retaliation this year israel asked the united nations to 
publish similar state department reports on committee members and 
members of the arab league that have criticized israel 
israel said these reports show the hypocrisy of its critics who 
have abysmal human rights records according to the state 
department 
israeli offices noted that among its critics cuba and saudi 
arabia make it a crime punishable by death to propagate zionist 
ideas 
the committee has 23 members and israel has published reports on 
members and other critics including afghanistan bahrain 
bangladesh burkina faso cuba iraq libya laos malaysia mali 
mauritania pakistan saudia arabia senegal somalia and syria 
under un guidelines any member or un body may request the 
organization to translate print and distribute statements or 
reports in six official languages arabic english chinese 
french russian and spanish 
israeli mission spokesman yuval rotem said we warned the 
united nations in advance that this would be a costly exercise and 
we hoped the palestinian committee would not distribute again this 
year the human rights report on the occupied territories 
we are going to use the very same coin they use namely the 
human rights report on the territories none of our critics has 
a better record than israels 
ambassador absa claude diallo of senegal chairman of the 
committee was not immediately available for comment but arab 
diplomats blamed israel for any waste of money and said it was 
trying to deflect attention from its own problems in the occupied 
lands and to derail criticism 
both the general assembly and security council have denounced 
israels harsh handling of the continuing palestinian uprising that 
began on dec 8 1987 in the occupied territories 
palestinian officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed the 150000 price tag and agreed it was a waste 
we were waiting for the price tag to reach 250000 before we 
complained said a diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity

pleaded innocent friday to firstdegree murder in the wednesday 
night shooting death of his pregnant halfsisters boyfriend 
municipal judge rosemary shumsky ordered brando 32 held 
without bail denying a plea from his attorneys that a bail hearing 
be held immediately 
the prosecutor said he wasnt ready to argue bail and shumsky 
agreed to hold the hearing tuesday 
brando handcuffed unshaven and clad in a grey shirt and jeans 
was glum and looked down at the floor through most of the hearing 
the selfemployed artist and welder spoke only twice to say 
yes when asked if he understood his right to a speedy 
preliminary hearing and whether he was willing to waive that right 
shumsky set june 11 to schedule a preliminary hearing 
famed civil rights lawyer william kunstler appeared at brandos 
side along with two other attorneys but kunstler left the legal 
arguments to local attorney dan stormer 
in addition to the murder count brando pleaded innocent to 
possession of a machine gun and a silencer found following the 
shooting in the den of marlon brandos home the weapons werent 
used in the shooting authorities said 
christian brando is charged in the death of dag drollet 26 a 
guest at the home and the son of a tahitian official 
drollet reportedly was the father of 20yearold tarita cheyenne 
brandos unborn child police said the shooting apparently was 
sparked by an argument over drollets treatment of miss brando and 
said there were allegations drollet had beaten the young woman 
outside the courtroom kunstler said he had discovered from the 
police report that the gun apparently went off accidentally during 
a struggle 
this is not murder by any means the attorney said 
but police detective steve osti said earlier there was no 
indication there had been a struggle before the shooting christian 
brando and drollet were alone at the time 
an autopsy friday determined that drollet died of a gunshot 
wound to the head and neck said coroners office spokesman bob 
dambacher 
kunstler said marlon brando 66 has been very supportive of his 
son and was willing to take the stand and testify if necessary 
hes going to do whatever any father would do the attorney 
said he said marlon brando had told his son to be strong 
the oscarwinning actor was in another part of the estate when 
the shooting occurred and was the one who called police 
the small courtroom was jammed to capacity with reporters 
photographers and television crews and the clicking of cameras and 
the pop of flashbulbs punctuated the brief session 
marlon brando didnt attend the hearing but christian brandos 
former wife mary mckenna brando was in the courtroom 
kunstler said marlon brando called him thursday asking him to 
represent his son the two men are longtime friends and allies in 
civil rights struggles over the past 30 years 
christian brando is the son of the actor and his first wife 
anna kashfi the couple was divorced in 1960 and their troubled 
son was the subject of a bitter custody battle 
tarita cheyenne is the daughter of brando and his current wife 
tarita teriipia a tahitian actress who played his love in the 1962

a nearly retarded man who killed twice as a 
teenager went quietly to his death in louisianas electric chair 
early friday in an execution that worldwide protests couldnt stop 
dalton prejean 30 became the first murderer to die under the 
us supreme courts 1989 ruling that allowed the death penalty for 
crimes committed by 16 and 17year olds 
amnesty international the european parliament the american 
civil liberties union and numerous other civil rights organizations 
denounced the electrocution gov buddy roemer received 206 
telephone calls urging him to call off the sentence and 129 
supporting the execution his office said 
just before the execution prejean said his death would serve no 
purpose 
one mistake 13 years ago and thats a long time he 
said during a rambling barely audible final statement nothing 
is going to be accomplished i have peace with myself 
prejean was put to death for the 1977 murder of state trooper 
donald cleveland who was killed during a traffic stop in 
lafayette prejean was 17 then and had served more than two years 
in reform school for killing a taxi driver when he was 14 
a black man he was convicted of killing a white man by an 
allwhite jury a factor that led to charges of racism by capital 
punishment opponents 
his supporters also argued he had suffered brain damage as a 
child apparently at the hands of an abusive aunt his iq of 71 was 
just above what would be considered mentally retarded and his age 
at the time of his crime was another reason for mercy they said 
i doubt that in documented recent world history there is an 
execution that has such a pile of reasons not to do it said 
steve herrick southern regional director for amnesty international 
roemer was unmoved he already had rejected a 32 recommendation 
of his pardon board to commute the sentence to life in prison 
repeatedly in recent months he had noted the trooper was killed in 
cold blood by a gunshot to the face 
im never happy with these things but i do not as a 
representative of the people have a choice roemer said 
antideath penalty demonstrations were held thursday at the 
capitol and at the governors mansion in baton rouge at the prison 
gates in angola however about 10 proexecution demonstrators held 
a quiet latenight vigil 
several were relatives of murder victims 
weve come to every electrocution since 1984 when our 
daughter was murdered said johnny reece of pineville 
prejeans final supreme court appeal was rejected about 7 pm 
thursday 
he had been on louisianas death row for 10 years longer than 
any other inmate and had been turned down by the us supreme 
court four times 
about 1205 am four guards escorted him into the freshly 
painted yellow cinderblock death chamber 
witnesses watched from behind a glass window as the softvoiced 
prejean spoke for about three minutes on what was about to happen 
some of his remarks were about clevelands widow and children 
to whom he expressed remorse for his crime 
to the cleveland family they say it wasnt for the revenge 
but its hard for me to see to understand prejean said i 
hope theyre happy 
the execution was the nations third in 24 hours texas and 
missouri each executed killers early thursday since capital 
punishment resumed in 1977 128 prisoners have been executed in the 
nation 19 in louisiana

slaying of hawkins a black 16yearold who went to bensonhurst to 
look at a used car 
the alleged ringleader of the white gang mondello was convicted 
on lesser charges of riot unlawful imprisonment discrimination 
menacing and criminal possession of a weapon 
on thursday joseph fama 19 was convicted of seconddegree 
murder 
after that ruling bensonhurst residents were defensive and 
mostly unwilling to talk to the media about fama who they 
described as a good kid 
after fridays verdict clearing mondello of the most serious 
charges against him neighbor jim league was jubilant 
im happy that justice has been served justice was served 
yesterday and its served again today said league 37 
yesterday in east new york they must have been bubbling over 
for the system league added referring to the predominantly 
black neighborhood where hawkins lived today we are bubbling 
over 
there is justice for all i feel like i am singing 
maria gonzalez 25 standing in the doorway of a laundry as the 
celebration rushed by her said mondello was going to have that 
on his conscience the rest of his life so are all of them 
neighborhood attitudes are writ large in the graffiti of romance 
and racism 
subway station walls bore the chronicles of love past robert 
n kim 51087 jimmy n diane 92783 anthony n rita 
6886 
and freshly painted in black on a building at 20th avenue and 
70th street these words no nigger zone 
this was were mondello and gina feliciano had dated and 
quarreled and where hawkins had walked to his death thinking he 
was going to look at that used car 
instead he ran into a group of whites looking for outsiders 
prosecutors said mondello assembled the white mob because he feared 
black and hispanic friends of miss feliciano were coming to beat 
him up 
fama was among the crowd youths wielding baseball bats and 
carrying at least one gun which chased trapped and fatally shot 
hawkins 
at franklin d roosevelt high school 17yearold anthony 
nardulli said most of the students agreed with the fama jury 
it was good he said of thursdays verdict there are bad 
italians and good italians im upset everybodys upset about what 
happened 
although bensonhurst is known as an italian enclave all sorts 
of people asians hispanics blacks work on its commercial 
streets for the most part they appear to get along 
its an informal place where clothing hangs on lines between 
some of the two and threestory brick houses and people shout out 
their windows bensonhurst in fact helped inspire the 
honeymooners 
but along 20th avenue where hawkins was shot to death the mood 
was grim thursday 
nobody really knows the real story of the hawkins killing 
said justine doz 19 who works at the gondola bake shop but she 
added they killed a kid and somebody has to pay for that 
she admitted however that many of her customers insisted fama 
did not get a fair trial 
there were those in bensonhurst hoping for an end to a case that 
has made their communitys name synonymous with urban bigotry and 
violence

president bush told hungarys acting president on 
friday that he will press soviet leader mikhail sgorbachev on 
soviet troop reductions in europe but that some us forces should 
remain as a guarantee of stability 
withdrawal of soviet troops is something we want to continue 
to discuss with the soviets to make sure their position hasnt 
changed on exactly what their intentions are presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters aboard air force one en 
route from washington to dallas 
the presidents position is that you shouldnt have any 
foreign troops where they arent wanted fitzwater added 
bush met with acting hungarian president arpad goncz at the 
white house before embarking on a fourday speaking trip his first 
stop was a republican fundraiser in dallas for gubernatorial 
candidate clayton williams and other gop candidates 
fitzwater said that bush was awaiting word from secretary of 
state james a baker iii who has been discussing arms control 
issues in moscow with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
and president mikhail gorbachev 
earlier in washington goncz told reporters that bush told him 
that the issue of soviet troop withdrawals would come up at the may 
31june 3 superpower summit 
we are in full agreeement that the soviet troop withdrawal 
from czechoslovakia hungary and other countries of the region 
should proceed goncz said 
hungary and czechoslovakia through they have overthrown 
communist governments are still allies of the soviet union in the 
warsaw pact the soviets have been pulling troops home from their 
stations in warsaw pact countries not all allies want a complete 
withdrawal though some do 
poland for instance has said soviet troops should stay there 
for a while as a counterweight to a stronger germany 
a white house statement on the meeting said bush told goncz that 
the united states would maintain a strong presence in western 
europe including a military presence as a guarantee of 
stability 
goncz said that bush sought his views on moscows standoff with 
secessionist lithuania and other rebellious baltic states he 
said he told bush the unfolding processes in the baltic states 
simply cannot be reversed any more im proceeding from our 
experiences which weve been through in hungary 
fitzwater in his comments aboard air force one said the 
administration was encouraged by gorbachevs meeting with 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene thats an 
encouraging sign the presidents been urging dialogue fitzwater 
said 
bush was to discuss the upcoming summit and eastwest relations 
at a commencement address on saturday at the university of texas in 
austin 
bushs speech to the gop fundraiser one of a series of 
political appearances he has been making this year in behalf of 
republican candidates was expected to raise up to 15 million 
fitzwater said 
the spokesman said that 1990 census estimates suggest that texas 
will add three congressional seats to the 27 it now holds and that 
bush wants to help raise funds to help the gop ticket as 
redistricting approaches 
bush told the gop fundraiser that we have to win in 1990 
if we dont once again the opposition will gerrymander fair 
representation right out the window and into thin air he said in 
prepared remarks 
bush told his gop audience he and his wife barbara were 
astounded when they caught a glimpse of the floodswollen trinity 
river on their way into dallas and could only see the tops of 
some trees 
the president rearranged his schedule and planned to tour some 
of the hardest hit flooddamaged areas near houston on saturday 
morning 
in this terrible disaster the losses have been heavybut 
one thing this state will never lose and that is its soul bush 
said of his adopted home state 
the president had declared 37 texas countries as disaster areas 
and more declarations are expected 
fitzwater in a written statement said bush and goncz agreed 
on the need for opening a process of dialogue between the soviet 
and lithuanian leaders as a prerequisite for creating a stable 
environment in which the countries of central and eastern europe 
can consolidate their democratic reforms 
president bush also stressed the importance of maintaining a 
strong us presence as a guarantee of stability fitzwater said 
goncz said he asked bushs assistance in encouraging mr 
gorbachev at the summit to keep the set deadline of soviet troop 
withdrawals from hungary 
defense secretary dick cheney said friday it was his impression 
that the soviets had stopped withdrawing troops from east germany 
as theyve placed more emphasis on withdrawing troops from hungary 
and czechoslovakia possibly because of housing or transportation 
problems in the soviet union 
in his discussion with bush goncz said he asked the united 
states for additional aid and support but did not name a price tag 
we are not coming here to beg he said 
only about 20 million of a 900 million us package of aid for 
poland and other emerging eastern european democracies is earmarked 
for hungary 
on his trip to texas and the west coast bush will take part in 
saturdays doug sanders celebrity proam golf tournament in houston 
before giving the commencement address at the university of texas 
in austin 
bush will be in portland ore on sunday and monday and finish 
his trip in los angeles

knopf said it is the only book the culver city school board has 
pulled 
houghtonmifflin spokesman sandy caswell said the ban was 
incomprehensible 
the fact that its an awardwinning book and one we felt was

reading series he said caswell added the company had received 
complaints about the book from three other school districts all of 
them in california

the contra guerrillas said they 
stopped disarming friday and cited an atmosphere of uncertainty 
and social instability provoked by the sandinistas who turned 
over power last month to nicaraguas new usbacked government 
in a communique signed by contra chief of staff israel galeano 
the rebels asked for new talks on disarmament accords 
the announcement by the nicaraguan resistance came as the 
national assembly was debating proposals by president violeta 
barrios de chamorros government to alter or suspend laws passed by 
the leftist sandinista government before it stepped down on april 
25 
her efforts to make similar changes by presidential decree led 
to a strike by government workers that paralyzed her administration 
earlier this week 
the estimated 11000 contra fighters had agreed to lay down 
their weapons by june 10 after spending years trying to oust the 
government of former president daniel ortega with us support 
galeano complained that promises under the agreements were not 
being met the basic accord for the contras to disarm and 
demobilize was signed on march 23 galeano did not sign that 
agreement but he did sign one on april 5 
rebels in security zones began disarming may 8 
galeano on friday accused the sandinistas of acting with 
vengeance frustration and rancor and said they were trying to 
sabotage and frustrate the first measures of reconciliation 
democratization and demilitarization 
he complained that wounded and crippled contras were not getting 
proper care that two demobilized contras were beaten when they 
tried to return home that sandinista troops had not completely 
evacuated contra security zones and that sandinista sympathizers 
had not been disarmed and that demobilized contras were not 
getting enough food 
only about 1000 of the fighters had actually laid down their 
weapons as of thursday and many of the weapons turned in were old 
luis sanchez an official of mrs chamorros coalition and first 
vice president of the national assembly said the contra 
announcement like the sandinistaled strikes was not surprising 
this is a result of the terrible damage done by 10 years of 
war to the national conscience sanchez said nobody trusts 
anybody 
he asked the sandinistas who came to power in 1979 to halt 
actions that undermine the government and asked the contras to 
observe the disarmament accords 
sanchez said the government had no advance word of the contra 
decision before it was read over radio nicaragua the government 
station friday 
former vice president sergio ramirez leader of the sandinista 
delegation in the national assembly said the disarmament accords 
could not be changed 
it would be extremely serious to open a new stage of 
negotiations to go over this matter which should be closed he 
said 
he said contra disarmament must be completed by june 10 
exactly as established in the accords 
ramirez said to change the accords in any way would be to 
renew uncertainty to open the perspective of more pain more 
death more blood meanwhile the assembly discussed and voted on 
bills annulling legal changes made by the lameduck 
sandinistacontrolled assembly 
changes in the general labor law were annulled by a 482 vote 
with the assemblys 40 sandinista members attending but refusing to 
vote 
mrs chamorra asked friday that a special commission be formed 
to study revisions in the sandinista legislation the commission is 
to be led by progovernment assemblyman adan fletes and include 
university presidents who are prosandinista meaning the 
government has agreed to discuss its proposal 
about 200 students many fearing budget cuts that would prevent 
them from getting a free education kept vigil across the street 
from the assembly building 
most public services were normal friday after the government and 
sandinista labor leaders agreed wednesday night to end paralyzing 
strikes by public employees 
the employees got most of what they wanted including a 100 
percent pay raise proving the sandinistas still are a force to 
reckon with despite their loss in the elections 
workers at state sugar mills have threatened to strike unless 
they get a 160 percent pay raise 
soaring inflation averaging 70 percent monthly in this country 
of 35 million residents is the reason for the big wage demands

a federal judge on friday rejected the bush 
administrations attempt to derail a record 55 million settlement 
of a lawsuit against unocal corp for polluting san pablo bay 
the settlement awarded in a lawsuit by the sierra club will 
pay for a variety of cleanup restoration and wetlands acquisition 
projects around san francisco bay 
the suit was over discharges of chemicals from a refinery in the 
community of rodeo that bypassed the companys treatment plant and 
flowed into san pablo bay at the north end of san francisco bay 
the us justice department on behalf of the environmental 
protection agency entered the case for the first time in march and 
appeared to ask that 42 million of the settlement be paid to the 
federal government that would be the entire amount awarded except 
for 13 million in legal fees and costs 
the settlement called for the money to be spent by various 
environmental agencies on the cleanup 
the department argued in letters sent before fridays hearing 
that civil penalties for violation of the federal clean water 
act belonged to the federal government but the department quickly 
backtracked first clarifying its position that only a portion of 
the money was properly viewed as a penalty and then dropping its 
request for funds altogether 
at fridays hearing justice department lawyer charles sheehan 
made a different argument that future polluters would not be 
adequately deterred unless more of the settlement was shifted from 
specific projects to a direct payment to the state treasury he 
asked that a proposed 500000 payment to the state for unspecified 
emergency cleanup work be increased by 1 million from funds 
elsewhere in the settlement 
were not asking that any money be paid to the federal 
treasury sheehan said its sufficient for federal interests 
that it go to a state of california fund but he asserted that 
only a payment to a government treasury can be considered a penalty 
under the law the kind of action that sends the strongest 
message across the country 
any discharger would prefer to have money spent locally 
where they could reap favorable publicity and be seen as 
environmental philanthropists sheehan said he also contended 
unocal might be allowed to claim a tax deduction on any sums spent 
on projects 
but unocal lawyer john barg said the company acknowledged that 
the entire sum in the settlement was a nondeductible civil 
penalty the justice departments position was also rejected by 
everyone else at the hearing including us district judge samuel 
conti who approved the settlement 
conti said sheehan was throwing a lot of monkey wrenches 
that if effective could prolong the already 6yearold case by 
another decade the judge also said the settlement was fair would 
serve to punish unocal and deter others and properly earmarked 
money for projects that will do some good locally 
stephan volker lawyer for the sierra club legal defense fund 
said the settlement was the largest civil penalty ever in a citizen 
enforcement suit under the clean water act he said it would send 
an unmistakable message to dischargers that there is no profit in 
pollution 
volker said the wastes flowing into the bay included phenols and 
other potentially cancercausing substances such as benzene 
toluene acetone and tce

the youth who allegedly led a white mob in a 
fatal attack on a black teenager was acquitted of murder and 
manslaughter friday a day after a codefendant was convicted of 
seconddegree murder 
the partial acquittal of keith mondello sparked a courtroom 
outburst from supporters of the family of the 16yearold victim in 
the case which had inflamed racial tensions in the city 
well do it ourselves some spectators screamed as mondello 
sat crying at the defense table 
a jury that deliberated 11 days convicted mondello 19 on 
lesser charges of riot unlawful imprisonment discrmination 
menacing and criminal possession of a weapon 
on thursday a separate jury convicted joseph fama 19 who was 
accused of firing the fatal shot of seconddegree murder in the 
shooting death of yusuf hawkins 
confusion reigned in the courtroom as the verdict was read 
michael mondello father of the defendant repeatedly shouted 
thank god thank god jesus has risen 
on the other side of the aisle relatives and supporters of the 
hawkins family screamed pointed at the jurors and shouted threats 
he did it he did it he set it up several of them screamed 
as the verdicts were read by forewoman mimi snowden 
diane hawkins the victims mother doubled over sobbing and 
was hugged by moses stewart the father 
two people were ejected from the courtroom for their outbursts 
in the hours that followed the verdict police reported a group 
of about 150 to 200 demonstrators in the east new york section of 
brooklyn near where hawkins had lived 
a television news crew was pelted with rocks and the windshield 
of their van was broken said police spokeswoman lisa guerriero 
the crowd tried to overturn the van and one reporter was injured 
she said the extent of the reporters injuries wasnt immediately 
known 
the most serious charges of which mondello was convicted riot 
and unlawful imprisonment carry jail terms of one and onethird to 
four years prosecutors said they would request the maximum 
sentence concurrent terms totaling 8 to 24 years in prison at 
sentencing june 11 
fama faces 25 years to life on his conviction others of the 
group are scheduled for trial later 
the killing took place aug 23 when hawkins and three black 
friends ventured into the predominantly white neighborhood of 
bensonhurst looking for a used car they were beaten by a mob of 
whites wielding baseball bats and hawkins was shot to death 
the killing fueled accusations of bigotry and the trial which 
coincided with several other racially divisive incidents heightened 
tension to the point mayor david dinkins went on television to 
appeal for calm dinkins the citys first black mayor asked new 
yorkers to join in a weekend of unity in the wake of the 
verdicts 
i ask those of you who grieve over the loss of yusuf not to be 
swayed by those who would use this occasion to spread their venom 
and cause our city more pain dinkins said the answer to 
racism cannot be further assault on our people 
outside the courthouse demonstrators who awaited the verdict 
for more than a week chanted no justice no peace as the 
hawkins family exited 
the rev al sharpton an advisor to the hawkins family told the 
crowd near the courthouse we are not going to take this verdict 
lying down we intend to move this city like its never been 
moved before 
the verdict was greeted on mondellos street in bensonhurst with 
smiles honking car horns and cries of support from friends who 
surged into the streets people hugged and couples cried tears of 
relief 
today we are bubbling over said jim league 37 standing 
outside the mondello home there is justice for all i feel like 
singing 
before the verdict was read friday hawkins father said the 
earlier verdict against fama didnt ease his pain 
dont come to me with this foolish rhetoric from any 
politician or anybody else about we love and forgive everybody 
because everybody is not loving and forgiving us the father said 
in his closing argument assistant district attorney paul burns 
said mondello organized the white mob that stalked the black 
youths encircled hawkins and left him dying on the street after he 
was shot 
does one of these guys stick around to help yusuf hawkins 
burns asked no they all run like a mob they came like a mob 
they left group courage masking individual cowardice 
the victims were targets solely because of the color of their 
skin burns said 
but defense attorney stephen murphy maintained mondello and the 
other whites didnt intend to hurt hawkins he said the gunman 
acted independently the defense contended the mob formed because 
of rumors a group of blacks and hispanics was coming to the 
neighborhood looking for a fight and the youths mistook hawkins 
and his friends for the outsiders 
some moron shot this young man for no reason that was 
senseless murphy said 
jurors declined to speak individually with reporters a brief 
statement on behalf of several jurors read by the foreman ms 
snowden called deliberations a long and difficult process but 
offered no detail on jurors reasoning 
mondello who held a bat in his hand and stood a few feet from 
hawkins realized the mistake and was about to walk away when the 
shot was fired murphy told the jury 
mondello his hands crossed on the defense table looked skyward 
and began crying as the verdict was read after the announcement on 
the final count he hugged his lawyer stephen murphy 
minutes later he left the courtroom in tears supported by his 
father and his mother susan 
i think mr mondello is happy with the verdict said murphy 
you just cant have a winner

a fogcloaked mount st helens slumbered 
through the 10th anniversary of its devastating eruption friday but 
scientists warned that it could awaken with a vengeance 
the southwest washington volcano killed 57 people and turned 
verdant forests into an eerie lunarstyle landscape in its may 18 
1980 eruption and there is a high probability of another 
major blast within the next 50 or 60 years said geologist dwight 
crandell 
that eruption could have six times the force of the 1980 blast 
which had the power of a 24megaton nuclear warhead or 2500 
hiroshima bombs he said crandell now retired cowrote a 1978 
government report that predicted the 1980 eruption 
st helens is the peak in the cascade mountains most likely to 
erupt soon but other volcanoes in the range should be watched 
closely said tom pierson a us geological survey geologist at 
the cascades volcano observatory in vancouver the cascades run 
from northern california to southern british columbia 
pierson said mount baker and mount rainier in washington state 
oregons mount hood and californias mount shasta show some signs 
of activity such as minor steam eruptions and bulging he termed 
rainier perhaps the most dangerous volcano in the cascades 
because of its potential for destruction of a huge area of puget 
sound lowland 
none of the scientists said how far in the future such eruptions 
might be 
the volcano experts and government officials headlined a ten 
years later conference that attracted 250 scientists from across 
the country 
the 1980 eruption must serve as a warning to prepare for 
inevitable volcanic disasters ahead the scientists said 
better monitoring and early warning techniques must be 
developed smarter land use planning adopted and citizens must stop 
building in the likely path of mudflows and flooding that eruptions 
will generate the experts said 
pierson noted the 21000 deaths when a colombian village was 
wiped out by a volcano a few years ago and said population centers 
are flourishing in the likely paths of flooding and mudflows from 
american volcanoes 
st helens is quiet now but scientists dont know how long the 
calm will last crandell said 
the mountain is being monitored in an unprecedented degree and 
almost certainly there will be a warning before another major 
eruption crandell said 
we are learning things that can be applied elsewhere such 
as the precursor earthquakes and bulging of the volcano flanks he 
said 
before mount st helens volcanoes were seen as something from 
the dinosaur era interesting but something that happened somewhere 
else said robert christiansen chief of volcano hazards for the 
usgs 
wildlife biologists foresters and other experts told the 
conference the habitat wildlife and vegetation around st helens 
have rebounded in a stunning fashion virtually every species 
devastated by the eruption has come back they said 
a helicopter tour of the area dramatized both the destruction 
and the recovery though snow rain and sleet obscured the peak 
itself friday other signs of the eruption were evident barren 
hillsides still caked kneedeep with graybrown ash giant trees 
strewn like matchsticks new river beds riding atop broad mudflow 
plains and newly configured lakes 
the swath of destruction cut by the flow of volcanic material 
and shock waves traveling the speed of sound contrasts with the 
lush stands of timber that survived 
but renewal is obvious too herds of elk graze on vegetation on 
steep slopes near the mountain and trees replanted in the volcanic 
ash are growing sturdily some of them already 30 feet tall rivers 
and lakes boast good fish runs a new highway is being punched 
through spectacular terrain hiking trails abound

a jury began deliberations thursday on 
charges that a reputed colombian drug lord conspired to ship more 
than 1000 pounds of cocaine to the united states 
prosecutors contend jose abellosilva operated an extensive drug 
shipment network but he maintains he is a legitimate businessman 
who got up and left a key meeting when talk turned to cocaine 
smuggling 
abello is one of 15 colombians extradited since august to face 
drug charges in the united states justice department spokesman 
harri kramer said 
he is the biggest fish landed by the united states in the 
colombian sea of narcotics said assistant us attorney david 
omeilia

states and conspiracy to possess drugs with intent to distribute 
he was arrested in october in bogota and extradited to tulsa

three prosecution witnesses were named as coconspirators in 
abellos indictment among them was boris olarte who was being 
held in a tulsa jail when abello allegedly conspired during a

pounds of cocaine into the united states 
money from the shipment allegedly was to be used to get olarte 
out of jail 
abello is being tried in tulsa because of phone calls and money 
exchanges between people in tulsa and florida allegedly part of the 
conspiracy

island off the coast of venezuela but he said when the 
conversation turned to cocaine he left 
he never agreed to do anything with those folks defense 
attorney patrick williams said in closing arguments 
the jury whose identities were kept secret began deliberating 
about 830 am thursday us district judge thomas brett said

arab nations agreed to delay a security 
council vote on soviet jewish immigration to israel and on 
settlements in the occupied lands until after an arab summit in 
baghdad this month un diplomats said thursday 
the diplomats from arab nations and the west spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
they said after intense negotiations general agreement was 
reached that a formal meeting would be postponed and await the 
results of the summit fruitless negotiations on a resolution have 
been going on more than 2 months 
the summit meeting is due to start in baghdad on may 28 the 
question of immigration and settlement in the disputed territories 
will be a major item on the agenda 
some arab nations like south yemen and syria and the palestine 
liberation organization favored early consideration of a resolution 
that would condemn jewish settlements in the occupied territories 
the diplomats said 
the comprehensive resolution proposed by the nonaligned 
nations would have been vetoed by the united states they said it 
would have called the settlements illegal and a threat to peace and 
security and would have endorsed palestinians asserted right of 
return and right to selfdetermination 
some arab diplomats sought to avert a us veto by proposing an 
interim resolution that would focus only on the problem of 
settlements in the occupied territories 
negotiations reached an impasse and most parties decided to 
await the outcome of the arab summit 
the occupied territories of the west bank and gaza strip were 
captured by israel in the 1967 middle east war palestinians claim 
the territory as a future homeland 
arabs the soviet union and nonaligned nations say the influx 
of soviet jews into israel may lead to expanded jewish settlement 
in the territories and undermine chances of a middle east peace

six jewish families on thursday quietly moved 
into temporary homes in the new settlement of dugit in the occupied 
gaza strip israel tv reported despite protests by israeli 
leftists and us objections 
about 800000 palestinians live in the israelioccupied strip 
but the dugit settlers said they do not find that upsetting 
it is not difficult an unidentified settler said on the 
television here everyone you see is invading this is the state 
of israel that is the first thing what can we do this is life 
dugit lies only a couple of miles from the gazan refugee camps 
jabalya and shati the jewish settlers are planning a fishing 
community 
the dugit settlement received its building permit from the 
caretaker government of rightwing prime minister yitzhak shamir of 
the likud bloc 
since the march 15 collapse of a likud coalition with the 
centerleft labor party the government has also given its approval 
to a settlement in the occupied west bank 
the united states objects to israeli plans to keep settling jews 
in the occupied lands us officials say the settlements are an 
obstacle to peace 
also thursday president chaim herzog accused the greek orthodox 
church of organizing a defamatory antijewish campaign in 
response to last months move by jewish settlers into a 
churchowned complex in jerusalems christian quarter 
herzog said the campaign sadly recalls a reversion to 
traditional christian antijudaism a reference to the times when 
christian clerics preached that jews killed jesus 
herzogs stinging criticism was conveyed in a letter to the new 
yorkbased greek orthodox primate of north and south america 
metropolitan paisios the letter was dated wednesday but was 
released thursday to the associated press 
the 150 jewish settlers moved into st johns hospice near the 
church of the holy sepulcher on april 11 but the supreme court 
evicted most of them in a ruling on a dispute over their rights to 
use the building 
the settlement stirred angry protests by palestinians and by 
christian churches around the world christian leaders in the holy 
land temporarily closed christian holy sites to protest the move 
the israeli government acknowledged after initial denials that 
it provided 18 million to help fund the settlement 
in his letter herzog also lashed out at the leaders of other 
churches who have protested the jewish settlement 
he apparently was referring to an open letter by cardinal john 
j oconnor of new york the roman catholic prelate called the 
settlers move a signal of a conspiracy to grab lands all over 
israel currently occupied by christians

why mess with a winning format vernel bagneris 
wisely has stuck with the mix of spirited 1920s new orleans music 
and backstage black vaudeville life that he created in one mo 
time for his new show further mo 
further mo opened thursday night at the offbroadway 
village gate downstairs once the site for the longrunning one 
mo time 
bagneris who wrote and directed the new show appears in it as 
the laidback likable dancer and singer papa du but he shines the 
spotlight on his three women singers and sometime shimmyshakers 
sandra reavesphillips who has toured in the late great 
ladies of blues and jazz brings a big rich voice to big bertha 
frozine thomas who was in one mo time here has a highly 
musical sound as ma reed topsy chapman as papa dus young wife 
thelma sounds like nell carter without the belting 
theres a little more plot in further mo than in the 
previous show edna is sick and papa du has hired big bertha 
former member of the troupe as special surprise guest star 
without informing ma and thelma 
this leads to bertha and thelma clawing each other with 
downhome catty repartee in the dressing room there may be a few 
too many bickering oneliners some are fun others just sound old 
the main plot idea is based on new orleans lyric theater 
burning down in 1927 early on james red wilcher as a wimpy 
theater owner nobody should trust tells papa du that the theaters

the united states in a bow to the lessened 
threat of war in europe is dropping its longstanding but rarely 
met demand that nato allies hike defense budgets by 3 percent a 
year above inflation 
the decision is expected to be ratified next week at a meeting 
of nato defense ministers in brussels pentagon sources said 
thursday 
europe is being transformed said the senior official who 
spoke of the decision on condition of anonymity basically its 
a statement of reality 
few countries met the target in recent years given the shift 
toward improved relations with the soviet union adopted by many 
western european democracies even before the fall of the berlin 
wall in november 1989

hopes of easy congressional passage of major 
civil rights legislation for the disabled faded on a house vote 
that critics say shows the triumph of fear over fact about aids 
by a 199187 vote the house approved an amendment thursday that 
lets employers reassign workers with contagious diseases to 
prevent them from handling food 
the vote came despite lastminute opposition to the amendment by 
the bush administration both sides agreed during debate that the 
amendment refers mainly to people with aids which spreads through 
sexual contact or other exchange of bodily fluids or by sharing 
hypodermic needles 
even supporters of the amendment said they were responding to 
what they believed were public misconceptions about aids and not 
what medical evidence has shown that casual contact does not 
spread the disease 
perception is reality said rep charles g douglas iii

if town officials have their way 
ventspils soon will have the safest bestrun brothel on the baltic 
sea and the only legal one in the soviet union 
sailors from the 3000 ships that dock in ventspils each year 
would be able to patronize a privately owned stateregulated hotel 
with registered prostitutes who paid taxes and were under medical 
supervision 
prostitution exists and we have to take it under control 
said nikolai bozhko police chief in this port town of 52000 
people 
we cant be an ostrich who puts his head in the sand he 
said thats the situation we were in up until now we put our 
heads in the sand and said we dont have that here 
authorities not only know prostitutes operate in the city 
bozhko said but where they can be found at the cosmos a dimly 
lit place where sailors drink 
a recent evening visit to the cosmos on a central treelined 
street found it to be like many other soviet restaurants with a 
floor show featuring scantily clad women dancing to americanstyle 
pop music 
many patrons were bleached blondes in heavy makeup miniskirts 
and spike heels no rowdy sailors were visible 
bozhko said the current system puts sailors in danger when they 
take prostitutes to unknown places and the city loses a source 
of badly needed foreign currency 
ventspils prostitutes charge the equivalent of 3050 and sell 
the foreign currency to speculators or blackmarketeers mayor 
aivars lembergs said under the council plan the city would expect 
about 40 percent of prostitutes to register and pay some of their 
earnings in taxes 
these women earn as much in a night as i earn in a month 
lembergs said they earn as much in a week as the president does 
in a month no a lot more 
the plan approved in principle by the 90member council is 
designed to legalize prostitution but not to encourage it 
prostitutes who refused to register would be subject to much 
more serious penalties than under current law which bozhko said 
prescribes fines of 100 rubles for a first offense and up to 300 
for subsequent ones with no jail time 
since a dollar buys as many as 15 rubles on the black market 
the fines are not much of a deterrent lembergs said 
in bozhkos vision of a stateregulated brothel a foreign 
sailor would leave his ship and a taxi from the stateapproved 
private business would take him to a cafe where he would meet a 
stateapproved woman who would spend the evening or night with him 
in a stateapproved hotel 
most policemen doctors and political leaders in ventspils 
appear to favor the plan bozhko said and predicted the latvian 
government also would approve 
the republics reaction has been its very new very 
interesting he said 
a detailed version of the proposal is being drawn up and 
probably will go to the republics parliament in september council 
secretary daina gasanova said 
if the idea works it may be tried in riga capital of latvia 
where there was a legal brothel in the 1930s bozhko said he added 
that russian ports also might try it 
ventspils has the reputation of being a seedy polluted port 
where chemicals in the air have killed some greenery and children 
practice with gas masks in case an ammonialoading center blows up 
the town has made strides against pollution in the last two 
years however and is restoring the buildings and narrow streets 
of its medieval quarter for the 700th anniversary 
lembergs appeared undisturbed that ventspils is becoming known 
for the brothel plan 
this problem appeared in the world a lot longer than 1000 
years ago he said smiling and of course not in ventspils

the centuriesold tapestries depicting 
gods animals and people in natural dyes of blue brown red and 
indigo have become the stuff of legal argument 
at issue is not their beauty which is undeniable but whether 
they are private property or the spiritual heritage of an indian 
town 
collectors abroad pay handsomely for such weavings made by 
indians of the andes mountains from the wool of alpacas llamas and 
vicunas 
a prolonged legal battle in north american courts pits 
international dealers in antiquities against the aymara indians of 
coroma 180 miles south of la paz by dirt road and has involved 
the bolivian us and canadian governments 
it is a contest between the concept of private property and the 
communal ownership in which indian cultures find religious 
significance rooted in the lucrative traffic in antiquities and 
artifacts from latin america 
elders in coroma where about 10000 aymaras live in 
thickwalled adobe huts on bolivias windswept high plains seek 
the return of weavings they describe as sacred 
in 1988 us customs agents in san francisco seized 56 textiles 
of the precolumbian and colonial eras from dealer steven berger 
police in halifax nova scotia confiscated about 6000 bolivian 
artifacts including an unspecified number of coroma weavings from 
roger york a former partner of berger 
all the goods are being held pending court rulings on whether 
they were exported from bolivia illegally 
town elders say some people in coroma sold the cloths which are 
kept in families for generations to bolivian middlemen without 
community authorization and the middlemen sold them to the foreign 
dealers the villagers involved have been ostracized and in some 
cases jailed 
the weavings are used in religious rites and community leaders 
say their loss has disrupted spiritual life some blame the absence 
of the cloths for troubles in the town and surrounding countryside 
one of them claudio torres said the textiles are the 
collective property of the community and we never authorized that 
they be taken they are the spirit of the community because they 
were lost people have died or lost their eyesight there is 
drought and many animals have died 
torres who has nine children makes his living raising llamas 
and sheep and growing potatoes and grain he was interviewed in la 
paz where he met with maria bedoya director of the bolivian 
culture institute who is helping with the towns case 
ms bedoya said she was confident the cloths would be returned 
these weavings are being held captive because somebody took 
advantage of the good faith of bolivians she said 
speaking by telephone from san francisco berger denied he had 
violated any laws in buying and shipping the weavings 
none of the pieces were stolen and all pieces were purchased 
in good faith he said the indians want to sell their 
textiles i purchased textiles that were for sale 
cristina bubba a bolivian psychologist who supports the towns 
efforts said the history of the community is depicted in the 
weavings and they are used as oracles to comunicate with 
ancestors the ancestors orient or direct the community in 
resolving political social and individual problems 
if the directions are followed the community is blessed the 
cattle multiply and there is a good harvest said ms bubba who 
has spent four years studying aymara culture and religion in 
coroma if the rites are not carried out negative forces take 
hold 
about 15 million aymara indians live in bolivia and peru their 
culture is older than the incas who are better known and always 
has put a value on tribal weavings at least equal to that of gold 
bergers laywer ted cassman of san francisco acknowledged by 
telephone that the case involved competing interests 
if an individual has a textile in his family and he decides to 
sell it and some people in the community believe it is not his to 
sell the question is who is to say to whom it belongs he asked 
cassman said it was common in bolivia for individuals to own 
and even collect old weavings such as those from coroma and to 
consider them private property 
the center for constitutional rights based in new york city is 
among the agencies working with the indians its legal director 
michael ratner said the effort was part of a larger movement to 
try to get back the patrimony of indian tribes in the western 
hemisphere

helen hayes known more than a halfcentury as 
first lady of american theater is just playing at being 89 
years old 
she probably could have danced through her walkon in tonights 
nbc special night of 100 stars iii which features more than 
165 stars of stage screen sport and fashion 
did i have anything to do she said her deep blue eyes 
twinkling like sapphires no i just came on and bowed thats 
all 
the audience will see clips from some of miss hayes movie roles 
featured in a tribute to great performers and directors 
there was one whole scene in which i broke a bottle and 
threatened people with this jagged glass she said and i dont 
remember ever doing such a scene ive been puzzling about it ever 
since 
she never loved hollywood despite her two academy awards her 
first oscar for best actress in 1932s the sin of madelon 
claudet she misplaced for more than a month the second was for 
supporting actress in 1970s airport 
they didnt know what to do with me out there she said of 
her early days in hollywood i was not the glamorous type that 
they were accustomed to promoting and presenting 
there was nothing to do with me but as louis b mayer said 
when he was cogitating well i guess the only thing we can do 
with you is keep you acting every minute on the screen i still 
dont know what that means 
she cannot bear to watch her old movies it fills me with such 
horror and overwhelming frustration she said 
i just wish people would avoid seeing me on the screen because 
it makes me very unhappy she said its like looking at a 
snapshot of yourself that is badly posed you just think oh i 
look terrible in that and i feel that way about being on the 
screen 
miss hayes was forced to retire from the stage in 1971 after a 
twoweek run in long days journey into night that nearly was 
canceled when she was hospitalized after developing an acute 
allergic reaction to stage dust 
her doctor was blunt he said the terrible words if you want 
to enjoy a few more years of life you will never step into a 
theater again backstage she said it was like a headsman 
coming down with the ax 
yet even if miss hayes were able and inclined to return to the 
stage she said she would not and blames the new unwritten but 
certainly understood rules of the theater 
because of theatrical costs todays playwright mustnt have 
more than four characters at the most three is acceptable two is 
ideal she said and theres one set better if you could just 
have black curtains and the lights 
theyre limited to such an extent that i dont think plays are 
as amusing or as delightful or as moving or as allconsuming as 
plays have been in the past she said theres no hope that 
they can ever write them anymore because the economics of the 
theater dont allow it 
so theres nothing i could hope to do and thank goodness for 
that because i wouldnt like to be yearning and not be able to 
realize my hope and dream

its a different kind of reefer madness these 
days for jerry garcia the man they used to call captain trips has 
become captain cousteau 
the unassuming singer and guitar wizard of the grateful dead 
whose music sprouted from the acid test lsd parties of the 
1960s and remains an enduring legacy of the psychedelic era now 
gets his kicks underwater 
i like the water i like the way it feels i like slipping 
around in it garcia said i feel like a fish its sort of 
like having an infinite aquarium to swim around in 
garcia is on a working vacation in hawaii that includes two 
concerts with his jerry garcia electric band and as much scuba 
diving as possible his first show on may 19 at waikiki shell was 
garcias first hawaii performance since 1970 when the dead last 
played honolulu 
the second concert may 20 at hilo civic center was a benefit for 
the ocean recreation council of hawaii torch is trying to preserve 
hawaiis coral reef by placing anchor mooring pins in ocean waters 
the moorings would be used by fishing and tour boats that currently 
drop anchor into the coral reef and destroy it 
ive seen what anchors do to coral garcia said the reef 
is the bottom of the food chain it provides food for the fish and 
so on and the fish end up on peoples plates and so on if you do 
away with the coral youre basically thrashing the whole economy of 
the islands or at least a large percentage of it 
garcia also is active in the rain forest movement the grateful 
dead has raised more than 1 million for environmental groups such 
as greenpeace and the rainforest action network 
garcia 47 started scuba diving three years ago shortly after 
recovering from a 1987 coma caused by untreated diabetes and 
exhaustion that illness which almost killed him occurred a few 
months after he stopped using cocaine and heroin 
in more than one way it was a rebirth for the beloved and 
reluctant figurehead of the dead heads subculture that spreads 
across the globe and numbers in the hundreds of thousands 
garcias recovery was followed by the 1987 release of the most 
successful grateful dead album ever in the dark the current 
album built to last also has gone gold but never caught on 
with radio stations and didnt fare as well commercially as in 
the dark 
not that garcia cares very much 
we certainly arent top 40 thats not what we do its not 
who we are he said our relationship to top 40 is pretty 
remote its almost as remote as our relationship to classical 
music or mainstream jazz were about 90 degrees off of just about 
everything 
garcia said the dead is working on a live album that will 
feature material performed on tour this spring it should be out by 
summer and the band is planning a series of stadium shows with a 
european tour slated for fall the bands first in a decade 
also the band has begun work on releasing vintage concerts from 
its massive tape vault on compact disc the first of these should 
be available by the holidays the ongoing project should keep the 
band busy well past the turn of the millennia he says 
despite the success theres trouble in grateful dead land its 
beoming more difficult for the band to find places to play as more 
and more venues say the problems real or perceived associated 
with the dead outweigh the big economic boost a series of dead 
concerts provides to a community 
as the success of the band increases 1990 is their 25th 
anniversary many people come to concerts without tickets to take 
part in the parking lot scene of hanging out and partying 
sometimes this leads to confrontations with police when ticketless 
fans try to crash a concert 
there also is the problem of drugs as the band that made its 
name at the famous lsd parties thrown by ken kesey and his merry 
pranksters the dead and their fans always have been associated 
with mindexpanding substances while the band frowns upon drug use 
now there still are significant numbers of fans who dont 
the band and most of the dead heads are making a very conscious 
effort to minimize their presence cutting down on outside vending 
camping and working to keep concert areas clean and positive 
the audience has been behaving so well lately garcia said 
weve been communicating with them what it is we have to deal 
with

so like last summer ed duffy was raking the 
kind buck at grateful dead shows selling central american clothing 
last winter he was pushing his product in a shopping mall the 
victim of a ban on vending at concerts 
one of rock musics longestlasting acts imposed the ban last 
fall ending a virtual 25year party at which fans and vendors set 
up tent cities before shows and entrepreneurial neohippies hawked 
everything from thai jewelry to vegetable burritos 
the grateful dead opened its spring tour at the capital centre 
in landover md some vendors who tried to sell their goods were 
handled in strict fashion by security guards duffy said 
the ban may have signaled the end of a subculture that had grown 
to include its own language food and dress the party was over 
they admitted that no more circus duffy said now its like 
going to see the knicks i was into the scene 
one of the clearest examples of the dead subculture is its 
peculiar jargon kind is the biggest grateful dead buzzword 
meaning good or healthy the term comes from the song uncle 
johns band in which lead singer jerry garcia asks are you 
kind dude is used quite frequently and like is well like you 
know used almost as punctuation 
a lot of the scene goes beyond music said eric rittenhouse 
who supported himself for two years by traveling to central america 
and asia buying jewelry to sell at shows 
so dude like what it all means is that the kind dead vendors 
who were styling when they were raking at shows are now scamming 
another way to keep eating 
rittenhouse 32 took a job in commercial property management 
last winter in los angeles duffy 28 spent the winter with his 
brother tim 25 selling guatemalan peruvian and ecuadorian 
clothing and accessories at shopping malls and flea markets in 
maryland pennsylvania and new york 
sherri greif 28 has managed to keep running her business 
fractalvision selling psychedelic computergenerated posters 
stickers and videos the ban however has had an impact 
a dead show is a concentration of people who are really into 
the kind of art we do so its not really the same greif said 
dead heads say that in addition to putting an end to vending 
the ban has ended a way of life gone are the superkind veggie 
burrito and organic fried rice and the deads eccentric entourage 
theyve been replaced by fast food and department stores 
grateful dead spokesman dennis mcnally said he appreciated the 
fans commitment to the band but said the group was not 
responsible for providing a living for them 
over the last two years the amount of energy that has been 
put into the outside scene was more social than musical mcnally 
said in a telephone interview from san francisco while we 
appreciate the outside activity it is not a social scene it is a 
music scene 
we stopped allowing vending and camping because facilities and 
halls with which we had been doing business with for years said 
we love you but we cant do business with you anymore 
said duffy it was one of the few ways left in america to grow 
up youd have your adventures in the old days it was the west 
now there is no west

burma the isolated nation sometimes called the 
hermit of asia is about to hold its first multiparty election 
in decades here is a report from aye aye win associated press 
correspondent in rangoon to which ap correspondents in neighboring 
thailand contributed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
burma will hold its first multiparty 
elections in 30 years sunday but two of the military regimes main 
opponents are under house arrest and a third is in prison 
diplomats stationed in rangoon have described the election as a 
cynical exercise by heavyhanded military rulers but some analysts 
feel it will create a form of party politics that may evolve slowly 
toward democracy 
the military junta which brutally suppressed a prodemocracy 
uprising in 1988 has allowed scores of parties to form since and 
promises the election will be free and fair 
more than 2300 candidates independents and representatives of 
93 parties are running for the 485 parliament seats election 
officials say 18900 voting stations will be provided and ballots 
will be counted in the presence of candidates representatives 
critics point out that however scrupulous the attention to 
election rules most of burma is under martial law many opposition 
politicians have been arrested and outsiders are not welcome 
burma has not approved applications by foreign correspondents to 
report on the election and on may 15 even stopped issuing visas 
to tourists 
there is no freedom of speech there is no freedom of 
assembly said one diplomat in the burmese capital who like 
others here would discuss the situation only if granted anonymity 
under those particular restrictions it is already not a free and 
fair election it is farcical that those the people want to vote 
for are not in the election 
aung san suu kyi the most popular opposition leader was placed 
under house arrest in july 1989 for alleged violations of security 
laws the other main leader of her national league for democracy 
tin oo is serving a threeyear prison term 
former prime minister u nu burmas last democratically elected 
leader was put under house arrest in december u nu now 84 was 
ousted in a 1962 coup led by gen ne win 
despite arrests of its leaders and some internal rifts the 
national league for democracy is clearly the most popular party in 
the election it is one of six to enter candidates for more than 
100 of the parliament seats 
the partys popularity is due in large measure to ms suu kyi 
daughter of burmese independence hero aung san she emerged as a 
brave charismatic leader during the democracy movement of 1988 
the league and other parties have held some rallies but their 
focus is on party organization and doortodoor efforts rather than 
public display 
security is tight in rangoon but western diplomats do not 
forsee a replay of the 1988 uprising when soldiers shot down 
several thousand demonstrators in the capital 
burmas numerous rebel groups including students who fled the 
repression are known to have plans to disrupt voting in more 
remote areas 
the national league for democracys main opponent is the 
national unity party the richest and best organized political 
group it is the successor of the burma socialist program party 
the militarybacked orgnization that controlled the country for 26 
years and led it to economic ruin 
four other opposition parties are considered to have some 
popular backing but burmese political analysts say none will win a 
parliamentary majority unless the election is manipulated that 
means a coalition 
the ruling military council led by gen saw maung has said it 
will not relinquish power until a government is formed and a new 
constitution written which is expected to take some time 
its all set up the government is going to pull all the 
strings josef silverstein a leading american scholar on burma 
said in an interview from the united states 
i think they could tell you today what the vote is going to be 
like theyre now trying to figure out how to divide the votes 
among the parties 
other foreign analysts stress preelection maneuvering and 
intimidation by the generals rather than possible rigging of the 
vote 
amnesty international the human rights group based in london 
accused burmese authorities of rounding up hundreds of people 
possibly thousands and said torture was widespread 
many diplomats believe one motive for relocating about 500000 
people from cities into the countryside was to have better control 
of the election 
there is no rule of law one said the big question is if 
the burmese will really dare vote for the opposition parties

election day in burma will be the 312th 
day of house arrest for a former housewife and academic who most 
analysts believe could lead her party to victory if she were free 
do to so 
until two years ago aung san suu kyi was virtually unknown 
today she is the countrys most popular political figure 
when the gemerals put her under house arrest july 20 1989 they 
hoped to silence their most vocal critic it didnt work 
she has now become more or less a martyr figure said a 
burmese expatriate in bangkok she embodies everything the 
burmese people aspire to 
ms suu kyi 44 is graceful and articulate she emerged as the 
star of burmas hazardous political stage less than two years ago 
at the height of a national uprising for democracy that was 
brutally crushed 
her father aung san is revered in burma as the leader of the 
movement for independence from british rule he was assassinated in 
1947 and burma achieved formal independence jan 4 1948 
other dissidents were cowed into silence by the armys ferocity 
but ms suu kyi refused to bow to the junta that took control in 
september 1988 
soldiers killed thousands of dissidents that year and thousands 
more have been arrested since ms suu kyi said she sometimes was 
threatened but she continued criticizing the juntas human rights 
abuses and campaigning for democracy 
she is the antithesis of ne win the reclusive general who ruled 
burma from 1962 to 1988 and is the only burmese politician who has 
dared attack him openly 
everyone knows who was responsible for all the bad things in 
burma but she was the first to blame ne win said a burmese 
no one had the guts to do that before 
ms suu kyi had lived abroad since she was 15 and happened into 
politics by chance when she returned home to nurse her dying mother 
she studied at oxford university and married an english academic 
in 1972 later she began an academic career of her own and worked 
for the united nations 
the political program of her national league for democracy is 
vague but ms suu kyi has referred in many speeches to the 
nonviolent liberation movements led by mohandas k gandhi of india 
and dr martin luther king jr in the united states 
before her detention tens of thousands of people defied martial 
law and heavily armed soldiers to hear her speak 
after being put under house arrest she began a hunger strike to 
demand humane treatment for imprisoned supporters she took only 
liquids for nearly two weeks until the government gave guarantees 
martin luther king said to the people i have a dream she 
told a reporter last year well it is the same with us we just 
want to bring our dreams to reality

mules pull the loads and theres hardly a 
car to be seen in motor city china 
this city of 378000 in the mountains of central china is home 
to the second automobile works the nations largest truck 
manufacturer which employs 80000 people and indirectly provides 
livelihoods for many more 
it made 135000 trucks last year about onefourth of all the 
motor vehicles china produced 
the second automobile works has brought the 20th century and 
prosperity to a backwater where peasants still use mules and water 
buffalo to scratch a living from the rocky terrain 
when china was in the throes of the cultural revolution in the 
late 1960s and relations with the soviet union were extremely 
tense mao tsetung decided to move key industries out of the way 
of upheaval and invasion 
in 1969 it was decided trucks would be made in shiyan a small 
town in the poverty belt of northwest hubei province 
there was nothing here but rice paddies then said ma yue 
executive vice president of the plant who arrived in 1971 there 
was no place to live so we had to stay with farmers 
young men brought in as workers had difficulty finding wives so 
a textile mill was built to attract young women 
today per capita annual income is about 2800 yuan 595 for 
workers at the truck plant and 2300 yuan 489 for shiyan 
residents in general both are roughly double the national average 
trucks from the second automobile works are in great demand 
all 140000 vehicles to be made this year are sold so shiyan has 
escaped an economic slump that began affecting most of china six 
months ago the citys industrial output in the first four months 
of 1990 grew by 51 percent 
unemployment is a problem in china as a whole but not in 
shiyan because the area is so remote the truck plant relies on 
local sources for 70 percent of its parts 
company officials also say the staterun enterprise will not lay 
off workers as it automates although the factory appears 
overstaffed 
during a visit to the final assembly plant 146 people were 
working along a 785foot production line children of workers are 
usually guaranteed jobs at the plant 
shiyan has shown off its affluence by building a musically 
synchronized fountain costing the equivalent of 170000 that 
provides residents with a colorful water symphony every weekend 
mayor wu fayu said that by supporting the truck factory and 
marching along the socialist road the people of his city were 
leading a comfortable life 
poverty still reigns outside the city beyond the drab 
functional apartments for factory workers farmers hack at tiny 
vegetable patches next to oneroom huts of brick and mud 
water buffalo pull plows through rocky soil women wash clothes 
in streams while their children bathe 
after leaving shiyan the road quickly deteriorates into 
potholes and stretches of construction where young boys chip at 
the mountainsides with pickaxes 
buses jeeps and trucks cruise on the citys wide empty 
streets but there are virtually no passenger cars carts pulled by 
men or mules carry produce and supplies 
the few traffic lights in the selfdesignated motor city of 
china were turned off during a visit to shiyan street lights on a 
main avenue did not come on after dark and couples strolled down 
the middle of the moonlit street 
guo shuyan the provincial governor said northwest hubei was so 
remote the the government did not know of a serious food shortage 
in one area until a newspaper reporter wrote an expose he said 
authorities quickly sent 44000 tons of grain 
company officials acknowledge being more than 600 miles inland 
from shanghai is a drawback to competing in the expanding chinese 
auto industry 
we are in the mountains so we have to provide our own schools 
and welfare facilities ma said and about 10 percent of the 1989 
profit of 600 million yuan 127 million went to welfare programs 
asked about the original decision to build the plant in shiyan 
ma replied it was the 1960s and we had no choice 
shiyan will remain the companys base but it has ambitious 
plans and is looking elsewhere 
a joint venture with citreon of france to produce 150000 small 
passenger cars annually by 1993 and up to 300000 later will be 
built in wuhan the hubei provincial capital wuhan is on the 
yangtze river an ideal route for shipping finished cars 
xiangfan on the plains 120 miles east of shiyan will be the 
site of a plant to produce up to 400000 engines a year for the 
joint venture

in the unfamiliar landscape of a western 
europe no longer threatened by the military might of the warsaw 
pact nato is searching for a new reason to be 
communisms collapse in eastern europe last year gave the north 
atlantic treaty organization the victory for freedom and democracy 
it had sought for four decades but it also stole the alliances 
main reason for being and has led some analysts to question whether 
there is any role left for nato 
the berlin wall is history the iron curtain is parting 
missiles are being blown up people on both sides of the atlantic 
are asking who needs nato 
president bush who meets next week with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev says the alliance in one form or another 
must remain gorbachev says it should be dissolved as should the 
sovietled warsaw pact 
washington fears that western satisfaction with soviet peace 
moves will create an unstoppable momentum toward disarmament that 
could erode us influence in europe and undercut the nations role 
as a superpower 
nato the officials say is a guarantee of continued us 
influence in europe 
secretary of states james a baker iii said in a speech may 14 
that the alliance will remain the place where western democracies 
join in guaranteeing the new peace of europe but he also said 
nato must adapt to the new political order 
bush and leaders of the 15 other nato member countries will meet 
july 56 in london to try to preserve the alliance by redefining 
its role 
the next day defense ministers from the sevennation warsaw 
pact will gather to consider that alliances future 
the first noncommunist defense minister of east germany rainer 
eppelmann has indicated the eastern alliance might be preserved as 
a political forum for a limited period 
but he added that it now appears as though the warsaw pact is 
in the process of dissolving itself 
in the soviet view both alliances ought to be dismantled 
replaced by broad new european security structures to include the 
united states and the soviet union 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze earlier this 
month proposed as a first step the immediate creation in berlin 
of a paneuropean center for the elimination of the military 
threat to control military activity in a unified germany 
gorbachev and shevardnadze say a nato including germany would 
upset the fundamental eastwest balance of power in europe 
the soviets have so far refused to accept a uswest german 
formula that would incorporate a reunited germany in nato but allow 
soviet troops to remain temporarily in what is now east germany 
unified germanys role in nato if there is one is the subject 
of discussions among the four victorious world war ii allies the 
soviet union the united states britain and france and the two 
germanys themselves 
assuming nato lives into the 90s what will it look like 
no west european leader has explicitly urged the disbanding of 
nato or the dismantling of its multinational military units most 
seem to agree that substantial changes of some sort will be 
necessary but few have offered concrete ideas 
france which left natos military structures in 1966 but 
remains a member of the alliance has been most vocal in advocating 
the formation of a new security apparatus that would include all 
european nations plus the two superpowers 
many analysts agree that nato will shift its focus becoming a 
more political and less military organization yet none has defined 
a political role for the alliance beyond its efforts in recent 
years to discuss terrorism and other aspects of international 
relations 
frank j gaffney jr director of the center for security 
policy a washington think tank believes the alliance is at the 
point of death and is unlikely to be fully revived 
were not going to change the sense in many quarters that the 
warsaw pact no longer exists that the cold war threat is gone 
said gaffney a former senior pentagon official in the reagan 
administration 
besides adjusting to the disintegration of the warsaw pact and 
the unification of germany nato faces a key dilemma of military 
strategy how to publicly manage popular arms reductions while 
maintaining a credible deterrent to nuclear war 
some say it cant be done at least not in the present nato 
scheme 
they suggest in a variation of shevardnadzes proposal a 
phasing out of natos military role and merging its political 
councils with those of less wellestablished forums that would 
include the soviets and eastern europeans 
this would provide a europeanwide security framework and reduce 
eastwest tension while preserving a role in europe for the united 
states and canada 
there still does need to be an international organization 
regulating military power in central europe said john d 
steinbruner director of foreign policy studies at the brookings 
institution a washington think tank 
karsten d voigt a defense expert in the west german parliament 
and a member of the opposition social democrats said recently that 
the longterm goal should be to supplant nato and the warsaw pact 
with a european security treaty signed by the 35 members of the 
conference on security and cooperation in europe

from africa to latin america to eastern 
europe moscows domain is crumbling 
soviet troops have left afghanistan the marxist regime in 
nicaragua is history ethiopia and mozambique are veering from 
their rigid prosoviet ideologies 
not to mention the disintegration of the iron curtain 
the speed of it all has taken mikhail s gorbachev by surprise 
and dramatically altered his stance as he heads into next weeks 
washington summit meetings with president bush 
soviet leaders and american presidents have met since nikolai 
bulganin and dwight eisenhower gathered with the leaders of britain 
and france in 1955 10 years after josef stalin won territorial 
concessions at yalta that some said helped tighten the soviet grip 
in eastern europe 
for decades after bulganin and eisenhower met in geneva moscow 
widened its circle of influence becoming to ronald reagan in 
1983 the evil empire 
how quickly things change in less than a year 
poland and hungary have held free elections resoundingly 
defeating candidates who represented the status quo 
czechoslovakias parliament elected dissident playwright vaclav 
havel as president replacing communist gustav husak 
bulgarias head of state todor zhikov resigned 
nicolae ceausescu was executed in romania 
east germany dissolved its communist government and opened the 
berlin wall it is headed toward reunification with west germany 
within the soviet union gorbachevs power is threatened by 
ethnic and economic nationalists 
he has been jeered by crowds in red square he has been 
criticized within the communist party for being too fast or too 
slow in remaking the soviet political and economic systems he has 
dispatched troops to quell ethnic violence 
he has beseeched lithuania unsuccessfully not to declare 
itself independent he is trying to cajole two other baltic 
republics latvia and estonia not to follow the lithuanians 
gorbachev has applied increasing economic pressure to lithuania 
to rescind its declaration and president bush has said the standoff 
between moscow and the baltic republics certainly puts some 
tension on the summit 
in all gorbachev will go into the summit with less of a power 
base than any of his postwar predecessors 
it puts gorbachev in a weakened position in which he basically 
has to in effect ask the west for its indulgence as he tries to 
ride out the crises said michael j sodaro a george washington 
university political scientist and an expert on east germany 
on the other hand sodaro added it puts the west in a 
position in which we dont really want to take excessive advantage 
of gorbachevs internal problems for fear that there might be a 
conservative backlash and gorbachev would be deposed he recognizes 
that the west has an interest in his continuation in power 
observers said they are sure that gorbachev in introducing 
relative freedom of expression and political action to the soviet 
domain did not anticipate the results 
he came to power dealing with not only the problems left to 
him by a communist regime that has failed but by russian history 
said arthur a hartman us ambassador to moscow from 1981 to 
1987 i cant believe he didnt know he would have to deal with 
those problems on the other hand i dont think he predicted 
exactly the way things have gone 
janusz bugajski an eastern european specialist at the center 
for strategic and international studies said i dont think 
there was any preplanning for what happened in eastern europe 
there was no blueprint i think what happened was that gorbachev 
became educated during the late 80s as far as the likelihood of 
some major revolution 
sodaro said i think even the most farsighted advisers to 
gorbachev were stunned by the rapidity of the dissolution of 
communism in eastern europe and east germany 
the suddenness of those events he added is affecting the 
attitude of kremlin leaders toward developments in the baltic 
i dont think they want as rapid a disintegration of the 
remaining part of the empire sodaro said 
i think gorbachev from the outset wanted to purge the soviet 
system from the vestiges of stalinism and certainly the 
acquisition of the baltic states can be chalked up to stalin 
said sodaro i think in the back of his mind he and his advisers 
would have to expect this would happen but i dont really think 
that he intended from the outset to preside over the disintegration 
of the soviet empire

radicals control the city councils in moscow and 
leningrad protesters call the president a dictator to his face 
fortyfive thousand people daily pass through mcdonalds golden 
arches blocks from the kremlin 
the nation is quite different from what it was in the early 
1980s president mikhail s gorbachev told the soviet congress 
last september 
indeed it is 
while repeatedly reminding soviets and foreigners alike that he 
is a devout communist gorbachev has borrowed generously from 
western democracy and capitalism to try to cure the multitude of 
ills afflicting his country 
he has freed scores of political prisoners opened the press to 
freewheeling reporting on oncetaboo subjects ended the communist 
partys monopoly on power and moved to make the country subject to 
the rule of law not the whims of a dictator 
popularly elected officials including many with unconventional 
views have been brought into the decisionmaking process ardent 
reformers have taken control of the moscow and leningrad city 
councils multiplecandidate elections a strong presidency and a 
working legislature have been cto rigid schemes 
such an approach however is not shared by all those with whom 
gorbachev shares power nor is the soviet populace solidly behind 
gorbachev who has admitted to miscalculations and mistakes 
during perestroika his program to restructure the soviet economy 
tens of thousands of protesters were allowed to march through 
red square on may day some jeered gorbachev and carried posters 
comparing him to nicolae ceausescu the stalinist dictator of 
romania executed in december in the midst of a popular uprising 
gorbachev has shown himself to have a thick skin sitting 
through much of the red square protest as well as hours of 
legislative debate that included harsh criticism of his policies 
he welcomes what the democratization of soviet society has 
fostered and advises conservatives not to be upset 
pluralism of opinions is not dissent but democratic centralism 
understood in a new way he told the central committee 
on occasion however he has complained bitterly that the press 
is too negative headlining societys problems without offering 
solutions 
informal political groups some of them seedlings of alternative 
parties have arisen throughout the country protesters have driven 
local leaders from office in dozens of regions 
although allowing such protests can be risky by exposing leaders 
directly to the peoples wrath gorbachev sees the political 
reawakening of his nation as a way to get people thinking and 
acting creatively to solve the countrys problems 
one can only welcome the fact that the broad mass of people 
has become involved in the management of the state and society 
he told the legislature 
inheriting an economy plagued by shortages long lines waste 
and little incentive for workers to produce more or better goods 
gorbachev has looked west for solutions although the word 
capitalism isnt creeping into the official vocabulary 
individual enterprise and marketoriented economy are 
in march the legislature passed a law permitting soviets for 
the first time in nearly 70 years to own the means of 
production an approach at odds with classical marxist doctrine 
karl marx saw in private ownership the roots of capitalist 
exploitation the russian revolution 72 years ago supposedly 
cleansed society of that evil the new law which takes effect july 
1 allows citizens to own small factories and hire their own 
workers 
another law allows peasants to bequeath the stateowned plots 
they till to their children 
the government is also considering commodity and stock exchanges 
and comprehensive price reform 
perhaps the most visible evidence that a touch of capitalism has 
come to this communist giant is the moscow mcdonalds a joint 
venture fostered by mcdonalds of canada the restaurant on 
pushkin square six blocks from the kremlin serves 45000 customers 
daily tass reported 
it is the largest mcdonalds in the world the line snaking 
along the sidewalk and around the square is rivaled only by the 
number of pilgrims standing patiently on red square waiting to be 
ushered into lenins tomb for a quick glimpse of the founder of the 
soviet state 
one joke making the rounds in leningrad implies gorbachev may be 
taking the reforms too far selling out to the west 
the soviets the joke goes decide to try to raise hard currency 
by auctioning off the lenin mausoleum the americans are the 
highest bidder and decide to move the mausoleum to lafayette park 
across pennsylvania avenue from the white house one day lenin 
returns from the dead and goes for a stroll he comes across a 
typical american supermarket its shelves fully stocked lenin 
elated but not realizing where he is proclaims you see what 
leninism has brought comrades

from the baltics to siberia to the southernmost 
republics the soviet union is being pulled apart by ethnic strife 
and economic selfinterest 
in place of the iron unity of the soviet communist party there 
are now dozens of parties hundreds have been killed in ethnic 
violence one in every 500 citizens is a refugee on a given day 
early this year 130000 people were on strike radical 
nationalists seek independence radical workers demand the kremlin 
leadership resign 
such byproducts of glasnost mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
openness are sure to be on the agenda when the soviet leader meets 
president bush in washington at months end 
in the baltics 
lithuania has declared itself independent in an attempt to show 
the way for its baltic neighbors and other republics seeking to 
escape the unbreakable union formed by josef stalin and 
extolled in the soviet national anthem 
neighboring latvia and estonia followed lithuanias march 11 
announcement by declaring an eventual restoration of the brief 
independence they had before being forcibly annexed a half century 
ago 
in the south 
georgian communists seek their own break with moscow and may 
soon follow the baltics in declaring their independence 
moldavian activists are looking across the prut river to 
romania to which moldavia belonged before being made part of the 
soviet union along with the balts 
azerbaijanis recently tore down frontier guard posts in a 
demonstration of their desire to unite with their ethnic brothers 
across the border in iran 
scores of christian armenians and moslem azerbaijanis have been 
killed in ethnic violence activists say soviet soldiers sent to 
end the deaths themselves killed scores more 
nationalists in the western ukraine extol guerrillas who fought 
soviet power until the early 1950s and press the rest of the 
republic to divorce itself from the union 
even in the russian republic itself home to more than half the 
nations people and with threefourths of its land mass dissidents 
are urging a break with the central government 
there as elsewhere the motivation is primarily economic 
alexander vlasov the russian republics premier and a candidate 
member of the national communist party politburo said in an 
interview published earlier this month that the republic could no 
longer afford to sell its vast raw materials and energy to other 
republics at depressed prices while itself paying inflated prices 
for goods from elsewhere in the union 
the russian governments obligation is to look out so that 
new wholesale and purchase prices answer the strategic interests of 
russia he said adding that the republic must demand its share 
of the hard currency its goods and raw materials earn abroad rather 
than seeing that money disappear into the national coffers 
other russians led by boris yeltsin gorbachevs most vocal and 
popular critic want more including a treaty governing relations 
with the union supremacy of russian laws over soviet ones and the 
right to conduct their own foreign relations 
every republic should have full sovereignty yeltsin told 
cheering delegates at the first meeting of the democratically 
elected russian legislature this month 
in siberia part of the russian federation but home to its own 
rebellion thousands of coal miners have struck for better pay and 
living conditions 
so far the central government has been unable to fulfill the 
promises it made last summer to end the walkout in april a new 
labor confederation organized in the siberian city of novokuznetsk 
called on the national government to resign 
said the federations declaration 
the fiveyear experience of transition to new economic 
conditions has manifested the failure of partial reforms in the 
economic system where there are no private initiative enterprise 
competition market and profit 
gorbachev has implored the dissidents whether motivated by 
nationalism or economics to think of the union first 
he has offered two republics latvia and estonia special 
status in a revamped soviet federation 
but in lithuania which has refused to rescind its declaration 
of immediate independence he has tightened the screws cutting off 
shipments of oil natural gas and other materials needed for 
everyday life and the republics industries 
his foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze says the 
dissidents have deliberately set a match to a powder keg 
none of them stops to think of the consequences of a social 
explosion capable of setting aflame not only addled minds but also 
the enormous stockpiles of nuclear and chemical weapons atomic 
power plants the zones already stricken by ecological and natural 
disasters and regions involved in ethnic strife 
shevardnadze like gorbachev has also found some good in the 
growing public discontent with the central government 
the most terrible thing is indifference when no one 
criticizes anyone and nothing makes any difference to anyone he 
told communist party comrades recently we have crossed this line 
and overcome indifference there are no indifferent people in the 
country any longer 
others have sharper opinions 
for latvian peoples front activist peteris lakis a 
sociologist the breakup of the soviet union is a necessity of 
history 
yuri afanasiev who is leading a reexamination of soviet 
history charges that lenin laid the foundation not of a workers 
paradise but of mass violence and state terror 
in all a far cry from the land envisioned in the countrys 
anthem

while foreign investment in this country gets 
most of the headlines these days american investors still are 
making waves of their own in the international marketplace for 
money 
consider that americans bought and sold a record 220 billion in 
foreign stocks during 1989 representing a 457 percent increase 
over the year before according to data from the treasury 
department 
the previous high of 190 billion was posted in 1987 
within the 1989 total us investors purchases exceeded sales 
by 137 billion notes david strongin director of international 
finance at the securities industry association a wall street trade 
group 
by far the biggest share of the net purchases more than 105 
billion was channeled to europe attracted by olitical upheaval 
in numerous nations and the approach of an economic alliance 
scheduled to take effect in 1992 
as a result of the opening of the east investment interest in 
europe has risen dramatically on an international level said 
heiko thieme an analyst at deutsche bank capital corp in new 
york this trend is also clearly visible among us investors 
in part observers say crossborder flows of money have been 
swollen simply by the international investment movement that has 
been spurred by improved financial research and communications 
around the world 
the trend has been abetted by the creation of new vehicles to 
meet the demand 
not so many years ago for example mutual funds set up to 
invest in overseas markets were little more than a curiosity in the 
world of professional money management now they are one of the 
biggest growth properties in the business 
in the first quarter of 1990 points out reg green publisher of 
the bodega bay califbased mutual fund news service sales of 
internationalfund shares to investors reached 25 billion up 
from 400 million in the comparable period of 1989 
the volcanic changes in europe have lit a fire under the 
international mutual funds green says 
to some all this bears many of the markings of a financial fad 
with the accompanying danger of a letdown once the visions it 
evokes start to collide with reality 
in any case however analysts say it provides a good gauge of 
how international investors see the world outlook in the early 
stages of a new decade 
in the 1990s global growth will be led by europe the pacific 
basin nations and perhaps parts of latin america say analysts at 
painewebber inc in a recent report on the subject 
the us economy slowed by a lingering budget deficit 
demographically ordained weak consumer spending and heavy debt 
loads will grow relatively slowly the 1990s look very different 
from the 1980s 
such expectations go a long way toward explaining the choices 
american investors have been making 
nevertheless painewebber has been making an alternative 
suggestion for investors wanting to get in on the overseas game 
without venturing far from home 
the firm suggests shopping among the stocks of the best 
foreign companies among us corporations firms that have 
powerful positions in foreign markets whether by virtue of exports 
or sales by foreign subsidiaries 
one need not look far to find candidates in this category a 
list compiled by painewebber of leading companies with large and 
growing foreign revenues includes such bluechip names as philip 
morris merck cocacola international business machines boeing 
and sara lee 
in the 1990s painewebber concludes investors will 
increasingly have to consider not just what an american company 
sells but where it sells it

the chairman of the democratic party was 
having lunch with three former chairmen inevitably the 
conversation turned to 1992 and who was making moves toward 
challenging george bush 
we couldnt come up with a candidate said john white one 
of the former chairmen at the table 
where are you bill bradley why arent you out there mario 
cuomo al gore dick gephardt what about it bob kerrey bill 
clinton sam nunn pat schroeder 
its kind of spooky said bruce babbitt the former arizona 
governor who was an early causalty in the race for the 1988 
democratic presidential nomination 
in may 1986 new hampshire was buzzing with overt and covert 
presidential campaign activity rep richard gephardt dmo and 
babbitt were campaigning actively others including thenvice 
president george bush had campaign people working in the state 
in the past six months no potential candidates have visited the 
state that holds the first presidential primary and no campaign 
people are soliciting support for candidates 
ditto for iowa where the first presidential caucuses 
traditionally attract some of the earliest maneuvering 
normally at this stage of the game you would have least one or 
two out making all the body language doing the fundraising 
denying they were a candidate but obviously you know you can 
smell em said white i dont find that anywhere now 
party chairman ronald h brown who hosted the luncheon that 
also included former chairmen robert strauss and charles t manatt 
said he doesnt share whites concern 
i really think a 1991 start is plenty of time i dont see 
any real reason or particular benefit to potential candidates being 
out this year he said 
brown acknowledged that it is important to move around the 
country to get to know what is on voters minds and to develop the 
techniques for communicating effectively with voters but he 
insisted that even those democrats being mildly mentioned are 
finding opportunities to get around the country 
by this time in the cycle id been out there campaigning 
for two years said walter f mondale who learned how tough it 
was to challenge a popular incumbent president 
the quietude is widely perceived as a general reluctance to jump 
into a race against the republican president whose approval ratings 
in opinion polls are at nearrecord levels 
there are a few stirrings 
virginia gov l douglas wilder plans to visit both iowa and new 
hampshire next month and get acquainted with people in the states 
that traditionally kick off the presidential nominating season 
a group of texans is getting organized to promote sen lloyd 
bentsen for president but the man who drew rave reviews as the 
1988 democratic vice presidential nominee insists hes not running 
on any given day jesse jackson is delvering a speech somewhere 
whether thats campaigning or just a way of life is anyones guess 
beyond those three there are lots of other names but very 
little activity 
babbitt is practicing law in phoenix and writing about the 
destruction of the rain forests in brazil and showing no 
inclination to repeat his 1988 adventure but like other democrats 
he worries about the lack of activity in his party 
its not a good idea to be sitting in the bleachers he 
said it looks like a tough game but you never know whats going 
to happen if everybody hangs back until the last minute its going 
to make it all that much harder 
even if bushs popularity holds and he proves unbeatable in 
1992 theres always 1996 and the prospect of running against dan 
quayle his approval ratings run about 40 points below those for 
bush 
i guess im more puzzled than troubled about why there seems 
to be so little activity said paul g kirk jr who was 
democratic party chairman during the 1988 campaign 
there are those who believe you have to run through this once 
before you can fully appreciate it and find the kind of stride and 
stamina and message that puts you in shape for another campaign 
said kirk 
mondale for one thinks its essential for potential democratic 
candidates to get out and discover what its like running for 
president 
its a different kind of politics its a different set of 
issues said the last democrat to serve as vice president he 
said a candidate needs the intensive travel to pick up your 
public message and identify the central themes in american 
life 
im not sure anybody knows how strong bush is going to be in 
92 mondale said he may be strong but i dont think thats 
for sure 
mondale took on ronald reagan in 1984 and got little thanks and 
fewer electoral votes for his trouble three years out of his life 
endless hours on airplanes thousands of bad meals nights spent 
tossing and turning in drab hotel rooms and for what 
he carried his home state of minnesota and the district of 
columbia a total of 13 electoral votes the lowest for any 
presidential candidate since alf landon was blown away by franklin 
d roosevelt in 1936 mondale was the consensus winner when he 
debated reagan on domestic issues but his party remembers only 
that he was a loser of historic proportions 
no one seems eager to join him in the record book 
no plans said bentsen when asked if he might run but the 
attention is nice its amazing what some of them presidential 
boosters come in and say i have people at airports walk up and 
say nice things which i always enjoy

take a close look at the 1990 nissan pathfinder se v6 4door 
4x4 is there a car lurking underneath that truck exterior 
youd swear there is once youve driven this welldesigned sport 
utility vehicle its no wonder the pathfinder beat out six 
competitors in car and driver magazines comparison of sport 
utilities 
the vehicle offered for a test drive came with nissans 2000 
sport option package and was surprisingly carlike in its handling 
and ride watch the tight turns however since sport utility 
trucks have a higher center of gravity and thus more body sway 
the pathfinder is especially versatile considering all the 
demands it is built to meet its smooth on pavement handles rocks 
with a minimum of bucking and rocking and takes grassy fields and 
occasional potholes with commendable ease 
much of the credit goes to the fivelink coilspring rear 
suspension a system pioneered by nissan when it introduced 
pathfinder as a 2door model for 1987 its designed to help each 
wheel work independently and suck up the bumps 
toyota has come up with a fourlink suspension but many other 
sport utilities still have leaf springs the type more common to 
pickup trucks 
several of my passengers also were pleased by the relative quiet 
inside the v6 engine teamed with a fivespeed manual transmission 
was not bad for a sport utility even when we rode with the stereo 
turned off 
the engine delivers 153 horsepower sufficient to power the 
pathfinder through the muck and snow admirably but dont look for 
sportscar acceleration in car and drivers comparison test the 
pathfinder did 060 mph in 12 seconds and ranked behind the jeep 
cherokee laredo and ford explorer in acceleration epa fuel economy 
with the automatic transmission is 15 mpg city 18 highway about 
average for 4door sport utilities with the fivespeed 
transmission its 15 mpg city 19 highway 
getting into a pathfinder gracefully without running boards 
takes practice though the test vehicle did have optional step 
rails in the form of rounded black bars running along the bottom 
of the doors outside women will find them ok with flat shoes 
tricky with heels 
getting in and out can also be messy after driving through mud 
because it tends to collect on the step rails around the wheel 
wells and at the bottom of the doors outside 
the pathfinders front seats were spacious and comfortable 
though i had to lean forward to tune the radio because the scan 
button was small and needed a precise touch 
the rear bench seat is comfortable roomy enough for three 
adults and can be folded down completely or one side at a time 
for extra cargo space to do that you have to remove the rearseat 
headrests so the seat back will fit flat behind the front seats 
and be sure to pull the seatbelt connectors back up after you 
unfold the rear seat otherwise they tend to fall below and cant 
be reached 
the 314cubicfoot carpeted cargo area is reached by a single 
rear door which opens left to right 
nissan hopes to sell about 30000 pathfinders this year and 
expects 85 percent of those to be the new 4doors the company only 
sold 17253 last year after raising prices 1500 to compensate 
for a new us tariff 
in 1988 nissan sold 30344 units and 34600 the year before 
that 
the company is pitching the truck at drivers 28 years and older 
with aboveaverage incomes buyers will need the money the 4door 
pathfinder test vehicle had a base price of 20149 and topped out 
at more than 22000 the twowheeldrive version starts at 15720 
main competitors include the toyota 4runner 4door which starts 
at more than 16200 for a model with a v6 engine and manual 
transmission and the isuzu trooper 4door ls model with a 
28liter v6 engine that starts at more than 16800 
consumer reports ranks 198788 pathfinders as much better than 
average in owner reports of trouble

no doubt about it farmers have an image 
problem with congress over the amount of taxpayer money used to 
subsidize the nations production of food and fiber 
its an old story and this years version is little different 
there are those who claim farmers have been on the public dole for 
decades and should be weaned off it 
others with matching fervor say food production is so vital to 
the american dream that agriculture deserves the moral spiritual 
and financial support of all citizens 
net spending on farm commodity programs including direct 
payments to farmers peaked at 258 billion in the 1986 fiscal 
year and has dropped sharply because of dwindling surpluses and 
higher market prices 
without choosing sides the general accounting office has taken 
one of its periodic looks at the situation in a new report 
farming and farm programs impact on the rural economy and on 
farmers 
the gao the chief investigative arm of congress really doesnt 
plow new fields in its 43page report but it does provide timely 
figures for use by lawmakers during the current 1990 farm bill 
debate 
congress hopes to agree on a new fiveyear blueprint in the next 
few months to succeed the current food security act of 1985 
although the law covers a wide range of measures such as 
conservation rural housing credit research international trade 
food stamps school lunches and other agriculture department 
functions a bundle of commodity programs is its core 
those cover price support operations for major commodities such 
as wheat corn and other feed grains soybeans cotton rice dairy 
products wool and mohair 
since the early 1930s the general thrust of government programs 
has been varying degrees of supply management to help prevent the 
buildup of huge crop surpluses and low prices 
in return for complying in the major crop programs those for 
dairy and some other commodities are structured differently 
farmers get federal price support guarantees or loans that can be 
repaid if market prices improve 
if market prices dont improve farmers can forfeit their 
commodities to the government and the debt is canceled taxpayers 
then own the forfeited crops 
additionally in recent times there are direct income subsidies 
called deficiency payments to make up the difference between 
low market prices and target prices specified by law 
the differences among the programs for specific commodities are 
often complicated tedious and difficult to comprehend just the 
right conditions for lobbyists and politicians 
another central theme for more than half a century holds that 
benefits accrue to those individual farmers who produce the most 
bushels bales or pounds of whatever item is covered by a usda 
program 
the worker who puts in 40 hours a week on an assembly line is 
going to get a fatter paycheck than the parttime employee working 
20 or 30 hours 
and the bigger the farm the bigger the production that makes 
for bigger subsidies at least thats the way it has been most of 
the time although in recent years congress has tried to limit the 
amounts individual producers can collect 
some in congress contend subsidies should be targeted to 
smaller familytype farms to help them survive 
john w harman the gaos director for food and agriculture 
issues said analysts looked at farmsector employment 
distribution of payments among various sizes of farming operations 
and some other factors relating to the before and after passage 
of the 1985 farm law 
in summary the number of farmingdependent counties is 
decreasing and nonagricultural employment in rural counties is 
increasingly important to those county economies harman told 
congress nine out of 10 rural workers are employed by nonfarm 
industries 
more than half of the nations farm families have one or more 
members working at nonfarm jobs he said 
for the most part the distribution of farm program payments 
did not change substantially after passage of the 1985 farm bill 
harman said during the 1985 through 1988 time period cash grain 
farmers received over half of all farm payments 
the gao report showed that in 1988 a total of 632690 farms 
participated in federal commodity programs which was less than 30 
percent of the 22 million farms in the united states that year 
these farms averaged 14257 each in farm payments in 1988 the 
gao report said but payments varied greatly by specialty which 
was based on the kind of production that represented at least 
onehalf a farms annual sales 
according to the gao report 273955 cash grain farmers 
collected an average of 18700 in 1988 representing about 57 
percent of the total payments 
cotton farms shown at 18095 units averaged 32785 each in 
1988 and 199804 producers of beef cattle hogs and sheep got 
10032 each the report said dairy farms totaled 69596 and 
averaged 10423 each 
the remainder of 1988 payments was accounted for by other crops 
and livestock operations 
looking at farm sizes as measured by annual dollar sales the 
gao report said that regardless of the type of operation those 
with 1988 sales of 500000 or more some 21701 farms had 
average farm program payments of 56571 
put another way those largest farms accounted for only 34 
percent of the us total number of units but got 136 percent of 
the 1988 government payments 
other sales categories 
250000 to 499999 sales 52260 farms averaged 35599 
100000 to 249999 sales 154060 farms averaged 21364 
40000 to 99999 sales 159691 farms averaged 10917 
10000 to 39999 sales 156591 farms averaged 4930 
9999 or less 88324 farms averaged 1410

the credibility of admitted felon ivan boesky is 
on trial along with his former associate john a mulheren jr 
mulherens lawyer said 
the attorney defending mulheren against charges of manipulating 
markets and breaking securities laws tried to shift the focus of 
the trial to boesky in his opening arguments thursday 
ivan boesky is john mulherens chief accuser and he is 
someone whos cheated and lied to both friend and foe alike hes 
one person who throughout his entire life has manipulated people 
attorney thomas p puccio said 
he will attempt before your eyes to manipulate you he said 
but assistant us attorney e scott gilbert said the 
government welcomes that scrutiny 
we submit that you will see that the testimony of these 
witnesses no matter how many crimes they have committed is 
confirmed by other evidence he said 
boesky wall streets most notorious felon is expected to 
testify as early as monday as the government tries to prove 
mulheren schemed with him to break the law 
it would be the first time boesky has taken the stand since his 
1986 plea agreement under which he agreed to supply information 
about other wall street figures in exchange for leniency 
boesky paid 100 million in penalties and pleaded guilty to one 
count of lying to federal securities regulators to settle the 
largest insider trading case in history he was released last month 
after serving two years of a threeyear prison sentence 
mulheren 40 is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy 
securities fraud mail fraud and violating federal recordkeeping 
laws he faces a maximum five years in prison and 250000 fine on 
each count 
the prosecutor told the jury mulheren manipulated the price of 
one stock and concealed ownership of others to help boesky cheat on 
his taxes and evade federal securities laws 
this case is about a twoway street of mutual advantage that 
ran between these men gilbert told a crowded courtroom 
he said in october 1985 mulheren bought 75000 shares of gulf amp 
western stock at boeskys behest helping to raise the share price 
25 cents to 45 a share 
that was the level at which boesky wanted to sell his 35 
million shares to the company after a failed takeover attempt the 
prosecutor said the sales executed in seven minutes helped 
boesky make 800000 gilbert said 
the government also charged mulheren had concealed the true 
ownership of stocks for boesky to help him avoid taxes during a 
business reorganization 
in alleged sham sales mulheren bought the stock but boesky 
retained control over the shares and was responsible for profits or 
losses 
some transactions were designed to help boeskys firm seemala 
corp avoid securities laws governing the amount of capital a 
brokerage firm must maintain gilbert said 
puccio told the jury not to confuse boeskys intentions with 
mulherens he said his client never thought he was breaking the 
law 
to the extent that john mulheren ever did anyone a favor or 
accommodated anyone in any way it was legal and he believed it to 
be legal puccio said there wasnt an agreement there wasnt 
a conspiracy there wasnt a meeting of the minds 
he said later a major part of his case will be boeskys 
credibility 
the stench that will be created by ivan boesky in this 
courtroom will not be removed until this trial is over puccio 
said and all the ammonia the government applies will not be able 
to remove it 
mulheren of rumson nj a diagnosed manic depressive was 
arrested in february 1988 carrying an assault rifle and army 
fatigues police said he planned to kill boesky state weapons 
possession charges later were dropped and mulheren placed on 
pretrial probation 
leonard destefano 34 a former trader at mulherens firm jamie 
securities is a codefendant he is charged with two counts of 
conspiracy and recordkeeping violations 
gilbert said destefano kept a running tally of the alleged 
illegal payments to boesky in violation of recordkeeping laws 
the jury trial is expected to last about six weeks 
testimony was expected to continue monday with the governments 
opening witness michael passarella a partner with the accounting 
firm price waterhouse on thursday he detailed the federal rules

t boone pickens one of the highest paid 
executives of the 1980s will start the new decade with no paycheck 
because of low natural gas prices 
in a meeting thursday with stockholders of his mesa limited 
partnership pickens noted that his salary is tied to cash 
distributions which the company has suspended because natural gas 
prices are so low 
pickens said distributions would resume when gas prices improve 
the turnaround wont come today and it wont come tomorrow 
but it will come he said in remarks prepared for delivery at the 
meeting 
in response to questions pickens estimated distributions could 
be resumed by 1992 or 1993 when mesa is predicting natural gas 
prices will reach about 3 per thousand cubic feet mesa expects 
prices to average 165 this year 
these measures have been tough on mesa unitholders as well as 
mesa executives pickens said adding that 90 percent of his net 
worth is tied up in mesa 
my compensation is based on 1 percent of distributions so 
with no distributions i receive no salary in 1990 
last year pickens was paid 18 million based on distributions 
of 180 million mesa spokesman jay rosser said 
according to business week magazine pickens was the sixth 
highest paid executive of the 1980s pulling down 569 million 
from 198089 
1990 will be another tough year pickens predicted saying 
mesa will focus its attention on debt reduction 
pickens admitted he may have paid too much in 1988 when he 
bought gas reserves from tenneco inc a move responsible for much 
of mesas longterm debt 
considering todays gas price we may have been a little too 
aggressive he said 
he also conceded past distributions to unitholders may have been 
excessive in light of falling natural gas prices but if 
distributing money to shareholders is a mistake its a burden i 
can shoulder he said 
distributions had been maintained through profits from other 
mesa investments 
the tenneco purchase and the doubling of our reserve base to 
26 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalents from 1985 to 
1989 will pay off in the coming 18 to 24 months pickens said 
our day will come 
if i wasnt confident about the growth potential of the 
natural gas industry i would have sold out long ago he said 
rosser said an overwhelming number of the 300 shareholders at 
the meeting said they supported mesas decision to remain a limited 
partnership instead of converting to a corporation limited 
partnerships have lost favor somewhat in recent years with changing 
tax laws 
rosser said many of the shareholders also voiced support of 
pickens in his battle with koito manufacturing co ltd of japan 
through his merchant banking firm boone co pickens has bought 
up more than 26 percent of the auto parts manufacturer he has been 
rebuffed in his efforts to review the companys books gain 
representation on the board and demand a higher dividend though 
pickens said the battle is an example of how japan is closed to 
us investors charging koito and toyota motor co koitos other 
major shareholder with unfair trade practices

meredith corp was talking big losses 
but analysts said the conglomerates decision to sell several 
businesses and focus on its core media interests would provide 
opportunities for future earnings growth 
meredith best known for its better homes and gardens and 
ladies home journal magazines disclosed it would write down 
earnings by 64 million in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year to 
cover expected losses on asset sales 
the onetime charge would result in the companys first 
fullyear loss since 1973 
meredith also said wednesday evening that completion of a 
previously announced 4875 million sale of a printing business 
will be delayed until the fiscal year that begins july 1 proceeds 
from that sale could have offset the losses 
meredith fell 75 cents thursday to close at 2750 a share on 
the new york stock exchange 
analysts said meredith was acknowledging its poor track record 
in investing profits from its magazines and seven television 
stations in other ventures and signaling a return to its core 
businesses 
the company has had its wrists slapped by the market for going 
into investments outside its basic expertise said claude 
carmichael who follows meredith for the new york securities firm 
of wr lazard laidlaw amp mead 
its a negative that they lost the money its positive in 
that theyre getting back to what they do well he said 
w whitney george of dominick amp dominick in new york called the 
disclosures a major step toward being a highly profitable company 
in what we recognize as two wonderful businesses its unfortunate 
it took them so long 
meredith said it would take the writeoff to cover expected 
losses on the sale of its interests in real estate brokerages in 
san francisco and saddle river nj and a moneylosing television 
advertising sales subsidiary in new york it also said it was 
taking a loss on syndicated television programs it purchased that 
did not perform up to expectations 
after taxes meredith said the writedowns would reduce fourth 
quarter earnings by about 50 million or 268 a share and that 
the company will expect to report a net loss for the fiscal 
year 
spokesman steve salato would not speculate on the size of the 
loss but said it would be the first for a full fiscal year since 
1973 
meredith earned 235 million or 127 a share in the first 
nine months of the fiscal year earnings in fiscal 1989 were 332 
million or 175 a share 
president jack rehm said the company felt it could not wait 
until the july earnings report to disclose the losses he insisted 
the writeoff did not endanger merediths overall vitality 
carmichael said the sale of the printing business has been 
delayed by a federal trade commission antitrust review 
meredith hoped to conclude the sale of meredithburda before the 
quarter ended and could have used its share of the proceeds to 
offset the writedowns it said it still believes the deal will be 
completed 
meredithburda is equally owned by meredith and the burda family 
of west germany the buyer is rr donnelley amp sons co the 
leading commercial printer in north america 
carmichael said the only wild card could be if meredith uses 
proceeds from the sale of meredithburda for another investment 
they will have a lot of cash they have not been good 
investors he said 
he said meredith could be interested in womans day magazine 
which diamandis communications inc put up for sale earlier this 
week 
meredith magazine group spokesman rick phillips declined to 
comment about womans day saying the company doesnt speculate on 
possible acquisitions

insurance industry officials are reacting 
cautiously to the chicago board of trades plan to introduce 
insurance futures contracts 
the exchange says the innovative products would provide a 
measure of price protection to the insurance industry and help 
lower consumer costs for health care health insurance and car 
insurance 
but people within the insurance industry say they need to hear 
more about the proposed contracts and the board of trade is 
keeping a lid on details while it prepares an application for 
regulatory approval 
until they cough up some details were just going to sit 
tight and see what develops said cheryl van tilburg spokeswoman 
for the blue cross and blue shield association the nations 
largest health insurer 
spokeswoman georgiana smith of the washingtonbased american 
insurance asssocation agreed i think were going to have to wait 
until they actually come out with what theyve developed 
the proposed contracts one for health insurance and one for 
auto insurance would require the approval of the commodity 
futures trading commission the federal agency that regulates 
futures trading 
the board of trade did not provide details of the proposed 
contracts in its announcement wednesday citing competition within 
the futures industry 
richard sandor a former board of trade economist who helped 
design the proposed contracts said insurance and reinsurance 
companies could use the contracts to hedge against price swings in 
their dealings with each other 
reinsurance is the practice among insurance carriers of selling 
policies to other insurers to spread the risk around 
a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or 
basket of commodities at some future date for a price agreed upon 
in advance 
an insurance futures contract might represent a basket of 
insurance policies maturing at the same time futures industry 
officials said by trading these contracts insurance and 
reinsurance companies could lock in certain costs and revenues in 
advance thus reducing their exposure to price changes 
the savings they realize from reduced risk could be passed on to 
consumers in the form of lower insurance premiums supporters said 
sandor is considered one of the architects of interestrate 
futures which are widely used by banks and institutional 
investors those contracts along with various other financial 
futures products are responsible for a huge increase in futures 
trading volume since they were introduced in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s 
these new contracts could be as major an innovation as 
interestrate futures sandor said 
the insurance business is an extremely risky business said 
board of trade chairman karsten mahlmann there is a tremendous 
need out there 
sandor conceded the exchange faces an enormous task of 
educating the insurance industry on how to use futures markets 
christian milton the head of reinsurance buying for the new 
yorkbased american international group said he would like to be 
able to lock in prices but he and others questioned whether the 
board of trade could design a standardized reinsurance agreement on 
which to base trading 
there just isnt any standard reinsurance arrangement said 
robert faber a reinsurance executive at the allstate insurance co 
each time we go back to renegotiate our client companies may 
have a higher appetite for risk or lower he said

company announced 
burkes appointment effective june 1 was approved unanimously 
by the companys board of directors which met in bristol following 
the companys annual meeting thursday

of them at capital cities communications inc which bought 
american broadcasting cos for 35 billion in 1985

four major banks are complaining to federal 
regulators that american telephone amp telegraph co is illegally 
marketing a combined general credit card and phone calling card 
the banks in filings with the federal communications 
commission the federal deposit insurance corp and the federal 
reserve said the phone giant is trying to act like a bank without 
being subject to banking laws and that it is improperly offering 
discounted longdistance calling as an inducement to gain customers 
one of the banks san franciscobased bankamerica corp said 
thursday it wanted only a level playing field in order to compete 
against a nonbanking company with tremendous market presence 
that is in practical effect directly offering a banking service 
without being sujbect to banking laws and bank regulatory 
oversight 
in their fcc filing the banks said that by offering 10 percent 
longdistance discounts to holders of its atampt universal card the 
telephone giant was illegally discriminating against other atampt 
customers 
atampt which in march began offering its calling card customers a 
combined phone cardvisa or phone cardmastercard called the 
banks allegations absolutely without merit 
the fcc filing cited published reports estimating that atampt 
could have 5 million customers for its credit card by the end of 
this year with a total portfolio estimated at 5 billion 
credit card industry officials have said that consumers loaded 
down with bulging wallets full of plastic probably would find a 
combined credit card attractive and put big pressure on 
traditional bank cards 
doug jones the fdics deputy general counsel said the banks 
bankamerica citicorp mbna america bank and chase manhattan corp 
were alleging banking violations he would not elaborate 
fdic spokesman david barr said the banks had sent a 53page 
petition to the agency tuesday with a 10page cover letter to fdic 
chairman l william seidman atampt spokesman jim mcgann said the 
banks also filed a complaint with the georgia state banking 
commission 
the banks told the fcc that atampt was charging discriminatory 
phone rates had failed to have the 10 percent discount approved 
failed to file tariffs for finance charges and late charges imposed 
on the card users and discriminated against other credit card 
holders in access to phone service 
peter gallagher senior vice president for corporate and 
consumer affairs at atampt universal card services corp said atampt 
was not violating telephone rules because the card was being 
offered through an unregulated business the bank 
we anticipated these questions gallagher said but we did 
our homework before offering the card in march im absolutely 
confident we are in total compliance with the appropriate laws 
rules and regulations 
as a socalled dominant carrier atampt must receive approval from 
the fcc for all its telecommunications prices and contracts 
but gallagher said atampts agreement with universal bank a 
subsidiary of synovus financial corp of columbus ga called for 
the bank to purchase the receivables that are due for the calls 
charged to the universal bank card at the full tariffed rate so 
there is no discount there is no discrimination and the universal 
bank bills and collects for those receivables and has decided to do 
it at a 10 percent discount rate 
he acknowleged that universal bank was established solely to 
service the credit card 
i dont know for a fact that theyre precluded from doing 
anything but that i dont think thats the case at all 
gallagher added 
gallagher also rejected the banks assertion that universal bank 
was acting as a reseller of phone services which also would fall 
under fcc regulation and that the universal card discriminated 
against nonatampt credit card holders who try to use atampt coinless 
pay phones 
we are not going to be deterred by any diversionary tactics 
gallagher said were committed to the credit card business 
were here to stay 
while refusing to divulge any subscription figures for the card 
gallagher said the response has been wonderful 
he said atampt received 250000 inquiries about the card in the 
first 24 hours after it was offered 
he said demand was running 250 percent ahead of what the company 
had forecast

xerox corp will introduce a line of 
electronic copiers later this year that will set the pace for the 
company in the next decade officials said at the annual 
shareholders meeting 
xerox officials divulged little thursday about the new 
multifunction products other than to say they will use 
digital scanners rather than the light lenses used by most copiers 
the new line is being developed in rochester where most of the 
stamford connbased companys operations are located the 
products will allow all kinds of information to be easily 
translated into a digital stream that enables images to be 
combined printed at the most convenient location and even filed 
electronically said president paul a allaire 
we think this is the wave of the future said chairman david 
kearns 
other companies already offer digital imaging products in which 
documents are transformed into computer code that can be 
electronically stored and manipulated it was unclear how the 
planned xerox products would compare with these 
officials also said at the meeting that xerox profits will be 
down in 1990 because of its troubled real estate and insurance 
subsidiaries despite growth in earnings at its business equipment 
and systems division 
the company took a 400 million writeoff in the first quarter 
because of financial problems at vms realty partners of chicago in 
which xerox had invested more than 500 million that writeoff was 
the main reason xerox reported a 254 million loss in the first 
quarter 
kearns said the company does not expect any other writeoffs in 
connection with vms 
thats over were out of that business he said 
xerox will remain in the financial services business but will 
review our financial services strategy to ensure that we 
concentrate our resources exclusively in those businesses which 
will add profit growth and value to our shareholders kearns said 
xeroxs insurance business crum and forster inc suffered a 56 
percent drop in income in the first quarter the business however 
is positioned well for improved profits when the insurance cycle 
turns up kearns said 
in april xerox sold its personal insurance business 
in other business at the meeting shareholders rejected a 
proposal that xerox completely withdraw from south africa by no 
longer providing materials products services or technology to 
that country 
shareholders also defeated a proposal that the company adopt the 
macbride principles equal employment opportunity guidelines for 
companies operating in northern ireland

deleveraging may be the buzzword as the 1980s 
debt boom gives way to a more prudent era in finance but the trend 
could mean higher borrowing costs for home buyers students and 
farmers 
federal officials seeking to prevent another debacle like the 
savings and loan collapse are urging congress to tighten capital 
requirements for governmentsponsored enterprises that have 
hundreds of billions of dollars in loans outstanding 
gses like the federal national mortgage association fannie 
mae the student loan marketing association sallie mae and the 
farm credit system were established and chartered by the federal 
government in recent decades to steer credit to housing education 
and agriculture 
the agencies are private corporations but because they were set 
up under federal sponsorship and designed to foster public goals 
most investors regard them as having the treasurys implicit 
guarantee against default 
thats what has congress and the treasury concerned after all 
federal guarantees of thrift deposits are widely perceived as 
having encouraged freewheeling lending by sampls and led to the 
bailout that could cost taxpayers up to 500 billion 
the markets perception of federal backing for gses weakens 
the normal relationship between the availability and cost of funds 
to the gses and the risks that these enterprises assume robert 
glauber undersecretary of the treasury for finance told a house 
ways and means subcommittee last week 
that perception also lets the agencies provide more loans with 
the same amount of capital backing than other commercial lenders 
that is very similar to problems of excessive risktaking that 
occurred in the thrift industry glauber said 
to pad its cushion against risk the treasury wants to require 
the agencies to maintain enough capital to obtain a triplea rating 
the peak of creditworthiness based on their balance sheets 
alone and not the implicit guarantee if an agency doesnt 
congress should sever the guarantee the treasury says 
standard amp poors corp a leading credit rater has suggested 
to congress that most of the agencies would fall short of triple a 
for sallie mae the difference is probably small sampp said for 
fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corp freddie mac 
its more substantial the farm credit system probably would get 
only a high junk rating sampp said 
for all of them one thing seems clear they would have to 
reduce the amount of financial leverage they have right now says 
thomas gillis a managing director at sampp 
take the biggest agencies fannie mae and freddie mac they buy 
home mortgages holding some in their portfolios and packaging the 
rest as securities for sale to investors 
the two agencies own or have repackaged about 650 billion in 
mortgages a quarter of the nations total theyre also growing 
fast today they purchase more than half of all new mortgages 
yet for every dollar of exposure fannie mae has just 11 cent 
in equity and reserves freddie mac a little under a penny 
commercial banks are in the process of boosting their equity 
capital ratio to 4 cents 
raising capital will increase the cost of doing business for the 
agencies to the extent that their costs are increased it will 
get passed through to homebuyers predicts andrew carron manager 
of research for mortgagebacked securities at first boston corp 
fannie mae plans to add at least 2 billion in capital this year 
and next by retaining earnings says timothy howard chief 
financial officer but if congress enacts tougher capital 
requirements howard says it could slow the agencys growth 
reducing a key supply of funds to the mortgage market 
freddie mac president leland c brendsel doesnt concede the 
need for more capital he says his operations are less risky than a 
bank or sampl 
freddie mac wont buy a mortgage bigger than about 187000 for 
example and it requires 20 percent down payments it and fannie 
mae have insurance on many mortgages from third parties and their 
holdings are spread across the country so they shouldnt get 
whacked by plunging home prices in the southwest or northeast 
indeed freddie macs earnings rose in every year of the 80s 
too much capital is bad just as too little capital is bad 
brendsel says if congress toughens requirements too much he says 
the price will be paid ultimately by home buyers in the mortgage 
rates they pay 
albert lord chief financial officer at sallie mae questions 
why the treasury wants the agencies to be tripleas when none of 
the nations major commercial banks are rated that highly it 
would certainly be a very different standard than any other company 
operates under he says 
in the end the decision will be a political one as much as an 
economic one says gillis of sampp 
theres always a compromise that you have to have between 
safety and public purpose he says if the treasury wants more 
security against another big bailout he adds public purpose in 
the form of cheap mortgages and farm loans are likely to suffer

budget negotiators should limit next years 
deficit cuts to 50 billion to 60 billion far less than the law 
requires say top fiscal experts for congress and the bush 
administration 
the advice if followed would make it easier and less 
politically painful for participants in the budget summit to 
reach a deficitreduction deal for 1991 
white house officials and congressional leaders met in the 
capitol thursday for their second round of talks on the 12 
trillion budget for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
that spending plan will have to contain an enormous amount of 
taxes or spending cuts to meet the 64 billion deficit ceiling 
mandated by the grammrudman balanced budget law 
at thursdays session negotiators did not agree on what size of 
budgetcutting package they need 
its bouncing all over the ballpark 60 billion 45 billion 
50 billion said senate budget committee chairman james sasser 
dtenn 
their own analysts gave them wildly differing figures about the 
size of the looming shortfall 
the nonpartisan congressional budget office said next years 
budget gap looks like it will be 149 billion to 159 billion that 
would mean savings either new taxes or spending slashes of 85 
billion to 95 billion to shrink the shortfall to the grammrudman 
target of 64 billion 
the white houses office of management and budget projected a 
shortfall of 123 billion to 138 billion that would necessitate 
59 billion to 74 billion in cuts to hit the grammrudman ceiling 
neither set of figures includes the cost of rescuing the 
countrys savings and loan institutions a bailout that could cost 
the government tens of billions of dollars next year 
yet according to participants cbo director robert reischauer 
and omb director richard darman agreed that savings should be 
limited to 50 billion to 60 billion 
the two budget experts said deficit cuts exceeding that amount 
could slow an already weak economy many economists worry that 
taking more than that amount away from consumers and government 
contractors in the form of higher taxes or spending cuts could 
prompt a recession 
some negotiators have said that loosening the deficit targets in 
the grammrudman law could be one way of keeping automatic cuts 
from taking effect 
darman also presented negotiators with examples of the spending 
cuts the grammrudman law would impose next year if congress and 
president bush fail to enact a deficitreduction plan the law 
would trigger enough cuts to reduce the deficit to 64 billion 
according to the budget chief 30 billion in grammrudman cuts 
would mean a 104 percent cut in domestic programs and a 76 
percent reduction in defense spending a 60 billion cutback would 
pare domestic programs by 222 percent and defense by 152 percent 
in january bush released a proposed budget asserting that only 
37 billion in savings would be needed to reach the grammrudman 
deficit target 
the administration says that since that time projected costs of 
aiding the savings and loan industry have grown interest rates 
have jumped and tax collections have dropped democrats point out 
that cbo and many private economists have been expecting the higher 
deficit figures for months 
the budget talks are expected to last weeks or months both 
sides are being cautious in suggesting how to cope with a problem 
that could mean unpopular tax increases or spending reductions in 
an election year

grain and soybean futures prices turned lower 
after a mostly higher opening this morning on the chicago board of 
trade 
analysts said the selling reflected preweekend profittaking 
and positionevening some of it by traders who had participated in 
the buying that boosted prices across the board on thursday 
the crop markets were expected to trade on either side of 
unchanged today william biedermann research director with the 
commodities brokerage allendale inc said todays early strength 
was partly a reaction to increased export sales of us grains and 
soybeans last week as reported by the agriculture department on 
thursday 
weather forecasts also were mainly supportive biedermann said 
more rain was expected this weekend in the soaked winter wheat 
fields of the southern plains and in the midwest where rain has 
delayed corn planting 
the way the weather forecast looks it will be late next week 
before farmers in southern illinois will be able to get into their 
fields he said were definitely looking at corn yield 
reductions 
the wet midwestern weather could lead to increased soybean 
plantings though if farmers waiting out the rain decide to shift 
planned corn acreage into beans 
in early trading wheat futures were 1 cents to 2 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in may at 387 a bushel corn 
futures were cent to 2 cents lower with may at 286 a bushel 
oats were unchanged to 4 cents lower with may at 154 a bushel

social security commissioner gwendolyn king 
today defended her agency against frequent criticism that people 
have trouble getting adequate service from the agency and often get 
bad advice 
the employees of social security care about their jobs and 
care about the quality of their work mrs king told the special 
senate committee on aging my goal is to build upon their record 
of success and raise the agencys level of service to even 
greater heights 
mrs king said she welcomes constructive criticism but vowed to 
avoid having our course disrupted by criticism that serves no 
constructive purpose 
she was more blunt in an interview just one day earlier when 
she lashed out at congressional critics for a steady stream of 
criticism that she said has been counterproductive in some cases 
talk is easy she said in an interview thursday with the 
associated press its harder to make a difference 
mrs king said she found it particularly galling that 
congressional critics have been soliciting horror stories from 
social security caseworkers 
you have to look at the big picture and not focus on all the 
anecdotes that you can muster she said in the interview 
social security is across the board serving people answering 
telephones handling problems and its amazing to me how well 
theyre doing 
the agency whose staff was slashed by 20 percent during the 
reagan administration has been faulted for declining service 
providing inaccurate information and frequent busy signals on its 
tollfree telephone network 
mrs king who took over the agency in august said her 
frustration was not aimed solely at congress she alluded to 
negative media coverage of the agency and cited disgruntled 
employees who come in with gripes and criticism that may have 
been relevant a year ago 
from every sector you will find people zeroing in on a 
microcosm of problems anecdotal in nature and certainly needing 
fixing mrs king said while we care about every single person 
i do have to keep the big picture in mind 
mrs king said she welcomes constructive criticism but she 
expressed concern that unfair reports could undermine public 
confidence in social security 
youre going to get people frightened and concerned about 
whether the system is going to be there to serve them she said 
the impression left of a stumbling inept agency down on its 
knees is one that really does translate into a real problem 
she also expressed concern for hardworking employees who pick 
up the newspaper every day and find that somebody is leveling them 
for something that they all know is a very small portion of all the 
work thats done 
it bothers me and its fair to say it bothers people at 
social security that we always seem to get dumped on and nobody 
ever takes the time to say you know that was a good job mrs 
king said 
she invited her critics to be a part of the solution and not 
just a part of the griping problem 
mrs king said the agency had improved its operations over the 
past year sharply reduced the busy signals on its tollfree 800 
number and hired 500 workers to address staffing shortages 
a study by the inspector general of the department of health and 
human services found a large majority of social security clients 
surveyed called the service helpful and accurate she said 
she criticized several legislative proposals including a bill 
to separate the social security administration from hhs she said 
another proposal to require that local social security office phone 
numbers not just the 800 number be listed in telephone books was 
specious and trite 
surely the us congress has more important business to get 
about she said

share prices fell in active trading friday on the 
london stock exchange as the market consolidated from thursdays 
impressive rally 
the key financial timesstock exchange 100share index on 
thursday made its sharpest daily gain in more than two years 
finishing up 633 points or 285 percent at 22844 on friday 
it closed down 153 points or 067 percent at 22691 a touch 
above its low for the day of 22685 
everyone said it would be a day of consolidation and thats 
what happened commented senior dealer paul corbett of the 
panmure gordon ltd brokerage 
the financial times 30share index ended 24 points lower at 
17933 volume was a healthy 5948 million shares down from 6454 
million the day before the financial times 500share index was 
down 606 at 122379 
in the futures market the june ftse 100 index contract 
finished at 22950 down from 23290 thursday 
although the 100share index in the cash market started the 
session well ahead on strong stockindex futures contracts and 
firmness in the underlying shares profit taking and a retreat of 
institutional investors trimmed share prices dealers said 
in addition a weak opening on wall street which has recently 
had greater influence than usual on londons performance helped 
shave the gains 
thursdays rally was largely driven by rumors that the pound 
would enter the european monetary systems exchange rate mechanism 
shortly although chancellor of the exchequer john major reiterated 
late thursday that entry was still months away and lower inflation 
was a precondition dealers in london said investors took heart at 
what they felt was a further indication of the governments intent 
to fully join the ems 
most traders were optimistic about the markets potential in the 
short term anticipating a drifting in prices for several days and 
then another rally although probably not as dramatic as thursdays 
633point surge

billionaire h ross perot has hooked up again with 
an old boss signing on to provide consulting services to ibm 
under the agreement perot systems corp will advise 
international business machines corp how to best expand its 
computer processing and services organization 
as we started enlarging our computer service unit we realized 
we needed to learn more about this business said bill wilson 
general manager of ibms systems services unit in its national 
services division were trying to tap into as many sources as we 
can to learn the dynamics of the industry 
the first thing perot is giving us is advice on the business 
and how to operate a business in it wilson added theyre 
showing us how to build a management structure to meet the 
requirements to grow in this field 
perot systems president pat horner refused to disclose the terms 
of the deal with ibm saying the company does not discuss its 
contract awards 
analysts suggested the agreement is designed to help both 
companies compete better against dallasbased electronic data 
systems corp perots former company which dominates the field of 
providing corporate data processing and putting together computer 
networks for large businesses 
perot who once was a successful ibm computer salesman sold eds 
to general motors corp in 1986 for 2 billion and gm stock which 
the automaker later repurchased for 700 million to remove perot 
from the company after repeated clashes with gm chairman roger 
smith 
the billionaire then created perot systems to compete with eds 
ibm best known as a manufacturer of computer hardware launched 
its effort to provide computer processing and consulting services 
two years ago it now provides computer services for several major 
clients including eastman kodak co and hibernia corp 
the agreement may help both sides generate more business said 
stephen mcclellan an analyst with merrill lynch amp co in new york 
ibm may be able to share customer leads developed by its large 
sales force while perot systems can lend credibility to ibms 
service offerings mcclellan said 
for ibm its like getting the good housekeeping seal of 
approval he said 
but perot also may be helping a potential future competitor in 
the computer services industry mcclellan said

shearson lehman hutton inc coping with recent 
management upheaval and big losses is expected to reorganize by 
uncoupling its investment banking and brokerage operations and 
possibly changing its name company sources said friday 
the plan which is likely to be announced by months end could 
help rehabilitate the image of the troubled american express co 
unit whose losses neared 1 billion last quarter company 
executives familiar with the proposed realignment said 
shearson is the nations secondlargest securities company 
behind merrill lynch amp co it grew by leaps and bounds in the boom 
years of the 1980s but has faced increasing financial and 
management problems in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash 
under the proposed reorganization the companys various 
divisions would be split between two new operating units according 
to the company sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the retail brokerage and asset management businesses would be 
combined into one unit which would include about 10000 
stockbrokers catering to individual investment needs the sources 
said it would probably retain the shearson name they said 
the other unit would focus on corporate finance including the 
firms investment banking and capital markets operations and could 
operate under the resurrected name of lehman brothers once one of 
the most trusted names on wall street 
sherman r lewis jr currently head of investment and merchant 
banking and richard s fuld jr head of capital markets are 
likely to head that unit they said 
the parent company probably would also change its name to 
either shearson lehman holdings inc or slh holdings inc with the 
two separate divisions under it the sources said 
steven faigen a spokesman for shearson said he couldnt 
confirm or deny the reorganization plans 
at this time the firm is examining a number of options that 
would result in a more customerdriven organizational structure 
he said friday but we havent made any decision on exactly how 
well move ahead on that score 
securities analysts said reorganizing would be a positive step 
for shearson which has struggled to integrate its numerous 
acquisitions over the years 
it would give it a new identity said perrin long of lipper 
analytical services inc 
long added that such a plan might also make it easier for 
american express which has a controlling stake in shearson to 
sell the firm some time down the line american express has denied 
it has any plans to sell shearson or any of its parts 
in addition long said that by reviving the lehman brothers name 
for its investment bank shearson could help to keep good people 
within the old lehman organization 
shearson formerly known as shearsonamerican express acquired 
lehman brothers kuhn loeb inc in 1984 the merged shearson lehman 
purchased ef hutton amp co in 1988 
the proposed reorganization reportedly has been in the works 
since howard l clark jr a former american express official 
became shearson chairman earlier this year replacing peter a 
cohen who resigned 
clark was unavailable for comment shearson officials said 
during the first three months of 1990 shearson lost 915 
million the largest in securities industry history mostly to 
pay for a restructuring that included 2000 layoffs and business 
cuts initiated by american express 
american express which currently owns 61 percent of shearson 
recently signed an agreement to buy the rest of its outstanding 
common shares american express was forced to inject more than 1 
billion into shearson to shore up its finances

the hottest investment in tokyo this year is cash 
with uncertainty in japans stock and bond markets many 
investment managers have sought shelter for their money they are 
finding it in tokyos overnight money markets shortterm 
certificates of deposit and other interestbearing cash 
investments brokers and analysts say 
while the rush to cash investments is paying shortterm 
dividends to investors some experts fear it could swell the money 
supply and pressure interest rates higher around the world 
people are hiding in cash and cds from all of the unpleasant 
possibilities said william h brown president the investment 
advisory firm of scudder stevens and clark overseas 
the rate for unsecured overnight call loans the shortestterm 
cash investment has been above 7 percent recently hovering just 
about 02 percentage points under the yield of the benchmark 
10year japanese government bond 
threemonth certificates of deposit yielded as high as 750 
percent recently compared with 684 percent at the beginning of 
the year in april 1989 3month cd yields were 458 percent 
such high rates offer investors a rewarding hedge for their 
money while market turbulence continues stock prices remain more 
than 20 percent below their levels at the beginning of the year 
the situation recalls the run for cover by many american 
investors who sought the safety of cash investment following the 
1987 market collapse 
who wants to be the first to stick out their neck by taking a 
stand when you can get those kinds of rates on the overnight 
calls said one dealer who asked not to be identified if im 
20 percent in cash and youre 40 percent in cash and the equities 
market crashes again who wins you do 
at county natwest securities analyst david threadgold remarked 
id be very surprised if a lot more money werent going into 
cash 
as a result japans money supply is far above a level justified 
by its economy in the view of the official bank of japan 
the broad money supply which includes shortterm investments 
like cds rose 117 percent from january through march in that 
period the stock market lost a quarter of its value the yen lost 
more than 10 percent vs the dollar and government bond prices 
dropped to about 85 percent of their face value 
the central bank had forecast only a 9 percent expansion of the 
money supply for the quarter bank of japan officials said a major 
cause of the excessive growth was the merrygoround of 
funds through cash instruments as investors darted in and out of 
various markets 
the bank said prices remained stable but the cash glut shows no 
sign of abating and could eventually heat up inflation the central 
bank is now predicting 11 percent money growth for the marchmay 
quarter 
it means more inflation and that will result in higher 
interest rates whether the bank of japan does anything about it or 
not brown said 
the fear of still higher interest rates both in japan and abroad 
will limit any stock market rally many analysts said 
the market believes rates are going higher west germany will 
have to raise rates to deal with east germany that will set off 
another round of world hikes said one 
mitsuhiko kinugasa a currency dealer with daiwa bank said the 
yens recent rise resulted partly from life insurers selling us 
treasury bonds and converting the proceeds into yen for shortterm 
investment in japan 
an insurance company fund manager speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the rates in tokyo now are undeniably 
attractive

chrysler corp officially announced today it 
will produce its pricey dodge viper sports car with the first 200 
of the corvette competitors to be available in the 1992 model year 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca said the viper which debuted in 
prototype form at the detroit auto show in january 1989 was 
expected to generate 400 horsepower from its allnew v10 engine 
and would cost under 50000 he wouldnt be more exact about 
the price 
iacocca said his engineers told him they believed the sleek 
convertible with an integrated roll bar and exhaust pipes built 
into a cutaway side will be able to go from 0 to 60 mph in 39 
seconds it will reach a top speed of 188 mph 
chrysler officials at a news conference said they eventually 
expect to produce about 5000 vipers a year to be sold at 300 to 
500 us dealerships 
iacocca said developing the viper had cost chrysler tens and 
tens of millions not hundreds of millions adding it can make 
money for the company at a sales pace of 5000 cars a year 
among the team that came up with the viper concept was chrysler 
consultant carroll shelby the father of the popular shelby cobras 
chrysler says the viper is the first product produced by a 
computerdriven conceptual design and rendering system which 
is supposed to cut by 25 percent the time it takes to bring a 
totally new car to market 
iacocca said the viper would be made in this country but he was 
not more specific 
chrysler also is working on a new line of sleek midsize cars 
and an additional model for its profitable jeep line among other 
vehicles 
todays news conference caps a sixcity tour promoting the 
quality of chrysler cars iacocca claims they now equal japanese 
models and are the safest on the road 
he told shareholders the companys 156 billion fiveyear 
product development plan would pay off 
i think weve got a good program well come back in the next 
six months he said after the meeting in universal city 
iacocca acknowledged at the meeting that the companys 
difficulties have hurt its share price 
nobody in this room is more frustrated than i am at our stock 
sitting there at about 17 a share today he said hell that 
means the stock is less than half the book value of the company 
and its half a billion less than the cash we have in the bank 
nevertheless he said the company is much stronger than a decade 
ago when it survived only because the government cosigned its 
loans chrysler has much more cash far less debt and a bigger 
market share than it did in 1980 he said 
he denied that his latest ad campaign constituted japanbashing 
saying he never said a word against the japanese people or the 
highquality products they produce but only against their trade 
practices and the us government for allowing them 
the fact is japan bashing is a headline or a tv soundbite 
thats become a code word for racism iacocca said he said he 
would not be intimidated by such gutter innuendo 
sorry to say it seems to come with the territory these days 
if youre an american trying to peddle your wares and you have the 
audacity to say theyre as good as what the japanese have to 
offer

david and merry roes hair salon the shears 
tower is being clipped by sears roebuck and co which says the 
roes are infringing on the giant retailers trademark 
were just a small shop david roe said friday as he styled 
a customers hair we put a lot of money into building the 
business and a lot of money in the new name new business cards and 
new checks i dont want to go through all that expense again 
but sears says it has a lot at stake too 
weve worked hard to build that name and have it mean 
something company spokesman lewis smith said it doesnt help 
to have any dilution of that name 
the companys legal department has written the roes a letter 
telling them shears tower must find a new name for the store in 
suburban naperville or risk infringing on the companys rights 
roe 30 said he and his wife changed the salons name in 
january when they moved the fiveemployee shop off the suburbs 
main street 
we didnt want to be called main street hair because we were 
no longer on main street roe explained 
after brainstorming unsuccessfully on a new name his younger 
brother dale finally hit on shears tower because at three 
stories the building housing their new salon is the tallest around 
we thought at first it was a joke roe said but then 
our customers said hey we like that 
they came up with a new logo a generic skyline with a pair 
of scissors set in front of it imprinted it on new cards and on 
their checks and opened up shop 
roe said they went to great lengths even consulting lawyers 
to avoid any infringement problems with sears 
we talked to a couple of different attorneys who said its a 
different spelling shears are a tool of your trade so you 
shouldnt have any problem 
but smith said sears isnt satisfied and by law must 
aggressively pursue anyone who attempts to use a name similar to 
sears 
the burden is on the companies to prove they are very 
interested in their trademarks or they lose them the sears 
spokesman said 
should the roes not change the name we will have to 
vigorously pursue it smith said 
roe said he still hopes to retain the name 
its just a big guy picking on a little guy no one thinks 
were associated with sears its almost ridiculous he said

grain and soybean futures prices closed 
moderately to sharply lower friday on the chicago board of trade as 
speculators sold aggressively amid signs that nearterm 
availability of us grains has improved 
the decline erased most of the gains posted thursday 
analysts also cited new private forecasts for several days of 
dry weather in the midwest early next week which would allow 
farmers to get back in their fields and resume planting of corn and 
soybeans sooner than had been expected 
further selling in the futures market was prompted by 
indications that thursdays acrosstheboard rally prompted more 
us farmers to sell oldcrop corn and soybeans said william 
biedermann research director with the commodities brokerage 
allendale inc 
increased soybean shipments from south america to europe also 
weighed on soybean futures he said 
with supplies of corn and soybeans more readily available 
biedermann said commercial grain dealers are willing to buy on a 
handtomouth basis and are not aggresively supporting the market 
at the close wheat futures were 2 cents to 5 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in may at 386 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 4 cents lower with may at 283 a bushel oats were 5 
cents to 6 cents lower with may at 149 a bushel soybeans were 7

slightly above 9 percent at their peak a few weeks ago some

they say the same sluggish economic climate that has allowed for 
a lowering of inflationary expectations and interest rates also has 
raised new questions about prospects for corporate profits

the pan am shuttle was put up for sale friday as 
moneylosing pan am corp tries to raise money for the operation of 
its biggest subsidiary pan american world airways 
pan am has previously indicated it was looking for partners 
after coming off one of the worst years in its 62year history 
the decision puts both air shuttle services carrying passengers 
along the heavily traveled northeast corridor between boston new 
york and washington dc up for sale at the same time 
developer donald trump hired merrill lynch amp co in april to 
negotiate the possible sale of trump shuttle which he acquired a 
year ago for 365 million 
one industry analyst kevin murphy of morgan stanley amp co 
estimated pan am may get 350 million for the pan am shuttle which 
he said controls about 55 percent of the east coast air shuttle 
market 
possible suitors for the pan am shuttle include the airlines 
delta american usair and america west 
in trading on the new york stock exchange pan am closed 
unchanged at 250 a share 
pan am chairman thomas plaskett has repeatedly indicated he 
wants to have pan am world airways become part of a larger route 
network either through merger acquisition or a joint marketing 
agreement 
in a filing friday with the securities and exchange commission 
pan am said it had determined to pursue the possible sale of or 
other commercial transaction involving the pan am shuttle 
it said the transaction is being contemplated in order to 
provide additional liquidity to support the operations of pan am 
world airways 
the statement noted that this potential sale would be in 
addition to the companys previouslydisclosed plans to sell its 
service within west germany 
company spokeswoman pamela hanlon said the pan am board would 
produce additional capital that can be reinvested in pan am world 
airways among the companys goals has been to expand its 
operations in miami where traffic bound for points south of the 
united states can counter seasonal declines in travel to europe and 
to attract more business travelers 
the parent company has lost about 1 billion over the past 
decade has not made an annual profit since 1980 and lost 336 
million in 1989 alone 
that loss included 4371 million loss at pan am world airways 
last year 
the pan am shuttle has been profitable since shortly after pan 
am started it in october 1986 as a competitor to the 
longestablished eastern shuttle company spokeswoman hanlon said 
pan am does not disclose financial results for the shuttle 
which operates separately from pan am world airways 
ms hanlon noted however that pan am world airways accounted 
for 33 billion of the companys 36 billion in revenue in 1989 
the remainder of the revenue came mainly from the shuttle and 
pan am express which operates a regional system serving 32 cities 
that feeds traffic into pan ams hub cities 
pan am world airways serves 99 cities overall including 31 in 
the united states and carried 15 million passengers last year ms 
hanlon said about 4 million people a year travel the two shuttles 
on the bostonnew yorkwashington route 
the pan am shuttle operates at least 16 roundtrip flights a day 
between new york and boston and another 16 roundtrips between new 
york and washington 
the service is popular particularly with business travelers who 
are guaranteed a seat without making a reservation when a plane is 
full the shuttle rolls out another plane to accommodate other 
travelers 
pan am started the shuttle after buying landing and takeoff 
slots and gates from texas air corps new york air service it 
captured about a quarter of the shuttle market in its first month 
of operation and built slowly toward just under 50 percent 
its market share rose dramatically in the wake of a march 1989 
strike against eastern airlines but the trump shuttle has whittled 
away at pan ams big lead in recent months

interco inc is trying to come up with two 
alternatives to extricate itself from its financial woes but 
analysts said friday neither option is likely to win much support 
from shareholders or the companys debtors 
interco said thursday it would ask shareholders to approve a 
prepackaged bankruptcy reorganization plan that could be put into 
effect if the company cannot win shareholder approval of a debt 
restructuring 
the st louisbased company which is saddled with a heavy debt 
load after a 28 billion recapitalization has been trying to 
restructure its indebtedness outside of bankruptcy court 
but analysts said the restructuring has little chance of being 
accepted 
this is part of the negotiating drill said king 
bartholomew an analyst with painewebber inc in new york it has 
a low probability of being successful 
said juli niemann an analyst for stifel nicolaus amp co in st 
louis at this point id be surprised if bondholders will be part 
of the getalong gang 
i think going to be very confrontational she said 
interco said that if neither the restructuring nor the chapter 
11 plan is approved it might be forced to file for bankruptcy 
court protection from its creditors without an approved plan 
the outcome of such a filing according to documents filed with 
the securities and exchange commission would be uncertain interco 
said common stockholders could stand to lose their investment if 
the company goes into bankruptcy without a prepackaged plan 
interco ran into trouble after it recapitalized to fend off a 
hostile takeover attempt in 1988 the company borrowed money to pay 
shareholders cash dividends totaling 142 billion a package of 
junk bonds and preferred stock and stock in a stub company 
the company sold off some of its divisions including its ethan 
allen furniture business and londontown rainwear manufacturer but 
it has been unable to sell all the assets it needed at high enough 
prices to help fund the recapitalization 
the surviving company consists of florsheim shoe co converse 
inc broyhill furniture co and lane co 
interco said the restructuring it is now proposing will allow 
management to concentrate on its core businesses instead of its 
debt load 
last week bond analysts said they were dissatisfied with the 
proposed plan viewing it as the companys opening offer in order 
for interco to proceed with the plan it must win the approval of 
90 percent of the holders of each class of common and preferred 
stock and each class of its bonds 
the prepackaged bankruptcy it is offering as a fallback 
position requires the approval of a simple majority of shareholders 
in each class but that majority must control at least twothirds 
of the stock or bonds in their respective class 
in its proposed restructuring interco is asking holders of its 
debt to convert the majority of their bonds to common stock and 
then to participate in a 10forone reverse stock split 
that split would reduce the equity of common shareholders to 10 
percent of their current holdings

bond prices lost more ground friday in light 
dealings as the federal reserve took steps that signaled to many 
traders that it has no intention of relaxing its monetary policy 
anytime soon 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond fell point or 5 per 
1000 face amount its yield which rises when prices fall rose 
to 869 percent from 864 percent late thursday and 866 percent 
last friday 
the market traded in a narrow range this week in the wake of a 
powerful rally that had knocked longterm treasury yields down from 
more than 9 percent at the beginning of the month 
analysts said fridays decline stemmed from the federal 
reserves second consecutive daily move to arrange shortterm sales 
of treasury securities with the understanding that it would 
repurchase them in a day or so 
that action temporarily drains funds from the banking system 
and puts upward pressure on interest rates 
it was seen as an even stronger indication they werent about 
to ease policy said robert chandross chief economist at lloyds 
bank in new york 
some traders had hoped for an easing of credit policy in view of 
recent reports that have indicated economic growth and inflation 
are moderating 
analysts said fridays decline also reflected some 
disappointment that budget talks between president bush and 
congressional negotiators have failed to yield more results 
it just doesnt seem there is a heck of a lot of progress 
being made said william v sullivan jr who follows the credit 
markets for dean witter reynolds inc 
failure to reach an agreement could mean that the government 
would be forced to borrow more than expected flooding the market 
with more securities and possibly driving the general level of 
interest rates higher 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments lost 532 point intermediate maturities dropped 
point and longterm issues fell as much as 916 point according to 
telerate inc the financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 274 to 114497 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds fell 316 point to 91 132 the average 
yield to maturity rose to 756 percent from 755 percent late 
thursday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 799 percent as the 
discount rose 6 basis points to 774 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 814 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points to 
773 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 827 percent as the 
discount rose 5 basis points to 770 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 316 percent unchanged 
from late thursday

a majority of large banks surveyed in may 
reported they had tightened their standards for loans to small and 
mediumsized businesses in the first four months of this year the 
federal reserve said friday 
more than half of 60 large banks surveyed nationally said they 
had made credit policies more stringent with one in 10 reporting 
they had tightened considerably the regulatory agency said 
rep john lafalce dny chairman of the house small business 
committee said the survey was the first hard evidence backing up 
complaints of a credit crunch from small business owners 
he summoned regulators from the central bank the federal 
deposit insurance corp and the office of the comptroller of the 
currency to a june 6 hearing to start exploring the extent of the 
problem and its ramifications 
regulators had told lafalces panel april 25 they were unable to 
confirm that a lending squeeze had spread beyond the real estate 
industry however business owners particularly from new england 
said longestablished sources of credit were drying up 
the survey indicates that the anecdotal information we were 
given at our hearing has a real basis in fact lafalce said 
as recently as last week after a meeting between the three top 
federal banking regulators and the nations largest bank trade 
association greenspan had said evidence of the credit crunch was 
quite limited 
but seeking to prevent the squeeze from snowballing greenspan 
stressed in private remarks to officials of the american bankers 
association that bankers should continue to make sound loans 
in fridays survey lending officers said the primary reason for 
tightening lending policy was a less favorable economic 
outlook second was a deterioration in the performance of loans 
the bank had made previously pressure from regulators was also 
mentioned frequently 
in addition to tightening standards for which loan applicants 
qualify more than half the banks reported making the terms of 
loans they did make to mediumsized businesses more stringent 
including requiring more collateral 
about 30 percent said they had reduced the size of credit lines 
to middlemarket firms also on balance banks reported a slightly 
wider spread between the interest rate they were charging 
businesses for loans and the banks own cost of funds 
the 60 banks surveyed hold slightly less than a third of 
commercial bankings 29 trillion in assets

chrysler corps new muscle car the dodge 
viper will debut during the 1992 model year at a sticker price of 
under 50000 chairman lee iacocca said friday 
iacocca made the anticipated announcement at a news conference 
that capped a sixcity tour promoting the quality of chrysler 
vehicles 
the viper was both seen and heard at the news conference with 
iacocca introducing it amid an eardeafening roar from its 
400horsepower engine as a model of the car emerged from behind a 
curtain into a spotlight 
the car had been unveiled at a detroit auto show last year but 
fridays announcement was the first official confirmation that it 
would go into production 
iacocca said about 200 of the twoseaters will be produced in 
time for sale late next year while the chairman said the car would 
sell for under 50000 he wouldnt say how much under 
chrysler is counting on the sexy new car to jazz up its flagging 
image and sales 
iacocca said the car powered by a v10 engine originally 
designed for trucks will go from 0 to 60 mph in 39 seconds its 
top speed will be 188 mph 
chrysler officials said they eventually expect to produce about 
5000 vipers a year to be sold at 300 to 500 us dealerships 
iacocca said developing the viper cost chrysler tens and tens 
of millions not hundreds of millions adding it can make money 
for the company at a sales pace of 5000 cars a year 
features on the sleek competitor to chevrolets corvette include 
an integrated roll bar and exhaust pipes built into a cutaway side 
among the team members who came up with the viper concept was 
chrysler consultant carroll shelby the father of the popular 
shelby cobras 
iacocca told reporters at the downtown bonaventure hotel news 
conference that it was shelby who edged him out of getting the 
first cobra produced in the 1960s 
shelby has been offered millions of dollars for that car 
iacocca noted ruefully 
i am not making the same mistake twice he said pointing to 
a red viper on display this one here is mine 
chrysler says the viper is the first vehicle produced by a 
computerdriven conceptual design and rendering system which 
is supposed to cut by 25 percent the time it takes to bring a 
totally new car to market 
the car has been one of the companys worstkept secrets the 
prototype drew huge crowds at last years auto show and word of 
the cars production schedule leaked out earlier this week 
iacocca also hinted friday that he may stick around after his 
contract with the no 3 automaker expires at the end of 1991 hed 
been noncommittal about the issue during chryslers annual meeting 
thursday in universal city 
at the news conference he gestured toward a bank of sporty red 
cars displayed as testimony that not all chrysler products are 
stodgy the viper a new lamborghini diablo a plymouth laser a le 
baron convertible a dodge stealth a dodge shadow convertible 
if this stuff starts to sell i might want to stick around for 
a while he said 
he also said he believed that slipping sales of chrysler cars 
and trucks had bottomed out thanks in part to the recent ad 
campaign which strives to compare chrysler vehicles favorably to 
japanese cars 
even before the official announcement friday pleas for the 
viper were flooding the automaker from 3300 people who wrote 
called or sent money iacocca said 
not everyone who wants one is going to get one unless hes 
willing to stand in line for a while because of the limited 
production he said

federal reserve policymakers concluded at 
their march meeting that excessive inflation would continue and 
decided to maintain high interest rate policies in the face of a 
moderately growing economy according to minutes of the meeting 
released friday 
the minutes were made available amid signs that the 
policymakers who met in secret again tuesday decided at the 
latest meeting to continue the policies at least for the next six 
weeks while they try to determine the economys direction 
the fed has tried for more than two years to stem inflation by 
keeping a tight grip on credit and thus slowing the economy some 
observers fear the tightmoney policies could restrain the economy 
too much and push it into a recession 
but at its march 27 meeting the central banks federal open 
market committee reviewed information that suggested that the 
economy was likely to expand at a somewhat faster pace over the 
next several quarters than in the fourth quarter of 1989 the 
minutes said 
at the same time a staff projection said little improvement 
was anticipated in the underlying trend of inflation and some 
members commented that the prospects for inflation remained the 
most disturbing aspect of the economic outlook 
on balance the minutes said little or no progress in 
reducing inflation appeared to be in prospect for the quarters 
immediately ahead 
as a result most members indicated a preference for an 
unchanged policy although several preferred an immediate move 
toward a tighter stance to achieve price stability the vote for 
maintaining policy was 92 
until several weeks ago many analysts thought the fed might 
tighten credit at its meeting this week however statistics for 
employment industrial production retail sales and inflation all 
pointed to a return to slower growth in april 
in fact some traders thought the central bank had loosened 
credit to stimulate growth when the federal funds rate dropped 
below the feds 825 percent target late wednesday and early 
thursday 
but the fed took steps thursday to push up the rate which is 
what banks charge each other for overnight loans that signaled to 
many market watchers that a relaxation of monetary policy was not 
imminent 
the federal funds rate is the primary lever the fed uses to 
control shortterm interest rates 
edward g boehne president of the federal reserve bank in 
philadelphia and a member of the fomc also told a bankers group 
thursday that fed policy has been unchanged since december 
the federal funds rate has remained at 825 percent since dec 
21 when the central bank permitted it to drop from 850 percent 
that move followed its dec 1819 meeting 
the fomc comprised of the seven fed governors and five of the 
presidents of the 12 fed regional banks meets in secret eight 
times a year to formulate monetary policy and confers by telephone 
as needed minutes of the meeting are released about six weeks 
later

platinum futures prices rocketed above 500 an ounce friday for 
the first time in two months amid supply fears sparked by south 
african racial violence and a reported drop in platinum sales by 
the soviet union 
on other commodity markets other precious metals also rose 
sharply cocoa futures surged to new 14month highs livestock and 
meat futures rose grains and soybeans fell and oil futures were 
mixed 
platinum futures settled 1410 to 1510 higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange with the contract for delivery in july at 507 
a troy ounce the highest settlement of a nearmonth platinum 
contract since march 15 
the rally was underpinned by the threat of supply disruptions 
from south africa the worlds largest platinum producer if racial 
violence there continues several analysts said 
two people died in a fight between black and white workers at a 
south african gold mine wednesday which kicked off a series of 
incidents in the country in which 12 more people were killed 
there is a perception that the middle ground in south africa 
may be getting smaller and smaller creating a situation where 
there is more opportunity for the left and the right to clash 
said william oneill research director for elders futures inc 
bernard savaiko senior metals analyst with painewebber inc 
traced some of the strength to an annual platinum supplyanddemand 
report issued earlier this week by british platinum refiner johnson 
matthey plc 
in the report johnson matthey said sales of physical platinum 
by the soviet union reached a decadehigh 550000 ounces in 1989 
but were expected to decline in 1990 to levels nearer 1988s sales 
of 440000 ounces 
the unusually high level of sales last year suggests the soviets 
dipped into their platinum stockpile and indicates they may not 
have much platinum left savaiko said 
he and oneill said that with this weeks gains the platinum 
market appeared to be on a bullish course but merrill lynch 
analyst david syphen said the rally was merely a correction from an 
oversold condition 
gold futures settled 5 to 560 higher on new yorks commodity 
exchange with june at 37560 a troy ounce silver was 95 cent to 
96 cents higher with may at 5122 a troy ounce 
cocoa futures rose sharply on new yorks coffee sugar and cocoa 
exchange on reports of that soldiers in the ivory coast continued 
to demand better wages and living conditions the ivory coast is 
the worlds biggest cocoa producer 
cocoa settled 28 to 31 higher with july at 1477 per ton the 
highest nearmonth cocoa settlement since march 15 1989 
on the chicago mercantile exchange cattle futures were 
supported by a government report that showed a fewer number of 
cattle placed on feedlots last month than the market had expected 
pork futures were boosted by firm cash markets and bullish chart 
signals 
live cattle futures settled 05 cent to 50 cent higher with 
june at 7432 cents a pound feeder cattle were 35 cent to 77 
cent higher with may at 8552 cents a pound live hogs were 10 
cent to 72 cent higher with june at 6682 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 15 cent lower to 2 cents higher with may at 
6822 cents a pound

federal prosecutors friday began the painstaking 
task of trying to recreate allegedly fraudulent commodities trades 
with tape recordings documents and the testimony of an undercover 
fbi agent 
jurors donned headsets with big yellow foamrubber earpads to 
listen to snippets of tape recordings made by fbi agent randall 
jannett amid the din of the chicago mercantile exchange trading 
floor 
prosecutors contend the tapes document fraudulent trades made by 
the three defendants it is the first trial stemming from an fbi 
sting operation at the worlds two largest commodities exchanges 
jannett testified that he made a 100 profit in a trade made off 
the market or outside the open auction in the trading pit the 
practice is deemed illegal because it deprives the customer of the 
most competitive price 
jannett said he bought swiss franc futures contracts from 
defendant robert d mosky at a price below the market price the 
government contends the two men made the trade between themselves 
rather than in the auction 
defendants mosky danny l scheck and david zatz were indicted 
last year along with 44 other chicago futures traders and a clerk 
on charges of defrauding customers who sent in orders to the floors 
of the merc and the chicago board of trade sixteen have pleaded 
guilty 
the tapes which also were played over loudspeakers in the 
courtroom were noisy and the most clearly audible words were 
shouted numbers in one tape two voices were conversing but the 
conversation was difficult to make out 
you have to get an ear for it assistant us attorney james 
fleissner told a reporter during a recess in the trial which began 
may 8 
jurors were given transcripts of the taped conversations but 
us district judge ann c williams repeatedly reminded them that 
the tapes not the transcripts were the evidence 
youre to rely on what the tape says and not the transcript 
she said 
on the witness stand was jannett who posed as a corrupt trader 
at the merc from february through december 1988 
during questioning by fleissner jannett described a trade in 
which he said mosky sold him nine swiss franc futures contracts 
below the market price 
one contract represents 125000 francs the price of the 
contract changes in units or ticks of 01 cent per franc 
jannett testified that the market price for swiss franc 
contracts was 7162 cents per franc but that mosky said to him 
sold you nine at one meaning 7161 cents 
jannett said he had not agreed to buy the nine contracts 
jannett testified that he then sold eight contracts at the 
market price of 7162 cents to another trader 
how did that leave you fleissner asked 
i had made eight ticks or 100 jannett said 
jannett then testified that mosky said to him good things 
happen to those who help out 
attorneys for the three defendants have argued that their 
clients did nothing wrong and that jannett was so befuddled in the 
melee of the trading pit that he mistook legitimate 
tradeconfirmation conversations for attempts to defraud customers 
mosky scheck and zatz face more than a dozen counts each of 
mail or wire fraud and violations of the commodity exchange act 
mosky also is charged with racketeering conspiracy for which he 
could be sent to prison for 20 years and be forced to forfeit 
personal assets including exchange membership

southwest savings association the thirdlargest 
thrift in texas and one of the institutions created by the 
controversial federal southwest plan was taken over by government 
regulators friday 
the 55 billion asset thrift owned by the caroline hunt trust 
estate is the first of the southwest plan institutions to fail 
the thrift was created by regulators from four insolvent thrifts on 
may 18 1988 
the estate of caroline hunt daughter of the late wildcat oilman 
hl hunt contributed 25 million in equity to the new savings and 
loan in return for 2 billion in notes yield maintenance and 
capital coverage 
the office of thrift supervision placed the dallasbased 
institution under control of the resolution trust corp the 
agencies were created last year to clean up the faltering thrift 
industry 
the ots said southwest savings was operating in an unsafe and 
unsound condition and had incurred losses that depleted 
substantially all of its capital with no prospect of replenishment 
without federal assistance 
m danny wall the former head of the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp who advocated the southwest plan said southwest 
savings failure was not an indication of problems in the 14 other 
southwest plan deals 
this is an exception from the standpoint of the deals that 
were done wall said by telephone from his home near washington 
dc it was early in the process and as more time went on there 
and elsewhere we discovered the problems were greater in 
institutions in texas and elsewhere than we thought 
clearly our view at the time we made the decision was that 
there were deep pockets at the parent and the deep pockets would 
protect their investment wall said they apparently have 
chosen not to 
the hunt estates office was closed and no one could be reach 
for comment friday night 
the observation needs to be made that southwest savings itself 
needed help fairly soon after the deal was made said wall who 
was forced out as head of the ots in part because of congressional 
displeasure with the southwest plan deals 
under the southwest plan regulators led by wall sought to bail 
out failing institutions by bringing in new investors and promising 
future assistance in return for the investment the deals were 
defended as the best solution at the time because of the insolvency 
of the insurance fund 
the deals have been attacked as too costly with the general 
accounting office suggesting it would have been cheaper to shut 
down a third of the institutions and pay off depositors 
separately the resolution trust corp said friday it was 
spending an estimated 188 million in federal assistance to aid the 
sale of the insolvent broadview federal savings bank in cleveland 
ohio to first federal savings bank in cleveland 
first federal will assume responsibility for all of broadviews 
108000 deposit accounts and other liabilities totaling about 14 
billion first federal paid a premium of 1195 million for the 
deposits and agreed to purchase 930 million of the failed 
institutions assets with the right to return any to the 
government within three months 
the rtc is injecting 483 million into broadview but it hopes 
to recover a substantial portion of that by retaining and selling 
about 421 million of the closed institutions assets 
in boston the federal deposit insurance corp said it closed 
merchantsbank and transferred its 340 million in deposits to the 
first national bank of boston the principal subsidiary of bank of 
boston 
it was the first bank failure in massachusetts 
an fdic statement said its board of directors declared 
merchantsbank insolvent and placed it under fdic receivership 
because no acceptable purchase and assumption bids were received 
for the ailing cooperative bank 
deposits in the failed bank will become deposits in bank of 
boston which will reopen all eight merchantsbank branch offices 
monday 
also friday the ots placed first savings and loan association 
of borger texas in conservatorship and sold houstons cornerstone 
federal savings association to great southwest savings also in 
houston

securities and exchange commission chairman 
richard breeden renewed his turf war friday with the commodity 
futures trading commission saying the sec should be given power to 
regulate stock index futures 
speculators who believe strongly that the stock market as a 
whole is going to rise or fall can bet on the movement of standard 
amp poors index of 500 stocks without worrying about picking 
individual stocks 
even though the index comprises stocks the cftc regulates the 
sale of futures contracts based on the index as it does futures in 
commodities such as soybeans or pork bellies in a speech friday to 
the los angeles world affairs council breeden said theres no 
reason for that 
while stocks must be purchased with no more than 50 percent 
borrowed funds margin requirements mean stock index futures can be 
purchased with 97 percent borrowed money far too much breeden 
said 
beyond that us brokerages who want to offer stocks bonds and 
stock index futures must pay to maintain two separate regulatory 
agencies and their separate sets of rules he said 
nomura and daiwa do not have to do that in tokyo morgan 
grenfell and sg warburg dont have to do it in london thus we 
alone suffer from a fragmented system that reduces effectiveness 
and raises costs just the opposite of what should occur 
breeden said 
meeting with reporters here thursday breeden said the 
settlement under which michael milken will provide information to 
the sec after he is sentenced will help the secs investigations of 
irvinebased lincoln savings and miamibased centrust bank 
both thrifts were heavy investors in the junk bonds milken 
pioneered and their failures will cost taxpayers billions of 
dollars 
breeden said he expects more indictments in the insider trading 
probe that has led to the convictions of milken ivan boesky and 
dennis levine 
we think the milken settlement was a good one he said 
in his speech friday breeden renewed calls for more cooperation 
between securities regulators in countries around the world and 
for the dismantling of the checkerboard of different regulations in 
the 50 us states 
with european economic barriers coming down in 1992 it is 
conceivable that it may someday be easier for someone to sell a 
stock issue in every country in europe than in every us state he 
said 
breeden also called for legislation to reduce the amount of 
federally insured deposits 
breeden who advised president bush on the savings and loan 
bailout legislation last year before becoming head of the sec said 
the bailouts requirements that thrifts put more of their own cash 
at risk was a serious step in returning sanity to our regulation 
of depository institutions 
however he said we need to follow this legislation with a 
plan to significantly reduce the aggregate volume of federally 
insured deposits as deposit insurance provided the fuel for the 
fire in the thrift disaster and could do so again
