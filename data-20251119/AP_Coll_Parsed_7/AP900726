a laboratory accused of mishandling blood 
samples taken from exxon valdez skipper joseph hazelwood issued a 
statement thursday attempting to explain what happened 
lawyers for hazelwood said the statement left too many questions 
unanswered they continued to assert that the blood testing for 
alcohol was botched and followed by a coverup which denied 
hazelwood his right to a fair trial earlier this year in alaska in 
the nations worst oil spill 
compuchem the north carolina parent company of chemwest a 
sacramento laboratory that received hazelwoods blood acknowledged 
that three glass tubes containing his blood were mislabeled by a 
lab technician 
that took place when the tubes were received four days after the 
exxon valdez struck a reef in alaskas prince william sound in 
march 1989 spilling 11 million gallons of crude in the nations 
worst oil spill 
the labs finding that hazelwoods blood had a 06 alcohol 
content was the cornerstone of his prosecution on criminal charges 
though a jury acquitted him of being intoxicated the image of 
the drunken skipper hung over the proceeding 
hazelwoods lawyers contend discrepancies in descriptions of the 
tubes in which the blood for hazelwoods blood was shipped to 
california for the alcohol test suggest the lab results could be 
for the wrong person 
coast guard technician scott m conner who drew hazelwoods 
blood 10 hours after the exxon valdez grounding testified in the 
alaska trial and before the national transportation safety board 
that he placed hazelwoods blood in three 15milliliter tubes two 
had gray stoppers and one had a red stopper he said 
chemwests first inventory sheet showed it had received 
hazelwoods blood in three 10 milliliter red stoppered tubes on 
march 28 1989 
the colored stoppers are used to differentiate the contents of 
the blood tubes 
graytopped blood tubes contain a chemical added to prevent 
blood alcohol from fermenting and thus reaching a reaching a higher 
level red tubes are used for drug testing and are considered 
unreliable for alcohol because they are untreated 
on thursday compuchems statement said adhesive evidence tape 
obscured a technicians view of the blood tube stoppers 
while the color of the vial stoppers was initially 
misidentified because the stoppers were covered by adhesive 
evidence tape this was subsequently discovered and properly 
corrected said the lab statement 
but on may 1 1989 the inventory sheet appears to have been 
changed the number 3 is crossed out and a 1 is substituted for the 
number of red tubes a handwritten line adds that two 
graystoppered tubes were received the size of the tubes is still 
logged at 10 milliliters 
hazelwoods lawyers were outrage at the labs explanation about 
the tape 
blood was taken from all of the crew members that day said 
attorney thomas russo if there were security seals on his tubes 
they should have been on all of the tubes how come they got the 
others right 
identifications on samples of all other crew members conformed 
with conners testimony he said 
why did she say the stoppers were red if she couldnt see 
them did she just make that up russo asked referring to 
technician karen s metcalf who signed the documents 
he noted that even after the corrections the sizes of the 
tubes were still wrong 
compuchem vice president paul brunswick whose name appeared on 
the statement was unavailable for comment late thursday a call to 
his north carolina office after business hours was unanswered 
there was nothing that occurred during the chemwest handling 
andor testing of the hazelwood samples that invalidates the chain 
of custody or the laboratory testing results said the statement 
hazelwoods lawyers complained that the blood documents were 
withheld from them until four months after his trial was over 
though they had repeatedly asked to see everything relevant to the 
blood tests 
the lab said the documentation went to authorized officials 
and to the national transportation safety board when the trial 
began in february 
there are strict legal limitations regarding the release of 
such information to others it added these precautions are 
necessary to protect individual rights and confidentiality 
hazelwood lawyer michael chalos had a different interpretation 
of the withholding of documents 
what they did was deprive capt hazelwood of his rights 
chalos said 
he alleged that the ntsb the coast guard and the state of 
alaska also may have had the documents and withheld them 
chemwest handled the receipt testing and reporting of the 
hazelwood samples correctly and totally in compliance with 
established forensic drug testing procedures said the statement 
issued for compuchem by a new york public relations firm 
the ntsb is scheduled to issue its final report on the exxon 
valdez disaster next tuesday russo and chalos have said the newly 
discovered documents should be taken into account if the board is 
planning to say whether hazelwood was intoxicated 
a coast guard administrative law judge suspended hazelwoods 
captains license for nine months in a plea bargain announced 
wednesday the coast guard dropped two charges including one that 
he was intoxicated and hazelwood pleaded no contest to two other 
charges including one that he drank alcohol within four hours of 
sailing

animal rights activists kept watch 
wednesday as about 150 wild ponies made the 65th annual chicoteague 
island pony swim 
a crowd of about 40000 people including the activists saw the 
ponies complete a 10 to 15 minute swim across the quartermilewide 
channel to this barrier island from assateague 
bonnie scribner of voice for animals a charlottesvillebased 
group said after the watching the swim that she had seen nothing 
amiss 
but the swim is just part of it she said we dont 
approve of the sale of foals under four months of age 
she said last year there was no veterinarian available and two 
ponies died her organization came to make sure a veterinarian was 
present there were two on duty and ms scribner said she was 
delighted 
the animals are thought to be the descendants of ponies who 
washed ashore during colonial times from shipwrecks the ponies 
gained fame from marguerite henrys childrens classic misty of 
chincoteague first published in 1947 
activists had said they wanted to monitor the 65th roundup 
penning and auction of the wild horses by the communitys volunteer 
fire department 
gail eisnitz of the humane society of the united states said the 
event is real stressful for the horses and ponies we feel it is 
animal exploitation for human entertainment and for big bucks 
some of the foals will be sold at auction thursday by the fire 
department to control the herd size last year the department made 
40000 on the sale of 77 foals 
ed moran president of the chincoteague volunteer fire 
department said all the money raised including that from a 25 
video of the swim goes back into the community he said it 
pays for maintaining the departments three fire trucks and four 
ambulances 
about 20 to 25 people wilted in the midday heat and were taken 
by ambulance for treatment at the island medical center then 
released said ambulance chairman ollie reed 
the humane society of the united states has been monitoring the 
annual event for 20 years 
ms eisnitz said conditions for the animals have improved but 
in the last two years six animals have died 
as a result of those deaths the chincoteague national wildlife 
refuge on assateague threatened to revoke the fire departments 
permit to graze the animals on the refuge if the department did not 
provide a veterinarian for the swim penning and auction

a man accused of hijacking two city buses from 
depots early wednesday told detectives he wanted to work for the 
transit authority police sources said 
the first bus was grabbed in manhattan and driven 25 miles 
across the borough of queens but it wasnt until the second bus 
was spotted zooming out of the queens depot at 445 am that the 
double theft was discovered 
a sharpeyed transit manager later spotted the second bus coming 
off the triborough bridge in manhattan recognized that it was in 
the wrong borough and started a chase that resulted in the 
suspects capture 
darius mccollum 25 of queens was charged with grand larceny 
after his arrest at grand central station at about 6 am said 
police spokesman officer scott block 
police sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
mccollum told detectives he stole the buses because the transit 
authority wouldnt hire him 
investigators were checking transit authority records to see 
whether mccollum had applied for a job or taken a test to become a 
bus driver 
detectives were also trying to verify mccollums boasts that he 
had commandeered a subway train about 10 years ago as a teenager 
twentyfive city buses have been stolen in the last 12 months 
according to transit authority statistics unfortunately its 
going up we are seeing a trend said transit authority 
spokeswoman caren gardner 
mccollum is considered a suspect in other bus thefts said 
transit police spokesman al oleary 
what someone wants to do with a transit authority bus i cant 
begin to tell you ms gardner said the bright blue and silver 
buses which are 40 feet long by nine feet wide are kind of 
recognizable and not usually taken for joyrides 
the manager who spotted the bus at 530 am waved down a police 
car and officers gave chase 
the driver jumped from the moving bus in front of grand central 
and the bus rolled into a parked new york telephone truck causing 
no damage to either vehicle ms gardner said 
mccollum was arrested inside grand central

americans say pete rose deserves a place in two 
venerable institutions the federal prison system and the baseball 
hall of fame 
eightyone percent in a national associated press poll said it 
was right for rose baseballs alltime hit leader to be sentenced 
to federal prison last week he got a fivemonth term last week for 
cheating on his taxes 
at the same time a majority said rose should be allowed to work 
in baseball again even though he was banished from the sport for 
gambling last year and twothirds said he deserved election to the 
hall of fame

reinstatement to baseball and 63 percent said he should get it at 
some point 
rose becomes eligible in december 1991 for election by sports 
writers to the hall of fame with 4256 hits in a 24year career 
he was virtually assured of the honor before he ran afoul of the 
baseball commissioner and the law his chances now are less certain 
the poll did not specify an election date for rose asking only 
if he should be named to the hall of fame at some point 
baseball fans were a bit more likely than nonfans to favor him for 
the hall 71 to 63 percent and men were more supportive than 
women 74 to 62 percent 
women also were slightly more likely than men to say rose had 
damaged baseballs image 43 to 36 percent but men were a bit 
harder on rose in other areas they were more likely than women to 
say he deserved jail time 8578 percent and while 67 percent of 
women said rose should be allowed back into baseball at some point 
that fell to 59 percent of men 
in most cases opinion was roughly the same among respondents 
who called themselves baseball fans as among nonfans fiftyfour 
percent said they were fans 61 percent of the men and 48 percent 
of the women

israel has ordered its stateowned el al 
airline to halt its twiceweekly flights to stockholm in response 
to changes in swedens airport security arrangements 
the new security procedures made by the government of sweden 
do not answer the security requirements of the government of 
israel yehiel amitai spokesman for the ministry of 
transportation said wednesday 
he would not say what changes had been made but said his 
ministry could not allow the continuation of el al flights that 
were not adequately guarded amitai said the decision would be 
reversed if sweden returned to the previous security arrangements 
the transportation ministry citing the principle of mutuality 
also banned all charter flights originating in sweden from landing 
in israel the scandinavian carrier sas does not operate regular 
flights from stockholm to israel 
el al has canceled its flights in the past over security 
arrangements usually it involves the presence of israeli security 
people who want direct responsibility for the safety of the 
aircraft and passengers something not every country is willing to 
allow 
el al flights are considered prime targets for palestinian 
guerrillas and security is very stringent 
in december 1985 guerrillas of the radical abu nidal 
organization launched attacks against the el al counters in the 
rome and vienna airports killing 16 people

an american animal rights activist posted a 
petition in st peters square calling on pope john paul ii to 
declare that animals have immortal souls and sought a meeting with 
the pontiff 
but security guards quickly took down the statement on wednesday 
and shooed away the activist john stockwell of berkeley calif 
and several of his followers and a private audience was not 
granted 
stockwell a 55yearold geologist and school teacher compared 
his initiative to that of martin luther the protestant reformation 
leader who posted his historic 95 theses on the door of a castle 
church in wittenberg germany in 1517 
what were seeking is the beginning of a humane and ecological 
reformation stockwell said 
he said he had hoped for a meeting with the pope but was not 
granted one stockwell and several followers attended the popes 
general audience wednesday morning but they were given seats far 
from the pontiff 
later the group gathered in st peters square and stockwell 
taped a sheet of paper containing his 10 theses to the base of 
a marble column near the entrance to the basilica 
after photographers snapped pictures vatican guards moved in 
removed the petition and asked the group to leave the area 
stockwell applauded a recent statement by the pope that gods 
breath also touched animals but said he wanted john paul to go 
further 
his petition declares that all animal species have immortal 
souls it also calls for a ban on hunting fishing medical and 
scientific research on animals and all forms of abuse and cruelty 
in an address to scientists in 1982 the pope said it is 
certain that animals are at the service of man and can hence be the 
object of experimentation nevertheless they must be treated as 
creatures of god which are destined to serve mans good but not to 
be abused by him

an israeli arab poet has pleaded innocent to 
charges he incited antiisraeli violence with his writings 
at the opening day of his trial wednesday shafik habib a 
49yearold accountant from nazareth acknowledged he had written 
the book of poetry on which the charges are based 
but he denied that his political poetry constituted 
incitement 
habib was jailed and then held under house arrest for several 
weeks in june after police charged that his poems could incite 
violence the military censor banned further publication of the 
poems 
the action was taken under an antiterror statute that dates 
back to the days of british control 
the arrest ignited protests by arab legislators and arab 
writers unions they said they feared the move could signal a 
government crackdown on writers and other artists 
the court in this northern port city was told wednesday that 
habibs poetry urged violence against jews and supported the 
31month palestinian uprising against israeli occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip 
the charges say habibs poetry encourages readers to fight back 
with stones molotov cocktails and explosives 
judge rahamin tsemah agreed to delay further proceedings until 
sept 30 after habib complained that the translation of his book 
from arabic to hebrew was not precise

at the presidential palace late wednesday less than three days 
before presidentelect alberto fujimori is to take office police 
said damage to the palace in downtown lima was minor 
the attack took place just after outgoing president alan garcia 
met with a group of judges to sign a law reforming perus 
judiciary police and witnesses said 
one grenade exploded against the rear wall of the building and 
the other exploded on the roof 
the grenades were launched by two men from next to a small car 
parked 100 yards from the palaces rear entry the men then fled in 
the car police said 
afterwards in comments to reporters garcia discounted the 
importance of the attack 
all they prove with their pistols and bombs is that theyre 
psychologically inferior they have to resort to violence because 
they cannot convince people through politics he said 
police set up roadblocks throughout downtown lima and detained 
hundreds of people they said they were unsure which of perus two 
rebel groups staged the attack the maoist shining path or the 
procuban tupac amaru 
in other attacks late wednesday shining path rebels burned a 
cityowned bus in a poor lima neighborhood in another poor area of

here is the text of the letter written by 
david h souter on behalf of the judges of the new hampshire 
superior court on may 13 1981 to roma h spaulding chairwoman of 
the health and welfare committee of the new hampshire house 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dear madame chairman 
i am writing as a member of the committee to speak for the 
superior court on proposed legislation that would affect the court 
the full court met on may 7 and directed me to write to you to 
express the courts position on sb 194 which you have scheduled 
for hearing on may 13 
the judges do not believe it is appropriate for the court to 
take a position on the basic question addressed by the bill 
whether parental consent should be required before an abortion may 
be performed upon an unmarried minor the courts concern is 
directed rather to that provision of the bill that would require 
a justice of the superior court to authorize the performance of an 
abortion upon such a minor when there is no parental consent if 
the justice determines that the performance of an abortion would 
be in the best interests of a minor who is not mature 
the members of the court find two fundamental problems inherent 
in this provision first it would express a decision by society 
speaking through the legislature to leave it to individual 
justices of this court to make fundamental moral decisions about 
the interests of other people without any standards to guide the 
individual judge judges are professionally qualified to apply 
rules and stated norms but the provision in question would enact 
no rule to be applied and would express no norm in place of a rule 
or a norm there would be left only the individual judges 
principles and predilections as carefully considered as these 
might be they would still be those of only one individual not 
those of society much criticism of the role of the judiciary in 
this country has characterized judicial activity in the application 
of constitutional standards as no more than the imposition of 
individual judges views in the guise of applying constitutional 
norms of great generality the provision that i have quoted from 
the present bill would force the superior court to engage in just 
such acts of unfettered personal choice 
the courts second concern is with the necessarily moral 
character of such choice and the resulting disparity of responses 
to requests that judicial discretion be exercised as you would 
expect there are some judges who believe abortion under the 
circumstances contemplated by the bill is morally wrong who could 
not in conscience issue an order requiring an abortion to be 
performed there are others who believe that what may be thought to 
be in the best interests of the pregnant minor is itself just 
as necessarily a moral as a social question upon which a judge may 
not morally speak for another human being whatever may be that 
judges own personal opinion about the morality of abortion judges 
in each category would be obligated to indicate that they could not 
exercise their power in favor of authorizing abortions to be 
performed on immature pregnant minors the inevitable result would 
be required shopping for judges who would entertain such cases in 
other words a principled and consistent application of the quoted 
provision would be impossible 
for these reasons i have been directed to request on behalf of 
the court that any bill you may pass on this subject not authorize 
the exercise of judicial choice by justices of the superior court 
to determine whether an abortion should be performed upon a 
pregnant immature minor whose parents do not consent to that 
course of action 
yours respectfully 
david h souter justice 
new hampshire superior court

reps ronald machtley and james mcclure clarke 
have a message for the budget negotiators who are thinking of 
cutting social security and medicare 
dont 
thats the poison pill for any solution said machtley 
rri 
social security would be awful said clarke dnc 
medicare should be only a last resort 
machtley and clarke both represent districts with large numbers 
of retired people and both expect tight reelection races this fall 
but their reluctance to slash social security and medicare is 
shared by most members of congress thats why budget bargainers 
who are likely to cut programs that help the elderly are exploring 
those reductions with all the trepidation of kids tiptoeing into an 
isolated dark cave 
f16s fighter planes dont vote senior citizens do said 
house majority whip william gray dpa referring to the 
democratic preference to cut deeply into the defense budget 
thats a political reality of an election year 
negotiators from the white house and congress have been trying 
for 11 weeks to reduce the federal budget deficit by increasing 
taxes and trimming programs white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said wednesday that the two sides had agreed to present specific 
proposals as early as weeks end 
the talks are being watched closely by senior citizens 
organizations those groups have warned the negotiators to leave 
social security alone and go after medicare only as part of a 
package in which all groups not just the elderly bear some pain 
it would be very tough to argue to the people affected by 
these cuts that its a fair sacrifice for them if they look around 
and see other people not suffering with the same intensity said 
lobbyist john rother of the 32millionmember american association 
of retired persons 
members of both parties involved in the budget talks say it now 
appears unlikely that social security benefits will be cut 
social security has been described as the third rail of 
american politics if you touch it you die said rep bill 
frenzel rminn a negotiator who favors restraining the programs 
growth 
but the bush administration supports some cuts in the program 
which helps support 39 million elderly and disabled people and 
their dependents and the issue isnt completely off the 
bargaining table 
medicare which provides health coverage for 33 million elderly 
and disabled americans appears targeted for at least 3 billion in 
reduced payments to doctors and hospitals 
the reason social security and medicare are vulnerable boils 
down to arithmetic 
budget negotiators are trying to reduce next years projected 
169 billion deficit by at least 50 billion thats a lot of 
money even for a 12 trillion budget so the bargainers are 
looking for big targets 
theyve found them in social security and medicare social 
security is the biggest federal benefit program and will cost 245 
billion this year medicare will have a 97 billion price tag 
together they account for more than one dollar of every four 
the government will spend in 1990 
as the countrys population ages and medical costs soar 
these programs are expected to grow even more the nonpartisan 
congressional budget office projects that by 1995 social security 
will cost 338 billion and medicare will cost 183 billion 
they can at least arguably stand a reduction said frenzel 
who is retiring from congress 
these programs are even more vulnerable because by some 
measures the nations elderly are a relatively welloff group 
advocates for the elderly dispute those measures contending that 
large numbers of senior citizens live below the poverty line 
thats the wrong group of people being asked to sacrifice 
said aarps rother 
senior citizens groups are already gearing up for a fight 
sending letters and serving notice to lawmakers that millions of 
voters know what is going on their campaign is aimed at a congress 
that vividly recalls the democrats 1986 recapture of the senate 
which many credit to the republicans willingness to cut social 
security 
this can be political dynamite said sen don nickles of 
oklahoma who heads the senate gops election committee

its an argument among statisticians 
economists and intelligence analysts matching eyeglazing formulas 
and rival numbers that measure the magnitude of soviet military 
spending with a very big price tag behind the debate 
central intelligence agency estimates of the soviet economy its 
performance and the share moscow was spending on the military have 
been a factor in us defense planning and budgeting for the past 
40 years 
now the cia numbers are being challenged 
a democratic senator says soviet economic strength has been 
vastly overestimated for years prompting an american military 
buildup that helped run the united states deep into debt 
a top economic adviser to president bush said he thinks the 
soviet gross national product last year was substantially lower 
than the cia estimated 
soviet economists free to speak after decades of cold war 
silence on such topics say their nations economic performance was 
far weaker than the cia judged it to be 
and an analyst at the defense intelligence agency said at a 
senate hearing that the cia clearly understates the share of 
the soviet economy devoted to military expenditures 
william t lee a longtime cia critic said that agencys 
methods are flawed and likely to be as unreliable and 
misleading in the future as in the past 
but the cia insists that essentially it has been correct 
i think we have done a very good job on a very complex 
issue george kolt cia director of soviet analysis said last 
week at the senate foreign relations committee hearing but that 
does not mean that our numbers are totally accurate they are 
estimates that are most likely on the high side 
the current cia estimate is that the soviet gross national 
product amounts to 51 percent of that in the united states which 
had a 1989 gnp of 42 trillion 
michael j boskin chairman of bushs council of economic 
advisers said he thinks the soviet gnp is about onethird that of 
the united states 
at a conference sponsored by the american enterprise institute 
in april soviet economists and statisticians offered even lower 
estimates one soviet official victor belkin said his nations 
gnp could be as low as 14 percent of that in the united states and 
no higher than 28 percent 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny says the cia estimates of 
soviet economic strength and military capabilities in the mid1970s 
led to the massive defense buildup that began when jimmy carter was 
president and accelerated under ronald reagan 
moynihan said the senate committee should look further into the 
consequences of government statistics about the soviet union 
would we have spent as much on our military during the 1980s 
if we had believed that the soviet defense burden simply was not 
sustainable he asked i think not and if i am correct then 
this issue has been a momentous one for the state of the american 
economy 
moynihan said that just as the united states was launching its 
military buildup soviet economists were predicting disaster for 
their economy 
the cias kolt said that while the agency considers its estimate 
of the defense burden generally accurate the threat to the united 
states isnt represented by that number anyhow but by soviet 
weapons and forces 
and those are easier to count than economic statistics 
defense spending accounts for about 6 percent of the us gross 
national product kolt said the cia had estimated that 15 to 17 
percent of the soviet gross national product has been going into 
military spending although that has declined since last year 
defense secretary dick cheney said he thinks it is running at 
about 25 percent but doubts it will stay that high 
soviet military spending will decline as a matter of policy 
and because it cant be sustained he said i think they 
are in a depression 
nevertheless cheney said the soviet military is maintaining 
and modernizing its strategic forces thats what makes them a 
superpower and they wont give that up he said

a trade spat between two big southeast asia 
rice producers is helping dampen export prospects for us rice 
farmers 
but an agriculture department report says tight supplies are 
likely to keep us prices firm in the coming year at least 
above sagging world prices 
over the last year world prices have weakened in response to 
increased competition in world markets especially between thailand 
and vietnam and a drop in world trade the report said wednesday 
the export competition is expected to heat up further in the 
199091 rice marketing year that begins aug 1 
currently the report said vietnam has cut into thailands 
markets by selling at prices substantially below those offered 
by thai exporters thailand is the worlds largest rice exporter 
recently thailand announced an export subsidy scheme in an 
effort to increase exports but the response has been weak the 
report said 
meanwhile thailands market share dropped from 40 percent in 
1989 to 31 percent forecast for 1990 
it is expected that thailand will aggressively compete with 
vietnam to regain market share in 1991 the report said 
the us global market share is forecast to fall to about 18 
percent in 1991 from 20 percent the past two years usda analysts 
said tight supplies and relatively high prices may hinder us 
competitiveness in some foreign markets 
analysts said us rice production this year may be about 158 
million hundredweight up only 23 percent from the 1989 harvest 
based on acreage and yieldtrend projections the first official 
rice estimate will be included in usdas aug 9 crop report 
however conditions to date indicate that yields may not match 
last years record the report said rain and wet field 
conditions this spring delayed planting in the mississippi delta 
which could reduce yield potential 
currently based on the latest projections the us rice 
stockpile going into the new marketing year on aug 1 is expected 
to be 238 million hundredweight down from 267 million a year ago 
and 314 million two years ago 
if production and total use turns out as projected the rice 
stockpile a year from now could be about unchanged from the current 
level the report said

a report to congress says the agriculture 
department should review more closely a proposal to remove import 
inspections on canadian meat and poultry entering the united states 
the proposal was announced by usda last month with july 30 set 
as a deadline for public comments if adopted the experimental 
plan would be in effect for one year 
officials of the departments food safety and inspection service 
said canadian products would still be thoroughly inspected at 
slaughter and processing plants under a system that is nearly 
identical to the us system and standards 
but reinspection of random samples at border points would be 
eliminated under the proposal a reciprocal nod would be given us 
products entering canada 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress said in a recent report that the departments inspection 
agency has not documented how it arrived at the determination that 
canadas system is virtually identical to that of the united states 
further the gao said unexplained 1989 rejection rates for 
canadian meat inspected randomly at border points are cause for 
concern 
according to the report usda inspectors rejected about 3 
percent of the selected products compared with 1 percent in 1988 
without an adequate explanation the rates could be 
interpreted as indicating a decline during 1989 in the 
effectiveness of the canadian inspection system the report said 
assistant agriculture secretary jo ann smith told a senate 
hearing on july 12 that the meat proposal is a spinoff from the 
uscanada free trade agreement that went into effect jan 1 
1989 the goal she reminded lawmakers is to promote economic 
growth in both countries 
smith said some us producers and manufacturers are worried 
that canada will intrude on the american market 
but as with any trade agreement its a twoway street she 
said we will see canadian products move to the united states 
just as we will increasingly market and sell us products to 
canadian consumers 
the industrys american meat institute told the same senate 
panel that the openborder proposal deserves a fair chance to 
work 
michael j copps the trade associations senior vice president 
for legislative affairs said the oneyear experiment is a 
necessary and logical step to eliminate trade barriers between 
the two countries

a south african cousin of kleingrass which is 
popular in areas of scant rainfall may some day be added to the 
list of us forage crops the agriculture department says 
the regular kleingrass is liked because of its ability to thrive 
in inhospitable settings with little water the departments 
agricultural research service said wednesday in a report 
but kleingrass has a major drawback for seed producers a 
tendency to shatter when harvested dumping its seed on the ground 
almost as fast as it ripens scientists estimate only 10 percent of 
the seed is actually harvested 
the south african kleingrass however retains about twice as 
much of its seed the new line was discovered in 1976 and is being 
evaluated by scientists the agency said

for nearly a decade ramon gonzalez vergara 
dreamed of leaving cuba for a better life but he was afraid to 
defect on his travels abroad for fear his family would be punished 
by the castro government 
finally vergara told a news conference wednesday he received 
his lucky break when he was assigned to moscow as cubas deputy 
secretary at the council on mutual economic assistance the soviet 
blocs economic confederation 
vergara 50 an economist took his wife his motherinlaw and 
his two children ages 14 and 11 on his foreign posting 
while in moscow vergara and his wife plotted how they would 
leave the soviet union but didnt tell their children about their 
plan he said in his first public appearance in this country 
because it was too dangerous to talk aloud in their moscow 
apartment vergara feared electronic eavesdropping he and his 
wife communicated using chalk on a blackboard 
he said they walked in the park when they wanted to iron out 
their plans 
finally on june 25 the vergara acted on their plan the family 
went to berlin for a holiday and then crossed the border in a 
sovietmade lada vehicle 
the car worked well vergara said joking that the soviets ought 
to be proud of their vehicles 
we knew we only had a 72hour grace period vergara said 
the family drove quickly across the continent to madrid where they 
had relatives in spain vergara sought asylum at the us embassy 
vergara whose appearance was sponsored by the cubanamerican 
national foundation is one of the growing number of cubans who are 
carrying out plans to leave said jackie tillman who works with 
the anticastro group 
in his remarks vergara said the soviet union could not sustain 
the huge amounts of aid that have propped up the cuban economy 
the soviet aid helps a lot to maintain the standard of 
living in cuba he said us officials estimate the soviet 
unions grants and subsidies to cuba amount to 5 billion annually 
but some private economists say that figure may be high 
vergara confirmed the 5 billion amount but he said he doubted 
it would continue at a time of belttightening and shortages in the 
soviet union itself 
they cant maintain the same levels of past year he said 
of course the cuban government is aware of the situation they 
have felt the first symptoms 
vergara who described cubas economy as being in recession 
said havanas trade with the soviet union amounts to 75 percent of 
the total trade with former soviet satellites such as those in 
eastern europe amounted to between 12 percent and 17 percent of the 
total he said 
while trade with eastern europe has eroded in recent months 
cuba is reaching out to trading partners in latin america and 
china he said

bob zuckerman came to rub shoulders with the 
pros and selma ford arrived harboring hopes for a job back home in 
ohio 
one hundred political enthusiasts converged on washington 
wednesday for the kickoff of the democrats annual campaign summer 
camp 
the intense fiveday training seminar is designed to teach 
wouldbe political pros the imprecise art of the campaign 
everything from how to control unpredictable candidates to how to 
curry favorable press coverage 
participants will plunge themselves into a campaign between mock 
state senate candidates ann neu age and bob sonny legion 
working from candidate profiles financial background and polling 
data 
once the race is on a local newspaper the daily planit 
covers the changes in the political climate and keeps the campaigns 
informed of the candidates sometimes unpredictable behavior 
the training camp was started in 1985 with the aim of electing 
democrats to state legislatures in key states before the 1990 
census this years crop of campers includes seasoned campaigners 
and novices alike 
zuckerman a new jersey state senate aide who has worked in 
several statelevel campaigns said he hopes to make new contacts 
and polish his campaign skills learning from political 
professionals here who have years and years of experience 
ford a student who just finished a washington internship hopes 
to translate her training into a job on the gubernatorial campaign 
of democrat anthony celebrezze in her home state of ohio 
its wonderful experience and i want him to win she said 
democratic party chairman ronald brown opened camp with a pep 
talk telling participants the key to democratic gains over the 
next decade lies in the success of statehouse races this year 
those elections are crucial to both parties since each side 
wants to have the upper hand when states redraw congressional and 
legislative districts based on the 1990 census results 
the only way to ensure fairness in reapportionment is to make 
sure that the hand that draws the lines is the hand of a 
democrat brown said 
after the opening ceremonies in washington participants went to 
rural piney point md for the remainder of the training camp

granting temporary amnesty to tax evaders in 
order to reduce the budget deficit could make honest taxpayers feel 
cheated and lose more money than it gains the bush administration 
says 
a federal tax amnesty program is a gamble with our tax 
systems most important asset the general willingness of 
taxpayers to obey the law said michael j graetz deputy 
assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy 
the vast majority of taxpayers who already comply with tax 
laws might feel cheated if they see that those who knowingly broke 
the rules are allowed to escape punishment graetz told the house 
government operations subcommittee on consumer affairs wednesday 
tax amnesty is a popular proposal in congress as lawmakers look 
for ways to reduce the budget deficit without raising taxes or 
cutting spending too deeply 
the internal revenue service estimates that cheating on income 
taxes will cost 87 billion in lost revenue this year in addition 
the longterm backlog of taxes that corporations and individuals 
admit owing but have not paid will total in the 80 billion range 
this year 
several bills would give wayward taxpayers six months in which 
to settle their accounts with the irs in return the agency would 
waive penalties and under some bills forgive interest and 
forgo civil or criminal prosecution 
the bills also promise considerably toughened enforcement after 
amnesty ends and include an expanded auditing and collection force 
at the irs 
as we battle headlong to reduce our uncontrollable budget 
deficit debating over whether to cut essential programs or impose 
unwanted taxes on our citizens we should take advantage of the 
benefits that a tax amnesty program yields sen alan dixon 
dill sponsor of one amnesty bill told the subcommittee 
sen kent conrad dnd noted that the 1991 budget prepared by 
the senate budget committee endorses the amnesty program he has 
proposed which congressional authorities estimate would bring in 
an extra 637 billion over five years 
its both fiscally irresponsible and insulting to the vast 
majority of honest taxpayers in this country if we fail to tap this 
revenue from those who havent complied conrad told the 
subcommittee 
graetz the treasury official called conrads estimate an 
exaggeration we do not believe a federal amnesty program would 
raise large additional revenues and there is a risk that such a 
program in fact might lose revenue he said 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr also said a general 
federal tax amnesty would be illadvised and counterproductive 
even so he said the irs is studying results from the 31 states 
that have offered amnesty and considering proposals that might be 
designed to provide an opportunity for a fresh start to those 
individuals who are not reached by our current tax administration 
efforts 
state amnesties have produced 16 billion in gross revenues 
but graetz and goldberg said there is no reason to expect a federal 
amnesty would bring in large amounts 
federal enforcement efforts already are far more effective than 
those used by any state graetz said in addition a considerable 
part of the increased state revenues probably were attributable to 
the tougher enforcement that accompanied amnesty he said 
goldberg said any workable amnesty would have to be highly 
targeted and part of a massive program to update irs computers and 
tighten enforcement there should be no forgiveness of interest or 
amnesty in taxshelter cases he said 
under the best of circumstances goldberg said there are 
serious doubts that the irs could implement any amnesty program 
during the next several years

supporters of guaranteed unpaid family leave 
for workers say congress will keep sending a bill to president bush 
until he signs it or they gain enough votes to override his veto 
george bush is going to have a family leave bill on his desk 
every year he is in office said sen christopher dodd dconn 
backers fell 53 votes short of the twothirds majority needed in 
the house to override on wednesday sustaining bushs veto of a 
family leave bill with a 232195 vote 
were going to have this kind of legislation enacted if not 
this year in this session next year or the year after said 
house speaker thomas foley dwash its inevitable 
fiftyseven democrats voted with bush to sustain the veto along 
with 138 republicans voting to override were 194 democrats and 38 
republicans 
the vote kept bushs perfect veto record intact it was the 13th 
veto of bushs presidency and congress has failed to override any 
democrats and some republicans denounced bushs veto and said 
it would provide democrats with an issue in the fall elections 
they pointed to polls that show large majorities of the public 
support the idea 
the bill would have required employers except those with fewer 
than 50 workers to provide unpaid jobprotected leave of up to 
12 weeks to workers who have new babies or family illness or other 
emergencies those in the highestpaid 10 percent within a company 
would have been exempt 
employers would have been required to continue health insurance 
benefits for those on leave once the employees returned they 
would have to be restored to their previous jobs or equivalent 
positions 
opponents charged the bill would be an onerous and costly new 
burden for businesses and hurt workers by discouraging employers 
from offering other types of benefits 
rep steve bartlett rtexas praised bush for his courageous 
veto and charged the bill would have imposed a 
onesizefitsall benefit without regard to need 
dodd who guided the bill through the senate said he would 
introduce a new version in that chamber next week he said it would 
have only minor differences and acknowledged it may be difficult to 
push the issue again in this session 
foley said democrats would not try to push a milder version of 
the bill this year he said the vetoed measure was a moderate bill 
requiring only unpaid leave and that most industrialized nations 
have programs that meet or exceed it 
further adjustment to satisfy the president i think would 
have to reduce the bill to a nullity and i for one am not willing 
to do that foley said 
business groups had strongly opposed the measure though 
confident of victory more than 50 lobbyists from a coalition of 
business groups worked capitol hill sporting buttons that said 
sustain the veto 
democrats pointed to bushs own campaign rhetoric in his 1988 
presidential campaign in which he said he supported the idea of 
unpaid family leaves some republicans criticized the president too 
wheres our heart asked rep arthur ravenel rsc

senate committee leaders arent giving up 
campaign donations from groups affected by the panels decisions 
although some senators are shedding contributions from savings and 
loan interests 
a spot check of various committee chairmen and ranking minority 
members turned up none willing to follow the lead of the banking 
committees donald riegle who says he no longer will accept 
campaign money from interest groups under his panels jurisdiction 
my inclination is to believe its an isolated incident from 
someone whos under the gun said michael traugott a university 
of michigan political scientist and authority on campaign finance 
i would put it under the heading of damage control 
riegle is among five senators whose ties to charles keating jr 
and his failed lincoln savings and loan are the subject of an 
ethics committee investigation 
riegles been under some pressure because of the keating 
affair and this may be the way he wants to deal with it said 
david shapiro spokesman for sen richard lugar rind ranking 
republican on the agriculture committee but there hasnt been 
any cloud over donations from farm interests he said 
nevertheless lugar postponed a fundraiser with agriculture 
groups until the senate completes work on the 1990 farm bill 
shapiro said theres a heightened sensitivity to how things 
appear 
spokesmen for several chairmen and ranking minority members said 
the senators screen individual contributions and return any that 
appear tainted but none were ready to ban all contributions from 
one of their biggest sources of campaign dollars 
among those surveyed 
energy and natural resources chairman bennett johnston dla 
he received 180461 from energy industry political action 
committees from 1983 through 1988 according to a study by the 
publicinterest group common cause 
environment and public works chairman quentin burdick dnd 
who received 97103 from energy pacs and 327700 from labor pacs 
some of which have an interest in environmental legislation such as 
the pending clean air act rewrite 
commerce science and transportation committee chairman ernest 
hollings dsc who received 828842 from business pacs 
jake garn rutah ranking republican on the banking committee 
who received 195375 from financial institution pacs including 
77600 from those tied to sampls 
riegle dmich last week announced he was giving the us 
treasury an amount equal to all contributions he has gotten and 
kept from sampl interests since 1983 
rising public outrage over the multibilliondollar thrift mess 
is making the return of sampl money an increasingly popular means of 
declaring independence from the troubled industry 
riegle led the senate in contributions from pacs representing 
banks sampls securities firms and others in the financial industry 
accepting 344133 from 1983 through 1988 common cause said 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas refuses money 
from subsidiaries controlled by foreign corporations because he 
favors legislation to outlaw contributions by those pacs spokesman 
jack devore said 
bentsen was the top recipient of contributions from business pac 
donations with 18 million 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the governmental affairs 
committee accepts contributions legally given and legally 
received and he votes his conscience spokesman rebecca bell 
said she declined to elaborate 
glenn received 693166 from pacs between 1983 and 1988 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the veterans affairs 
committee has no plans to follow riegles lead a spokesman said 
he received 15 million from pacs from 198388 and ranked seventh 
in receipts of labor pac money with 410600 and ninth in finance 
pac receipts with 209195 
glenn and cranston are targets of the ethics committee probe as 
are riegle and sens dennis deconcini dariz and john mccain

an alliance of government and private highway 
safety advocates wants to give police the power to take away a 
drunken drivers license on any road in the country 
claiming successes in 29 states where automatic revocation laws 
are in effect the heads of the national transportation safety 
board and the national highway traffic safety administration called 
wednesday for a campaign to pass similar laws in the rest of the 
nation 
the aim is to give police in every state the power to suspend 
the license of a driver who refuses or fails a roadside breath test 
for alcohol consumption 
the action is taken administratively without a court decision 
a nonjudicial hearing may be held if the driver appeals the laws 
have passed all court tests in states where they have been applied 
officials said 
in most states the illegal level of alcohol in the blood is 
010 percent but five states california colorado oregon maine 
and utah have set the level at a more stringent 008 percent 
the surgeon general has recommended that all states adopt the 
tougher law and eventually go as low as 004 percent for adults and 
000 for any driver under 21 
more than 16 million drivers are arrested each year on drunken 
driving charges and about half of all the 45000 traffic 
fatalities each year are alcoholrelated according to the traffic 
safety agency 
we hope the coalition will stay active until we get the 
administrative revocation law in all 50 states said ntsb 
chairman james l kolstad whose independent board has called for 
such laws in its investigations of drunken driving accidents 
kolstad and traffic safety agency administrator jerry r curry 
met with representatives of safety advocacy groups the insurance 
industry police organizations and others to plan a campaign for 
passage of laws in the remaining 21 states 
the fact that in the morning a driver has a license and if he 
or she is foolish and drinks at lunchtime and then fails a breath 
test the license is lost on the spot would be a strong incentive 
against drinking and driving kolstad said 
curry said he had followed drunken drivers through the process 
of losing their licenses being taken to a hospital for verifying 
tests being processed at a police station and then having to be 
driven home by someone else 
its an absolutely debilitating experience you think youre a 
criminal you are a criminal this is a violent crime he said 
without such laws we have to go through the court system and 
if were not able to get a trial date that particular drunks 
license might not be pulled for months curry said 
the administrator said the laws may be tough to get passed in 
legislatures where it has become a states rights issue its 
going to be a hard push he said 
opponents of the laws include some police agencies who are 
concerned about the extra hearings required when drivers appeal 
the revocations from trail lawyers who defend arrested drivers 
and from some state motor vehicle officials concerned about the 
administrative costs 
the federal government offers incentives of up to several 
million dollars to states which pass automatic revocation laws 
among organizations participating in the campaign are the 
american association of motor vehicle administrators american 
automobile association american trucking associations insurance 
institute for highway safety international association of chiefs 
of police mothers against drunk driving motor vehicle 
manufacturers association and national safety council 
states that do not have the automatic revocation laws are 
alabama arkansas georgia idaho kentucky massachusetts 
michigan montana nebraska new hampshire new jersey new york 
ohio pennsylvania rhode island south carolina south dakota 
tennessee texas virginia and washington

the nations privately run savings and loans 
continue to pile up losses despite an allout effort by the 
government to seize failed institutions 
the treasury departments office of thrift supervision said 
wednesday that the 2505 sampls outside government control on march 
31 lost 271 million in the first three months of this year 
that marked a sharp improvement from the 31 billion loss in 
the final three months of 1989 but it was a drop from the slight 
10 million profit in the first quarter of last year 
information was withheld on an additional 350 stillopen 
institutions controlled by the resolution trust corp an agency 
created last year to close and sell failed thrifts it is expected 
to issue data on those institutions next week 
nearly onequarter of the surviving institutions lost money and 
sampls overall lost money in 20 states although there was a vast 
improvement in texas the state hardest hit by the sampl crisis the 
industry deteriorated in northeastern states hit by lackluster real 
estate markets 
texas thrifts lost 110 million in the januarymarch period 
compared with 22 billion in the same period a year earlier 
however sampls in new york lost 1629 million compared with a 
616 million profit a year ago massachusetts lost 68 million 
compared with a 100000 loss the industry in connecticut lost 
1042 million compared with a 35 million profit 
analysts contended that reporting profit results separately for 
private and governmentcontrolled thrifts amounts to sugarcoating 
bad news and interferes with their ability to analyze the entire 
industry the thrift office collects information from both sets of 
sampls and in the past had always released both groups of figures 
its hogwash said bert ely a financial institutions 
analyst in alexandria va the thrift office wants to be the good 
news boys 
however thrift office director timothy ryan declared im not 
mr rosy scenario 
putting the two together presents an inaccurate picture of the 
industry he said 
in wednesdays report the thrift office did not say how much 
the losses were reduced by government subsidies to sampls bailed out 
in 1988 ely estimated the subsidy at between 1 billion and 15 
billion per quarter 
the 1988 deals are coming under increasing criticism from sen 
howard m metzenbaum dohio and others in congress who say they 
provided acquirers with virtually guaranteed profits for very 
little investment 
ryan in a news release greeted the firstquarter results as a 
sign of progress it appears that deposits and profits are 
returning to the strong part of the industry he was quoted as 
saying 
however at a news conference ryan told reporters it was too 
soon to draw conclusions from the data he said he would not know 
if the industry is capable of surviving until sometime early next 
year 
should we jump up and down and declare victory he asked 
no this is still a very tough situation in my view 
the thrift office divided the sampl industry into four parts 310 
institutions expected to fail 311 struggling thrifts that may 
fail 620 sampls that are somewhat weak but are expected to survive 
and 1264 institutions in good shape 
only the institutions in the last group earned what investors 
consider an acceptable return 692 million the next best group 
earned a subpar 192 million the struggling sampls lost 281 million 
and the expected failures lost 874 million 
you have an enormous segment of the industry that isnt making 
it ely said 
wednesdays report was about a month late ryan said the agency 
had changed its data collection process and hoped to release the 
reports on time in the future

attorney general dick thornburgh says mexicos 
request for the arrest of a federal drug agent investigating the 
1985 torturemurder of a colleague could disrupt improved law 
enforcement cooperation 
thornburgh on wednesday lashed out at the mexican governments 
refusal to cooperate in the investigation of the killing of enrique 
camarena a us drug enforcement administration agent who was 
abducted in guadalajara 
thornburgh said mexicos request for the extradition of dea 
agent hector berellez and an informant who arranged the april 2 
kidnaping of a guadalajara doctor charged with participating in 
camarenas killing was a step backward in improved usmexican 
law enforcement cooperation 
the attorney general said mexico appeared to be retaliating for 
continued us efforts in the case which include the indictment 
earlier this year of two former highranking mexican law 
enforcement officials on charges they participated in the killing 
unfortunately it would appear this most recent action thats 
contemplated by the government of mexico is in some way intended to 
retaliate for some of these efforts thornburgh said at the 
national press club 
we were obviously distressed by what could lead to a breakdown 
in what had up to this date been a very constructive relationship 
between mexican and american authorities 
the mexican government last week formally asked the state 
department to arrest berellez and antonio garate bustamante on 
charges of illegally abducting dr humberto alvarez machain 
alvarez a 42yearold gynecologist was seized at his office by 
four armed men and flown to el paso texas where he was arrested 
by dea agents on charges of participating in the killing of 
camarena 
garate has said in interviews that he arranged for mexican 
police to kidnap alvarez berellez testified in court that he was 
authorized by senior dea officials to approve the operation and 
offered to pay 50000 as reward plus expenses 
thornburgh said the request for the two extraditions marred a 
vast improvement in relationships between mexican and american 
law enforcement authorities that began when president carlos 
salinas de gortari took office in late 1988 
he reiterated us determination to see this prosecution 
through and said its a mistake for the government of mexico 
not to cooperate in this investigation not to bring to justice 
those persons who have engaged in acts or contributed to this 
dreadful incident 
we will not rest until we have brought to the bar of our 
justice those persons responsible thornburgh said we hope and 
expect that our friends and neighbors in mexico will understand our 
outrage and our determination to see this case through to 
completion 
we need to act together to deal with the drug traffickers to 
deal with the money launderers the attorney general said and 
a step backward in that regard is something i think brings dismay 
to all of us in law enforcement 
the alvarez kidnaping sparked accusations that the united states 
was encroaching on mexican sovereignty 
thornburgh defended deas role in the alvarez arrest during an 
interview may 10 when he invited the delivery of other defendants 
in the camarena case that the mexican government has declined to 
turn over to american authorities 
the defendants still at large in mexico include the former head 
of the mexican federal judicial police and the former head of the 
mexican branch of interpol the international law enforcement 
agency

house republicans say president bush risks 
losing the battle over military spending to the democrats unless he 
becomes personally involved in the fight 
theres no guidance im flying by instinct rep bill 
dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the house armed 
services committee said after he and other lawmakers met with bush 
on wednesday 
the president reiterated his support for the level of military 
spending adopted by the senate armed services committee a total 
of 289 billion that slashes 18 billion from his original request 
for the 1991 fiscal year 
in a session with vice president dan quayle defense secretary 
dick cheney and national security adviser brent scowcroft bush 
also urged lawmakers to approve continued production of the b2 
bomber elements of the antimissile strategic defense initiative 
and other major weapon systems 
but with the house armed services committee beginning to craft a 
defense bill today to the houseapproved figure of 283 billion 
and democrats certain to push for deep cuts gop lawmakers pressed 
the administration to indicate what level of spending is acceptable 
theres no bottom line for sdi no suggestion for b2 said 
dickinson he said he is willing to operate on his instincts but 
would prefer that the administration state what is totally 
unacceptable 
republicans conceded that the administration is faced with a 
difficult task because congressional and white house negotiators 
have yet to reach agreement on how to cut 50 billion from the 
deficit in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 
the whole thing is lost in the mist of the budget summit 
said rep joseph mcdade of pennsylvania ranking republican on the 
house appropriations defense subcommittee 
in the white house session mcdade said he proposed that cheney 
and the ranking members of the congressional armed services and 
defense appropriations subcommittees work to reach agreement on a 
military budget total 
but that proposal received little support from lawmakers who 
want to avoid preempting the budget summit 
conservative democrats and republicans are also pushing the 
president to lobby harder for various weapons warning that without 
a phone call from bush or an invitation to the white house the 
program may be severely cut or killed 
everybody indicated that the president has to engage 
himself mcdade said he understands it 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said after the white house meeting that it will take 
strenuous efforts by bush cheney and scowcroft to save the b2 
stealth bomber 
the house armed services committee is poised to follow its 
chairman rep les aspin dwis and end the program at the 15 
planes currently in production 
support for the radarevading aircraft is eroding in the 
100member senate where opponents say privately they have 40 solid 
votes to cancel the weapon 
the dire predictions come as aspins committee is weighing a 
reduction in bushs proposed budget of 47 billion for sdi to 29 
billion said congressional sources who requested anonymity 
the senate armed services committee in approving its version of 
the bill cut nearly 1 billion from the presidents request 
several house armed services panels were beginning work on the 
defense bill today with the seapower and strategic and critical 
materials subcommittee facing the toughest task cutting 3 
billion from bushs request of 163 billion for the navy 
the panels chairman rep charles bennett dfla said it will 
likely approve funds for one trident nuclear missile submarine and 
one seawolf attack submarine 
the senate armed services committee in its bill approved 12 
billion for the navys 18th trident sub but deferred the 
administrations request to buy two seawolfs for 23 billion

the nuclear regulatory commission relaxed the 
control of lowlevel radioactive wastes despite repeated concerns 
expressed by staff advisers and the environmental protection 
agency internal documents show 
the documents were obtained by a congressional panel that is 
questioning the decision announced last month that the nrc no 
longer regulate a wide range of lowlevel radioactive materials 
from nuclear power plants laboratories and hospitals 
nrc commissioners were called to defend the action today before 
the house interior energy and environment subcommittee 
rep george miller dcalif the subcommittees chairman said 
the nrc policy has the potential to endanger the public health 
and is an open invitation to abuse by unscrupulous operators 
who want to dump radioactive materials in ordinary landfills 
under the new policy such lowlevel wastes as gloves clothing 
lab equipment and even buildings and equipment at nuclear power 
plants can be disposed of as if they were normal garbage if 
radiation doses are below a certain level 
the commission plans to consider exempting various wastes on a 
casebycase basis as requests for exemptions are submitted by 
industry under the new policy guidelines 
nrc chairman kenneth m carr has argued that the policy change 
represents a way to save lives because federal and state regulators 
will be able to spend our resources on threats that are more 
important 
but representatives from the epa a halfdozen members of 
congress and a number of state radiation control officials were 
expected to testify against the nrc action announced on june 27 
according to documents obtained by millers subcommittee the 
epa as well as key nrc staff members expressed concern repeatedly 
during the two years the new policy was being debated that too many 
wastes are being deregulated 
the nrc decision would exempt from special control wastes that 
subject individuals to radiation doses of less than 10 millirem per 
year half the level of a normal chest xray 
we believe that is too high a level of exposure for a 
blanket deregulation criteria and is not protective of the public 
health the epas office of radiation programs concluded in a 
briefing paper submitted to the subcommittee the epa made similar 
arguments to the nrc before the policy change was made 
the epa maintained that the 10 millirem cutoff for regulatory 
action could result in as many as three additional cancer deaths 
for every 10000 people exposed numerous standards established 
by the epa including those for drinking water set upper limits of 
risk at lower levels it said 
according to internal nrc memos and other documents key 
commission staff members also expressed strong reservations about 
the 10 millirem cutoff level as the new policy was debated in 1988 
and 1989 
a staff report in june 1988 urged that only wastes with 
radiation doses of 1 millirem per year be deregulated among those 
who objected to the 10 millirem cutoff was robert m bernero 
acting director of the nrcs office of nuclear material safety and 
safeguards according to the documents 
bernero in one memo to his nrc superiors expressed concern about 
the health effects to individuals who may be subject to numerous 
exposures of such wastes and the longterm effect on such materials 
on the waste stream 
but the objections from bernero and other staffers were 
overruled by senior nrc officials the documents indicated 
the epa later suggested the cutoff be set at 4 millirem per 
year but that was rejected 
in their zeal to relax the regulation of the nuclear industry 
the nrc commissioners have ignored the objections of their own 
staff experts the environmental protection agency the states and 
the public said miller 
the nuclear industry as well as the nrc commissioners have 
argued that the wastes that are at issue emit only extremely small 
doses of radiation

treasury secretary nicholas f brady appears 
to be leaning against lowering the 100000 limit on deposit 
insurance but in favor of restricting insurance to one account per 
person 
in an appearance wednesday before the senate banking committee 
brady refused to be pinned down on what specific changes he favors 
in deposit insurance 
but he said i cant see a rush to lower it the insurance 
limit at this particular time 
asked about limiting insurance to one account per person he 
said if you were going to start any place that would be a place 
to start 
brady said the treasury was studying a proposal to charge 
depositors a fee for insurance an idea that sparked a furor when 
it was first floated by the bush administration in january 1989 and 
then quickly withdrawn 
currently depositors do not pay for insurance directly 
however banks and savings institutions pay a premium 
charging banks with risky portfolios more for deposit insurance 
is an idea we should look very closely at brady said 
his statements were similar to views expressed by federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan to the banking committee earlier 
this month 
brady agreed with sen donald w riegle dmich the committee 
chairman and sen jake garn of utah the senior republican on the 
panel that congress should overhaul the financial system next year 
he said his department would make specific recommendations on 
the overhaul after the end of this year when it completes a study 
of the issues 
many economists blame deposit insurance for encouraging savings 
and loan owners to speculate wildly because they knew the 
government would pay off depositors if their gambles soured 
however brady said the sampl crisis should not deter congress 
from permitting commercial banks to venture into the insurance and 
securities industries 
i dont think we ought to take the thrift debacle and make it 
such a big factor in our minds that we dont face the issues in the 
banking industry he said 
the thrift industry was deregulated without requiring sampl owners 
to risk more of their own money brady said consequently any 
expansion of bank powers ought to be linked to strong capital 
requirements he said 
we learned all too painfully from the thrift crisis that a 
crucial protection for the taxpayer is requiring firms to have a 
substantial amount of their own money at risk to absorb losses 
he said 
we will not propose changes to the financial services 
regulatory structure that would increase the taxpayers exposure 
brady said retaining the status quo is not an attractive 
option 
banks are losing some of their best business to securities 
firms who underwrite shortterm borrowing called commercial paper 
for major companies he said 
at the same time banks have been hindered from freely expanding 
across state lines and fully entering such lucrative fields as 
insurance and securities the treasury secretary said 
as a result banks have had to concentrate their lending in 
riskier areas such as commercial real estate lending energy and 
farm loans and leveraged buyout loans he said 
brady suggested there are lessons to be learned from the 
banking system in europe where banks enjoy much wider financial 
powers than in the united states 
he also said the complex system of financial regulation in the 
united states ought to be streamlined currently there are three 
federal agencies regulating banks another overseeing sampls and one 
supervising credit unions plus 50 state regulatory agencies 
we need to explore the reform of our regulatory structure 
although to be frank the inevitable turf fights involved may 
prevent the full achievement of this goal brady said

major legislation to curb job discrimination 
is headed for house floor action with sponsors brushing off bush 
administration warnings that it would usher in the use of minority 
hiring quotas 
we did not bring forth a bill that will lead to quotas or any 
danger of quotas rep don edwards dcalif said wednesday 
before the house judiciary committee approved the bill 2412 
house speaker thomas foley dwash said last week that the 
measure which closely matches a bill already passed by the senate 
would not come up for house floor action until after lawmakers 
return from their august recess 
civil rights forces however are urging him to reconsider and 
bring the bill to the floor before the break 
five supreme court decisions last year would be effectively 
overturned by the bill the top legislative priority of the civil 
rights movement 
provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the 
workplace to punitive damages for discrimination victims in extreme 
cases 
at the core of the debate is a provision designed to overcome a 
supreme court ruling that favors employers in certain 
discrimination lawsuits 
until last year companies could win if they proved the 
employment practices leading to the disparity were required by 
business necessity the new ruling made it easier for 
employers placing on those filing suit the burden of proving the 
practices in question were not business necessities 
the combination of damages plus the bills definition of 
business necessity would trigger an upsurge in discrimination 
suits critics say 
this should really be called the plaintiffs lawyers full 
employment act of 1990 rep f james sensenbrenner jr rwis 
told the judiciary committee 
under the bill business owners would feel compelled to turn to 
racial and ethnic hiring quotas as a way of protecting themselves 
in advance from such lawsuits the administration contends 
president bush has said repeatedly that he would like to sign a 
bill to combat job bias but not one that would lead to quotas 
the judiciary committees majority democrats easily beat back 
republicansponsored amendments designed to limit damages courts 
could award discrimination victims and tighten the rules governing 
fairhiring lawsuits 
rep barney frank dmass conceded there are horror stories 
about overenforcement of similar laws but he said such 
instances were rare and that those intent on discriminating often 
would find the means to get away with it 
the advantage is overwhelmingly with the sophisticated 
bigot he said 
rep henry j hyde rill said the problem was that the 
phrasing of the bill does more than merely negate last years 
supreme court decision and actually represents gains for civil 
rights forces 
i would concede the employer groups do not want a level 
playing field they want one that assists them hyde said but 
i also learned that the civil rights groups do not want a level 
playing field 
the house education and labor committee whose chairman rep 
augustus hawkins dcalif is a chief sponsor along with edwards 
already has approved the legislation 
two minor amendments were adopted by the judiciary committee 
before it approved the measure one would clarify the definition of 
business necessity 
the second would encourage the use of dispute resolution 
procedures outside the court system to resolve discrimination cases 
rep craig t james rfla a veteran attorney expressed 
skepticism he said urging nonjudicial settlements was a 
beautiful sentiment but that the amendment was a waste of 
paper because it would never be used

in a legislative race epitomizing 
the conflict between young reformers and the old guard in the new 
political climate a lawyer with no political experience is taking 
on the communist party boss 
ganbold the 29yearold candidate of the fledgling party of 
national progress favors rapid privatization and bold political 
change 
he says he volunteered to challenge 61yearold gombojavyn 
ochirbat arguably the most powerful man in mongolia in ulan 
bators 12th district race for the great peoples hural 
it is the first time the hurals 430 seats are being contested 
by noncommunist parties and the communists say that shows how far 
mongolia has strayed from its authoritarian past in the seven 
months since they agreed to reform under pressure of prodemocracy 
street rallies 
ganbold and other opposition candidates want more change and 
are finding considerable support among voters in the capital 
in last sundays primary ochirbat received the most votes but 
nearly half went to opposition candidates including ganbold 
the other opposition parties are now backing ganbold the only 
remaining opposition candidate in the district and have given the 
race top priority in this sundays second decisive round of 
balloting 
the communist party in mongolia is already going down not 
just the organization but the theory of communism i decided it 
would be appropriate not to allow the head of the communist party 
to be a deputy ganbold said wednesday 
he spoke at party headquarters in a traditionalstyle ger or 
nomads tent after returning from a full day of meeting with 
voters he was weary but exhilarated 
one of my fears that older people would be against me 
disappeared today as i met a lot of older people who said they 
were willing to back me he said 
the communist mongolian peoples revolutionary party which has 
ruled this central asian nation for seven decades clearly regarded 
district 12 as a safe place for ochirbat to run 
it is one of several bleak impoverished shantytowns on the 
fringes of ulan bator many of its 5300 registered voters have 
come recently from the countryside where communists are strongest 
and where there is little news of the revolution that has swept 
other soviet bloc nations 
neither candidate is from the district residency is not a 
legal requirement 
ochirbat may have expected that the residents could not resist 
the chance to have the ruling party chief as their hural delegate 
the party chairman a whitehaired dignifiedlooking man took 
office in march after popular demonstrations swept the incumbent of 
six years from power his past posts include head of the party 
ideology department president of the partycontrolled trade union 
and deputy chief of the party organization department 
ganbold is a juniorlevel officer in the ministry of law and 
jurisdiction like many mongolian intellectuals he studied in the 
soviet union and says he learned there that communism doesnt work 
he can make a good case that it hasnt worked well for district 
12 
the district has no kindergarten no schools ganbold said 
the electricity stops sometimes there is no telephone in the 
district 
ganbold said he has cannot promise that he could provide the 
services the district lacks but can vow to give the problems more 
attention 
he admits his campaign got off to a slow start he didnt begin 
doortodoor visits until wednesday but he said ochirbat still 
hasnt campaigned in person sending high party officials instead 
at a news conference tuesday ochirbat said some communist party 
members criticized the districts communists for not campaigning 
harder on his behalf but he did not announce any plans for taking 
a more active role 
nor did he outline any program for helping the district saying 
only that his party was now firmly on the path of reform

eastern airlines may have put thousands of 
passengers at risk by falsifying jet maintenance records federal 
prosecutors said in announcing indictments against the carrier and 
nine of its managers 
eastern struggling to rebuild in bankruptcy court after a 
bitter strike replied that corrective actions have been taken and 
the airline now is safe federal regulators agreed 
unprecedented in the airline industry the 60count indictment 
unsealed wednesday charged eastern and highlevel managers with 
conspiring to falsify safety and maintenance records to avoid 
flight delays and cancellations 
the motivation was to get the airplanes into the air an 
airline only makes money with planes in the air said andrew j 
maloney a us attorney in new york 
maloney said the charges involved critical items including 
radar landing gear automatic pilot instruments and fuel systems 
but that none of the alleged violations caused accidents or 
injuries 
thousands of innocent passengers may have been put at risk 
every day by the criminal actions of these defendants attorney 
general dick thornburgh said in a statement 
the charges returned by a grand jury in brooklyn capped a 
10month investigation plea bargain talks collapsed when eastern 
refused to admit to a conspiracy 
the indictment charges conspiracy fraud falsification of 
documents and obstruction of justice 
it names eastern and highlevel managers including edward upton 
former vice president of maintenance and engineering and thomas 
lewis easterns maintenance director for the region from 
washington to montreal 
if convicted eastern faces a fine of up to 30 million the 
other defendants face up to five years in prison and fines up to 
250000 on each count 
until a few days ago five of the defendants were employed as 
maintenance supervisors by eastern maloney said a 10th employee 
will be charged separately he said 
the alleged violations took place from july 1985 to october 1989 
at kennedy and la guardia airports in new york hartsfield airport 
in atlanta and eastern headquarters in miami 
by tampering with log books work cards and computerized 
maintenance records eastern caused aircraft that were not 
properly maintained or repaired to fly and carry unsuspecting 
passengers the indictment charged 
the federal aviation administration said eastern now meets 
federal safety standards and eastern said in a statement that it 
had taken full corrective action 
as a result eastern has become the most scrutinized airline 
in the industry the statement said and today there is no 
question that eastern is safe 
the investigation began after an eastern maintenance supervisor 
told maloney about irregularities 
the grand jury found that eastern managers had ordered that 
maintenance not be performed on aircraft and that records be made 
to reflect that it was maloney said he said managers pressured 
supervisors and mechanics to get the planes in the air or perhaps 
risk their jobs 
among the irregularities cited were a failure to properly pump 
accumulated water out of jetliner fuel tanks the water can freeze 
at high altitude and clog fuel lines it also makes fuel gauges 
read high 
workers in atlanta installed defective or untested cockpit 
instruments to make it appear that repairs had been made maloney 
said 
eastern employees went on strike on march 4 1989 the airline 
filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code five days later pilots and flight attendants quit 
the strike several months later but mechanics remain on strike 
maloney said prosecutors had no evidence of improprieties at 
eastern since courtappointed trustee martin shugrue began running 
the airline in in april 
the indictments validate strikers claims an official of the 
machinists union said 
thousands of passengers were put on aircraft when they 
shouldnt have been tony chapman vice president of machinists 
local 1690 said in atlanta

nasas failure to fix atlantis 
hydrogen leak bumped another shuttle flight into 1991 a team of 
nasa experts meanwhile began looking into the 15 billion hubble 
space telescopes woes 
but the space agency also got a bit of good news wednesday a 
thricedelayed launch of an unmanned atlas rocket went off without 
a flaw 
its good to have something positive happen nasa spokesman 
jim cast said its a definite boost to nasa morale 
after three postponements due to mechanical problems and bad 
weather the rocket blasted into space with a nasa and air force 
satellite that will study electric and radiation fields far above 
earth 
earlier in the day a lastditch effort to fix atlantis at the 
launch pad failed atlantis became the second shuttle in two months 
to be sent back to the hangar for repair of a hydrogen leak 
the leak reappeared when liquid hydrogen was pumped into 
atlantis external tank it was the third such test of atlantis 
but the agency still was unable to pinpoint the leak 
nasa postponed the shuttles secret pentagon flight from this 
month to november 
columbia the first leaky shuttle rolled back from the launch 
pad now will be next to fly its astronomy mission originally 
scheduled for may is set for september 
we have every reason to believe that we have no more problems 
ahead of us on columbia said william lenoir head of the 
national aeronautics and space administrations space flight 
program 
the space agency has replaced columbias leaky plumbing its 
leak was believed to be larger than the one plaguing atlantis and 
in a different place 
atlantis delay means nasa must bump another flight into 1991 a 
second atlantis mission set for this year with the gamma ray 
observatory originally was scheduled for november and now probably 
will be early next year 
nine shuttle flights had been planned for 1990 the number is 
down to seven now 
the shuttle developments came as a space agency team began 
investigating the cause of nasas highestprofile problem the 
flawed mirror on the 15 billion hubble space telescope that is 
sending back blurry images 
the sevenmember team led by lew allen director of nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory took testimony in secret wednesday at the 
plant where the mirror was made hughesdanbury optical systems 
inc of danbury conn 
allen said the group hoped to find a smoking gun and a 
fingerprint on the trigger 
the flaw has halved the effectiveness of hubble placed in orbit 
in april by astronauts aboard discovery the last shuttle to fly a 
repair mission by spacewalking astronauts is planned for 1993 
the hartford courant reported wednesday that scientists may have 
discovered the flaw in may 1981 but dismissed the evidence because 
they believed it was the result of a faulty testing apparatus 
on the shuttle front nasa officials had hoped atlantis problem 
could be solved by tightening bolts around the suspected leak area 
a flange in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen from the tank to 
the main engines 
the leak was discovered in a fueling test june 29 after which 
nasa temporarily grounded the threeshuttle fleet 
nasa wants to get at least one shuttle up before discoverys 
october mission with ulysses a satellite that will explore the 
suns poles

president corazon aquino will not 
agree to release funds frozen by us courts so that former first 
lady imelda marcos can donate money to earthquake relief press 
secretary tomas gomez said today 
on wednesday a lawyer for mrs marcos said the former first 
lady had offered to donate about 5 million for earthquake relief 
if us and philippine officials agree to release money frozen by 
american courts 
the point is if she mrs marcos is really sincere about 
giving money she can get in touch with the philippine national red 
cross thats as simple as that gomez said in an interview 
gomez said mrs marcos widow of the late president ferdinand 
marcos had money beyond that in the frozen accounts that she could 
donate to the relief effort 
asked if the government was willing to unfreeze the marcos 
accounts gomez said of course not why should the government 
they accounts are all sequestered 
the trouble with imelda is she is so insincere gomez said 
she is using the disaster for her foolishness 
mrs marcos lawyer james linn said some of the marcos assets 
frozen by the 1986 court order are in swiss banks and some in hong 
kong he did not give an estimate of amount in the accounts 
linn said us officials would be asked this week to issue a 
court order releasing the funds 
philippine officials claim marcos had kept up to 10 billion in 
swiss accounts but no proof has been offered to support the amount 
claimed 
the july 16 earthquake killed more than 1600 people injured 
more than 3000 and destroyed the homes of 90000 people in the 
northern philippines 
official preliminary estimates of damage totaled nearly 700 
million this is expected to rise as reports from remote areas 
reach manila 
on july 2 a federal jury in new york acquitted mrs marcos of 
racketeering fraud and obstructing justice in connection with the 
alleged theft of more than 220 million from the philippines 
treasury during marcos 20year rule 
mrs marcos has remained in new york rather than returning to 
hawaii where she had lived since fleeing manila during the 1986 
militarycivilian uprising the mrs aquino rode to power 
her husband died in hawaii in september 
both the philippines and us governments have banned mrs 
marcos return to her homeland citing national security threats

an american human rights group is accusing 
israels government of condoning needless killing of palestinians 
by failing to curb soldiers excesses or to adopt tight rules on 
opening fire 
israeli policies all too often encouraged a lack of restraint 
by idf israel defense force troops says a 126page report 
released wednesday by middle east watch which is based in 
washington dc and new york 
the group says the death toll from army gunfire in the 31month 
palestinian uprising could be drastically cut if senior military 
and civilian officials were determined to stop unjustified 
killings 
the report comes on the heels of similar findings by other human 
rights groups early this month amnesty international said many 
palestinian victims in the uprising died in circumstances 
suggesting excessive use of force or deliberate killings 
 
in a written response to the middle east watch report the army 
denied that israel ignores palestinians rights or condones 
violations 
israel is concerned about the issue of human rights no less 
than its critics the army said it said that israel has imposed 
stricter restrictions on soldiers opening fire than mandated under 
international law 
the army also said the report completely ignores wideranging 
incidents of terrorism in the uprising including killings by 
palestinians of fellow arabs as alleged collaborators with israel 
eric goldstein the groups research director and author of the 
report said middle east watch officials have condemned 
collaborator killings in testimony before us congressional 
committees 
the report says troops have confronted the uprising with loaded 
m16 or galil assault rifles while army figures show that soldiers 
were faced with guns in only 5 percent of incidents the other 95 
percent involved stone throwing slingshots and such weapons as 
iron bars 
the imbalance of weaponry underscores the propriety of 
treating the intefadeh uprising as a civil revolt rather than a 
war the report says 
in 450 palestinian deaths through june 1989 no more than 16 
soldiers were courtmartialed on charges of causing death and no 
more than 10 were convicted says the report which was released in 
jerusalem and washington 
the report uses the army death toll of 670 palestinians killed 
in army gunfire in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
according to figures gathered by the associated press 724 
palestinians have been killed by israeli soldier and civilians in 
the revolt at least 242 palestinians have been slain by fellow 
arabs most as suspected collaborators fortyfive israelis also 
have been killed 
an israeli human rights group said last month that soldiers 
violated firing orders by shooting 14 palestinians in the head 
chest or back despite regulations calling for them to aim for their 
legs the israeli center for human rights in the occupied 
territories known in hebrew as betselem had studied casualties 
during disturbances following the may 20 massacre of seven unarmed 
arab laborers by a deranged israeli civilian

japanese government bond was quoted at 8579 points as of 3 pm 
down from wednesdays close of 8598 the yield stood at 7460 
percent up from 7425 percent 
currency dealers said the dollar opened higher as traders showed 
their belief that easing us interest rates had receded but then 
weakened slightly on dollarselling by importers 
the dollar turned a bit bearish said kozo yoshida a dealer 
with mitsui taiyo kobe bank 
yoshida said the dollars retreat from its opening was partly 
attributable to an easing of tension in the persian gulf 
diplomatic sources based in the persian gulf said iraqi troops 
would begin pulling back from the border with kuwait thursday prior 
to direct talks to try to solve the two nations dispute over land 
and oil production 
kuwait had insisted that iraq withdraw what it claimed were 
massed forces at their common 100mile border before kuwait would 
sit down for negotiations this weekend with baghdad said the 
sources who spoke anonymously 
on the stock market the nikkei index started falling with a 
waitandsee attitude prevailing among many market players coupled 
with the yens weakness against the dollar said a dealer with 
nomura securities who spoke anonymously

a satellite that will illuminate 
earths invisible magnetic field in shades of red white and blue 
orbited the world today after a flawless ride into space on an 
unmanned rocket 
the 143foot atlas rocket roared into a clear sky wednesday from 
cape canaveral air force station and the satellite separated as 
planned after several delays 
its always a good feeling to see a launch vehicle leave the 
ground nasa manager sid saucier said so far everything is 
going great 
it was the fourth attempt in six days by nasa and rocket builder 
general dynamics to launch the atlas the first commercial version 
of the rocket ever flown the postponements were caused by a helium 
leak bad weather and a corroded power transfer switch in the 
rocket 
the weather was perfect as the atlas boosted the 189 million 
combined release and radiation effects satellite to an orbit 217 
miles by 22236 miles high to study radiation in space 
the 2ton satellite a joint program of nasa and the defense 
department holds 24 chemicalfilled canisters that will be ejected 
starting this fall ultraviolet rays from the sun will ionize the 
released barium lithium and other chemicals creating large 
glowing clouds that will spread along earths magnetic field lines 
the bariumladen clouds will resemble the aurora borealis or 
the northern lights the display will be visible to the naked eye 
enabling scientists to measure electric fields in space and see how 
they interact with normally invisible charged particles 
the first releases will be made over american samoa in the south 
pacific in september four months later people in north america 
will get their first glimpse of the clouds additional canisters 
will be released next summer over the caribbean providing a view 
from florida and the southern portions of alabama and georgia 
wednesdays launch was the first of a commercial atlas and the 
eighth commercial rocket launch by an american company nasa used 
earlier versions of the atlas to launch planetary probes and other 
midsize payloads

a year after fire wiped out the 
nations leading producer of laboratory mice breeders at the 
jackson laboratory are nearly back to full production 
last year the director of the national institutes of health 
said the loss of the mice was creating a very serious problem for 
research scientists all over the world 
now production had returned to almost 80 percent of what it had 
been laboratory director kenneth paigen said wednesday before the 
may 10 1989 fire the lab distributed 2 million mice a year to 
11200 laboratories worldwide 
many of the mice which carry unusual mutations and conditions 
that mimic human diseases are unavailable anywhere else 
the demand now is greater than it has ever been before 
paigen said 
the laboratorys mice were used in 80 percent to 90 percent of 
the scientific studies with mice published in leading journals last 
year paigen said 
ninetysix percent of mouse studies on aids relied on jackson 
laboratory mice he said 
the fire destroyed the large mouse breeding facility at the 
laboratory but did not spread to the research labs which are in a 
separate building 
four hundred thousand mice died in the fire but at least some 
individuals or frozen embryos of all strains survived so no 
valuable mutant mice were permanently lost 
the threat of another supply interruption remains however 
because temporary breeding facilities set up in trailers after the 
fire could suffer power losses paigen said 
ground has been broken for the construction of new permanent 
breeding facilities he said the recoverys total cost is expected 
to be 32 million of which congress has approved up to 25 million

the army corps of engineers has laid out a 
plan under which the federal government can help us industry 
develop highspeed magnetic trains by the year 2000 
the corps preliminary implementation plan released 
wednesday sets a timetable under which various federal agencies 
would evaluate and eventually oversee the development of magnetic 
levitation trains in the united states 
under the plan the federal agencies studying the feasibility 
maglev trains should know by 1993 whether the united states can 
regain the lead in this transportation technology 
we believe there is a golden opportunity for magnetic 
levitation in this country said dan mauldin deputy director of 
civil works for the army corps of engineers 
sen harry reid dnevada said the report echoes what he and 
sen daniel p moynihan dny have been saying if we want a 
us maglev and its benefits we must put us money into it 
foreign money will get us foreign maglev systems 
maglev trains are propelled by magnets on a cushion of air over 
a rail such trains could travel up to 300 miles per hour use less 
energy than conventional transportation modes and would be cheaper 
to ride than airplanes according to the report 
so far only the japanese and the germans have developed 
prototype maglev trains but several projects are under discussion 
in the united states 
maglev was invented and pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s by 
americans including james powell and gordon danby at brookhaven 
national laboratory on long island but us advances stopped 
around 1974 when the federal role in maglev development ended 
moynihan said at a news conference 
the report released wednesday estimated it would cost between 
800 million and 12 billion to develop a 20mile single track 
demonstration project not including the cost of land for right of 
way

foreign investors sold 42 billion worth of 
american stocks and bonds more than they bought in the first three 
months of 1990 
the securities industries association reported wednesday that 
the biggest item was a net sale of us treasury bonds 65 
billion worth there were also net sales of 33 billion worth of 
us stocks 
net foreign purchases of bonds issued by us agencies and 
private companies amounted to only 56 billion 
the association called these figures a sign that the united 
states can no longer count on foreigners to finance its federal 
budget deficit and provide money for us industry 
net sales of us treasury bonds by japan alone amounted to 29 
billion compared with net purchases of 14 billion in the last 
quarter of 1989 japanese also sold a net 702 million worth of 
stock in us companies and 84 million worth of their bonds

emergency workers and bystanders 
showered in the middle of a busy street to wash off a powdery 
residue 22 people were taken to the hospital and two federal 
agencies are investigating 
a major chemical spill no a minor rearend auto accident in 
which one cars air bag deployed 
nobody at the scene had a handle on the procedures for the 
situation and there were a lot of people there with a lot of 
emergency experience said jeff wells who heads the ambulance 
service in neighboring weehawken 
federal transportation and consumer officials say that the 
hysteria was unnecessary and that the incident in this new york 
city suburb points up the need for rescue workers to learn how to 
handle accidents involving air bags standard equipment in about 3 
million 1990 cars 
the confusion began when patricia sanchezs 1990 plymouth 
sundance hit a car stopped for a red light and her cars air bag 
deployed 
the nylon bag stored in the hub of the steering wheel inflates 
in onetwentieth of a second and deflates through vents in its side 
within a few more seconds packed in cornstarch or talcum for 
lubrication the deployed bag gives off a puff of powder and leaves 
a fine white residue inside the car 
but rescue workers believed the air bag had exploded and spewed 
sodium hydroxide a form of lye on ms sanchez 
a quartergram of sodium hydroxide along with a small amount of 
baking soda are created as byproducts of the chemical reaction 
that inflates an air bag in a frontend collision said tim hurd 
spokesman for the national highway traffic safety administration 
which is investigating the crash 
the amount of lye is minuscule and its only a minor irritant 
he said 
but rescue crews cut away some of sanchez clothes thinking 
they were contaminated with chemicals firefighters cordoned off 
the intersection set up a shower in the street and rinsed off 
anyone who came in contact with the powder 
emergency workers fearing more trouble with the bag cut it out 
of the car and now cant find it 
they were frightened of the powder said louis ciavatti 
acting city fire chief it could have been overplayed 
there is absolutely no reason to hang back and delay treatment 
because an air bag has deployed hurd said 
the problem is that air bags and the way they work are still a 
mystery to many people said frank ghiorsi regional director for 
the national transportation safety board which is also 
investigating the july 14 crash 
hurd said he interviewed sanchez and she does not think the air 
bag malfunctioned he also said there were no stray bag fragments 
or other evidence of an explosion in the car 
twentytwo people were taken to jersey city medical center and 
10 of them were treated as if they had been exposed to sodium 
hydroxide said hospital spokeswoman sheila paris klein sanchez 
also was treated for chemical burns and spent two nights in the 
hospital 
but federal investigators believe sanchez only suffered friction 
burns from the inflating air bag they dont believe any of the 
other injured were exposed to lye 
clarence ditlow of the center for auto safety in washington a 
consumer group that supports air bags said drivers have suffered 
friction burns but never chemical burns from air bags 
alan miller a spokesman for chrysler corp which manufactures 
the sundance said the company will investigate the incident 
passive restraints either air bags or automatic seat belts are 
required in front seats in all 1990 domestic cars bags are 
contained in all chrysler usmade cars about half of ford motor 
co cars and about 15 percent of general motors corp cars 
gm held a seminar in june to teach us and canadian 
firefighters about the new technology and rescue techniques

marilyn quayle has been released from bethesda 
naval hospital four days after undergoing a hysterectomy 
the vice presidents press office said wednesday that the 
operation was performed because pap smears indicated she had 
severe dysplasia a cell abnormality that experts said can be a 
precursor to cervical cancer 
the announcement was the most specific yet about the surgery 
performed on the vice presidents wife 
mrs quayle had two abnormal pap smears earlier in the year 
quayle press secretary david beckwith said in a written statement 
a cone biopsy was performed and revealed sever dysplasia a 
hysterectomy was performed saturday morning 
because of early detection due to the excellent work of the 
cytologists at the national naval medical center mrs quayle is 
expected to have a full and complete recovery he said 
dr allan b weingold chairman of the department of obstetrics 
and gynecology at george washington university medical center said 
severe dysplasia is a premalignant disease that is 100 
percent curable by a hysterectomy 
she is cured said weingold who was not involved in 
treating the vice presidents wife 
he said experts grade dysplasias as mild moderate and severe 
beyond that the cell abnormalities are classified as carcinoma in 
situ or already advanced to the cancerous state and in the final 
stage as invasive cancer 
not all dysplasias become cancers 
she was two steps away on the benign side from invasive 
cancer said weingold its 100 percent curable by the kind of 
surgery she had thats the whole purpose of the pap smear 
a hysterectomy involves removing all or part of a womans 
uterus ending her ability to bear children 
mrs quayle turns 41 on sunday the quayles have three children 
ages 16 13 and 11

the soviet union will get more badly needed 
foreign hard currency by selling its rough diamonds exclusively 
through the south african giant de beers in a fiveyear 
multibilliondollar agreement 
the company is advancing the soviets 1 billion against future 
diamond sales said officials who announced the agreement on 
wednesday 
the soviet union among the worlds largest diamond producers 
reached the deal with de beers because it wanted to sell a huge 
stockpile of diamonds without disrupting the market de beers said 
the soviet union had refused to deal directly with the south 
african company because of apartheid but now is willing to openly 
do business with de beers new swiss arm de beers centenary ag 
south africabased de beers consolidated mines ltd controlled 
by the oppenheimer family of south africa established the 
publiclyheld swiss company in may 
de beers centenary said in a statement that it reached the 
agreement with glavalmazzoloto of the ussr for the exclusive export 
and sale of the soviet unions diamond production 
glavalmazzoloto is the main administration for precious metals 
and diamonds under the soviet unions council of ministers de 
beers said 
it said its luxembourgbased subsidiary centenary holdings sa 
has agreed to make a secured advance of 1 billion to 
glavalmazzoloto against future diamond deliveries 
repayment would be made over five years beginning in november 
it said 
nicholas oppenheimer deputy chairman of de beers centenary 
said as a result of the agreement that the soviet union at a time 
of considerable financial strain was assured a steady flow 
of funds from diamonds during the life of the contract 
company officials estimated the contract could be worth as much 
as 5 billion 
moscow has been seeking foreign credit as it tries to bring 
marketoriented reform to an economy plagued by shortages 
the soviet diamond stockpile will be held at de beers 
londonbased marketing arm the central selling organization as 
collateral for the 1 billion advance de beers said 
the organization a 57yearold cartel has the financial 
resources to hold large stocks of diamonds which is how it keeps 
the market stable 
although de beers said it had had no direct contact with the 
soviet union since 1963 diamond experts say de beers already sells 
most of the soviet unions westbound diamonds 
all the worlds major diamond producers including botswana 
australia tanzania zaire and namibia have sales contracts with 
de beers centenary the central selling organization as a result 
markets 80 percent of the worlds rough diamond production of some 
100 million carats 
the organization had sales of 409 billion last year 
largescale diamond mining began in the soviet union in the 
1950s and is concentrated in the yakutia region of north eastern 
siberia de beers said the soviet union doesnt disclose the value 
of its output

six us soldiers who went awol from intelligence posts in west 
germany and were arrested at a florida beach known for ufo reports 
wont be courtmartialed but many other questions about the 
bizarre case remain 
were the six five men and a woman acting on psychic 
input from biblical figures and preparing for the worlds end as 
a friend of one suggested 
did they plan to move to the west and live like a survivalist 
group as a police captain said he was told by two in the group 
or was there another explanation of the events that began 
unfolding when the six who held topsecret security clearances 
left the 701st military intelligence brigade in augsburg west 
germany early this month 
dont judge them yet they have a right to defend 
themselves said anna foster at whose gulf breeze fla home 
four of the six were arrested july 14 ms foster a civilian 
described by authorities as a psychic is not charged in the case 
and said she could not elaborate 
the army offered the six nonjudicial punishment no trial 
by courtmartial after an investigation by the army intelligence 
and security command found no evidence of espionage officials said 
wednesday 
at fort knox ky where the six were being held maj ron 
mazzia said they could receive reductions in pay or rank or both 
and could be fined specific terms will be determined by an officer 
acting as a sentencing judge

and they were just going to kind of live out in the woods kind of 
like a survivalist group hicks said he said they mentioned 
santa fe nm and texas 
as the six were moved first to fort benning ga and then to 
fort knox another story emerged it focused on beason doing his 
second hitch in the army 
beason had trained in pensacola and dated and corresponded with 
ms foster he always was interested in science fiction beason 
created miniature spaceship models and other artwork and was trying 
to write a book friends said 
he can draw or make anything as long as its not real said 
beasons brotherinlaw charles reed 
four or five years ago beason hired commercial photographer 
stan johnson of bybee tenn to photograph some of his creations 
johnson and his wife vivian a former english teacher helped him 
with his writing theyre in their 50s and said they became a kind 
of second family for beason 
during a twoweek visit last christmas beason seemed his usual 
self but in a few phone calls since may he took a different turn 
he just reeled and rambled and ranted said mrs johnson 
describing one call 
she said he thought the disciples and some of the other 
spirits have talked to him or else one of the other people in that 
group the group that was arrested and told them the rapture is 
near and for them to prepare for it 
some fundamentalist christians believe that during the rapture 
believers will be swept to heaven before the world ends some 
relatives who helped raise beason after his parents divorced were 
fundamentalists friends said 
mrs johnson said beason wouldnt be swayed when she questioned 
his statements 
hed say you just dont understand i am a chosen ive 
been told to do this she said 
do what specifically 
beason said he and the others would go to florida on a 
missionary project to prepare for the end stan johnson said 
the real interesting part of this was that when the second 
coming of christ occurred jesus christ was going to arrive in a 
spaceship 
reed added he thinks hes doing what god wants him to 
beason and hueckstaedt found a used volkswagen van after they 
flew from west germany to tennessee and apparently picked up the 
other awol soldiers for a drive to gulf breeze a florida panhandle 
town whose claim to fame is the number of reported sightings of 
unidentified flying objects 
a symposium of the mutual ufo network concluded there july 8 
police said 
lee perlock the mother of kris perlock said her family was 
close and their religious practices were mainstream other 
relatives of the soldiers said the same thing about their religious 
backgrounds but were reluctant to discuss details of discussions 
with them after the arrests 
notified of the armys disciplinary decision mrs perlocks 
husband ron reacted with relief this has been going on for so 
long not knowing 
they hope to see their son soon in the meantime mrs perlock 
said softly there are a lot of unanswered questions

researchers have found a defect in the 
bodys scaffolding that may cause a genetic disease that makes 
people unusually tall and lanky and might have affected abraham 
lincoln 
the disease called marfan syndrome can also include severe 
heart problems that may cause basketball players to die suddenly on 
the court dr reed pyeritz of the johns hopkins school of medicine 
in baltimore said wednesday 
pyeritz and his colleagues identified the defect in a protein 
called fibrillin a component of the elastic fibers in skin blood 
vessels and ligaments 
theres something wrong with the scaffolding and glue that 
holds us together pyeritz said at the jackson laboratory in bar 
harbor where some of the nations leading researchers have 
gathered for an annual genetics course 
lynn sakai of the oregon health sciences university who 
collaborates with pyeritz has identified the gene for fibrillin 
and is now conducting studies to determine its function 
she said in a telephone interview that she and pyeritz soon will 
be able to confirm whether a defect in the fibrillin gene and the 
consequent defect in fibrillin itself are the cause of marfan 
syndrome 
meanwhile a research group in finland has obtained preliminary 
evidence through an entirely different approach that the genetic 
defect for marfan syndrome is on chromosome 15 one of the 23 pairs 
of human chromosomes 
if the fibrillin gene is also on chromosome 15 that will be 
further evidence that the gene is indeed the cause of the disorder 
sakai said 
if fibrillin is lnked that would be quite a breakthrough 
she said 
doctors have speculated that lincoln had marfan syndrome not 
only because he was tall and lanky but also because toward the end 
of this life he had an illness that could have been congestive 
heart disease pyeritz said 
that is one of the consequences of a defect that causes the 
aorta the principal output vessel from the heart to expand and 
tear 
the aorta problem is also what causes the oncourt death of 
basketball players and can cause sudden death in others with marfan 
syndrome pyeritz said 
the discovery of the gene for marfan syndrome would enable 
doctors to begin devising new treatments but it would not 
guarantee any change in the near future for marfan victims pyeritz 
said 
people with the disorder can currently be helped by surgery to 
replace part of the aorta with a dacron tube pyeritz said 
other aspects of the disease can be difficult to treat however 
many patients have a dislocation of the lenses in their eyes and 
some are blind others have curvature of the spine chest 
deformities and loose joints 
the work by pyeritz and sakai and their colleagues identifying 
fibrillin comes after researchers have tried for years to determine 
what defect could cause such a wide range of symptoms 
the elastic fibers containing fibrillin are found in eye 
ligaments bones blood vessels and other affected tissues pyeritz 
said

former exxon valdez skipper joseph 
hazelwood could be back in command of a ship in nine months under a 
penalty imposed by the coast guard for the nations worst oil spill 
hazelwood in an interview said he was satisfied that the coast 
guard dismissed misconduct and negligence charges against him and 
decided to let him to resume his career 
at a coast guard hearing wednesday administrative law judge 
harry gardner suspended hazelwoods captains license for nine 
months and put him on probation for three more months 
misconduct and negligence charges were dismissed after hazelwood 
agreed to enter nocontest pleas on two other counts that he 
violated coast guard policy by drinking liquor less than four hours 
before taking command of the tanker and that he improperly left 
the vessels bridge while it was headed for jagged bligh reef 
but hazelwood said after the hearing he was angered by newly 
disclosed papers about crucial bloodalcohol tests that had implied 
he was drunk when the tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude last year 
hazelwoods attorneys said the blood analyzed may not have been 
his 
its what we said all along and nobody would listen to us 
hazelwood said the possible skulduggery that goes along with it 
is enough to make anybody angry 
if it werent for our discovery of this it would have been 
buried forever and a lot of people with political agendas would 
have been very happy 
hazelwoods attorneys contended that evidence may have been 
covered up a charge the coast guard and national transportation 
safety board denied 
the 987foot tanker was en route from the alaskan port of valdez 
to long beach on march 24 1989 when it struck the reef in prince 
william sound 
wednesdays hearing followed a trial in which an alaskan jury 
acquitted hazelwood of charges of intoxication and recklessness 
but convicted him on a misdemeanor of negligently discharging oil 
he is appealing 
weve cleared the two major hurdles as far as my personal life 
is concerned said hazelwood 43 of huntington ny of 
course id like to wake up tomorrow morning and it would all be 
done but thats not going to happen 
he said his life has been consumed by litigation since the 
disaster put his name in headlines asked if could he ever see a 
time in his life when he would be free of litigation hazelwood 
sighed and said not in this century i can see going into the 
year 2000 with some pending litigation of some sort 
hazelwood said he thought his experience might drive other 
tanker captains out of the business 
everything in your private life is paraded in public and 
youre lampooned from pillar to post is the job worth it i still 
havent made up my mind a lot of good people will leave the field 
rather than risk this 
hazelwood said he had pondered going into some other field 
perhaps even law given his exposure to it as he waits nine months 
to be eligible to reclaim his captains license issued in 1966 
but i cant foresee myself putting on a pinstripe suit 
grabbing a bag and getting on the long island rail road every 
day he said but i wont foreclose anything 
the coast guard offered no explanation for dismissing the charge 
that hazelwood was intoxicated during performance of his duties 
with a blood alcohol level over the coast guards 04 percent limit 
also dismissed without explanation was a charge he left an 
improperly licensed third mate in control of the ship 
hazelwoods attorney michael chalos disclosed during the 
proceeding the defense recently found documents indicating that the 
blood test taken 10 hours after the spill was mishandled and 
unreliable 
in interviews hazelwoods lawyers said the tardy disclosure of 
the alcohol records constituted misconduct by the coast guard and 
the ntsb which had access to the documents 
the coast guard said the blood matter had nothing to do with the 
plea agreement the ntsb said in a statement the blood sample was 
tested at certified labs and the ntsb had no control over the 
results 
michael peat director of chemwest analytical laboratories in 
sacramento where the sample was analyzed denied the specimens 
were tampered with but declined to elaborate

and william condon were convicted on two counts each of gambling 
and racketeering 
i really thought we shouldnt be here connick said after 
the verdicts were returned i didnt expect to be convicted 
prosecutors claimed that connick at the urging of his three 
acquitted codefendants illegally returned seized records to 
aucoin so the admitted bookie could pay off and collect gambling 
debts 
connick maintained that aucoin was entitled to have his gambling 
records returned under state law aucoin said he needed them to pay 
federal taxes on his gambling income 
before the trial started connick said the charges were 
contrived by us attorney john volz as part of a political 
vendetta connick is a democrat volz a republican

police sources confirmed the afp account and said two men were 
later taken into custody and were being held pending identification 
by witnesses to the attack the specific motive for the attack was 
not known

a convoy of trucks today began 
spiriting away a vast cache of deadly nerve gas once secretly 
stored by the united states just outside this small west german 
town 
the snaking convoy removed the first batch of 100000 gasfilled 
artillery shells stored at a us military site at clausen which 
is near kaiserslautern in the southwest part of the country 
the lethal cargo destined for destruction on a pacific atoll 
is being removed under a 1986 uswest german agreement at a cost 
of 831 million 
hundreds of crack paramilitary west german police troops lined 
the convoy route and stood guard on overpasses as the the long line 
of 80 trucks began shuttling the shells at about 8 am 
vans carrying police with riot gear accompanied the convoy 
the first trucks arrived at miseau about 30 miles away 2 
hours later at miseau the containers are to be loaded onto 
special trains that will take them to nordenham on the north sea 
where they will be placed aboard us navy ships for transport to 
johnston atoll 
the weapons will be destroyed in a specially built incinerator 
on the us atoll about 800 miles southwest of hawaii 
only about 20 of the 80 trucks that left clausen actually 
carried the chemical weapons sealed in airtight containers said 
us army spokesman jim boyle he said the rest contained 
decontamination crews firefighters west german and us soldiers 
police monitoring teams and medical staff 
the chemical team is equipped to contain any incident he 
said the operation is going as planned 
only four protesters were spotted they draped posters 
including one that said evil is simply being shifted from here to 
the pacific over a stone wall next a church along the convoy 
route in clausen 
they said they were protesting the us decision to destroy the 
weapons on the atoll and said it would jeopardize the populace 
there 
this solution is the worst of all worlds said protester 
ursula siegmayer she said she had participated in earlier chemical 
weapons protests but were not proud of our success this is a 
catastrophe 
the west german government is paying 312 million of the 
removal costs the us cost is 52 million 
environmental groups which for years had campaigned for the 
removal of the chemical weapons had sought to block the transport 
charging that the safety measures were inadequate 
the environmental greens party one of the strongest opponents 
of chemical weapons went to court to try to block the removal but 
an administrative court in cologne ruled friday there was no 
evidence to prove the greens contention that faulty data had been 
used to calculate the risk of transportation 
several groups of private citizens concerned about the safety of 
the transport had also unsuccessfully tried to block the operation 
through court action 
the shells are safe to handle and transport due to their 
construction and condition the munitions without fuses are 
double packed in vaporproof secondary steel containers and 
military vans for transport the us army said in a statement 
announcing the beginning of the operation 
the approximately 100000 artillery shells in 6inch and 
8inch sizes are loaded with liquid nerve agents according to 
boyle 
they were brought to clausen between 1958 and 1968 where they 
have remained since 
clausen is the only site in west germnay where chemical weapons 
are stored 
boyle said the army has done everything to make sure the 
operation goes ahead without a hitch 
there is safety measure upon safety measure redundant 
throughout the operation he said 
one convoy will take the weapons daily from clausen to miesau 
over the next 30 days 
the rail transport to the north sea port will take about a week 
and will be conducted at night 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and former president ronald 
reagan agreed in 1986 to remove the chemical weapons by 1992 the 
timetable was advanced by president bush 
it was only in march that authorities acknowledged that the 
chemical weapons were stored in clausen

north and south korea signed a historic 
agreement today calling for their prime ministers to meet for the 
first time in an effort to end four decades of cold war 
confrontation on the divided peninsula 
yet in a scenario which has become commonplace in interkorean 
relations the day ended in controversy namecalling and 
dissidents shouting antiseoul government slogans near the border 
the acrimony erupted over the aborted border crossing by five 
north korean civilians and threatened to spread a blight on todays 
accord 
the planned fall talks between the prime ministers would focus 
on easing political and military tensions promoting exchanges and 
other moves toward cooperation between the two states formed 42 
years ago 
by signing the accord north koreas communist government of kim 
il sung tacitly recognized the legitimacy of the seoul government 
of president roh taewoo 
this precious fruit will open a decisive chapter in a road to 
ending national division and achieving peaceful unification said 
south korean chief delegate song hanho 
north korean chief delegate paik nam jun said the agreement 
will open a new chapter in the history of the national division 
the 19point accord was signed at the truce village of panmunjom 
located inside the 2milewide demilitarized zone which separates 
the communist north from the capitalist south 
the first prime ministers talks would be held sept 47 in 
seoul a second meeting is to be held oct 1619 in the north 
korean capital of pyongyang 
the two prime ministers kang younghoon of south korea and yon 
hyung muk of north korea are ceremonial figureheads with little 
policymaking roles but their meeting as the highest level ever 
between the two rival states is seen as symbolically significant 
within an hour of the documents signing however the rival 
koreas became embroiled in disagreements over housing and travel 
arrangements for five north koreans who were to have crossed the 
border today for a twoday visit in seoul to plan a koreawide 
rally for unification 
eight hours after the crossing was to take place it was 
effectively canceled a communist official reportedly hung up the 
phone during a conversation with a south korean official shortly 
thereafter a north korean radio broadcast blamed the south for 
blocking its delegates 
the seoul government had insisted that the north koreans stay in 
a luxury seoul hotel the north koreans wanted to stay with south 
korean dissidents at a church house and travel in the dissidents 
cars 
three disappointed south korean dissidents waiting as a 
welcoming party started chanting antigovernment slogans down 
with president roh taewoo who blocks unification they shouted 
in seoul unification minister hong sungchul issued a statement 
saying all indications compel us to doubt if north korea really 
had any intentions to make the crossing and the rally come off as 
scheduled 
he said our door remains open 
lee haehak one of three south korean dissident leaders at 
panmunjom called it a political show he said cancellations of 
the north koreans visit would make it difficult to plan and hold 
the unification rally that had been planned for aug 15 
the five were to be the first civilians since a 1985 family 
exchange to cross the border with the approval of both governments 
paik the north korean delegate said if citizens on both sides 
of the border have difficulty in arranging the rally relations 
of the south and north would further deteriorate and it would have 
an irreparably bad impact on the holding of the highlevel talks 
proposed sites for the aug 15 rally include the capitals of 
either north or south korea or panmunjom 
the koreas were divided after world war ii they fought a 
threeyear civil war that ended in 1953 and have remained rivals 
since 
their border is the most heavily fortified in the world with 
more than 15 million armed men on either side 
south korea offered last week to open its border to north 
koreans for unrestricted travel for five days starting aug 13 it 
challenged north korea to do the same for south koreans 
the north has said it would open the border on a limited basis 
on aug 15 to koreans desiring unification 
the two sides have become bogged down in a blitz of proposals 
and conditions and it remains unclear whether there will be any 
crossings 
aug 15 is the 45th anniversary of the liberation of korea from 
japanese colonial rule it is a sentimental holiday on both sides 
of the border

with a blessing by buddhist monks 
six sets of human remains were flown out of cambodia today for 
tests to see whether they are the bones of americans missing from 
the vietnam war 
it was the first time since the end of the war in 1975 that 
communist cambodia has allowed the repatriation of suspected 
remains of those missing in action or mia 
a somber american military honor guard escorted six flagdraped 
aluminum caskets on board a us air force c141 that took off for 
hawaii where the remains will undergo forensic examination to try 
to identify them 
buddhist monks chanted prayers during a 15minute memorial 
service conducted before an altar covered with flowers and burning 
incense the six caskets sat behind the altar and a monk sprinkled 
holy water to bless the dead 
the united states appreciates the support of the phnom penh 
authorities for this undertaking said air force lt col thomas 
boyd spokesman for the repatriation team we consider this an 
important humanitarian undertaking which if successful will help 
to alleviate the suffering of american families 
the team had flown to phnom penh earlier today from bangkok 
thailand to join the group of military experts who had examined 28 
sets of remains collected by the cambodians and chose six for 
further tests 
in hawaii the remains will be analyzed and identified by the 
joint casualty resolution center and the army central 
identification laboratory 
the remains were given an initial examination by a sixman 
military team in phnom penh on tuesday and wednesday the first 
such mia mission to cambodia since the 1975 communist takeover 
we came and did our work and the cooperation was everything we 
asked for lt col joe harvey the us team leader told 
reporters wednesday after meeting with dith munty first deputy 
foreign minister of the vietnamesebacked government 
harveys team examined 28 sets of remains in a tiny laboratory 
at cambodias only medical college the teak caskets contained 
bones skulls and at least two sets of military identification 
dog tags 
a cambodian foreign ministry spokesman said his government paid 
2000 for the return of some remains from remote provinces 
harvey said six sets warranted further analysis in hawaii 
two were found in outlying provinces and four were from choeung 
ek an area southwest of phnom penh that was used as a mass 
execution ground by the fanatical communist khmer rouge who ruled 
from 1975 to 1978 the khmer rouge were ousted after vietnamese 
forces invaded cambodia in late 1978 
it was unclear if the remains found in choeung ek dated from the 
period when the khmer rouge held power 
eightythree american servicemen and eight us civilians are 
listed as missing in action in cambodia from the indochina war 
the us mission broke a long political stalemate between 
washington and successive communist governments in phnom penh over 
the mia issue 
boyd said past us efforts to examine remains in cambodia had 
been either ignored or politicized 
he said washington would consider sending another team to 
examine more remains but added that this was not discussed during 
his groups visit 
the united states does not recognize the phnom penh government 
but a week ago it announced it was withdrawing recognition of the 
khmer rougedominated guerrilla coalition that is fighting the 
phnom penh government and would open talks with vietnam on ending 
the cambodian civil war 
cambodias deputy interior minister khim ponn head of a newly 
formed mia commission said he wanted to discuss normalization of 
diplomatic relations but the americans limited talks to mias 
most of the americans missing in cambodia are airmen whose 
planes were downed during bombing raids from 1969 to 1973 on the ho 
chi minh trail the major supply route for the north vietnamese 
into south vietnam that wound through the mountains of eastern 
cambodia 
a total of 2300 americans are officially listed as missing in 
action in indochina aside from those in cambodia 1678 are 
missing in vietnam 533 in laos and six in chinas coastal waters

rival rebel groups are closing in on 
the city from two directions in heavy fighting for control of the 
capital 
as the battles raged wednesday the airfield that was monrovias 
last link to the outside world also came under attack 
fighters of rebel leader charles taylor resumed their offensive 
in the eastern part of the city followers of a rival rebel 
commander prince johnson fought off government soldiers who tried 
to retake bushrod island in the north 
with gunfire echoing all around acting information minister 
paul allen wie told reporters that president samuel doe had no 
plans to step down despite the advancing armies 
the president thinks it is worth dying for his country wie 
said at a news conference at the ducor palace hotel he distributed 
a news release quoting doe as saying a sudden resignation would 
lead to greater anarchy and ethnic tragedy in liberia 
i cannot heed the advice to quit the leadership of liberia 
because it would introduce a dangerous precedent of outrageous 
rebellion and instability into the west african region doe said 
early wednesday prodoe troops attacked two bridges that link 
the city center with rebelheld bushrod island but they were 
repulsed by heavy fire 
one squad of government soldiers was seen crawling across one of 
the bridges but was pinned down under the heaviest gunfire yet 
heard in the battle for the city 
some of the soldiers lay motionless as though dead or injured 
others ran back to the safety of the government positions 
shells were also seen exploding on the other bridge hitting a 
government jeep which was trying to lead an attack from that side 
the wreckage of the jeep sat in the middle of the bridge 
government troops firing from the city center shelled rebel 
positions on the far side of the bridges some rounds falling close 
to the citys main oil storage depot which was in rebel hands 
state department spokesman richard boucher said it appeared 
johnsons men controlled the island which includes the port 
johnson is believed to have split with taylor sometime in the 
past three months and some diplomats say his army is now stronger 
than taylors national patriotic front 
a few miles away to the east rebels waded across a swamp and 
attacked spriggspayne airfield the last way out of the city that 
was not in rebel hands it was unclear whether fighters of johnson 
or taylor launched the airfield attack 
further east in paynesville taylors men resumed their 
offensive diplomats reported heavy fighting in that area where 
the rebels had been blocked several weeks by government soldiers 
diplomats said taylors forces surrounded and effectively 
neutralized government troops who were barricaded inside the radio 
and television stations east of the city the rebels did not attack 
them in order to spare the facilities the diplomats said 
the government which the rebels accuse of corruption and human 
rights abuses repeated its allegation the united states was 
actively aiding the insurgents 
the united states has denied the accusation and boucher said 
its offer to provide safe passage out of the country for doe stood 
doe met tuesday with us ambassador peter de vos but did not ask 
for help in leaving the country boucher said at a washington 
briefing 
the liberian people are disappointed by the united states 
wie told the reporters 
doe expelled the chief of the us military mission to liberia 
col david staley on friday after accusing him of actively 
supporting the rebels 
on tuesday the government accused the united states of 
launching an attack on does presidential mansion from a submarine 
a charge immediately denied by washington 
people who said they witnessed the attack said it came from a 
rebel gunboat offshore the fortified mansion returned the fire and 
later announced that five civilians were killed on a nearby main 
road 
monrovians continued their desperate search for food and water 
in a city where all shops were closed and where utilities have been 
shut down for more than a month 
as many as 5000 people were jammed into a usowned fuel 
storage depot near the embassy in the exclusive mamba point 
district seeking haven from attacks by soldiers who were going on 
looting sprees and attacking civilians 
most government soldiers are members of does krahn tribe since 
the insurgency began in december they have attacked civilian 
members of the gio and mano tribes which provide the main support 
for taylor 
sixteen ambassadors met with the acting foreign minister 
wednesday to complain about being harassed by troops at checkpoints 
throughout the city

two quakeravaged freeways will remain 
closed six months later than planned because of revised design and 
construction changes on the elevated roadways 
director robert best of the state department of transportation 
said wednesday an independent private panel of engineers 
discovered more construction work was needed to cope with 
disastertype stresses on the central and interstate 280 freeways 
two weeks ago officials said the freeways which carry 250000 
vehicles a day would reopen in october 
the freeways resemble the cypress freeway that collapsed in 
oakland during the oct 17 earthquake the quake measured 71 on 
the richter scale killed 67 people and caused an estimated 7 
billion in damage the new freeways are expected to withstand a 
quake registering 82 on the richter scale 
nicholas forell chairman of the independent review panel said 
repair work on the elevated roadways involves an immense 
engineering task 
there is no precedent to these freeways anywhere in the 
world forell said 
about 5 million of 39 million in original repair contracts on 
the two freeways has been spent to date best said the revised 
plans could bring costs to 80 million he said 
asked why work was started before all engineering reviews were 
in best said we did that to try to expedite the reopenings 
we felt there was a good chance that work could be accommodated by 
getting the contracting going 
we were taking a gamble to get these facilities opened a few 
months earlier than if we had waited

gov buddy roemer said his belief in 
free speech led him to veto a bill that would have required warning 
labels on recordings that some say promote deviant behavior 
the democratic governor also planned to announce friday whether 
he would veto the nations strictest state abortion bill 
roemer vetoed the record labeling bill wednesday as he was 
flanked by supporters that included tipper gore president of a 
parents organization that pushed for voluntary labeling and jason 
berman president of the recording industry association of america 
the bill would have mandated labels for recordings with themes 
of rape murder suicide incest illegal drug use child abuse and 
satanic worship it also would have prohibited the sale of such 
recordings to people under age 17 
retailers manufacturers and distributors of recordings would 
have been subject to possible sixmonth jail terms and 5000 fines 
musicians and recording industry officials had threatened to 
boycott louisiana if roemer signed the bill but he denied the 
pressure influenced his decision 
as a parent and as a governor this legislation has presented 
to me my most severe philosophical conflict roemer told 
reporters my strong belief about decency in the proper 
upbringing of my own children versus my strong belief and 
dedication to freedom of speech and my innate desire to avoid 
excessive governmental interference 
there also is pressure for roemer to veto the abortion bill he 
said he received a letter signed by law professors from harvard 
yale georgetown stanford and other universities who concluded 
that there is virtually no chance that this particular bill would 
be sustained by the united states supreme court 
the bill passed in the last days of the legislature this month 
would prohibit abortions except to save the life of the mother or 
for cases of incest and rape doctors performing abortions could be 
sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and fined 100000 
roemer declined to say whether he plans to veto the abortion 
bill friday or allow it to become law without his signature 
in 1985 when mrs gore wife of sen albert gore dtenn 
helped organize us senate hearings on record labeling various 
record company executives said they planned to label records that 
contained explicit lyrics 
state rep ted haik the sponsor of the louisiana bill said the 
music industry cant be trusted 
he apparently has learned nothing from the past experiences of 
broken promises of the music industry to develop a uniform labeling 
system haik said of the governor 
elton john ray charles randy newman patti labelle and other 
performers protested the bill the neville brothers favorite sons 
in louisiana called the bill racist and threatened to stop 
performing in their home state 
the national academy of recording arts and sciences threatened 
to end consideration of new orleans as a site for the grammy hall 
of fame if the bill became law music industry organizations 
threatened to cancel planned conventions in the city 
radio stations had label day marathons playing records that 
disc jockeys thought would fall under the ban among them were such 
classics as stagger lee house of the rising sun love 
for sale and mack the knife 
in may the recording industry unveiled a voluntary labeling 
system that it hoped would halt state campaigns for mandatory 
labeling 
we believe this voluntary system responsibly addresses the 
parental concerns without crossing over the line that results in 
unconstitutional limits on freedoms of expression berman said 
this industrywide standard logo provides an easily recognizable 
tool to assist parents who wish to monitor the music their children 
are buying

iraq has agreed to pull thousands of troops 
back from its disputed border with kuwait diplomatic sources say 
after apparently forcing kuwait to agree to end oil overproduction 
today iraqi newspapers suddenly ceased what had been daily 
attacks on kuwait and an iraqi official confirmed that iraqi and 
kuwait representatives would open talks this weekend in the saudi 
arabian port of jiddah 
but the official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
president saddam hussein has not backed down on demands that kuwait 
cut oil production pay for oil baghdad claims was pumped illegally 
from a field that straddles the countries undemarcated border and 
forgive billions of dollars in loans 
the ball is in the kuwaiti court now he said 
diplomatic sources said late wednesday that tens of thousands of 
troops reportedly sent to the border earlier this week by saddam 
would begin withdrawing today 
in geneva where opec was holding a midyear meeting iraqs oil 
minister denied there had even been a troop buildup as published 
reports and diplomats had said there is no such thing as massing 
of troops along the border said issam abdul rahim alchalabi 
oilrich iraq with a 70 billion foreign debt after a fall in 
crude prices and a costly war with iran last week threatened 
military action against fellow oil producers kuwait and the united 
arab emirates for contributing to the overproduction that has 
driven down the price of crude 
iraq has 17 million people including 1 million soldiers kuwait 
has 18 million residents 20300 in the armed forces the uae 
has about 16 million residents and a military with about 43000 
personnel 
in geneva opec oil cartel members this week are trying to put a 
lid on production to drive up the price and officials from kuwait 
and the uae indicated wednesday that they are ready to go along 
that agreement along with mediation efforts by egyptian 
president hosni mubarak and other arab leaders appears to have 
reduced tensions considerably 
the persian gulf sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said kuwait had insisted that iraq withdraw the forces it 
reportedly massed on the countries 100mile border before it would 
negotiate this weekend with baghdad 
they credited intensive mediation tuesday and wednesday week by 
mubarak and king fahd of saudi arabia 
the announcement of direct iraqikuwaiti talks was made by 
mubarak on wednesday in cairo even as the iraqi media stepped up an 
antiamerican campaign in response to us military muscleflexing 
in the persian gulf 
the pentagon had announced tuesday that us warships and 
aircraft were holding a shortnotice exercise in the persian 
gulf with the uae a clear show of support for the two small 
states challenged by baghdad 
in baghdad saddam summoned us ambassador april glaspie for 
talks on wednesday government radio gave no details of the meeting 
in kuwait diplomatic sources said saddam had assured mubarak he 
would not use military force as long as kuwait agrees to the 
following conditions paying compensation for 24 billion in oil 
iraq claims kuwait stole and holding direct talks on a border 
dispute 
the oil allegedly stolen was from the rumaila oil field which 
straddles the border iraq claims rumaila is exclusively its own 
in addition iraq wants kuwait to write off billions of dollars 
in loans it granted iraq during the 8year iraniraq war that ended 
in august 1988 it also wants the reopening of a border air 
corridor 
the dispute flared last week when a bellicosesounding iraq 
accused kuwait of stealing the oil and alleged that kuwait and the 
uae were causing a slump in oil prices by exceeding their opec 
production quotas 
baghdads move was widely interpreted as seeking to pressure the 
two small states into agreeing at this weeks meeting of the 
13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries to a 
proposal to cut oil output

a disease that can cause kidney failure has been 
arrested in rats by an experimental drug raising hopes for a new 
human therapy researchers said today 
the disease called glomerulonephritis strikes perhaps 100000 
americans a year researcher dr wayne border said 
a medication like the one used in the experiment may someday be 
able to stop the diseases progression so patients wouldnt need 
dialysis or transplants he said 
such a treatment may also work for a similar kidney complication 
of diabetes and high blood pressure border a kidney specialist at 
the university of utah school of medicine said in an interview 
the rat study was published today in the british journal nature 
the work raises exciting possibilities in a new line of 
research said dr ira greifer professor of pediatrics and 
nephrology at the albert einstein college of medicine and 
montefiore medical center in new york 
existing drugs dont always work and can produce major side 
effects he said 
but it will take more research to determine what the new 
approach means for treating human disease cautioned dr lawrence 
agodoa of the national institute of diabetes digestive and kidney 
diseases 
glomerulonephritis pronounced glomerulownehfritis is an 
inflammatory process that can destroy ballshaped kidney structures 
called glomeruli the structures help remove wastes from the 
bloodstream if destruction is extensive enough wastes can 
accumulate in the bloodstream and cause death 
glomerulonephritis can appear by itself or in conjunction with a 
chronic disease called lupus strep throat or a variety of 
infections 
the researchers gave rats a form of glomerulonephritis by making 
the rats diseasefighting immune system attack the glomeruli 
although the cause of the human disease is not well understood 
such an attack frequently appears to play a key role they said 
then they injected some of the rats with proteins called 
antibodies that would seek out and latch onto a natural substance 
called transforming growth factor beta previous studies suggested 
that this substance stimulates the glomeruli to produce a protein 
meshwork that leads to destructive scarring 
the scientists reasoned that if the antibodies could bind to the 
growth factor and disable it the production of the meshwork might 
stop 
agodoa said nobody has yet shown that the growth factor plays a 
role in human glomerulonephritis 
greifer said he doubted the work would apply to kidney scarring 
caused by high blood pressure because that scarring comes from a 
different process 
other researchers in the study were selya okuda of the utah 
medical school erkki ruoslahti and lucia languino of the la jolla 
cancer research foundation in la jolla calif and michael sporn 
of the national cancer institute

it might have been a tribute to an honored 
elder statesman so lavish was the praise and not the unanimous 
condemnation of a senator for deliberately breaking senate rules 
the senate voted 960 wednesday to denounce sen dave 
durenberger for financial wrongdoing but first senators called 
the minnesota republican a man of conscience of influence of 
decency afterward they lined up to hug him shake his hand and pat 
his shoulder 
he is after all one of them 
and as sen bill armstrong rcolo put it after this is 
all over and we denounce him we still want him to be our friend 
durenberger was disciplined for violating senate speaking fee 
and gift limits misleading the senate on real estate transactions 
involving his minneapolis condominium and converting a campaign 
contribution to personal use 
the senate also ordered him to make restitution of up to 
123000 for money he received improperly durenberger has agreed 
to repay the money 
the judgment marked the 24th time in 201 years that the senate 
disciplined one of its own the main case against him was made by 
sen howell heflin dala chairman of the ethics committee 
i wish there was ambiguity here but there is none i wish i 
could find innocence or at most inadvertence or inattention or 
simple ignorance in sen durenbergers actions here but i 
cannot heflin said somberly 
durenberger sat nearly impassive through the three hours of 
emotional remarks clasping his hands tightly at times and staring 
intently at each senator who spoke 
the debate was unusually personal with senators referring 
frequently to durenberger simply by his first name and the chamber 
was unusually full with all committee business suspended for the 
solemn proceeding 
durenberger made his reputation building bridges among senators 
politically and personally and many of them indicated they could 
not forget that as they struggled with their duty 
as senators we must unflinchingly exercise the judgment which 
is required said sen carl levin dmich as a human being i 
remain a steadfast friend of dave durenbergers and an admirer of 
the legislative work he has accomplished 
several senators said they found it hard to reconcile the 
evidence with the cheerful capable man who for 12 years has played 
major roles in legislation affecting the disabled minorities the 
elderly rural communities the environment and health care 
we all know what happened some of us watched it with startled 
mien said republican whip alan simpson of wyoming i still 
cannot understand said sen warren rudman rnh vice chairman 
of the ethics panel 
durenberger has said his judgment was impaired by family 
problems the death of his first wife a troubled remarriage four 
sons going through difficult adolescences and tremendous financial 
stress 
but rudman said none of that could excuse his conduct and 
durenberger looking him in the eye from across the aisle nodded 
solemnly in agreement 
sen orrin hatch rutah noted with approval durenbergers 
resolve to reform a theme that suffused the minnesotans brief 
floor remarks after the vote 
he vowed to be a better man a better senator he said he would 
work harder shoulder more responsibility he called the moment an 
ending but also a beginning i ask your forgiveness he said 
i need your friendship 
later durenberger said his decision to take my medicine and 
forge onward rather than resign was due to strong support from his 
colleagues he said their comments wednesday caused me to believe 
that if anything ill be even more effective in the future 
durenberger who has four years before he must face voters back 
home was not the only one who saw good coming from his ordeal 
he could have withered and fallen into selfpity and 
bitterness said simpson instead he said i have seen my 
friend soften and mature and grow in this terrible process 
sometimes hard times bring people together said sen david 
pryor dark a member of the ethics panel he said the senate has 
not always been congenial lately but today i sense a sense of 
feeling together a sense of closeness and a sense of brotherhood

president mikhail s gorbachev said today his 
country needs western assistance to make his reform program work 
and he promised that any aid will be repaid 
gorbachev spoke at a news conference after a day of meetings 
with italian premier giulio andreotti the president of the 
european community andreotti is a leading proponent of providing 
aid to the soviet union 
no agreements were reached in the talks about italian or 
european aid to boost gorbachevs reform program 
gorbachev said the soviet union needs help producing more food 
and consumer goods for the market and that factories need a chance 
to work with foreign firms to boost their productivity 
as an example of soviet inefficiency gorbachev has said 25 
percent of the nations crops are lost during harvesting and 
storage 
the resident of the russian federation the soviet unions 
largest republic today warned of a food shortage catastrophe 
in russia unless efficiency improves 
we have to gather it carefully preserve it and get it onto 
the table of the russian people boris n yeltsin said 
the existing food situation in our republic is critical he 
said in an appeal on the front page of the sovietskaya rossia 
newspaper to prevent a catastrophe we must improve it 
immediately 
as an incentive yeltsin said the government would issue special 
coupons to agricultural workers from farmers to tractor drivers 
allowing them to buy goods that have been in short supply 
russian prime minister ivan silayev warned in a separate 
interview that if the market is not soon saturated with food and 
consumer goods the situation will be unpredictable 
the prices will simply skyrocket and the shadow economy will 
capture everything he told pravitelstvenny vestnik newspaper 
gorbachev said the next two years of reforms will be crucial 
in these two years in which we will have to make the most 
difficult changes we need this kind of help gorbachev said 
some of the aid should be given quickly to reduce the 
difficulty of the problems and so perestroika does not slow 
down he said 
however he added the soviet union cannot depend on foreign 
sponsors to fix its economy but must depend largely on itself 
aid to his country will not be a handout he said but 
temporary assistance that must be paid back 
the west german government has guaranteed 31 billion in bank 
loans to the soviet union and together with france it pushed the 
european community to endorse an immediate 15 billion aid program 
but european leaders refused to go along with the plan as did 
leaders of the worlds seven largest capitalist powers meeting in 
houston texas earlier this month 
president bush says a program to provide the soviet union with 
western advisers and knowhow would be of greater benefit than 
economic aid until the soviet union makes greater changes in its 
economy he also has asked gorbachev to cut aid to countries like 
cuba

secretary of state james a baker iii 
today sought to reduce speculation that an agreement with the 
soviet union on afghanistan could be announced during his 
fournation visit to asia 
theres no agreement on afghanistan baker was quoted as 
telling reporters on his plane to jakarta its a product of the 
rumor mill 
the us embassy in jakarta released a statement with the baker 
comments 
prior to bakers departure us officials had indicated the 
secretary of state would try to clear the remaining roadblocks to a 
ceasefire in afghanistan during the asian trip 
they said baker and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze who are to meet aug 1 meeting in irkutsk soviet 
siberia would discuss a timetable for afghanistans president 
najibullah to step down 
the soviets hinted at a deal they haven fleshed it out an 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
tuesday the thread of the deal is going to be pursued in irkutsk 
by baker 
abc news had said earlier this week that shevardnadze and baker 
already had made a deal to end the afghan civil war but the 
administration official disputed that report 
the bush administration has been hoping for a breakthrough to 
end the war between afghan government forces armed by the soviet 
union and a guerrilla coalition fighting with americansupplied 
weapons funneled through pakistan 
the soviets have not yet told the united states how najibullah 
might be removed from power in kabul said the administration 
official 
the soviet union installed the najibullah government in 1979 
but the government in kabul has been unable to impose its will on 
the countryside the soviets withdrew their troops last year but 
continue to supply arms 
in indonesia baker will attend a meeting of the association of 
southeast asian nations on friday and saturday 
asean said in a statement wednesday that a change in cambodias 
representation in the united nations would hurt the search for 
peace in indochina last week the united states withdrew its 
recognition of the guerrilla coalition that holds cambodias un 
general assembly seat 
baker was quoted as telling reporters on the plane that the 
change of us policy on cambodia was an example of our need to 
adjust to new circumstances 
washington also announced last week it would open talks with 
vietnam on a settlement in cambodian and would no longer support 
the right of the guerrilla coalition to represent phnom penh in the 
world body 
those steps could open the way to a broader rapprochement 
between the united states and hanoi shifting the balance of power 
in southeast asia hanoi supports the cambodian govenment 
the abrupt us policy change underlined the failure of years of 
aseanled diplomacy to negotiate a settlement asean helped form 
the cambodian resistance group in 1982 
us officials said the shift was designed to prevent the khmer 
rouge the strongest of the three guerrilla groups from gaining 
power in cambodia the khmer rouge took power in 1975 and 
slaughtered hundreds of thousands of civilians before being ousted 
by vietnam in 1978 
asean includes thailand the philippines singapore malaysia 
indonesia and brunei later in the asian trip baker will later 
hold talks in singapore and visit outer mongolia

last two years with a new high expected in 1990 
veronicas uncle willy cosme blamed it on the neighborhood 
growing up around here other little kids often learn the bad 
side of life he said the brooklyn police precinct where 
veronicas family lives is the deadliest in the city with 97

negotiators for el salvador and 
leftist guerrillas agreed today to have a un commission monitor 
human rights in el salvador where tens of thousands of civilians 
have died in the civil war 
the accord was reached after an allnight negotiating session in 
san jose the talks turned to the human rights issue after failing 
to make progress on a ceasefire in the decadeold war the 
commission would not begin work until a ceasefire agreement is 
reached 
nevertheless negotiators said the rights accord was a 
significant step it was the first concrete agreement between the 
sides since peace talks began in may and both delegations had 
expressed concern that the absence of an accord in the san jose 
talks might deal a devastating blow to the negotiating process 
salvadoran guerrillas have long accused the rightist government 
of human rights abuses and human rights groups say at least 30000 
people have died at the hands of rightwing death squads 
the latest victims include six jesuit priests their cook and 
her 16yearold daughter who were shot to death early nov 16 at 
central american university 
the accord reached today between the government of el salvador 
and the farabundo marti national liberation front rebels doesnt 
close the topic of human rights but it is a partial accord said 
alvaro de soto a un mediator 
de soto said the accord without doubt helps clear the way for 
progress on other items of the agenda 
were enormously satisfied said oscar santamaria the 
justice minister and chief of the government delegation this 
accord is a very meaningful advance 
guerrilla commander schafik handal leader of the rebel 
negotiating team said the document is an accord of great value 
but he cautioned that the issue of overhauling the armed forces 
was still pending this human rights accord will not mean a 
great deal unless we advance in the field of demilitarization of 
salvadoran society he said 
the talks began friday and the top agenda item was the overhaul 
of the armed forces which the rebels have demanded before they 
stop fighting during 20 hours of talks negotiators failed to make 
even slight progress on that issue 
it was the third round of talks this year aimed at ending the 
conflict that has killed 72000 people most of them civilians 
the massacre of the jesuits focused new attention on the 
civilian toll it stunned the world and prompted calls from some 
us politicians to reconsider aid to the el salvadoran government 
which stands at 1 million a day 
several soldiers were arrested in the case but they have not 
been brought to trial no officer has ever been convicted of human 
rights abuses in el salvador 
the un mission will be headed by an appointee of un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and will comprise as 
many agents as are necessary 
the mission will enjoy broad powers to adopt any initiative it 
deems appropriate for the promotion and defense of human rights 
said a joint communique 
it said the mission will be free to document and denounce rights 
violations conduct unrestricted interviews with all people make 
recommendations to both the government and guerrillas and publish 
its reports conclusions and recommendations 
the mission is to begin work as soon as a ceasefire is reached 
the government said the accord was a big step toward fulfilling 
requirements for a cessation of hostilities and they demanded the 
rebels modify their positions in order to meet a september target 
date for a ceasefire 
but the insurgents insist that accords on military issues 
including a purge of rights abusers from the officer corps an end 
to military impunity and drastic reduction of troop strength be 
reached prior to halting combat rebel chiefs say a september 
ceasefire may be unrealistic 
a joint communique said the military issue would receive 
priority consideration at the next round of talks scheduled 
aug 1722 in san jose

an appeals court today fined the magazine private 
eye and its editor 18100 each for publishing articles that 
prosecutors said could have affected the outcome of the notorious 
yorkshire ripper murder case 
they also alleged the articles were intended to discourage the 
defendants wife from pursuing a libel case against the satirical 
magazine 
lord justice roger parker speaking for a threejudge panel 
said i regard it as of the greatest importance that it should be 
clear that articles of this nature within a short time of trial are 
not to be tolerated 
outside court private eye editor ian hislop said im 
disappointed we will pay the fines and its a slap on the wrist 
the court of appeal panel upheld the attorney generals appeal 
against a high court ruling that favored the magazine in march 
the high court found that two february 1989 articles did not 
pose a threat to the administration of justice in the trial of 
peter sutcliffe who became known as the yorkshire ripper those 
articles claimed the defendants wife sonia sutcliffe had 
provided her husband with a false alibi and defrauded the 
department of health and social services 
they were printed while mrs sutcliffe was pursuing a libel case 
against the magazine for alleging she tried to cash in on her 
husbands notoriety by agreeing to sell her story to a newspaper 
prosecutors said that in addition to possible influencing jurors 
in the murder trial the articles were aimed at dissuading mrs 
sutcliffe from continuing the libel case 
she won a 109000 award in may 1989 in the libel action and 
also received a 181000 settlement from the magazine 
lord justice parker said he ruled out imprisoning hislop in the 
contempt matter but he said any similar conduct in the future 
would be unlikely to attract such leniency 
peter sutcliffe was jailed for life in 1981 for killing 13 women 
and attempting to kill another five mrs sutcliffe was not 
implicated in any of the crimes

the nuclear regulatory commission relaxed the 
control of lowlevel radioactive wastes despite repeated concerns 
expressed by staff advisers and the environmental protection 
agency internal documents showed today 
the documents were released by a congressional panel that is 
questioning the decision announced last month that the nrc no 
longer regulate a wide range of lowlevel radioactive materials 
from nuclear power plants laboratories and hospitals 
at a hearing before the house interior energy and environment 
subcommittee a number of congressmen expressed concern that states 
would be forced to accept radioactive wastes from other states as 
part of normal garbage destined for landfills 
states like west virginia and indiana already targets for 
outofstate garbage shipments fear they will become the dumping 
ground for radioactive wastes said rep joe rahall dwva 
im concerned where were heading in terms of nuclear 
wastes said rep philip sharp dind who said states will be 
prevented from restricting such shipments under the nrc rules 
the nrcs commissioners were expected in later testimony to 
defend the policy change as no threat to public health 
rep george miller dcalif the subcommittees chairman said 
the nrc policy has the potential to endanger the public health 
and is an open invitation to abuse by unscrupulous operators 
who want to dump radioactive materials in ordinary landfills 
under the new policy such lowlevel wastes as gloves clothing 
lab equipment and even buildings and equipment at nuclear power 
plants can be disposed of as if they were normal garbage if 
radiation doses are below a certain level 
the commission plans to consider exempting various wastes on a 
casebycase basis as requests for exemptions are submitted by 
industry under the new policy guidelines 
nrc chairman kenneth m carr has argued that the policy change 
represents a way to save lives because federal and state regulators 
will be able to spend our resources on threats that are more 
important 
but representatives from the epa a halfdozen members of 
congress and a number of state radiation control officials were 
expected to testify against the nrc action announced on june 27 
according to documents obtained by millers subcommittee the 
epa as well as key nrc staff members expressed concern repeatedly 
during the two years the new policy was being debated that too many 
wastes are being deregulated 
the nrc decision would exempt from special control wastes that 
subject individuals to radiation doses of less than 10 millirem per 
year half the level of a normal chest xray 
we believe that is too high a level of exposure for a 
blanket deregulation criteria and is not protective of the public 
health the epas office of radiation programs concluded in a 
briefing paper submitted to the subcommittee the epa made similar 
arguments to the nrc before the policy change was made 
the epa maintained that the 10 millirem cutoff for regulatory 
action could result in as many as three additional cancer deaths 
for every 10000 people exposed numerous standards established 
by the epa including those for drinking water set upper limits of 
risk at lower levels it said 
according to internal nrc memos and other documents key 
commission staff members also expressed strong reservations about 
the 10 millirem cutoff level as the new policy was debated in 1988 
and 1989 
a staff report in june 1988 urged that only wastes with 
radiation doses of 1 millirem per year be deregulated among those 
who objected to the 10 millirem cutoff was robert m bernero 
acting director of the nrcs office of nuclear material safety and 
safeguards according to the documents 
bernero in one memo to his nrc superiors expressed concern about 
the health effects to individuals who may be subject to numerous 
exposures of such wastes and the longterm effect on such materials 
on the waste stream 
but the objections from bernero and other staffers were 
overruled by senior nrc officials the documents indicated 
the epa later suggested the cutoff be set at 4 millirem per 
year but that was rejected 
in their zeal to relax the regulation of the nuclear industry 
the nrc commissioners have ignored the objections of their own 
staff experts the environmental protection agency the states and 
the public said miller 
the nuclear industry as well as the nrc commissioners have 
argued that the wastes that are at issue emit only extremely small 
doses of radiation

he wanted to set up in antigua for panamanian rebels opposed to 
gen manuel antonio noriega when plans for the school fell 
through klein said the panamanians wanted the weapons shipped to 
panama but somehow they were diverted to colombia 
in colombia accusations surfaced last year that klein was 
involved in traning assassination teams for gacha who was killed 
in a december battle with colombian police klein denied the 
accusations 
in may a jerusalem magistrates court charged klein with 
illegally exporting military expertise and material to a group in 
colombia the charge said klein made a deal with a group known as 
the farmers organization in colombia in april 1988 it made no 
mention of the drug cartel 
defense ministry officials said klein did not have permits 
required for conducting training or exporting arms

while discussions began soon after the goals were outlined mike 
cohen of the governors association said this week a consensus 
still has not been reached on many details 
theres no horrible impasse said an association official 
who requested anonymity but building a consensus on anything is 
just not an easy process these are not people who normally 
agree on a lot of things 
at stake are the goals bush set forth in his state of the union 
address in january the governors who met with the president last 
fall in an education summit gave their approval to the goals a 
month later 
besides making american students first in the world in math 
and science by the year 2000 the goals call for improving 
student competence in english history and geography increasing 
the high school graduation rate to at least 90 percent upgrading 
early childhood education improving adult literacy and freeing 
schools of violence and drugs 
the nations state school officers called on the governors and 
the president to adopt an eightstep set program of national 
strategies including enactment of a federal education goals 
bill transfer of military personnel and technology to teaching 
jobs and schools to achieve the goals 
the council of chief state school officers said in a statement 
sent to the chief executives that the governors and president have 
raised national expectations and should implement an agenda that 
would link student performance with what the nation expects them to 
know and be able to do 
the governors are leaning toward organizing the commission along 
three tiers 
they would include a policysteering group possibly made up of 
governors to oversee the student assessment process an advisory 
group of highlevel education specialists and business officials 
and a staff to carry out the advisory groups recommendations 
perhaps more contentious will be determining a way to measure 
student success in achieving the national goals 
most states test students on their general academic knowledge 
but decades of widely reported dismal results have forced educators 
to reassess the most commonly used testing and assessment methods 
even within the bush administration there is disagreement on 
the meaning of standardized test scores education secretary lauro 
cavazos released his departments annual wall chart of 
statebystate performance reports over objections from the white 
house 
thirtytwo states test elementary pupils statewide with the 
most popular tests being the california achievement test the 
stanford achievement test the metropolitan achievement test the 
science research associates test the comprehensive test of basic 
skills and the iowa test of basic skills 
the other 18 states allow local officials to pick the tests 
given to students in their district 
the national council of teachers of english has said repeatedly 
that standardized testing distorts and debases the language arts 
curriculum many people wrongly conclude that high scores on 
multiplechoice tests are proof of students ability to use the 
language effectively in life and in learning the group said 
if not standardized tests what 
several states are experimenting with innovative testing methods 
most of which have been lumped under the category 
performancebased testing such assessments can include 
teachers evaluations of students work based on collections of 
their essays poems and drawings 
michigan illinois california and connecticut have been leaders 
in this movement said lawrence rudner of the education 
departments educational resources information center 
florida has a fiveyear plan to phase out standardized tests 
the concept is that standardized multiplechoice tests are 
limited because of the breadth and depth of what they can test 
rudner said students also need to be tested on how well they work 
in groups and on their problemsolving abilities for example 
the american federation of teachers has called for phasing out 
standardized multiplechoice tests and replacing them with 
reliable valid and educationally appropriate alternatives 
aft president shanker said performancebased assessments more 
accurately depict the status of american education than 
standardized tests 
a harsh critic of all assessment methods is albuquerque nm 
physician john jacob cannell leader of friends for education a 
nonprofit citizens group 
performancebased assessment is another form of cheating 
cannell said in an interview 
he contends that 83 percent of 5143 elementary school districts 
and 73 percent of 4501 secondary districts report standardized 
achievement test scores above national norms as do 48 of the 50 
states 
in an honest test he said half the states would be below 
average instead of having all of them claim to be above and by 
being below the national average then schools would be forced to 
spend extra money and admit that they are failing 
cannell contended that many teachers and principals now coach 
students on test questions give students more than the allotted 
time to take tests and even alter answer sheets to raise scores

delta airlines will reduce its 
participation in next months pga championship joining other 
advertisers protesting the lack of black members at the host shoal 
creek country club 
meanwhile mayor richard arrington said today he expects the 
country club to add blacks as members within a year 
toyota and anheuserbusch on wednesday joined ibm in canceling 
plans to run commercials during abc and espn telecasts of the 
tournament toyota and ibm officials said they pulled the spots 
because shoal creek has no black members anheuserbusch did not 
give a reason for dropping its ads during the aug 912 tournament 
espn is broadcasting the first two days of the golf tournament 
with abc carrying the last two days 
bill berry a spokesman for delta told usa today that delta may 
have a presence in the tournament because of contractual 
obligations but that it would reduce its participation this is 
one of those embarrassments we have no control over he said 
delta is an official sponsor of the pga tour 
arrington who is black has tried to smooth over the 
controversy he has insisted that birmingham has become racially 
progressive in the past two decades 
at a news conference today he said shoal creek members have 
given me their commitment that blacks will be considered for 
membership within a few months 
he said it usually takes six months for an expedited 
membership at shoal creek based on commitments to him from a 
number of shoal creek members he said he was confident that the 
club will include blacks within the next year 
officials at shoal creek founded in 1977 and site of the 1984 
professional golfers association championship have said the club 
does not ban black members and that blacks have been guests there 
but club founder hall thompson angered many when he was quoted 
in a newspaper story as saying the club could not be pressured into 
accepting blacks he later apologized and said he was quoted out of 
context 
arrington released a letter today from thompson in which the 
founder assured the mayor that race would not be a factor in 
evaluating proposed new members 
new members must be invited to join memberships cost up to 
35000 with an additional yearly fee 
the pga said july 14 that in the future it would consider clubs 
membership policies in picking tournament sites 
the rev abraham woods who has called for picketing of the 
tournament said wednesday the club should at least set a 
timetable for actively recruiting blacks 
the planned protests could be averted if shoal creek accepted 
arrington as a member said woods president of the birmingham 
chapter of the southern christian leadership conference 
arrington who does not play golf has said he is not the 
countryclub type he is now in his third term as birminghams 
first black mayor 
mark mandel manager of sports information for abc declined to 
comment on the impact of the shoal creek developments or the 
networks view of the matter 
chris laplaca espns vice president of communications said 
our sales people have not been officially notified by the 
corporate types so theres nothing for us to say at this point

david souter met today with the chairman of 
the senate judiciary committee that will consider his supreme court 
nomination and refused to answer reporters questions about 
abortion and affirmative action 
souter spent an hour in private discussions with committee 
chairman joseph biden ddel who will preside over the 
confirmation hearings expected in september 
the quiet new hampshire jurist continued to dodge questions by 
reporters following him as he made his courtesy calls 
asked if there was any way to get him to talk about his views on 
abortion he responded in a word no 
how about affirmative action 
same word he said i like that word but he kidded a 
reporter to keep it up 
after his meeting with biden souter said i look forward to 
making my positions clear to the extent it is constitutionally 
appropriate when the hearings begin biden declined to reveal the 
contents of their discussions 
souter did write a letter on the abortion issue nine years ago 
asking the new hampshire legislature not to pass a law that would 
put judges in the position of having to decide whether minors can 
have abortions 
souter wrote the letter at the direction of his fellow state 
superior court judges and abortionrights advocates say they dont 
interpret it as an friendly or hostile to their position 
asked about the letter today souter said i think you should 
save any issue of that sort for the confirmation hearing where 
im sure that issue will be addressed 
meanwhile attorney general dick thornburgh told the national 
press club he thought souter would deflect the senates questions 
if they strayed too close to the controversial 
to try to pin down any prospective appointee on a specific 
issue or a specific case would seem to me to verge on the improper 
and certainly be unwise the attorney general said 
i think i trust to judge souters wisdom and experience to 
enable him to walk the line between giving the members of the 
senate an appropriate road map to his judicial philosophy politely 
declining to respond to questions that are case or 
issuesrelated thornburgh said 
several senators have said they would try to probe souters 
views with the understanding it was not proper to ask how hed 
vote on specific cases the nominee has not addressed many of the 
nations politically most sensitive issues during seven years as a 
state judge or while serving on the federal bench in boston since 
april 
in his chitchat wednesday with senators and the press souter 
said he might be well portrayed by a recent comment that he was a 
classic downeaster a term that normally refers to the 
private reserved style of people in the southeast part of maine 
during a visit with senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine himself a former federal judge the two men expressed 
mutual admiration for retired chief judge frank coffin of the 1st 
circuit 
souter recalled once receiving a complimentary letter from 
coffin 
i would frame it but that would be ostentatious said the 
50yearold bachelor who except for years away at college has 
lived in the same farmhouse near concord nh since he was 11 
years old 
asked by reporters for his feelings two days after bush made his 
choice souter said i really dont have any substantive feeling 
to express 
i think the best news i have is the blood is circulating to 
the brain well enough now so that im beginning to have some 
feelings he said

the bureau of engraving and printing said 
today it has mislaid a steel plate bearing benjamin franklins 
picture that was formerly used to print 100 bills 
the secret service was notified and sent two agents to 
investigate bureau spokesman ira polikoff said 
polikoff said the bureau believes the plate is still in its 
building and is working on the theory that it has gone astray 
because of a clerical error 
the plate is one of about 3200 made last year polikoff said 
it is about three feet by eight feet and weighs eight pounds 
its not something you can easily fold up and put in your 
pocket the spokesman said 
polikoff said anyone leaving the building with any package 
larger than a billfold is routinely searched he said this applies 
even to the highest level officials of the bureau 
the plate turned up missing during a monthly inventory check 
july 6 
polikoff said it had been found to be defective so was no 
longer being used in printing bills and was scheduled for 
destruction 
we believe at this point it was nothing more than a clerical 
error polikoff said 
polikoff spoke by telephone from san francisco he said that 
before he left washington tuesday the secret service sent two 
agents to investigate he said the service is routinely informed in 
such cases 
the spokesman said he did not know anything about the secret 
services investigation rich adams the secret service spokesman 
in washington dealing with the case said agents were interviewing 
employes at the printing plant and had not reached any conclusions

wednesday when an emergency light indicated the temperature of the 
ships primary coolant water had risen too high said a spokesman

as several thousand advocates for the disabled 
looked on president bush today signed an act banning 
discrimination against the nations 43 million handicapped people 
every man woman and child with a disability can now pass 
through a onceclosed door to a bright new era of equality 
independence and freedom bush said as he signed the measure in a 
ceremony on the south lawn 
the president likened the americans with disabilities act of 
1990 to the dismantling of the berlin wall as a symbol of freedom 
for a onceoppressed people it takes a sledgehammer to another 
wall he said 
the bill prohibits discrimination against the disabled in 
employment public accommodations transportation and 
telecommunications and defines as disabled anyone who has a mental 
or physical impairment limiting some major life function 
the disabilities bill like other major civil rights 
legislation includes a variety of sanctions for violators 
including those who discriminate in hiring it allows victims of 
employment discrimination to seek back pay reinstatement and 
attorneys fees however the law exempts businesses with fewer 
than 15 employees from the hiring provisions 
the measure includes new protection for aidsinfected workers 
this day belongs to you bush told the audience gathered 
outside the white house it was one of the largest billsigning 
ceremonies ever held at the white house 
about 2000 people representing groups that lobbied for the 
bill sat in wheelchairs or on folding chairs at the ceremony in 
bright sunshine with temperatures in the mid80s 
white house officials had considered moving todays ceremony 
inside and reducing its size because of the anticipated heat 
but protests from disability groups including a threat by some 
to hold a separate peoples signing ceremony outside the white 
house gates persuaded officials to go ahead with the outside 
ceremony 
we considered moving it inside because of the heat concerns 
there could be up to two hours of sitting in the hot sun but the 
disabled community said heat was no problem said white house 
spokeswoman alixe glen 
some activists had suggested that the white house notion that 
disabled people are too frail to sit out in the summer sun showed 
the very kind of bias the legislation was designed to end 
in signing the bill bush said this historic act is the 
worlds first comprehensive declaration of equality for people with 
disabilities 
he called it an historic new civil rights act 
the crowd gave one of its loudest cheers when bush said the law 
would give the disabled expanded access to transportation 
its just fantastic its a tremendously exhiliarating 
feeling said gordon anthony 35 an activist and marketing 
consultant from los angeles who uses a wheelchair employers are 
going to start reaching out to the disabled he said it may 
open doors for what i do in my future career there may be better 
opportunities 
in advance of the ceremony white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater called the bill a milestone in president bushs 
decadelong personal commitment to the rights of the disabled 
i think it affects a broader scope of people than any law 
since the 1964 civil rights act fitzwater said

president fw de klerk held 
an urgent meeting with african national congress leader nelson 
mandela today after the anc denounced the arrest of a senior 
member a source said 
the presidents office announced the meeting a day after the 
arrest of mac maharaj who is also a communist party leader police 
said maharaj was being held in connection with a plot they said 
involved communist members of the anc 
neither the presidents office nor the anc would say if the 
meeting had taken place in pretoria but a reliable source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said it had the source had no 
details about what was discussed 
de klerks office said the president wanted to meet with mandela 
because it appeared the anc does not appreciate the seriousness 
of facts brought to light by a recent police investigation into 
the alleged plot to seize power 
many members of the ancs 35member national executive committee 
are also members of the south african communist party 
a radio report said the meeting had already taken place but de 
klerks office denied that 
in recent weeks police have arrested 40 members of the anc 
under the internal security act under which maharaj is being held 
the act allows authorities to hold detainees in solitary 
confinement without legal representation and interrogate them until 
they give satisfactory answers 
maharaj had been organizing a communist party rally planned for 
sunday to mark the partys emergence as a legal political group 
after years as an underground movement 
the party headed by joe slovo was legalized by the 
whiteminority government in february for years the government 
had portrayed it as a terrorist organization operating under soviet 
control 
maharajs arrest was a concerted attempt to disrupt our 
rally party spokesman jeremy cronin told a news conference he 
claimed police were trying to spread fears of a conspiracy by 
communists to seize power if government talks with the anc failed 
theres no red plot whatsoever he said 
before the de klerkmandela meeting was announced cronin said 
andela would attend the planned rally in the black township of 
soweto outside johannesburg and make a major statement about the 
ancs relationship with the communist party he gave no details 
mandela said earlier the opposition group would go ahead with 
talks aug 6 with the government despite the arrest the anc which 
condemned maharahs arrest and the government are trying to clear 
the way for talks on ending whiteminority rule and extending 
political rights to the black majority 
anc leaders have said the arrest of maharaj and other communist 
members of the anc will be discussed with the government at the 
aug 6 talks the talks are aimed at clearing away obstacles to a 
ceasefire and proceed with formal negotiations to end white 
minority rule 
after postponing talks once because of police action anc 
leaders said they would continue to object to such activity but 
would not allow anything to interfere with progress toward an end 
to apartheid 
one of the obstacles to negotiation the anc has said is the 
existence of the internal security act under which maharaj and 
other anc members have been detained indefinitely for questioning 
anc leaders appear to believe that they have a better chance of 
getting their members freed and ending such arrests by 
negotiating with the government 
the government has said little about the reported arrests 
except to warn all political groups not to try to seize power and 
affirm its determination to maintain law and order 
mandela and other anc officials have refused to sever their 
organizations ties with the communist party despite domestic and 
international criticism 
communist party leaders plan a major drive for working class 
supporters in south africas main industrial centers the 
communists say they plan to be a democratic party representing 
workers and have attempted to distance themselves from the excesses 
of communist groups in eastern europe and elsewhere

a medical panel has ruled that deposed 
communist leader erich honecker is too ill to be prosecuted but 
that an 82yearold former secret police chief is fit enough to 
face criminal charges 
honecker who ruled with an iron hand before being toppled in 
last years prodemocracy revolution had been charged with 
corruption and abuse of power 
he is suffering from kidney cancer and is staying at a soviet 
military hospital outside berlin 
the government said even though allegations of abuse of office 
and corruption justify criminal prosecution of honecker the 
77yearold former leaders health is too precarious 
west germany is still pursuing murder charges against honecker 
for his part in promulgating the notorious shoottokill order 
which led to the deaths of at least 192 people trying to flee into 
west germany 
the former secret police chief erich mielke was formally 
placed under arrest today pending an investigation of charges he 
harbored terrorists and jailed critics of the former regime 
mielke the onetime chief of the nowdisbanded domestic 
intelligence network had been in a berlin hospital undergoing a 
medical evaulation to determine his competency to face the charges 
the competency decisions were based on the results of an 
independent medical panels evaluation of honecker mielke and 
several other members of the ousted communist regime said federal 
spokesman peter przybylski 
mielkes arrest brings to three the number of former communist 
officials who have now been judged competent to face investigation 
also being held is former east german labor union chief harry

the surviving crewman of a downed contra supply 
plane today tearfully recounted the dramatic last moments of a 1986 
plane crash that helped unravel details of the irancontra affair 
the testimony came from eugene hasenfus who with the family of 
copilot wallace sawyer jr is suing richard secord and miamibased 
southern air for allegedly misleading the crew and using aircraft 
without adequate safety equipment 
hasenfus his voice cracking said his c123 was flying into 
southern nicaragua on oct 5 1986 with supplies for a contra force 
pinned down by sandinistas 
he said that suddenly a sandinista rocket struck the plane 
there was a loud explosion from the right i was astounded 
the whole plane was on fire hasenfus said 
wearing a parachute hasenfus jumped through the open cargo door 
and was in a near state of shock as the aircraft spiraled to the 
ground he evaded the sandinistas overnight in the jungle but was 
captured the next day sawyer and two crewmen died in the crash 
as he testified today sawyers wife kasanee of magnolia 
ark and hasenfus wife sally watched intently with tears in 
their eyes as well 
the crash of hasenfus plane was a key revelation leading the 
reagan administration to acknowledge illegally diverting money from 
iran arms sales to the contras 
prior to recounting the crash hasenfus said he was hired 
through the southern air headquarters at miami international 
airport and understood he was working for a front company operated 
by that airline 
he said the crews complained that there was no safety equipment 
such as parachutes and that the navigation radios did not work 
properly 
hasenfus suit says southern air skimped on safety to boost 
profits in the contra supply effort 
but defense lawyers in the federal suit said in opening 
arguments wednesday that hasenfus knew the risks when he joined the 
fight against communism in central america 
secords lawyer thomas spencer said his client never met or 
made any promises to the crew and that they knew the dangers of 
supplying the contras in enemy territory 
secord a retired air force major general pleaded guilty nov 
8 1989 to lying to congressional investigators when he said he 
was unaware of any money that went to oliver norths benefit from 
the maze of companies he used in the irancontra affair he is 
serving a twoyear probation 
southern air attorney robert beckman told the sixmember jury 
wednesday that the airline was not responsible for the crew or the 
crash 
he said hasenfus and sawyer had contracted with corporate air 
services which he acknowledged worked with southern air but he 
strongly denied corporate air was merely a front for his client 
southern air was once owned by the cia and continues to do 
contract work for the government 
hasenfus lawyers say they are still calculating damages on 
wednesday they submitted some figures to secord showing actual 
damages of about 2 million for sawyers family and about 1 
million for hasenfus

as a state judge nine years ago supreme 
court nominee david souter urged new hampshires legislature not to 
adopt a law that would have put judges in the position of approving 
abortions for minors if their parents refused permission 
souter did not express a personal stand on the issue but said 
his fellow judges had decided that a measure then pending before 
the state legislature would promote shopping for judges because 
it did not include guidelines on how judges should act therefore 
he said the bill would unfairly leave such decisions up to 
individual judges with varied opinions on abortion resulting in 
inconsistent application of any such law 
asked about the letter in washington today souter said i 
think you should save any issue of that sort for the 
conbfirmation hearing where im sure that issue will be addressed 
new hampshire abortion rights activist peg dobbie said wednesday 
souters letter was critical to efforts to kill the legislation 
she added but while it helped us you cant read into it 
anything about how he might feel personally about abortion an 
issue likely to dominate souters senate confirmation hearings 
the letter drew silence from righttolife groups who had no 
immediate reaction 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we 
have no reaction to it one way or the other 
dawn johnsen legal director for the national abortion rights 
action league in washington said the letter was reason for the 
senate to probe souters views on constitutional issues surrounding 
abortion during its hearings but she said naral did not view the 
letter as revealing souters inclinations on the central abortion 
issue 
i think it is not very illuminating on judge souters position 
on the constitutional right to privacy including the right to 
choose johnsen said 
she said it suggests that judge souter might vote with 
conservatives on the court to allow a law that mandated parental 
consent without any escape valve for teenagers who are victims of 
child abuse and family violence and thus are unable to discuss 
an abortion with their parents 
i dont see much reason for encouragement johnsen said 
at best its neutral its a complicated letter on just the 
judicial bypass there are people who are looking for the 
silver lining but i dont think this is it 
the 1981 letter written to the chairwoman of the legislative 
committee considering a parental consent bill is one of souters 
few public actions addressing the abortion issue 
in his one abortionrelated decision on the issue as a judge 
souter gave little insight as to how he might vote if confirmed and 
confronted with the opportunity to overturn the 1973 roe vs wade 
decision legalizing abortion 
in 1986 souter sided with the majority in a ruling that said 
physicians have a responsibility to test unborn children for birth 
defects and in the event defects are detected to counsel the 
pregnant woman about options including abortion 
a month after the roe vs wade decision souter was among the 
concord hospital board members at a meeting at which the board 
approved allowing abortions at the hospital 
two board members contacted wednesday dean williamson and 
marily wilson said they recalled only noncontroversial discussion 
and a unanimous voice vote in favor of allowing abortions neither 
recalled souter speaking during the discussion 
this was a medical procedure vote not a social issues vote 
ms wilson said it was not over the rights or wrongs of abortion 
but rather about our responsibility as a medical facility in light 
of the law 
in his 1981 letter on behalf of fellow superior court justices 
souter said the bill before the legislature failed to provide 
guidelines for the judges to use in deciding whether to allow 
minors to receive abortions if they did not have parental consent 
abortionrights advocates said there was nothing in the letter 
to shed light on souters personal views on abortion 
i cant for a minute say that this indicates he is opposed to 
restrictions on abortion its too vague to make any interpretation 
at all said peg dobbie of the new hampshire chapter of the 
national abortion rights action league 
i wish we could say that you could interpret this that way 
but you could just as easily say that he favors a parental consent 
law but just doesnt think the court or the judges should be 
involved 
indeed other superior court judges since souter was elevated to 
the state supreme court have sent virtually identical letters to 
the legislature during debate of other parentalconsent bills over 
the past decade all of which have been defeated 
the us supreme court has ruled that parentalconsent laws must 
contain an option permitting a judge to decide if the minor seeking 
an abortion does not want to consult her parents 
souters twopage letter said the court was not taking a 
position on whether the legislature should require parental consent 
the judges objected that in passing the bill legislators would 
be endorsing as the will of society to leave it to individual 
justices of this court to make fundamental moral decisions about 
the interests of other people without any standards to guide the 
individual judge 
without clear guidelines souter wrote there would be left 
only the individual judges principles and predilections and he 
said as carefully considered as these might be there would still 
be those of only one individual not those of society 
souder noted that the judiciary often is criticized for imposing 
its views on the society at large and said the pending parental 
consent law would force an individual justice to impose his or her 
individual view 
as you would expect there are some judges who believe 
abortion under the circumstances contemplated by the bill is 
morally wrong who could not in conscience issue an order requiring 
an abortion to be performed souter wrote without giving his own 
view 
there are others who believe that what may be thought to be in 
the best interests of the pregnant minor is itself just as 
necessarily a moral as a social question upon which a judge may not 
morally speak for another human being whatever may be that judges 
own personal opinion about the morality of abortion 
such internal conflict would lead to shopping for judges who 
would entertain such cases souter wrote 
several legislators reached late wednesday said the current 
chief judge on the superior court richard dunfey circulated a 
virtually identical letter to lawmakers last year when they were 
considering a similar measure 
when souter served as new hampshire attorney general he 
supported obscenity indictments against penthouse magazine and a 
drug store that sold its july 1976 bisextennial issue 
souters office did not bring the initial charges but 
represented a county prosecutor before the new hampshire supreme 
court 12 years ago when the defendants sought to have the 
indictments dismissed the high court refused to dismiss the 
indictments but it did declare unconstitutional a portion of the 
state laws definition of sexual conduct 
the case was among dozens souters office argued before the 
state court while he was attorney general in 197778 collectively 
they show he supported positions much like the tough lawandorder 
approach he later took as a state judge

president vaclav havel of 
czechoslovakia today warned of the dangers of lying about the past 
in comments indirectly critical of president kurt waldheim his 
host during a controversial visit to the city 
havel and the west german president richard von weizsaecker 
met briefly with waldheim as the salzburg festival of music and 
drama opened most western leaders have shunned waldheim for 
concealing his nazi past and the presidents visit angered jewish 
groups 
both leaders repeatedly emphasized the visits were private not 
official no private meetings with waldheim were planned 
havel weizsaecker and waldheim attended a lunch given by 
salzburg governor hans katschthaler the official host before 
havel and weizsaecker left for home 
american rabbi avi weiss was arrested with an associate inside 
the festival hall after they forced their way into the lobby 
shouting its a shame to meet waldheim 
weiss and three other activists also protested wednesday outside 
weizsaeckers sprawling west berlin palace wearing concentration 
camp uniforms 
havels comments in the opening ceremony were made in the 
context of changes in eastern europe over the past year that 
instituted democracy while he never mentioned waldheims name 
some of the language appeared clearly directed at the austrian 
president who sat stonefaced in the first row 
the expectation that one can negotiate his way through history 
without punishment and be able to rewrite his own biography is part 
of the traditional madness of middle europe said havel 
whoever tries to do this hurts himself and his fellow citizens 
waldheim a former un secretarygeneral drew international 
criticism for concealing his service as an intelligence officer 
with a nazi army unit implicated in atrocities in yugoslavia and 
greece during world war ii he has denied wrongdoing 
since his election in 1986 waldheim has been shunned by most 
western nations including the united states 
this month cypriot president georgios vassiliou became the 
first western head of state to make an official visit to austria 
since waldheims election pope john paul ii met with waldheim in 
1987 
heinz galinski head of the german jewish council said last 
week he was shocked over weizsaeckers meeting with waldheim 
weiss in a statement tuesday condemned both waldheim and 
weizsaecker we view the meeting of havel and weizsaecker with 
waldheim as obscene and we will be raising a voice of moral 
conscience against waldheim who is an unrepentant nazi the 
rabbi said 
we especially are outraged that at a time of german 
reunification the president of west germany is meeting with 
waldheim the only way germany can move forward is to reject people 
like waldheim weiss said 
i am attending a cultural event as a private person havel 
said in an interview published wednesday by the salzburger 
nachrichten newspaper 
however at the time of the visit i am also president that 
is something one cannot discard that is to say something official 
remains attached to any of my visits 
while havel criticized western leaders for continuing to steer 
clear of waldheim he made it plain he was unlikely to make a state 
visit to austria as long as waldheim is president waldheims term 
is to expire in 1992 
the czechoslovak state news agency ctk carried a statement today 
by havels office saying the former dissident accepted the 
invitation to the festival last year when it appeared unlikely the 
thenruling communists would let him go

postmaster general anthony frank endorsed 
legislation thursday to require childproof packaging of mailed 
medicine samples saying it could head off a disaster before it 
happens 
the bill was inspired by an incident last march in saline 
mich in which a group of children ages 3 to 8 obtained sample 
packages of tylenol gelcaps from an open mailbox area in an 
apartment complex the postal service typically places mailed 
samples in open racks or on tables in the mail area of apartment 
buildings when the packages dont fit in mailboxes 
the children pretending the gelcaps were cocaine were crushing 
them and apparently intended to inhale the powder but an adult saw 
what was happening confiscated the medicine and notified police 
frank said he had received no reports of children actually 
ingesting directmail medicine samples 
we all have it in our power to head off a disaster before it 
happens and what a great feeling that is for a change he told 
the house subcommittee on postal operations and services we 
stand foursquare behind the bill 
no opposition surfaced during the subcommittee hearing voicing 
support for the bill were donnelley marketing the company that 
handled the tylenol mailing the direct marketing association the 
third class mail association and two agencies of the us postal 
service 
the bill would require that pharmaceutical and hazardous 
household product samples sent through the mail be packaged in 
childproof containers the postal service would refuse to deliver 
samples not meeting the standard 
james douglas director of the saline department of public 
safety said about 110 sample packages of tylenol gelcaps were 
taken from the children 
the university of michigans poison control center later told 
police that as few as six of the gelcaps could cause serious or 
even fatal liver disease in a 40pound child that is the typical 
weight of children ages 3 to 5 douglas said 
an overdose of aspirin and similar drugs would not cause any 
readily observable symptoms such as vomiting or unconsciousness he 
said poison control officials told him the only way to determine 
whether a lethal dosage had been consumed is to conduct a blood 
screening within six hours of the time the drug was ingested 
douglas said 
this truly is a situation where a tightening of rules and 
regulations could prevent a threat to public safety said rep 
william ford dmich a cosponsor of the bill 
donnelly marketing already has adopted a policy requiring 
childproof packaging of medicine samples it distributes senior 
vice president ellen m farley said 
while supporting the legislation she said its effective date 
oct 1 or 60 days after its enactment whichever is later might 
not give manufacturers enough time to comply an additional six 
months should be allowed ms farley said

in their publicity material for the movie presumed innocent 
warner bros asks reviewers not to reveal the ending or say whether 
rusty sabich harrison ford is innocent or guilty 
its an interesting request considering that the 1987 scott 
turow bestselling novel sold more than 1 million in hardback and 
millions more in paperback needless to say a lot of people know 
rustys fate 
but nothing that happens at the beginning of the alan j pakula 
courtroom thriller or even as it unravels sets up the end the 
movie is plump with twists turns and blind alleys who can be 
trusted who is innocent who is guilty 
the novel is set in mythical kindle county in an unidentified 
midwest city with chicagostyle politics and corruption the movie 
was shot in detroit 
rusty a married topflight prosecutor is assigned to 
investigate the murder of another prosecutor caroline polhemus 
greta scacchi with whom he had been sexually involved polhemus 
was found bludgeoned to death and tied up in what appeared to be an 
act of sexual bondage 
but a glass containing a little beer and rustys fingerprint is 
left in plain view making it real easy for police to point a 
finger a telephone check also finds numerous calls made from 
carolines number to rustys number and vice versa including a 
call made the day of the murder 
rusty wasnt the only man bedding caroline his boss raymond 
horgan the chief prosecuting attorney also was intimate with 
polhemus horgan is in the midst of a bitter campaign for his seat 
against the smarmy nico della guardia horgan brian dennehy loses 
the election and serves up rusty on a platter once he discovers 
rustys relationship to caroline to his former foe 
rusty hires the best defense lawyer around the scholarly and 
elegant sandy stern raul julia and the game is afoot 
woven into the courtroom suspense is a thread of corruption that 
goes back to polhemus days as a probation officer and somehow 
involves della guardias sidekick a moldy little prosecutor named 
tommy molto joe grifasi 
the strength of presumed innocent is its rich gallery of 
welldeveloped characters its weakness is perhaps in execution of 
the final plot turn the book crafts duplicity and surprises far 
better than the almost labored denouement presented on film and a 
key clue one the camera sweeps by in a flash and pivotal to 
knowing who the murderer is never really blossoms 
caroline polhemus is a nasty piece of work disliked by men 
because shes aggressive and beats them at their own game she 
volunteers to tackle sex crimes cases usually relegated to the 
worst lawyers in the department because theyre a nowin situation 
however it is unfortunate that the author and now the 
filmmakers seem to think that the only way a smart woman can 
succeed professionally is by sleeping her way to the top 
polhemus is sexually attracted to rusty because he represents 
power in her office and is just a step away from the no 1 spot a 
spot she covets but why is rusty drawn to her there is no 
chemistry or sexual tension between them but he falls into her 
arms after a tough child abuse trial like a lovesick puppy 
ford plays rusty straight almost too straight he loves his 
wife we surmise and is happily married we suppose or is he 
bored by a wife who whines about being a housewife and mother 
he admits he does not love caroline but shes gotten into his 
blood or perhaps just the passion and lust have theirs is a 
purely sexual bond still his motive for engaging in a 
professionally and personally dangerous affair is fuzzy 
scacchi a european beauty is seductive and hungry as caroline 
she can be an ice queen but has a gentler side as when she coaxes 
an abused child into testifying against his mother 
as rustys wife barbara bonnie bedelia radiates compassion 
frustration love and fear it is one her strongest performances 
julia puts in a good turn as sandy stern and paul winfield adds 
charm and humor to courtroom prancing as the trial judge larren 
lyttle theres also good support from brian dennehy as raymond 
horgan and john spencer as the hardworking detective whose loyalty 
and sense of duty figure importantly in the end 
pakula all the presidents men sophies choice takes 
his time unraveling the story from the screenplay written by 
himself and frank pierson dog day afternoon he plays for 
reactions underlying motives the quirky human element 
and here he has a great similarity to otto premingers handling 
of courtroom suspense in 1959s anatomy of a murder with james 
stewart but missing is the hardedged tension billy wilder 
sculpted in 1957s witness for the prosecution 
both are gripping dramas both rely on the element of surprise 
to make a compelling film and both are among the best courtroom 
dramas ever made now presumed innocent has joined the ranks 
presumed innocent is a mirage production produced by sydney 
pollack and mark rosenberg with susan solt as executive producer 
it is rated r for strong sexual content and unpleasant shots of the 
murdered victim

on the ground after she was booed at a san diego padres game for a 
shrill rendition of the national anthem in front of 30000 baseball 
fans 
the comedian and star of abcs roseanne appeared to struggle 
wednesday night with an echo from the sound system as she sang 
between games of a doubleheader with the cincinnati reds said ron 
seaver the padres promotions director 
barr plugged her ears with her fingers at the start of the song 
then sang in a shrill voice after the boos began barr reached 
toward her crotch and spit on the ground 
barrs husband tom arnold later made a ceremonial pitch with 
no reaction but barr got more boos as she waved to the crowd and 
left with him 
the padres understand that many people were concerned about 
roseanne barrs rendition of the national anthem seaver said 
she was doing the best she could under the circumstances of the 
audio delay and she certainly meant no disrespect to the national 
anthem 
barr said she was pleased with her performance 
i think i did great and people wanted more she told a 
reporter for kfmbtv before leaving the field asked about the 
boos she said yeah well just because they werent up front

and gesture afterward

field i cant believe it happened its an insult there are 
people who died for that song 
i thought it was a disgrace padres outfielder tony gwynn 
said when they said she was going to sing the national anthem i 
thought something like this was going to happen 
tom werner who become the chairman and managing partner of the 
padres this season and also is cocreator and executive producer of

banner he would not comment after barrs performance

an fbi agent testified today that he thought 
the jan 18 undercover sting operation against marion barry had 
failed until the mayor unexpectedly asked for crack cocaine 
lawyer r kenneth mundy called agent ronald stern to the witness 
stand in an attempt to show that the fbi entrapped the mayor the 
defense was nearing the end of its case and mundy said it was 
unlikely barry would testify 
agent ronald stern said at barrys cocaine and perjury trial 
that an undercover agent carrying crack cocaine left a hotel room 
where barry had gone to meet exmodel rasheeda moore barry had 
said initially he didnt want the crack 
there was no longer any drugs in the room stern said as 
far as we were concerned the operation was over 
stern who was monitoring the sting from a nearby room at the 
hotel said barry then told ms moore to call the undercover agent 
back 
on the fbi videotape of the sting shown earlier at the trial 
barry tells ms moore got get some go get it she calls the 
undercover agent back to the room to retrieve the crack 
the important thing here is what mr barry was thinking 
stern testified he believed that the undercover agent was an 
opportunity for drugs 
the fbi and police rented eight hotel rooms for the sting and 
provided the drugs used in the operation stern said 
earlier barrys lawyers suggested that prosecutors had 
intimidated witnesses into testifying falsely against the mayor 
mundy played for the jury a feb 28 news broadcast of us 
attorney jay stephens exhorting witnesses to come forward and 
cooperate in the criminal investigation of barry 
stephens made the statement the day that barry pleaded innocent 
to cocaine possession and charges 
the time is now to come in stephens said in the broadcast 
the alternative of course is prosecution 
government witness lloyd moore testified that the broadcast was 
a factor in his decision to begin cooperating with government 
investigators 
moore testified that he saw barry use drugs about 10 times 
you testified truthfully assistant us attorney richard 
roberts asked moore on crossexamination 
yes replied moore who is an attorney 
there is nothing unusual about seeking the assistance of 
witnesses in solving crimes asked roberts 
they do it every day replied moore 
on wednesday a virgin islands couple testified that the fbi had 
badgered them about their repeated statements that they never saw 
barry use drugs on a 1986 sailboat ride 
carmen benjamin said she was interviewed three times by agents 
the final time late last year when she and her husband were 
summoned to fbi headquarters in washington 
she testified that she felt so pressured and harassed 
that she pounded her hand on the table she said she demanded that 
the interogation end but that agents continued to question her 
mrs benjamin said she was snorkeling while the sailboat was 
anchored in the virgin islands and didnt pay much attention to 
barry and ms moore 
the mayor is accused of 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession one misdemeanor conspiracy charge and three felony 
counts of lying to the grand jury 
convicted drug dealer charles lewis testified earlier that he 
and barry smoked marijuana aboard the sailboat on which the 
benjamins were passengers 
did the fbi and a city police detective attempt to pressure 
you to change your story robert mance one of barrys lawyers 
asked albert benjamin 
yes benjamin replied

police on bicycles zigzag through 
jungle tracks dodging land mines in a deadly game with teenage 
tamil rebels 
it is the bicycle brigade against the baby brigade as 
police call the young militants of the tamil tiger militia some 
are as young as 12 and their most successful weapons are homemade 
mines that have blown the legs off dozens of commandos since 
fighting resumed last month 
as a result officers of the special task force police trained 
to fight the tamils formed the bicycle brigade 
the bicycle tire has more chances of avoiding the buried 
explosive than a boot the damage causes less injuries as the blast 
is cushioned by the bicycle said senior commando upali sahabandu 
of the special task force 
the mines which consist of high explosives packed into wooden 
boxes with two small aa batteries have been dubbed johnnies dice 
or batta by the sri lankan troops they are hidden in culverts 
under the jungle roads of tirukovil which was once a tamil 
stronghold 
the government claims its troops now control a 33mile stretch 
of the eastern coast between lahugala south of tirukovil and 
kalmunai to its north 
special task force chief lionel karunasena said his unit of 125 
men has mastered the art of anticipating rebel moves 
the rebels operate in groups of five to seven to minimize 
losses we do the same we know their game they know ours so we 
are even karunasena told a group of visiting reporters 
that is why they avoid tangling with our bicycle brigade or 
hit us with mines on these roads he said 
his unit is part of the 2500member special task force trained 
to help in the war against militant tamils fighting for an 
independent homeland 
commandos moved into the town and set up camp in its main 
hospital this month forcing the oncedominant tamils to slip into 
the jungles 
people in the town 135 miles east of colombo say that although 
the troops control the area during the day the rebels return from 
the jungles to prowl at night 
a dogs bark in the dark is a sure sign the tiger rebels are 
around nobody else moves out at night said the rev thaya 
seelan a tamil methodist priest 
the commandos say their taking of tirukovil which has ample 
jungle cover to the west and the indian ocean to the right dealt a 
severe blow to guerrilla operations 
tirukovil is vitally located for jungle based hitandrun 
attacks without tirukovil as a base it will be difficult for 
the terrorists to launch any campaign to clear government forces in 
the eastern coast said sahabandu the veteran antiguerrilla 
fighter 
karunasena said he plans to first secure our hold here then 
move toward rebel strongholds in the eastern districts of ampara 
and batticaloa 
the tamil tigers have been fighting since 1983 to set up a 
homeland in the north and the east complaining of discrimination 
by the majority sinhalese 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
the sinhalese account for 75 percent

sixtysix senators of both parties called 
thursday for president bush to make further changes in us policy 
toward cambodia including permitting development aid and direct 
talks with the communist government in phnom penh 
the senators nearly twothirds of the senate also challenged 
administration assertions that there is no consistent military 
coordination between the two noncommunist factions fighting the 
cambodian government and the feared khmer rouge rebels with whom 
they are allied 
those signing the letter led by senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine and sen john danforth rmo spanned the 
political spectrum in the chamber their move reflected growing 
congressional fears of a khmer rouge military victory 
inadvertently abetted by the united states 
the group included 13 republicans and 53 democrats 
on july 18 about a week after the original letter to bush began 
circulating in the senate secretary of state james a baker iii 
announced that the united states was withdrawing its support for a 
un seat for the rebel coalition 
baker also said the united states would open a limited dialogue 
with the government of vietnam which installed hun sen in power 
before withdrawing its troops last year and he said limited us 
humanitarian aid could begin flowing to cambodia which is the 
subject of a 15yearold us embargo 
in the letter sent to bush on wednesday the senators welcomed 
those moves but said additional steps would be necessary to 
demonstrate that keeping the khmer rouge from retaking power is 
the highest aim of us policy 
the khmer rouge were responsible for the deaths of more than a 
million cambodians during their 3year rule in the late 1970s as 
they sought to force their vision of a communist agrarian state on 
the country people executed or died of starvation and disease 
the senators called for three additional steps 
pressing the government of china which us intelligence 
estimates provides 100 million a year in military aid to the khmer 
rouge to end its support for the communist rebels 
opening direct contacts with the hun sen government in phnom 
penh aimed at arranging free and fair elections supervised by the 
united nations 
permitting us development aid to flow to cambodia to 
strengthen and redirect its beleaguered economy 
in addition the group called for closer scrutiny of the 7 
million in overt nonlethal aid and the estimated 13 million in 
covert military aid which the united states now sends each year to 
the rebel coalition 
the letter emphasized that us law bars any aid which has the 
effect of promoting sustaining or augmenting directly or 
indirectly the capacity of the khmer rouge to conduct military 
operations 
it did not call directly for an aid cutoff but asked the 
administration to thoroughly investigate reports of military 
cooperation between the noncommunist rebels and the khmer rouge 
to ensure that there is no tactical or strategic cooperation 
the senate intelligence committee voted june 28 to cut off the 
covert aid program 
the central intelligence agency and defense intelligence agency 
in briefings for interested officials have described how the three 
allied rebel groups share supply lines which are controlled by the 
khmer rouge and coordinate their antigovernment attacks 
deep inside cambodia the lines between the separate fighting 
forces are blurred the intelligence reports say and the rebel 
group of prince norodom sihanouk backed by the united states 
serves as a political front to bring respectability to the khmer 
rouge 
the khmer rouge are marching again and from the reports i 
have received they are marching together with the forces of prince 
sihanouk sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign 
relations committee said in a floor speech 
the letter concluded we believe that after 20 years of 
turmoil and tragedy the people of cambodia deserve an opportunity 
to determine their own future free of fear of the khmer rouge

a juror today was removed from deliberations 
for a huge moneylaundering trial after reports that a member of 
the jury apparently telephoned members of a colombian drug ring for 
more information 
us district judge william terrell hodges held a closed hearing 
today on whether to declare a mistrial few details were available 
because of a gag order in effect for lawyers and their clients for 
the duration of the trial 
but court clerk john gay said the original panel of 12 is down 
to eleven alternate jurors were dismissed after testimony ended 
and deliberations can continue with eleven jurors when both sides 
agree there was no immediate indication if any action was taken 
against the dismissed juror 
gay said transcripts of todays hearing and two meetings 
wednesday will be made public when they are transcribed but that 
could take several days 
attorneys learned wednesday that one of the 12 jurors undertook 
some independent investigation including making telephone calls to 
purported medellin drug cartel members in colombia and then shared 
information with another juror according to a report in todays 
tampa tribune 
five employees of the luxembourgbased bank of credit and 
commerce international and a colombian airplane broker are accused 
of conspiring with an undercover us customs service agent to 
launder 14 million in proceeds from the sale of cocaine in six 
us cities 
the first public indication of trouble in the sixmonth trial 
surfaced wednesday morning when jurors were sent home shortly after 
reporting to begin their fourth day of deliberations 
the judge met privately with prosecutors and defense attorneys 
twice wednesday to discuss the situation the lawyers and court 
personnel refused to discuss the problem or divulge what occurred 
during the private meetings 
the newspaper reported that the juror who telephoned cartel 
members got the phone numbers from an address book that was 
introduced into evidence at the trial authorities took the book 
from the briefcase of one of the defendants colombian rudolf 
armbrecht when he was arrested in a miami motel in october 1988 
us attorney robert w genzman and larry curtin spokesman for 
the tampa fbi office had no comment 
jurors were specifically instructed by hodges to decide the case 
only on evidence and testimony presented during the trial and were 
told to avoid and ignore any outside information they have not 
been sequestered and have been allowed to return home throughout 
the trial 
the defendants in the case are ian howard and sibte hassan of 
bccis paris branch amjad awan and akbar a bilgrami of bccis 
miami branch syed aftab hussain who worked in panama and the 
colombian aircraft broker armbrecht 
the bankers were arrested oct 6 1988 at a fake wedding staged 
by the customs service to lure the bankers to tampa they were 
taken into custody after being separated from their families under 
the pretext of attending a bachelors party 
two bcci subsidiaries pleaded guilty in january to the 
moneylaundering charges and forfeited 15 million to the 
government more than triple the previous largest penalty ever 
assessed against a bank

the killer bees poised to invade the 
united states from mexico are beginning to worry officials in 
states as far away as maine and hawaii 
state agriculture inspectors from 32 states turned out for a 
fourday africanized bee conference which opened wednesday in 
weslaco about 10 miles from the mexican border 
some said they expect their states eventually to be infested 
either by the bees migrating naturally or being transported as 
stowaways on ships or truck trailers 
with modern transportation its conceivable that a swarm 
could stow away on a ship and establish itself in hawaii said 
kenneth teramoto chief of biological control of plant pests with 
the state of hawaiis department of agriculture well find out 
what texas and some of the other states are going to do about the 
africanized honey bee and well set up a state plan 
robert mitchell state apiarist for the delaware department of 
agriculture said he came to weslaco to learn more about the texas 
africanized honey bee management plan he said his state is 
preparing for the eventual arrival of the aggressive bees either by 
ship or truck 
other states represented at the conference included those as 
distant as washington and vermont 
theyre all concerned that they need to be speaking with a 
coordinated voice and a coordinated approach to dealing with the 
spread of the africanized bee in the united states said anita 
collins head researcher with the us department of agricultures 
honey bee research lab at weslaco 
the main concern is we dont want to harm the beekeeping 
industries in those states because they are our first line of 
defense in fighting the africanized bees she said 
twentytwo swarms of africanized bees have been found and 
destroyed since 1979 at us ports aboard ships from latin america 
the most recent swarm was found at the port of houston earlier this 
month in the hold of a ship from mexico 
the hardtomanage bees eventually are expected to cost us 
beekeepers as much as 58 million per year according to the usda 
expected drops in beepollinated crop production could cost us 
farmers as much as 40 million per year 
most attending the symposium cosponsored by the national 
association of state departments of agriculture and texas aampm 
university are involved in regulating honey bees in their states 
the texas africanized bee management plan includes the 
establishment of a 100mile quarantine zone at the southern tip of 
the state and the sampling of all bee colonies within two miles of 
a confirmed africanized find any africanized bees will be 
destroyed 
but the state has not provided the estimated 800000 needed to 
fund the plan in its first year said john thomas a texas aampm 
extension entomologist 
he said the bees have been wrongly branded as killers although 
about 600 deaths have been attributed to them mostly in south 
america their sting is no worse than that of regular bees but 
they tend to attack by the hundreds if they sense a threat to the 
colony 
people are going to have to be much more alert thomas said 
its like if we had only garden snakes in the rio grande valley 
and then we introduced rattlesnakes 
beekeepers are also worried about the africanized bees because 
they are harder to control and less productive than domestic honey 
bees 
africanized bees are the hybrid offspring of a swarm of african 
bees that escaped from a research project in brazil in 1957 they 
have expanded their range through latin america since then 
scientists previously had expected them to cross into southern 
texas by now but none has been found closer to the border since 
november possibly because a harsh winter and prolonged drought 
reduced the food supply needed for migration

the nations communist party 
chairman defended himself and his party thursday before irate 
voters who demanded to know the truth behind purges and coverups 
over seven decades of authoritarian rule 
i didnt repress anybody the whitehaired dignified 
gombojavyn ochirbat told about 200 people from ulan bators 12th 
election district where he is running for a seat in the national 
legislature 
the contest has become the most dramatic one in the first 
multiparty elections ever held in this longisolated sovietbloc 
nation 
it pits the 61yearold ochirbat a longtime party official who 
stresses moderation against a 29yearold lawyer with no political 
experience who favors bold moves toward democracy and economic 
privatization 
on sunday the districts approximately 5000 voters will decide 
whether ochirbat arguably the most powerful man in mongolia by 
virtue of his party post should also sit in the 430seat 
legislature the great peoples hural 
the communist party in mongolia is already going down not 
just the organization but the theory of communism said 
ochirbats opponent ganbold of the recently formed party of 
national progress i decided it would be appropriate not to allow 
the head of the communist party to be a deputy 
ochirbat became party chief in march when street protests 
inspired by eastern europes anticommunist revolution forced 
mongolias top communists to resign he has overseen the countrys 
first tentative steps toward democracy but insists it should 
remain socialist 
on thursday he shared a podium with ganbold as district 12 held 
a freewheeling meetthecandidates night that would have been 
unheard of not long ago 
residents of the impoverished shanty district on ulan bators 
western fringe eagerly called out questions about past purges a 
recent scandal involving a public prosecutor rumored price 
increases and restrictions on emigration 
in the past the communist party made many mistakes 
ochirbat said speaking calmly but firmly but we shouldnt just 
accuse the party of mistakes it also has done good things 
my father also was repressed he added in 1932 he was 
arrested with a couple of friends i know history quite well but 
we should understand the situation of that time 
ganbolds party of national progress has said it is running in 
part against ochirbats record as a ranking official of the past 
stalinist regime he was in charge of party ideology during the 
1960s when a group of intellectuals were purged but ochirbat said 
he was not involved 
speaking about another 1960s purge of two party officials 
accused of being prochinese he said everybody believed they 
were enemies of the people i was young then i believed it too 
but now according to the archival materials we can certainly say 
this was a fabricated case 
afterward local residents said the contest would be close 
its very democratic said dorj rolling a cigarette outside 
the tiny meeting hall i think ill vote for the communists but 
i also support the democrats because they put forward the most 
interesting proposals 
most of the opposition parties have joined in what is called a 
democratic coalition to back key candidates such as ganbold 
in sundays primary ochirbat led with more than 2500 votes to 
ganbolds more than 1300 according to partial official figures 
but opposition candidates altogether won nearly as much as ochirbat 
showing that he is not invincible with just the two competing in 
the second round ganbolds party believes he has a chance 
most young people support ganbold said a local backer 
turtoghokh 
ganbold began campaigning doortodoor wednesday a bit late 
he admitted but in an interview wednesday night he said he was 
warmly received 
one of my fears that older people would be against me 
disappeared today as i met a lot of older people who said they 
were willing to back me he said 
ganbold a juniorlevel officer in the ministry of law and 
jurisdiction said he knew hard times as a child as his mother 
struggled to raise five children by herself he said he can relate 
to the problems of district 12s residents 
the district has no kindergarten no schools ganbold said 
to go shopping they have to go two bus stops even the 
electricity stops sometimes there is no telephone 
the lesson he said is that communism doesnt work communism 
is a foreign idea to mongolia that is why a lot of communist party 
members do not back it ideologically they just belong 
but while meeting the voters he softpedaled his ideological 
attacks and kept his promises moderate 
if elected i will try to solve at least one of the smallest 
things ive promised he said

in the first case of its kind federal 
researchers reported thursday that a woman apparently got aids from 
her dentist during a tooth pulling even though he was wearing 
gloves and a mask 
the case has prompted the government to review its guidelines 
for aids prevention during medical procedures even though the 
possibility of another source of infection cannot be entirely 
excluded the federal centers for disease control said 
it said all evidence was consistent with the patient being 
infected during her trip to the dentist 
the dentist who had been diagnosed three months earlier was 
wearing protective gloves and a mask as recommended while 
extracting two molars for the patient who was visiting him for the 
first time 
we dont know exactly what happened during that procedure 
said dr harold jaffe deputy director for science in the cdcs 
hivaids program we have to assume there was some kind of an 
accident that exposed the patient to the dentists blood 
but there was no indication of that the patient didnt remember 
the dentist having any cuts the dentist didnt recall any 
accidents such as sticking himself with the anesthetic needle 
and dental records indicated the procedure should have been 
uncomplicated the cdc said 
officials of the american dental association said the cdc may 
have jumped to conclusions 
were not happy about it said dr enid neidle director of 
scientific affairs for the chicagobased ada we think it is not 
a totally conclusive case of transmission we are not happy at 
any report that could raise fears on the part of the public that 
the dental office is a place of danger and infection 
cdc officials stressed that there is no reason to believe the 
virus was transmitted just because a dentist with aids came close 
to a patient we are not suggesting some unique previously 
undescribed kind of transmission jaffe said and were 
certainly not suggesting to people they should be afraid to go to 
their doctors and dentists 
the case has prompted the government to review its 
recommendations for aids prevention in medical settings we will 
be looking at the guidelines to see if they need to be modified to 
decrease the chance this might happen again jaffe said 
aids activists worried that the report would spawn new fears 
about the disease 
i think thats inevitable said paul sathrum program 
director for the national association of people with aids the 
hysteria is always out there any little thing like this always 
brings it back to the surface 
this may be the type of situation that would provide 
ammunition for the forces who would love to see more restrictions 
on people with hiv i hope that doesnt happen 
two years after the womans trip to the dentist she was 
diagnosed with a rare pneumonia that strikes some aids patients 
she then tested positive for the aids virus 
a lengthy investigation found no risk factors for aids in the 
womans past such as intravenous drug abuse or numerous sex 
partners she said she had two boyfriends before her diagnosis 
both tested negative for the virus 
the cdc as is its custom did not identify the dentist or 
patient except to describe the patient as a young woman 
dna virus sequence tests performed on the dentist and the 
patient led investigators to believe their specific viruses were 
closely related with a high degree of similarity between the 
strains the cdc said 
still neidle said the ada believes too little is known about 
the details of the tooth extraction and what might have caused the 
infection including whether the patient was subsequently treated 
and whether some complications might have arisen in the placement 
or removal of stitches 
jaffe said there was no indication that the dentist failed to 
follow any guidelines for preventing aids transmission the only 
question he said would be whether or not the dentist should 
have continued in practice after being diagnosed with aids 
the most obvious guide for that he said is whether the 
person is physically or mentally able to do his or her job

the bush administration could balance the 
federal budget if it raised the taxes of americans with incomes of 
more than 200000 new york gov mario cuomo said thursday 
if you want to find wealth dont come to us and take it out 
of the pockets of children cuomo said dont come to us and 
take it out of the pockets of the people who are trying to run the 
drug programs 
cuomo made his comments at a news conference with state and 
local officials concerned that federal budget negotiators are 
considering eliminating state and local taxes as a deduction 
that the state and local officials said would constitute 
double taxation and an infringement on states rights 
earlier thursday sen robert packwood said a 10000 cap on 
state and local tax deductibility would unduly hurt the rich 
packwood the ranking republican on the senate finance 
committee said 974 percent of the losers under such a plan would 
be people with incomes over 100000 and 86 percent of the losers 
would be people with incomes over 200000 
if that isnt a tax on the wealthy i dont know what is 
packwood said 
however cuomo advocated raising federal taxes for the 
wealthiest americans 
it hurts nobody its fair to everybody and it avoids this 
kind of calamity said cuomo who has been mentioned as a 
possible contender for the 1992 democratic presidential nomination 
administration and congressional negotiators have been meeting 
for 11 weeks to try to agree on a budget package on wednesday 
most gop leaders involved in the talks backed a new white house 
proposal 
the new administration proposal would raise about 3 billion by 
limiting the deductibility of state and local income taxes on 
federal tax returns a gop bargainer said thursday such deductions 
would be limited to no more than 10000 said the negotiator who 
asked not to be identified 
gerald mcentee president of the american federation of state 
county and municipal employees said the reagan administration also 
tried to raise revenues in 1985 by ending deductibility 
and again the attack is a thinly veiled attempt to preserve 
the incredible shift of tax burden from the wealthy to the middle 
class he said its a shell game a way to pass off the 
federal deficit onto the budgets of states and localities 
william j althaus the republican mayor of york pa said 
its stupid its unfair and it suffers from what i can only call 
incomplete candor on the part of the government 
democratic mayor david n dinkins said he recently balanced new 
york citys budget by raising local taxes 
one of the reasons we did so is because of the deductibility 
of those taxes he said

the senate has approved a 20 million research 
and prevention program to keep zebra mussels from invading farm 
irrigation systems 
the striped mollusk which is not native to north america has 
caused problems at water and power plants throughout the great 
lakes they attach to water intake pipes and clog them 
an amendment authorizing the 20 million over five years was 
added to the 1990 farm bill by sen daniel p moynihan dny 
unlike other infestations this one is irreversible 
moynihan said in a statement thursday the zebra mussel is here 
to stay within 20 years time it will have spread through the 
entire surface water system of north america 
the amendment which the senate passed late wednesday directs 
the department of agriculture and the us army corps of engineers 
to develop a program of research prevention and design criteria 
for irrigation systems with an emphasis on keeping the mussels out 
on wednesday scientists expressed surprise that the tiny 
mollusks are spreading through the erie canal system from buffalo 
ny and now threaten rochester ny and the finger lakes region 
frankly i did not think their advance would be this fast 
said cameron lange a biologist studying the mussels movement for 
a consortium of power companies 
i thought we might find a few at lockport during our late july 
sample but i did not think theyd reach rochester by now 
rochester is about 60 miles east of lockport ny 
in may the senate committee on environment and public works 
authorized 375 million in grants and research funding for control 
of the mussel the provision is part of the pending water resources 
development act of 1990

the easing of federal controls on lowlevel 
atomic wastes poses public health concerns the environmental 
protection agency said thursday while lawmakers said the new 
policy could make some states into dumping grounds for radioactive 
garbage 
the decision last month by the nuclear regulatory commission to 
deregulate some lowlevel atomic wastes from laboratories 
hospitals and nuclear plants came under attack at a hearing by the 
house interior energy and environment subcommittee 
rep george miller dcalif the subcommittee chairman accused 
the nrc of coziness with the nuclear industry and said if the 
commission does not reverse its policy congress should protect 
states from being forced to accept such wastes in landfills 
at least two states including pennsylvania and maine already 
have enacted laws specifically prohibiting radioactive wastes in 
conventional landfills the nrc however has maintained that 
federal policy overrides state and local statutes 
under the policy announced june 27 lowlevel wastes including 
gloves clothing lab equipment dirt and even buildings and 
equipment at nuclear power plants can be disposed of as if they 
were normal garbage if radiation doses are below a certain level 
nrc chairman kenneth carr told the subcommittee that the issue 
is one of how safe is safe enough and promised that the 
public and the environment will remain properly protected 
but miller said the easing of federal requirements on such 
wastes has the potential to endanger the public health and is 
an open invitation to abuse by unscrupulous operators who want 
to dispose of radioactive materials 
some states that already are targets of outofstate garbage 
shipments fear they will become the dumping ground for 
radioactive wastes said rep joe rahall dwva he added if that 
becomes the case i fear there will be an allout rebellion in 
west virginia 
millers subcommittee released internal documents showing that 
both the epa and some nrc staff advisers have strongly opposed the 
nrc policy because they believe it covers too broad a range of 
lowlevel wastes the exemption from federal regulation would apply 
to wastes that subject individuals to radiation doses of less than 
10 millirems a year half the level of a normal chest xray 
we believe that is too high a level of exposure for a 
blanket deregulation criteria and is not protective of the public 
health the epas office of radiation programs concluded in a 
briefing paper made public by the subcommittee 
the epa estimated that the 10millirem threshold for regulatory 
action could result in as many as three additional cancer deaths 
for every 10000 people exposed 
richard guimond director of the office of radiation programs 
testified that one concern is the possible cumulative effect of the 
disposal of such wastes a single landfill for example may 
contain numerous categories of wastes each of which would be 
exempt because they individually meet the nrc cutoff for regulation 
the epa and some nrc staff members had urged that the cutoff be 
much lower guimond noted that the international atomic energy 
agency considered an individual dose of 1 millirem per year as a 
reasonable cutoff 
carr the nrc chairman said the agency would consider petitions 
for exemptions on a casebycase basis but he said a relaxation of 
controls on lowlevel wastes is needed to help return about 40 
nuclear sites under nrc jurisdiction to general use the energy 
department also has sought a clearer policy from the nrc on 
lowlevel wastes to help its cleanup of weapons plants 
no human endeavor involves a zero level of risk said carr 
the levels of radiation exposure we are talking about here while 
not zero are exceedingly small

the house today reprimanded a repentant rep 
barney frank for his official actions on behalf of a male 
prostitute lawmakers first rejected more severe punishments 
proposed by republicans 
im here to offer an apology and an explanation the 
massachusetts democrat told a hushed audience shortly before the 
40818 vote for reprimand he said he took some of the actions 
cited by the ethics committee to conceal my homosexuality 
i should have known better i do now but its a little too 
late said a subdued frank who acknowledged his homosexuality 
publicly in 1987 a year after the events that led to the house 
probe 
the vote against expulsion proposed by rep william dannemeyer 
rcalif was 39038 the vote against censure proposed by gop 
whip newt gingrich was 287141 censure would have stripped frank 
of his judiciary subcommittee chairmanship 
the reprimand which was recommended by the house ethics 
committee carries no penalty other than the vote by franks 
colleagues 
this should not be perceived as a referendum on purely private 
conduct or lifestyle said rep julian dixon dcalif chairman 
of the house ethics committee the recommendation before the 
house today i think is consistent with prior precedents 
dannemeyer said frank had knowingly permitted his apartment to 
be used as a house of prostitution charges that the massachusetts 
democrat has denied and that the house ethics committee found 
groundless 
are there standards in our society that we will affirm for 
ourselves and our children thats the issue dannemeyer said 
frank has admitted he fixed parking tickets and wrote a 
misleading memo for stephen gobie whom the lawmaker first paid for 
sex and later hired as a personal assistant using his own money 
it was the second time in two days that congress had acted to 
discipline one of its own on wednesday the senate voted 960 to 
denounce sen dave durenberger rminn for financial 
improprieties and ordered him to repay up to 123000 
like durenberger frank is popular with his fellow lawmakers 
the democratic leadership expressed confidence in advance the house 
would do no more than issue an official reprimand 
some republicans decided to make franks behavior an 
electionyear issue though 
frank is not who is on trial today said dannemeyer it is 
the house of representatives who is on trial today 
the question dannemeyer said is do we tolerate do we 
condone a member of this body who knowingly permits a house of 
prostitution to be operated out of his residence 
dixon called dannemeyers statements selective garbage 
the committees responsibility was to sort out fact from 
fiction and 12 men in this house six republicans and six 
democrats have tried to do that in this report dixon said 
during floor debate with frank looking on fromthe democratic side 
of the aisle dannemeyer insults the intelligence and the 
literacy of the members of this house who have read this report 
house speaker thomas foley members of the ethics committee 
many fellow democrats and a homosexual rights group support 
franks position that a reprimand is appropriate 
rep john myers of indiana the ranking republican on the ethics 
committee said he supported the reprimand recommendation and hoped 
the debate would not be partisan 
this is a discipline matter myers said it isnt a party 
position it isnt something that should be decided on a partisan 
basis its entirely too important for that 
the 12member ethics committee split evenly between democrats 
and republicans dismissed charges that frank was aware gobie was 
operating a prostitution ring out of franks capitol hill apartment 
in 1987 frank has said he immediately kicked gobie out of his 
apartment when he learned about the illicit business 
instead the committee cited frank for sending a misleading memo 
to a virginia prosecutor who was overseeing gobies probation on a 
sex and drug felony conviction the panel said the 1986 memo could 
be interpreted as an attempt to persuade authorities to be lenient 
toward gobie 
the committee also said frank improperly used his congressional 
authority to avoid paying 33 parking tickets some of them run up 
by gobie while on personal business 
among those lobbying on franks behalf was the human rights 
campaign fund the nations largest gay and lesbian organization 
were concerned that congressman frank is being held to a 
higher standard than any member of congress has been held to 
said gregory king a spokesman for the group

the house of commons began a 10week recess on 
thursday after a turbulent session marked by cabinet upheavals 
disputes over europe and a slump in prime minister margaret 
thatchers fortunes 
her ratings are better than they were in the early spring when 
she trailed the opposition labor party by 23 percentage points in 
the polls but her conservative party remains an average of 12 
percentage points behind labor 
inflation widely seen as the key to mrs thatchers hopes of 
winning an unprecedented fourth successive term is running at 
nearly 10 percent despite two years of steep increases in interest 
rates to curb it 
conservative party popularity has tended to decline as interest 
rates rise 
but what lay behind two dramatic resignations from her 22member 
cabinet in the past nine months was not unpopularity with the 
electorate but differences within the party over the quickening 
pace toward closer political and monetary union of the european 
community 
with the departure of two other longtime cabinet ministers for 
what they describe as family reasons mrs thatcher has had to 
reshuffle the government ranks half a dozen times since the 
parliamentary session opened in the fall 
conservative party chairman kenneth baker musing thursday over 
the chances of mrs thatcher winning again said weve a long 
way to go 
since winning power in 1979 the prime minister has led the 
party to two subsequent general election victories 
weve come through much more difficult phases than this 
baker added in a radio interview we were massively unpopular in 
1981 and we won the 83 election we were massively unpopular in 
86 and won the 87 election were not as unpopular now were 
in very good shape to win this next election 
mrs thatcher must call the next election by mid1992 but 1991 
is more likely if inflation is falling 
there is some good news for the 64yearold british leader 
there are signs that an unpopular new local government tax the 
socalled poll tax which provoked riots this spring is becoming 
less of an issue 
and the government also is pumping money into the problem with a 
54 billion special grant announced this month designed to head 
off another rise next year 
the tax averaging 690 annually for each adult has already 
pushed average household bills up by onethird and its 
introduction this spring helped send the thatcher ratings plunging 
the cabinet upheavals began in the fall chancellor of the 
exchequer nigel lawson the top treasury official quit when mrs 
thatcher refused to fire a parttime adviser who shared her 
wariness about linking the pound to other major european currencies 
this month trade secretary nicholas ridley a fellow 
rightwinger and probably her closest ally in the cabinet resigned 
after making antigerman remarks 
his assertions that european monetary union was a german 
racket to take over europe and that ceding british sovereignty 
to the european community was like surrendering to hitler caused a 
furor 
they also provided an embarrassing reminder of mrs thatchers 
often uneasy relations with the rest of the 12nation community and 
prompted speculation that despite her swift rejection of ridleys 
remarks she secretly shares his views 
she has to watch her back every politician does and her back 
is europe david owen a former labor foreign secretary and 
leader of the now defunct social democratic party told a gathering 
of us reporters recently 
meanwhile another excabinet minister and proeuropean former 
defense secretary michael heseltine is running an undeclared 
campaign for the party leadership polls show that heseltine 57 
is the favorite to succeed her 
however mrs thatcher has notably softened her stance on europe 
in the past few months seeking to avoid isolation and pressing 
with greater diplomacy her opposition to greater centralization 
she is a superb psychiatrist owen said there is only one 
card heseltine has to play and thats the european one if she 
offends the majority of proeuropeans in the conservative party 
then he is back with a chance

on a white house lawn crowded with people in 
wheelchairs president bush signed landmark legislation thursday 
banning discrimination against the nations 43 million disabled 
every man woman and child with a disability can now pass 
through onceclosed doors into a bright new era of equality 
independence and freedom bush said as he signed the americans 
with disabilities act 
he called it another independence day one that is long 
overdue 
the crowd of more than 3000 that spilled across the south lawn 
was the largest ever at a white house billsigning ceremony said 
deputy press secretary alixe glen 
many of those attending were disabled and they applauded loudly 
as bush said the law will ban discrimination in the workplace 
assure access to restaurants hotels and shopping centers expand 
access to public buses and rail systems and require telephone 
companies to provide special services for the deaf 
the law bans discrimination against people with disabilities 
including aids and defines the disabled as anyone with a mental or 
physical impairment limiting some major life function 
bush invoked the opening words of the declaration of 
independence saying we are keeping faith with the spirit of our 
courageous forefathers who wrote that all men are created 
equal 
tragically for too many americans the blessings of liberty 
have been limited or even denied bush said 
the president likened the americans with disabilities act to the 
dismantling of the berlin wall the law takes a sledgehammer to 
another wall he said 
we will not accept we will not excuse we will not tolerate 
discrimination in america bush said 
when he sat down at a table to sign the bill with a flourish of 
ceremonial pens many in the crowd rose for a better view only to 
sit quickly back down as those in wheelchairs called out down in 
front 
bush offered the fourth and last pen to the rev harold wilke 
75 an armless united church of christ minister from claremont 
calif who had delivered an invocation that spoke of the 
breaking of the chains which have held back millions of americans 
with disabilities 
wilke who teaches at union seminary in new york city suggested 
the pen go instead to ginny thornburgh wife of the attorney 
general and a longtime activist for the disabled 
the president said all right ill give it to ginny but 
ill give you mine wilke said later 
as bush reached into his pocket wilke deftly slipped his foot 
out of his loafer took the pen with his toes and slipped it back 
into his shoe a moment later seated beside barbara bush he put 
the pen into his pocket 
those watching the ceremony were enthusiastic 
its just fantastic its a tremendously exhilarating 
feeling said gordon anthony 35 an activist from los angeles in 
a wheelchair from a spinal cord injury 
anthony is a successful marketing consultant but he said the 
law may open doors for what i do in my future career there may 
be better opportunities 
employers are going to start reaching out to the disabled 
he said 
maggie behle 10 of salt lake city darted nimbly through the 
crowd on a single crutch she was born with one leg but is a 
downhill ski racer 
her mother sue behle boasted that maggie has encountered few 
obstacles she cannot overcome but the behles have a second 
daughter kate 15 who is autistic and retarded 
mrs behle who works with a state agency for the handicapped 
said she hopes the americans with disabilities act will mean that 
kate can have a job that she can be employed 
karen friedman of the human rights campaign fund which lobbies 
for gay causes called it a very historic day because it will 
stop discrimination against people with aids and hiv infection 
the disabilities bill includes sanctions for those who 
discriminate in hiring it allows victims of employment 
discrimination to seek back pay reinstatement and attorneys fees 
however the law exempts businesses with fewer than 15 employees 
from the hiring provisions 
to businesses worried about the new mandates bush called the 
disabled a tremendous pool of potential workers who will 
bring to jobs diversity loyalty proven low turnover rate and only 
one request the chance to prove themselves 
sen bob dole rkan who lost use of his right arm in world 
war ii said the law was a giant step forward 
it will be some burden on business dole said but its 
going to make it much easier for americas disabled

nearly all american indians are 
descendants of a single small band of pioneers who walked across 
whats now the bering strait from asia 15000 to 30000 years ago 
a genetics researcher said thursday 
the descendants of this hardy group make up 95 percent of 
american indians including the mayans incas and many other spread 
throughout north central and south america the exceptions are the 
eskimos and aleuts of the arctic rim the navajos apaches and a 
few others who arrived later said douglas wallace of emory 
university in atlanta 
it was clearly a small migration wallace said of the 
ancestral group he based his findings on studies of the genes that 
are related to the bodys energy production the genes were 
extracted from blood samples from members of three different indian 
groups 
in a presentation during a genetics course at the jackson 
laboratory in bar harbor wallace also reported using the same 
energyproducing genes called mitochondria to identify for the 
first time the cause of a form of epilepsy 
the mitochondrial genes which are separate from the bodys 
other genes are passed on to children only by mothers not by 
fathers 
studies of the genes allow researchers to trace maternal 
ancestry wallace explained 
the research on american indians showed that the vast majority 
descended from four women in that original migrating group 
thats a striking finding said michael silverstein an 
anthropologist at the university of chicago who studies american 
indian languages 
if the finding is confirmed silverstein said it significantly 
extends the conclusions about indian origins that can be made using 
language studies 
in march anthropologists met in boulder colo to debate a 
suggestion by joseph greenberg of stanford university that most 
american indian languages derived from one ancestral language 
that controversial view is supported by wallaces studies which 
trace most american indians to the migration of a single small 
group of people who presumably spoke the same language wallace 
said 
other researchers have identified up to 200 linguistic groups 
said greenberg that would suggest there had been many separate 
migrations or that the migrations occurred so long ago that the 
original language had had time to split into many different forms 
wallace said his data argues strongly against those 
possibilities 
wallace is trying to determine when the small group of indian 
pioneers lived the land bridge across the bering strait existed 
from about 30000 years ago when the glaciers that covered it 
receded until about 15000 years ago when the glaciers melted and 
water covered the bridge 
he hopes to establish the time of migration using techniques to 
find how much time it took for the ancestors genes to diversify to 
the way they are among indians today 
the studies might also be used to test the longshot theory that 
american indians descended from polynesians who managed to migrate 
from their islands in the south and central pacific 
wallace one of the leading authorities on mitochondrial genes 
has linked them to several unusual inherited diseases including 
one called myoclonic epilepsy and raggedred fiber disease or 
merrf 
the discovery that the disease is related to a genetic defect in 
the mitochondria underscores the importance of these little 
fireplaces in the body wallace said 
its the first epilepsy thats ever been worked out at the 
molecular level wallace said 
he was able to show that this disease which can produce severe 
handicapping muscle spasms is inherited its origin until now has 
been unknown wallace said 
although the discovery will not lead immediately to a new 
treatment it is an important step toward that goal he said 
preliminary success has been obtained in treating other 
mitochondrial diseases he said 
wallace also has suggested that the accumulation of defects in 
the mitochondria during aging could be a cause of the bodys normal 
degeneration although that hypothesis remains to be examined 
as we age our mitochondrial activity is declining he said 
organs that depend heavily on energy such as the brain and the 
heart are among the organs that begin to fail in old age he said

iraq scaled back a weeklong intimidation 
campaign against kuwait on thursday and began preparing for direct 
talks with its neighbor on ending a bitter dispute over land rights 
and oil production 
travelers returning from the border area said there were fewer 
weapons on display 
diplomatic sources in the persian gulf said iraq had agreed to 
remove extra troops reportedly deployed along the disputed border 
iraq denied ever increasing its military strength in the area 
despite reports from diplomats and the media that it moved as many 
as 30000 men to the border 
iraqi newspaper officials said they received instructions from 
the ministry of information wednesday night to halt propaganda 
attacks on kuwait as part of an agreement to defuse the crisis 
an iraqi official said representatives of iraq and kuwait would 
start direct negotiations in the saudi arabian port of jiddah on 
saturday or sunday 
egyptian president hosni mubarak sent an adviser to baghdad and 
kuwait to help organize the talks 
diplomatic sources in cairo said the meeting would be between 
oil and financial experts who would outline the countries 
differences and make suggestions to their governments for solving 
them the kuwait news agency reported 
in jiddah the 46member organization of islamic conference 
urged the two member states to resolve their differences 
peacefully it warned that any escalation of tension might bring 
foreign intervention to the region especially from israel 
the iraqi source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
iraqi president saddam hussein had not backed down on demands that 
kuwait cut oil production pay for oil baghdad claims kuwait stole 
and forget billions of dollars in wartime loans to iraq 
saddam has demanded kuwait compensate iraq for 24 billion 
worth of oil he accused kuwait of stealing from an oil field that 
includes land claimed by both countries 
the disputed rumaila oil field extends two miles into kuwait 
but iraq claims it owns the entire field 
saddam also claims kuwait and the united arab emirates deprived 
his nation of 14 billion in revenue by exceeding their opec 
production quotas and depressing the international price of crude 
oil he threatened to use force against opec cheaters kuwait and 
and uae deny that they have cheated 
in a move that could help soothe iraqi anger opec ministers 
were expected friday to sign an agreement to raise the cartels 
price of crude oil and try to limit production 
under the proposal kuwait and the uae would be limited to 
producing 15 million barrels a day analysts say each has been 
pumping about 2 million barrels a day

the bush administration is dragging its feet 
on a proposed us treaty that calls for eliminating human rights 
abuses against women around the world members of congress said 
thursday 
rep gus yatron dpa head of a house human rights 
subcommittee said the united states is one of the few developed 
countries that has not ratified the convention on the elimination 
of all forms of discrimination against women 
joining yatron in criticism was rep douglas bereuter rneb he 
said the united states tarnished its image in the eyes of other 
nations by failing to act on the un convention that was signed a 
decade ago he said the measure has been ratified by more than 100 
countries 
abuse against women takes a number of forms from denial of 
access to education to physical mutilation and even death yatron 
said at a hearing 
the human rights situation of women has been largely an 
invisible issue he said it is the purpose of these hearings 
to bring womens rights into the mainstream of our human rights 
policy 
jackie wolcott deputy assistant secretary of state said as a 
first step the bush administration wants the senate to ratify 
another convention banning torture treaties must be ratified by 
twothirds of the senate 
meantime she said the state department has asked the justice 
department to review the convention to determine whether any of its 
provisions conflict with current law 
the process of determining which human rights conventions 
should be recommended for ratification will undoubtedly be 
timeconsuming she said however we hope that it will proceed 
without undue delay following approval of the torture convention 
paula dobriansky the deputy secretary of state for human 
rights said the administration believes the us priority must 
be on the reform of governmental policies and institutions 
responsible for those abuses 
ms dobriansky testified that many countries continue to single 
out women for abuse 
in india for example more than 2000 women were killed 
usually burned in dowry deaths in 1988 their crime they 
couldnt meet the property demands of their husbands families 
in iran women have been raped before being executed and 
tortured after giving birth according to testimony obtained by the 
united nations 
in brazil women often from the lower classes are killed and 
assaulted with virtual impunity in crimes of passion because a 
mans honor is so important 
in africa the painful unhygienic practice of genital 
mutilation usually circumcision continues in various countries 
in china reports of forced abortion and sterilization continue 
as the country attempts to rein in its population growth 
these and other examples were brought up at a congressional 
hearing focusing on human rights abuses against women around the 
world

president mikhail s gorbachev said thursday his 
country needs western aid to rebuild its consumer industries in the 
next two critical years of reform 
speaking to reporters following a meeting with italian premier 
guilio andreotti gorbachev also said natos steps to transform 
itself were crucial in his decision not to block a united germanys 
membership in the western alliance 
he also warmly praised pope john paul ii and did not exlude a 
papal visit to the soviet union 
andreotti as president of the european community for the last 
half of 1990 has been europes point man on the issue of providing 
assistance to the soviet union he has said he believes gorbachevs 
reform program cannot succeed without a rapid infusion of western 
aid 
the question of italian financial credits to the soviet union 
was discussed in the meetings andreotti said but no agreements 
were reached 
gorbachev has said his 5yearold reform program would have to 
show results in the next two years or the soviet leadership should 
quit 
the consumer market is in disarray there are shortages 
everywhere of basic consumer goods and food items and many regions 
have gone to rationing or limiting sales to those who can prove 
local residence 
asked how foreign assistance could help gorbachev said the 
soviet union must move to convert its defense industries to 
peaceful production produce more food and consumer goods for the 
market and give factories a chance to work with foreign firms to 
boost their productivity 
in these two years in which we will have to make the most 
difficult changes we need this kind of help gorbachev said 
some aid should be provided quickly to reduce the difficulty of 
the problems and so perestroika does not slow down he said 
but the soviet union cannot depend on foreign sponsors to 
fix its economy and aid to moscow will not be a handout he 
said 
andreotti said assistance to the soviet union could help 
stabilize all of europe 
the west german government has guaranteed 31 billion in bank 
loans to the soviet union and together with france pushed the 
european community to endorse an immediate 15 billion aid program 
president bush says providing moscow with western advisers and 
knowhow would help more than economic aid until the soviet union 
makes more changes in its economy and cuts down assistance to 
countries like cuba 
gorbachev was asked about the soviet decision announced by last 
week to refrain from trying to block a united germanys membership 
in the north atlantic treaty organization he credited nato 
compromises 
meeting in london nato leaders agreed to reduce the alliances 
dependence on nuclear weapons and to study changes in its forces 
and military strategy 
i am sure that if there had been no london declaration it 
would have been very difficult to formulate our declaration 
gorbachev said 
asked by reporters after the news conference about the 
possibility of a papal visit to the soviet union gorbachev said 
of course everything is possible 
the soviet union had received good words from the vatican 
through the visiting italian officials gorbachev said 
gorbachev has been criticized by traditionalist communist 
officials for establishing relations with the vatican and meeting 
with the pope on a visit to italy last december

east germany on thursday jailed the former 
chief of the communist secret police on suspicion he had hidden 
some of the worlds most notorious terrorists 
however officials said deposed communist leader erich honecker 
was too sick to prosecute on allegations of abuse of office and 
corruption 
authorities arrested 82yearold erich mielke who ran the 
sprawling foreign and domestic spy network that touched nearly 
every east german and bolstered honeckers 19 years of ironfisted 
rule 
mielke was held pending investigation of charges he abused his 
power jailed people for criticizing the old regime and turned 
east germany into a haven for leftwing terrorists linked to some 
of the most spectacular attacks of the past two decades 
the government said even though the allegations against honecker 
would justify a similar criminal investigation the 77yearold 
former leaders health is too precarious he is suffering from 
kidney cancer at a soviet military hospital outside berlin 
some leaders of the ousted regime were arrested late last year 
or early this year but were freed because of poor health or 
advanced age 
east germanys democratic government has changed its mind 
several times about whether to prosecute the ousted communists and 
whether to grant amnesty to most of the 100000 people who worked 
for its intelligence network 
it is unclear how unification in december when east germany 
will come under west germanys justice system will affect the 
criminal investigations 
the east germany adn news agency quoted federal prosecutor 
guenter seidel as saying authorities had no other choice but to 
arrest mielke in light of the mounting evidence of complicity in 
harboring terrorists 
he added that medical difficulties still could stand in the way 
of eventual prosecution of mielke and other former officials there 
have been many reports in west german newspapers that mielkes 
mental state had deteriorated 
mielkes arrest follows a sensational string of allegations that 
the former communist government hid trained and perhaps financed 
notorious leftwing terrorists 
eight reputed members of the red army faction blamed for a 
series of killings and bombings in west germany in the 1970s and 
1980s were arrested in the past several week in east germany 
some had been living there for more than a decade all had 
assumed names and phony identification papers some said they were 
given housing and false identities by the former secret police 
there have been numerous reports that several other terrorist 
suspects regularly lived or traveled to east germany with the 
approval of authorities 
among them was illich ramirez sanchez the notorious carlos 
the jackal who masterminded the dec 21 1975 kidnapping of 11 
opec oil ministers and several other fatal attacks 
officials have said mielke also personally aided abu daoud the 
palestinian accused of orchestrating the massacre of 17 israeli 
athletes during the 1972 olympics in munich 
besides aiding leftist terrorists the stasi purportedly also 
aided rightwing radicals west german news reports have said 
recently 
in addition to east german allegations west germany is pursuing 
murder charges against honecker for his part in promulgating the 
shoottokill order that led to the deaths of at least 192 people 
trying to flee from the old regime into west germany 
besides mielke two other former communist officials labor 
union chief harry tisch and party economist guenter mittag have 
been judged competent to face an investigation

the massachusetts legislature has become mired in 
political gridlock threatening to further damage an already weak 
economy analysts said thursday 
as long as chaos continues theres always a tendency to 
postpone making any kind of decisions said david wyss an 
economist at drimcgraw hill in lexington that means businesses 
are not expanding people arent making investments 
lawmakers have been struggling for months to solve the states 
fiscal disaster while the legislature was gripped with political 
paralysis the states budget deficit climbed above 1 billion and 
the government bond ratings dropped to the nations lowest 
state officials hoped they were sending encouraging signs last 
week when gov michael s dukakis signed a 12 billion tax 
package that was followed by a legislative conference committees 
approval of a budget for the fiscal year that began july 1 
but events grew out of control this week when house lawmakers 
refused to agree to the budget and then house leaders tried to 
appease them by offering a substitute tax package that maneuver 
failed 
meantime standard and poors a major wall street bond rating 
agency was preparing an annual credit report on massachusetts to 
be released monday 
standard amp poors last year gave massachusetts a bbb bond rating 
lowest in the nation moodys investors service inc also has given 
massachusetts its lowest rating of any state 
its unfortunate that the budget delays persist a statement 
from sampp said the firm said it would have a comprehensive 
evaluation of the state once the budget and the financing of last 
years deficit are resolved along with the newly enacted tax 
package 
the protracted debate itself can hurt the states credit 
status said wyss who follows bond rating issues 
the basic problem is not the ability to pay but a lack of 
willingness to pay he said this is a further indication of 
it 
the state economy which started to weaken more than a year ago 
contributed to the fiscal crisis by shrinking tax collections but 
now the fiscal crisis is casting a shadow over the general economic 
picture some observers say 
it has the heavy hand of depression on all of us said james 
howell a leading private economist in boston 
howell has proposed some form of private sector intervention 
where members of the business community would work with legislators 
to restructure the states finances 
there is a time when this fiscal crisis cannot be allowed to 
continue he said 
some political observers blamed a leadership vacuum in the house 
for the inaction 
marty linsky a former gop legislator now affiliated with 
harvards john f kennedy school of government said house speaker 
george keverian traditionally has relied on personal friendships 
rather than strongarmed tactics to win support 
but because keverian is now running for the democratic 
nomination for state treasurer he has taken himself out 
linsky said that gives him much less leverage

thursday was a better day for dave durenberger 
wednesday night the minnesota senator sat at a frontrow desk 
in the senate chamber as colleagues stood one by one to vote for a 
resolution formally denouncing him for financial misconduct 
thursday morning he was on the white house lawn saluted by 
president bush along with a handful of fellow senators for their 
efforts in passing a popular bill barring discrimination against 
disabled americans 
durenberger waded into the crowd on the white houses south 
lawn his red white and blue tie emblazoned with tiny wheelchairs 
to greet dozens of men women and children in wheelchairs later he 
crouched to talk with a group of children answering questions 
about the new law 
a minneapolis stations tv camera took it all in along with his 
conversation with a poliostricken minnesota woman he brought to 
washington for the ceremony 
a few minutes later he took a plane to vermont for the weekend 
wedding of his third son michael 
it was just meant to be the republican senator said over 
and over about the mornings events the day after the darkest 
moment in his political career 
thursday morning he awoke to see his picture splashed in 
ignominy across newspaper front pages from coast to coast and in 
the twin cities the saint paul pioneer press and wccotv released 
poll results that showed durenbergers homestate approval rating 
had plunged to 40 percent 
but by 10 am all that was pushed aside as durenberger took his 
seat at the white house and began what he hopes will be a return to 
more routine senate life 
this is the real dave durenberger he told reporters this 
is the kind of an event that i think is an opportunity to rejoice 
in all the good things that i do as a united states senator 
weve put a couple of bad things that i did a couple of years 
ago behind i do this sort of thing every day i do it for a living 
and i do it as a person this is the good part of my life

smoke on the mountain is an evening of 
musical theater as downhome and satisfying as the sweet potato pie 
sold at intermission 
it is the depiction of a gospelsinging familys saturday 
evening appearance at the mount pleasant baptist church mount 
pleasant nc in 1938 its made more dramatic and musically 
varied than the real thing would have been but except for a few 
too many smirks from kevin chamberlin as mervin oglethorpe the 
resident preacher it isnt condescending 
smoke on the mountain has been running since may at the 
offbroadway lambs theater 
the acting singing and instrumental musicianship of the actors 
playing the sanders family is astounding instead of one rural 
white gospel song after another some of the songs are country 
blues and western swing everybody testifies telling 
interesting stories 
dan manning as stanley tells of disappointing his mother by 
being the one of her five sons who went to prison it might have 
been the most hokey of the stories but was actually the most 
touching 
i like a good mother song rev oglethorpe had said earlier 
and manning sang a dandy theyre all going home to mother 
tonight theyre all going home but one 
dennis robert olsen plays violin and his twin sister denise 
jane potter plays a tiny guitar burl the dad is played by 
reathel bean who looks more rural than most farmers he plays 
guitar vera the mom linda kerns plants her feet wide likes 
to interrupt and plays piano 
stanley burls brother plays upright bass everybody switches 
around on different instruments but manning as stanley gets a 
better tone on bass than anybody else and is also a dab hand with 
mandolin and harmonica the preacher besides looking longingly at 
the family daughters throws himself into the singing from time to 
time and once brings on his accordion 
the audience joins in on bringing in the sheaves 
june sanders the twins nonmusical sister is played by connie 
ray who wrote smoke on the mountain june is learning to sign 
for the deaf which the mount pleasant congregation doesnt need 
the drama which ends act 1 is the huffy exit from the amen 
corner of two old maids when the sanders girls move with the 
spirit to there is a place beyond the river of life we 
dont dance here screeches the preacher trying to save the 
evening 
alan bailey who directed had the idea for smoke on the 
mountain it was first performed at the mccarter theater in 
princeton nj in 1988 
some of the songs will be familiar to those with a protestant 
upbringing familiar songs or not the evening is a beguiling joy

leaders of six indian tribes on thursday 
formally accepted an interior department agreement that gives them 
direct access to federal funds and more control over how to spend 
them 
the selfgovernance demonstration project is designed to test 
whether the tribes can do a better job of managing their own 
affairs than the federal government 
tribes from washington oklahoma california and minnesota were 
chosen to participate in the threeyear program which begins oct 
1 
under the program the tribes will get federal funds directly 
rather than through the bureau of indian affairs they will be free 
to spend the money as they choose 
the senate select committee on indian affairs reported last year 
that very little of the 33 billion allocated for indian programs 
actually reached indian people 
this is a major step for the six tribes represented here 
today interior secretary manuel lujan said as he gave the tribal 
leaders a copy of the agreement which was signed july 3 
through their individual agreements they are taking control 
of their budgets and they are setting priorities for future 
development in their unique cultural communities lujan said 
participating in the program are the quinault lummi and klallam 
tribes of washington the hoopa tribe of california the cherokee 
nation of oklahoma and the chippewas mille lacs band of minnesota 
lujan said that if the program is judged successful it will be 
extended to other tribes 
the chairman of the senate panel sen daniel inouye dhawaii 
said the new system will allow tribes to target particular needs in 
of health and education it also will give them a new sense of 
autonomy he said 
this ceremony here will bring in a new relationship a united 
statesindian partnership he said 
the 1991 amounts are quinault 39 million lummi 22 
million hoopa valley 2 million jamestown klallam 687000 
cherokee 61 million and mille lacs 267210 new annual funding 
agreements will be negotiated for 1992 and 1993 
don wedll of the mille lacs band challenged the distribution of 
the funds he said mille lacs received 112 per member while other 
tribes received between 1000 and 3000 per member tribe 
officials say 80 percent of the mille lacs band live below the 
federal poverty level 
wedll said the tribe is renegotiating its allotment with the 
interior department

nbc on thursday appointed senior network 
executive albert barber to head the companys yearold cable 
venture the consumer news and business channel 
he replaces michael eskridge as cnbc president eskridge is 
leaving to form a broadcast management company 
cnbc is coowned by nbc and cablevision systems corp of new 
yorks long island 
the cable operation based in fort lee nj began in april 
1989 with reported startup costs of 65 million 
cnbc has a staff of 275 and is seen in 168 million homes and 
offices about half the number served by its older rival new 
yorkbased financial news network 
barber said one of his top priorities is to get cnbc carried 
around the world but as a business consumer and financial news 
service not as a rival to cable news network 
this not not a general news network barber said of cnbc 
which unlike ted turners 24hour cable news service is seen only 
in the united states cnn established 10 years ago is seen in 90 
countries 
barber 44 has been nbcs executive vice president and chief 
financial officer since 1987 before that he served in various 
managerial positions at general electric co which bought nbc in 
june 1986 
cnbc still is running in the red and doesnt expect to turn a 
profit until its fourth year when executives hope it will have 30 
million us subscribers 
barber said a priority will be visiting cable operators who 
dont carry cnbc to sell the service 
he said he might consider changing cnbcs primetime operations 
which consist mainly of interview shows but added we are very 
pleased with our daytime programming of financial and business 
news reports 
cnbc in may hired andrew friendly a former entertainment 
tonight producer to overhaul its primetime programming 
unlike fnn cnbc isnt yet carried by cable in manhattan and 
thus isnt seen by the influential wall street and advertising 
crowd but barber said he will work hard to get it shown by 
manhattan cable operators 
in trying to get cnbc a global audience barber said he will 
seek distribution in hotels and brokerage houses among other 
places 
last month cnbc began that attempt with a threeweek satellite 
transmission of the services programs to london and paris hoping 
to interest cable and television companies in carrying cnbc

the military claimed thursday that 
fleeing tamil rebels hacked and shot to death 41 sinhalese and 
moslem villagers suspected of helping the army in sri lankas civil 
war 
in a separate development in the south unidentified assailants 
shot to death 13 sinhalese villagers military officials said they 
said the killings could mean the resurgence of a sinhalese 
extremist group that believes the government has been too soft on 
the tamils 
rebels made no immediate comment on the militarys charge they 
killed 41 villagers it was not possible to independently confirm 
the report 
the military officials who cannot be identified under briefing 
rules said the killings occurred in five northern and eastern 
villages on tuesday and wednesday 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne told reporters 
government troops in the north and east have scattered guerrillas 
of the separatist liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
the tamil terrorists are on the run into the jungles and in 
desperation they want to kill as many as possible before they get 
killed wijeratne said 
the military officials said militants hacked and shot to death 
19 sinhalese villagers at midnight wednesday in the northcentral 
medawahchiya district they reported 20 people died but later said 
one seriously injured man was mistaken for dead 
they said 18 more sinhalese and four moslems were killed in four 
attacks in the northeastern northcentral and eastern districts 
four rebels and a soldier were also reported killed in fighting 
most fighting in this nation off the southern tip of india is 
concentrated below the northern peninsula of jaffna the militant 
stronghold 
government troops tuesday took control of a sixmile corridor 
that connects the peninsula with the mainland 
the peninsula has been under rebel control since the fighting 
started june 11 which ended a 13monthold ceasefire in the tamil 
war for a separate homeland 
since then at least 2900 combatants have been killed in the 
fighting for control of the north and the east besides the 
sinhalese and moslem deaths reported thursday a large but unknown 
number of other civilians including tamils have been killed 
military officials who reported the 13 killings in the south 
said they suspected the sinhalese extremist organization the 
peoples liberation front 
the gunmen dragged the victims out of their homes from diyadawa 
and siyamablagoda villages and took them to jungles where they were 
shot said the officials the bodies were later burned they said 
the victims were members of a peace committee appointed by the 
government to oversee arms surrender by extremists of the front 
if the sinhalese radicals are responsible for the attack it 
would be the first by the front since its top leaders were killed 
by security forces in december 
the sinhalese uprising started in 1987 to protest the 
governments peace overtures to the tamil separatists the tamil 
rebellion started in 1983 with the separatist groups complaining of 
discrimination by the sinhalese majority 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people the 
majority sinhalese who control the government and military 
comprise 75 percent of the population 
more than 13500 people have been killed in the 7yearold 
ethnic war

the house voted 40818 on thursday to 
reprimand rep barney frank for using his official influence on 
behalf of a male prostitute i should have known better the 
massachusetts democrat apologized 
the vote came after the house overwhelmingly turned back 
conservative republican efforts to expel frank or to censure him 
and strip him of a subcommittee chairmanship 
in a statement of contrition shortly before the vote frank said 
he had taken some of the actions cited by the ethics committee in 
part to conceal my homosexuality which he later publicly 
revealed frank said he knows better now but its a little late 
frank was punished for using his office to fix parking tickets 
for prostitute stephen l gobie and for writing a misleading memo 
designed to shorten gobies probation for sex and drug convictions 
the memo found its way to a virginia prosecutor and the ethics 
panel said it could have been perceived as an attempt to pressure 
authorities 
frank first met gobie when he hired him for sexual relations in 
1985 he later employed him as a personal assistant paying him out 
of personal funds 
several lawmakers took pains to say they were not judging the 
massachusetts democrat for his sexual preference 
we are neither condemning today nor condoning that 
lifestyle said rep john t myers rind the ranking 
republican on the house ethics committee which is officially the 
committee on standards of official conduct 
the vote marked the second time in as many days that congress 
had meted out punishment to one of its own on wednesday the 
senate denounced sen dave durenberger rminn for financial 
improprieties on a vote of 960 the senate also ordered him to 
make restitution of up to 123000 
frank was ordered to make restitution to the district of 
columbia for an unspecific amount to pay for the improperly 
dismissed tickets 
the house first voted 39038 to reject a move by california rep 
william dannemeyer to expel frank a motion that required a 
twothirds vote and had not been expected to pass 
more than an hour later house members voted 287141 against a 
move by gop whip newt gingrich of georgia to censure the 
massachusetts democrat a move that would have stripped him of his 
subcommittee chairmanship 
we are here to repair the integrity of the house of 
representatives gingrich said 
the 50yearold frank listened from a seat on the house floor as 
his fate was debated surrounded by his democratic colleagues from 
massachusetts other members stopped by to pat the fiveterm 
lawmaker on the back 
he said in advance he would not contest the ethics committee 
recommendation 
in his floor speech frank called the memo he wrote during 
gobies probation the most serious of his mistakes and 
admitted i shouldnt have written it there was in my life a 
central element of dishonesty for about 40 years it had to do with 
my private life i did in that memorandum misrepresent the facts 
because it was necessary to conceal my homosexuality 
three years ago i decided that concealment didnt work 
ethics committee chairman julian c dixon dcalif told the 
house in pushing for a reprimand we have set aside all of the 
color all of the filth and examined the facts 
it is not barney franks lifestyle that should be judged here 
today but rather what he did or did not do in his official 
capacity 
another committee member republican rep fred grandy of iowa 
said we do not enhance or enshrine family values by damning 
individuals whose lifestyles differ from our own we are here to 
prosecute not persecute 
and rep thomas foglietta added barney frank stands accused 
of being stupid if stupidity suddenly became the grounds for 
expulsion from this body there would be very few of us left here 
voting for the reprimand were 244 democrats and 164 republicans 
voting no were seven democrats and 11 republicans four members 
including frank voted present it is traditional for lawmakers in 
his situation to vote that way 
the house has censured 22 members in its twocentury history and 
expelled only four six had been reprimanded before that action was 
recommended for frank 
dannemeyer who needed a twothirds vote and had not been 
expected to succeed in his expulsion move asked the house are 
there standards in our society that we will affirm for ourselves 
and our children thats the issue 
rep bob dornan rcalif said he had not intended to support 
expulsion for frank but changed his mind i am going to vote for 
expulsion because he didnt have the honor and decency to resign 
he said 
dannemeyer accused the ethics committee of failing to see frank 
as a law breaker 
he said frank knew that gobie was operating a prostitution ring 
in the lawmakers apartment a conclusion that was contradicted by 
the committees finding that frank was unaware of the business 
dixon called dannemeyers version of the facts the most 
edited selective garbage that has ever been put forth in my 
opinion in this house his remark was followed by a round of 
applause 
the ethics committee chairman said dannemeyer announced months 
ago he would move to expel frank when information on congressman 
franks lifestyle is the only information he had at the time 
frank originally paid 80 for sexual relations with gobie and 
then hired him in 1985 as an assistant frank said he fired him in 
1987 after learning of gobies activities in the lawmakers 
apartment 
the committee accused him of improperly using his congressional 
authority to avoid paying 33 parking tickets incurred by gobie 
when he used franks car for personal business

the heirs of an american soldier accused of 
pilfering medieval art treasures from a german church during world 
war ii have given the trove to a dallas museum for safekeeping 
while their ownership is settled 
the quedlinburg treasures will not be displayed publicly at the 
dallas museum of art until the ownership is decided by a us 
district court judge museum director richard r brettell said 
thursday 
brettell said professionals and scholars might be allowed to see 
the treasures if the court and both sides in the lawsuit agree the 
public likely will get to see the art once ownership is clear 
each party was interested in eventually displaying the art for 
the people in texas brettell said 
the pieces will be moved from rural whitewright about 60 miles 
north of dallas to the downtown museum within a week he said 
the lutheran stiftskirchedomgemeinde church of quedlinburg 
claims that joe t meador stole the trove while his us army unit 
was guarding a mine shaft where the items had been hidden 
attorneys for jack meador and jane meador cook the brother and 
sister of the soldier have been negotiating with the church to 
have the treasures kept in a neutral place while they haggle over 
ownership 
meador who died in 1980 bequeathed the artwork to his 
siblings the heirs claim to have several but not all of the 14 
treasures sought by the church the treasures include a 9th or 
10thcentury wood reliquary a container a jeweled ivoryandgold 
comb a byzantine rock crystal flask four small reliquaries in the 
form of turrets and a small heartshaped reliquary 
two jeweled medieval manuscripts believed held by the meadors 
for several years were sold recently on the european art market 
brettell said he did not know how many objects the museum would 
receive he said they included gold silver ivory and crystal 
articles from the 8th to 14th centuries 
the quedlinburg treasury is undoubtedly the most important 
carolingian treasury of the germanies he said the objects 
were made for important kings they were in a repository which was 
among the three or four greatest medieval repositories 
the carolingian period refers to the reign of emperor 
charlemagne and his successors in the 8th through early 10th 
centuries 
brettel refused to assign a value to the treasures 
important carolingian objects have not traded hands on the 
open market for the last generation and therefore its impossible 
to give a real and correct evaluation he said

president fw de klerk held 
an urgent meeting thursday with black leader nelson mandela in an 
apparent bid to persuade him that communists within the african 
national congress have been plotting a coup 
de klerk summoned mandela to pretoria for talks a day after the 
arrest of senior anc official mac maharaj who is also a senior 
member of the communist party 
dozens of other anc members have been reported detained in 
recent weeks 
thursdays meeting in pretoria lasted two hours government tv 
reported 
a statement by de klerk read by his spokesman said the two 
would meet again next week at mandelas request no date or 
location was given 
mandela left the meeting without making a statement 
police have been quoted as saying they believed some communists 
in the anc were conspiring to overthrow the whiteminority 
government if its powersharing talks with the anc fail 
newspaper reports citing unidentified sources have suggested 
the top anc leadership did not know about the alleged plot 
it appears the anc does not appreciate the seriousness of 
the facts which were brought to light by the south african police 
investigations of the past few days de klerks office said in a 
statement announcing the meeting with mandela the deputy anc 
president 
at a news conference wednesday mandela denied there was any 
secret plot and said there was no rift between communists and the 
rest of the anc leadership 
like maharaj many members of the ancs 35member national 
executive committee are also members of the south african communist 
party 
maharaj was detained by police wednesday night under the 
internal security act the act allows police to hold detainees 
indefinitely in solitary confinement without access to lawyers 
and to interrogate suspects until they provide satisfactory 
answers 
maharaj is one of scores of highranking anc officials who have 
returned home from exile since may under a presidential promise of 
indemnity from arrest for past acts 
a communist party spokesman jeremy cronin said maharaj was 
arrested because the government wanted to derail plans for a rally 
he was organizing 
the gathering to be held sunday in soweto township outside 
johannesburg is to mark the communist partys emergence as a legal 
group after years as an underground movement the party was 
legalized in february 
a police captain peet bothma was quoted as saying the rally 
plans had nothing to do with the arrests 
bothma told governmentrun radio south africa that the arrests 
of maharaj and about 40 other anc members detained recently had 
resulted from information about an alleged conspiracy by the 
communist party and the ancs military wing to overthrow the 
government by force if negotiations with the government failed 
the government has said little about the arrests except to warn 
all political groups not to try to seize power the police 
commissioner gen johan van der merwe said on national television 
thursday that the detentions were based on reliable evidence and 
rest on firm legal grounds he refused to provide details 
mandela has repeatedly rejected suggestions from government 
officials and other south african political leaders that the anc 
should disassociate itself from the communist party its longtime 
ally 
south african newspapers quoting unidentified government 
sources have said the ancs top leadership and the commanders of 
the anc military wing did not know about the alleged plot they 
said it involved weapons stockpiling and training of guerrillas 
mandela denied those allegations wednesday but noted that the 
anc is still conducting an armed struggle in south africa however 
he said the anc leadership had decided to suspend its military 
operations if the government agrees to remove certain obstacles to 
formal negotiations on a new constitution 
the anc planned to go ahead with talks with the government 
scheduled for aug 6 mandela said 
anc leaders once postponed talks with the government because of 
police actions but now say they do not want anything to interfere 
with progress toward a new constitution giving the black majority a 
vote in national affairs 
chris hani a commander of the ancs military wing spear of the 
nation called maharajs arrest an act of provocation by the 
security police to create an atmosphere that will hinder the 
talks 
the anc has said the existence of the internal security act is 
one of the obstacles to full negotiations 
others are procedures for the return of an estimated 20000 
exiles the release of 3000 people the anc says were convicted of 
political crimes and an end to the state of emergency which gives 
police extraordinary powers in the province of natal

his friends surrounded barney frank like a 
shield as the assault began filling the seats near him and 
rotating quickly into vacant spots on their mission of comfort and 
protection 
thursdays proceedings against him started with an unusual 
admonition from the chair to avoid abusive language but the 
accusations that followed were anything but gentle 
then toward the end when he knew he would not be expelled 
there was frank himself a subdued somber selfdeprecating 
version of himself apologizing and trying to explain 
i have a reputation for honesty he said not always tact 
or tolerance but honesty the exception was what he called one 
central element of dishonesty that lasted for 40 years the 
secret that he was homosexual 
three years ago i decided that concealment didnt work i wish 
i had decided that a few years earlier the massachusetts 
democrat said 
frank avoided not only expulsion but censure which would have 
stripped him of his seniority and ended up with a reprimand in 
connection with favors he did for steven gobie a male prostitute 
the vote was overwhelming but it came after a vitriolic debate 
in which angry members shouted directly at each other and frank was 
held up as an example of the decline of american values 
are there standards in our society that we will affirm for 
ourselves and our children demanded rep william dannemeyer the 
california republican who tried to get frank expelled 
what will we accept next asked rep clyde holloway rla 
a high school principal a broadcaster a university president 
a business leader all would be fired or ruined in a case like 
this one finis finished done shouted rep bob dornan 
rcalif out the door barney 
garbage responded rep julian dixon the california 
democrat who heads the ethics panel that recommended a reprimand 
he called dannemeyer and his presentation mean selective 
unfair he reproached him like a naughty schoolchild follow 
along mr dannemeyer on page 49 of the report look at it 
mr dannemeyer its on page 49 page 49 mr dannemeyer take a 
look at it the normally mildmannered dixon said sharply 
frank is regarded as an able and articulate legislator and many 
colleagues approached him to shake hands or pat him on the 
shoulder but few rose to defend him during the debate 
one who did rep tom foglietta dpa called him a friend and 
a voice for a better world and rep vic fazio dcalif 
reminded his colleagues that were real people here not 
demigods we have all the foibles of the people who elected us 
it was the second day of high emotion on capitol hill where the 
senate voted 960 wednesday to denounce republican sen dave 
durenberger of minnesota for financial misconduct 
like durenberger before him a repentant frank said he had 
reformed mostly as a result of his decision to go public about 
his sexuality everything i did that was deceptive was done to 
conceal the fact that i was gay he said 
i think im a better judge of character now frank said 
later at a press briefing i had a sufficiently low view of my 
capacities in my private life so that i was more prone to do dumb 
things theres still a disparity between my private and public 
estimates of myself but the gap has closed 
those painful truths were about as much as frank would reveal 
a reporter said he was curious about franks emotions during the 
dannemeyer presentation 
and you will remain so the congressman said tersely 
bouncing back to his normal feistiness

the soviet union hardpressed for convertible 
currency with which to buy western goods and technology appears to 
be selling off some of its vast wealth of raw materials 
president mikhail s gorbachev said thursday his country does 
not intend to take aid free of charge but his prime minister 
has acknowledged the soviet union is in a most difficult 
hardcurrency situation 
the soviet ruble is not traded on world money markets making it 
difficult for the country to obtain western products that are much 
in demand at home where consumer goods are scarce and generally of 
poor quality 
recent kremlin decisions indicate the government is digging into 
its stores of raw materials for sale abroad or redirecting them for 
domestic use as well as getting ready to cut back on its foreign 
aid to allies 
although the west german government has guaranteed 31 billion 
in bank loans to moscow european community leaders refused to 
endorse an immediate 15 billion aid program at their houston 
meeting the leaders of the worlds seven largest capitalist 
countries this month refused to endorse a comprehensive aid program 
gorbachev said thursday after meeting with italian premier 
guilio andreotti that the soviet union is not seeking a handout 
from the west he told the communist party congress earlier this 
month that as far as such aid is concerned we act not as beggars 
but as partners and we are not going to take anything free of 
charge 
yet the soviet union clearly needs immediate cash infusions to 
avoid further economic decline 
we are at present in the most difficult hardcurrency 
situation soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov said in a speech last 
week as he outlined a new plan to rescue the economy 
on wednesday the soviets took a major step to get more hard 
currency de beers centenary ag signed an exclusive deal with 
moscow to sell the soviet unions rough diamond output 
de beers said it has agreed to make a secured advance of 1 
billion to the soviet union immediately against future diamond 
deliveries repayment would be made over five years beginning in 
november it said 
the soviet union has refused to deal directly with the south 
african company because of apartheid but now apparently has 
changed its mind 
foreign experts say the soviet union mines 10 million to 14 
million carats of diamonds a year and is the secondlargest 
producer after south africa 
in another move to soak up a domestic supply of hard currency 
the government on tuesday announced it was setting up a network of 
stores where soviet enterprises and organizations as well as 
individual citizens will be able to buy imported and highquality 
domestic goods for foreign currency 
it als said soviet citizens to spend their foreign cash in the 
soviet union beginning aug 1 without having to disclose where they 
got the money 
deputy prime minister stepan sitarian head of the governments 
economic commission said individual soviets had 200 million rubles 
324 million in foreign currency they had legally acquired but 
were unable to spend in the soviet union except at a few special 
shops for foreigners that have a limited amount of goods 
moscow also is changing its policies regarding raw materials for 
fellow socialist countries 
earlier this month ryzhkov announced that domestic needs 
especially for the upcoming harvest were forcing the soviet union 
the worlds largest oil producer to cut its oil exports by 
140000 barrels a day not only to western countries but to 
socialist bloc nations 
deliveries of bargainrate soviet oil supplies to cuba 
averaging about 90 million barrels annually already are being 
reduced 
a gorbachev decree made earlier this week warned developing 
countries presumably including cuba that the soviet union was 
reassessing its aid programs 
soviet aid to developing countries in 1989 was put at 12 billion 
rubles 19 billion or 14 percent of the gross national product 
according to the labor daily trud military aid is not included 
and western estimates are much higher 
v demchuk head of the socialist countries department of the 
state foreign economic committee of the council of ministers said 
in an interview published thursday in the government newspaper 
izvestia that the kremlin would be looking at getting a better 
return on its foreign investments 
a lot of money has been wasted on costly projects that had not 
been wellconsidered demchuk said 
he referred specifically to a plant in vietnam that was designed 
to produce 15000 diesel engines yet only built 500 soviet 
officials say that moscow gave vietnam about 10 billion rubles 
162 billion in credits for trade and technical asssistance from 
198690 
indicating vietnam cuba and mongolia demchuk said he thought 
it was reasonable to continue aid in building facilities to 
increase the export capabilities of each of those countries

the presidents of czechoslovakia and 
west germany met thursday with kurt waldheim in a break with the 
international diplomatic isolation imposed on the austrian leader 
because of his wartime past 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel indirectly criticized 
waldheim warning of the dangers of lying about the past but a 
defiant waldheim said afterward i didnt lie about anything 
before havel and president richard von weizsaecker of west 
germany shook hands with waldheim in a foyer of the salzburg 
festival hall american jewish activists shouted shame for 
meeting nazi waldheim 
havel and weizsaecker attended the opening ceremony of the 
annual salzburg festival of music and drama at the invitation of 
the provincial governor at the ceremony havel and weizsaecker 
chatted with waldheim the former un secretary general and then 
attended a lunch with him 
both leaders repeatedly emphasized the visits were private not 
official waldheim elected to a sixyear term as president in 
1986 has acknowledged he concealed his world war ii service as a 
junior officer in a german army intelligence unit that has been 
linked to atrocities in the balkans but he denied membership in 
or sympathy with the nazi party 
weizsaecker has become one of europes most respected figures 
for his frank reminders to germans about the nazi era and his 
conciliatory visits to israel and countries ravaged by hitlers 
aggression 
as the keynote speaker of the festival opening ceremony havel 
without mentioning waldheim by name said there is no full 
freedom where full truth is not given free passage 
falsifiers of history do not rescue freedom but threaten 
it havel told his audience in comments translated into german 
from czech by festival officials and then into english by the 
associated press 
havel received a standing ovation after the speech waldheim and 
other austrian officials were given only sparse applause 
after the ceremony waldheim was asked if he felt havels 
remarks referred to him 
certainly not he told austrian state television i didnt 
lie about anything 
official biographies released when waldheim was the un leader 
and early in his presidential campaign failed to mention his 
wartime years in yugoslavia and greece where his german army unit 
was implicated in war crimes 
waldheim also initially denied visits to a riding club run by 
the gestapo the nazi secret police until reports of those 
activities were published 
rabbi avi weiss of new york and his companions staged the noisy 
protest at the festival auditorium they were quickly subdued by 
security agents then charged with creating a public nuisance and 
released they face fines if found guilty 
i am outraged by this meeting for sheer political expediency 
and economic considerations weiss told reporters earlier 
during the lunch after the ceremony weiss protested outside the 
restaurant with another activist dressed in concentration camp 
uniforms they carried a banner saying waldheim resign 
the austrian presidents office had hoped that the visits of 
havel and weizsaecker would be interpreted as endorsement of 
waldheim who has been shunned by nearly all western heads of state 
but a decision by havel and weizsaecker to cut short their stays 
seemed to dampen austrian expectations 
salzburg government sources said a walk about town by the 
presidents was also canceled officially for security reasons 
the first and only official visit to austria by a western head 
of state since waldheims election came three weeks ago when 
cypriot president georgios vassiliou met with waldheim 
waldheims wartime activities have been the subject of intense 
scrutiny since the revelations about his past 
an international commission of historians in 1987 did not 
confirm allegations that waldheim was personally guilty of war 
crimes but stated that he was in close proximity to wartime 
atrocities 
waldheim has persistently denied any wrongdoing

one officer will be fired and another 
suspended because of separate beatings of two black ministers the 
chief announced he said no officer may mete out justice with 
nightsticks and shotgun butts 
chief steven bishop said wednesday he will fire a 28yearold 
officer with one years experience for beating rev joseph okoye 
after a june 4 traffic stop 
okoye a native of nigeria said the beating that left him 
bloody was racially motivated he was disssatisfied with the 
dismissal of just one of several white officers who were at the 
scene 
all of them have to go he said i dont think its enough 
to just fire the first guy 
police pulled okoye over on suspicion of drunken driving they 
said he smelled of alcohol although he denied he had been drinking 
okoye a roman catholic in the kansas city kan archdiocese 
has claimed police misinterpreted his strong foreign accent as 
slurring his words he said he asked why he was under arrest when 
police told him to lie down and put his hands behind his back 
police said he was waving his arms and pushing officers 
the officer who stopped okoye shattered his nightstick on 
okoyes head then grabbed another nightstick to hit him again 
okoye did not tell officers he was a minister during the 
confrontation 
in the other case the police chief said a 35yearold 
threeyear police veteran will be suspended for six months without 
pay for hitting the rev william fountaine a baptist minister in 
the head with a shotgun may 15 
fountaine was struck once as he lay on the ground police had 
stopped him and ordered him and a boy out of the car police said 
the juvenile matched the description of an armed robbery suspect 
but was not charged 
the officer hit fountaine because he didnt lie completely face 
down as ordered he said he lifted his head to keep rain out of his 
face 
though fountaine never contended he was assaulted because of 
racial motives black community leaders expressed concern about the 
beating 
maj james reynolds executive officer to the chief said 
whether the minister lifted his head in defiance didnt matter 
using a shotgun to strike someone is unacceptable reynolds 
said 
the chief said we must not allow the police department to 
slip back into the mentality of the 1960s when police officers 
meted out justice with oak nightsticks and the butt of shotguns we 
wont allow those dinosaurs to reemerge on this department

russian president boris n yeltsin appealed 
thursday to farm workers to prevent a food shortage catastrophe 
in the largest soviet republic by harvesting this years crops as 
efficiently as possible 
yeltsins was the latest official bid to raise farm production 
in the soviet union food is rationed in many parts of the country 
and the nation every year must import us and canadian wheat 
as an incentive to agricultural workers yeltsin said the 
government would issue special harvest 90 coupons to 
agricultural workers from farmers to tractor drivers to food 
processors allowing them to buy consumer goods that have been in 
short supply 
details of the coupon program will be published in the coming 
days he said 
the existing food situation in our republic is critical 
yeltsin said in an appeal to the russian people published on the 
frontpage of the sovietskaya rossia newspaper to prevent a 
catastrophe we must improve it immediately 
in a separate interview russian prime minister ivan silayev 
said if the market is not soon saturated with food and consumer 
goods the situation will be unpredictable 
the prices will simply skyrocket he told pravitelstvenny 
vestnik newspaper 
yeltsin said a good harvest was expected in nearly all parts of 
the russian federation the most populous of the 15 soviet 
republics 
the us department of agriculture agrees forecasting this 
years soviet grain harvest will be 215 million tons slightly 
higher than last years 211 million tons 
we have to gather it carefully preserve it and get it onto 
the table of the russian people yeltsin said 
yeltsin acknowledged that farmers were tired of such pleas he 
agreed they needed more fuel workers and a better transportation 
network 
he said they should have more freedom to make independent 
decisions and to sell their surplus produce to whomever they want 
for whatever price they can negotiate 
yeltsin blamed the agricultural woes on the careless 
experiment started on our longsuffering land 
gorbachevs reforms are only beginning to change the communist 
collectivized system of land ownership and the governmentowned 
distribution system 
in his remarks yeltsin said the bonus coupons will be issued 
both for produce that is required to be sold to the state as well 
as for surplus produce sold for profit he said the government 
would create a fund of consumer goods that could be exchanged for 
the coupons but he did not say what goods would be included or 
where the government would get them 
organizations responsible for food storage and processing also 
will be eligible to encourage them to reduce harvest losses he 
said 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has said 25 percent of the 
countrys crops are lost during harvesting and storage 
gorbachev tried to raise national grain production and reduce 
imports last year by promising to pay farmers in foreign currency 
for exceeding their quotas newspapers said the program failed 
because most farmers didnt believe the offer was true and ignored 
it

a law that forbids state censorship of the media 
takes effect next week in the soviet union but the main censorship 
agency wont be abolished its director said in an interview 
published thursday 
chief soviet censor vladimir boldyrev said the glavlit 
censorship agency will continue to check foreign publications 
audio and visual materials mailed to the soviet union they will 
keep looking for calls to overthrow the government or criminal 
action pornography war propaganda violence and race or ethnic 
superiority 
we check books video and audio materials coming from abroad 
in line with international agreements and the international postal 
convention boldyrev told the government newspaper izvestia 
the press law debated for months before it was passed by the 
soviet legislature on june 12 takes effect aug 1 it states 
the press and other mass media are free and censorship of 
the mass media is forbidden 
it also gives any soviet citizen the right to establish a media 
outlet 
the law forbids publication of state secrets but the penalties 
are to be imposed on whoever leaked them rather than the journalist 
reporting them 
it also forbids slander and use of the mass media to interfere 
in citizens private lives infrigement on their honor and 
dignity pornography also remains outlawed 
boldyrev told izvestia that glavlit will offer the media three 
options for selfcensorship 
for the chief editor to assume all responsibility for what is 
published or broadcast 
for a specially appointed member of the editorial board to do 
it 
for the editor to enter into a contract with glavlit asking 
the agency to review and evaluate materials in this case glavlit 
would assume responsibility for not revealing state secrets 
glavlit the main administration for safeguarding state secrets 
in the press is the principal organ of censorship in the soviet 
union and an agency of the soviet council of ministers it is 
responsible for scrutinizing all official domestic publications 
from the press to dissertations as well those coming in from 
abroad by working with soviet customs and post office 
censorship and strict control of the media was a hallmark of 
soviet rule for decades a soviet journalists role was first to be 
a supporter of communist party policies and second to be a source 
of information the limited reports of the staterun media defined 
what millions of people knew about their country and the world 
although the new media law guarantees the right of soviets to 
found their own publications the countrys poor economy places 
practical restrictions on their newfound legal rights 
production of paper and printing plants still are part of the 
staterun economy which cannot produce enough newsprint 
scores of unofficial papers have appeared in the soviet union 
reflecting its new thirst for politics and debate their publishers 
must scramble to reach agreements with staterun printing houses to 
supply paper 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on july 15 decreed that 
communist party control of broadcasting outlets should end and 
competing voices be allowed to establish their own radio and 
television stations 
he hinted the supreme soviet would take up the matter with 
enabling legislation akin to the law that now allows private 
individuals to start publications

medical necessity it has been the basis of three other court 
rulings around the nation that permitted people to use marijuana 
those cases and two permits issued by the us food and drug 
administration have been for people who smoke marijuana to relieve 
suffering from glaucoma an eye disease and multiple sclerosis 
expert witnesses said 
the jenkses would be the first to get court approval in 
connection with acquired immune deficiency syndrome if circuit 
judge clinton foster rules in their favor 
assistant state attorney quinton broxton argued the couple 
should be found guilty because they had failed to try a legal 
alternative that of seeking to obtain a federal permit for medical 
use of marijuana 
the couple said they have since applied for such a permit 
jenks 28 said he was a hemophiliac and received aids through a 
blood transfusion then gave the disease to his wife who also has 
uterine cancer the two were diagnosed with the disease in 1988 
the couple said the marijuana alleviated loss of appetite 
vomiting and nausea caused by aids and by drugs they have been 
taking for the disease including azt 
when i started taking azt i lost all reason to eat jenks 
said i just couldnt eat 
about an hour after smoking marijuana he said i ate 
everything in the house 
jenks said his wife was throwing up other medications until they 
began using marijuana 
she would lay on the couch with a bucket beside her he said 
mrs jenks said after she began using marijuana she gained back 
about half the 40 pounds she had lost and stayed out of the 
hospital for a year after their arrest march 29 she said she lost 
17 pounds down to 115 pounds and had to be hospitalized 
the couple said they grew their own marijuana because it was 
difficult to obtain the illicit drug and when it was available they 
couldnt afford it 
daniel danzak a university of alabama professor who has done 
research on marijuana as a medicine testified on behalf of the 
couple as did bob randall president of the washington dcbased 
alliance for cannabis theraputics 
danzak said 34 studies have shown marijuana can control 
potentially deadly vomiting possibly by suppressing the functions 
of a part of the brain that induces nausea 
ive never heard of anyone overdosing on marijuana danzak 
said 
randall won one of the prior court rulings on medical use of the 
drug enabling him to smoke marijuana legally to treat his 
glaucoma randalls organization is pushing for changes in federal 
regulations to allow medical marijuana use 
he told the judge he didnt think mrs jenks would still be 
alive if she hadnt used marijuana 
without marijuana they didnt eat anything at all randall 
said

magellan a robot spacecraft armed with a 
sophisticated radar is ready to rendezvous with venus and begin an 
eightmonth exploration and mapping of the earths nearest 
neighbor nasa officials said thursday 
the spacecraft is scheduled to complete its 804millionmile 
voyage to venus on aug 10 when it fires a rocket engine to settle 
into an orbit that dips to within 170 miles of the planets surface 
officials said the craft would approach venus at 24600 miles 
per hour and the rocket firing will slow magellan to 18400 miles 
per hour enough to put it into the planets orbital grasp 
after a checkout period lasting until about sept 1 magellan 
will use a powerful radar system to penetrate the dense clouds 
above venus and gather images for a detailed map of the baked 
surface of the torrid planet 
tony spear the magellan project manager said at a news 
conference that the only major problem experienced by the 413 
million spacecraft during its long journey has been an electrical 
failure in one gyroscope 
spear said the spacecraft needs two gyros to control its 
position and is equipped with four loss of the one gyro he said 
still leaves a full set of two plus one spare 
magellan was carried into space by the space shuttle atlantis 
and released into earth orbit may 4 1989 an upper stage rocket 
engine fired to send magellan streaking out of earth orbit toward 
venus during its 15month voyage the spacecraft looped the sun 
passed earths orbit once and then sped toward its august meeting 
with venus 
spear said the plans called for magellan to spend 243 days the 
length of one venus day creating a radar map of 70 percent to 90 
percent of the planets surface if the craft continues to perform 
spear said the mission would be extended for additional mapping 
cycles until 1995 
magellan will circle venus once every three hours spending 37 
minutes of each orbit bouncing radar signals off the planets 
surface each pass will image a swath 10000 miles long and about 
16 miles wide the data is stored in onboard recorders 
when the spacecraft swings toward the high part of its orbit it 
will spin aim its antennae toward earth and spend 115 minutes 
transmitting the radar data back to nasas deep space network 
later computers at the jet propulsion laboratory will process 
the signals into images that resemble aerial photos scientists 
expect magellan to detect surface details as small as 260 yards 
across about 10 times more resolution than any of the 20 or so 
spacecraft that have previously explored venus 
venus holds fascination for scientists because its nearly the 
same size and mass as the earth and the two planets are thought to 
have shared a similar planetary formation history 
but the two planets differ significantly in temperature and 
pressure 
venus has a surface temperature of about 900 degrees about the 
temperature of a selfcleaning oven and its atmosphere is almost 
pure carbon dioxide venus has no liquid water and the atmospheric 
pressure is more than 90 times that of earth 
though venus is 23 million miles closer to the sun than earth 
it is covered by acid clouds so dense that its surface is in 
perpetual twilight 
because of the clouds only a radar such as that carried by 
magellan can gather the images needed to map the venusian surface

salvadoran government and guerrilla 
negotiators ended a week of talks at loggerheads on an armed forces 
overhaul but hopeful a human rights accord reached thursday will 
keep up the momentum toward peace 
the two sides reached agreement on a united nations role to seek 
greater respect for basic rights at a 20hour session that extended 
the costa rican meeting by a day it was the first agreement 
produced in three rounds of talks since may 
representatives of president alfredo cristianis rightist 
government and rebels of the leftist farabundo marti national 
liberation front or fmln had fretted that a third round with no 
progress would badly damage the effort to end 10 years of civil 
war the war has killed about 72000 people and displaced nearly 
onefifth of el salvadors population of 53 million 
un mediator alvaro desoto said the rights accord without 
doubt helps clear the way for progress on other items of the 
agenda 
the un mission to be established under the accord will be 
headed by an appointee of secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar it will comprise as many agents as are necessary 
the mission will enjoy broad powers to adopt any initiative it 
deems appropriate for the promotion and defense of human rights 
said the document 
last may it was agreed that overhaul of the armed forces would 
lead the agenda and the fruitless june round dealt almost 
exclusively with that topic 
early in the costa rican session it became obvious that 
differences on the future role of the military remained vast the 
guerrillas said that on some matters the chasm had widened 
international watchdog agencies the united nations the 
organization of american states and the us congress are among 
organizations that have chronicled flagrant and systematic abuse of 
fundamental rights on a huge scale in el salvador during the past 
decade 
the armed forces and militarylinked death squads are blamed for 
the murder of up to 30000 suspected leftists torture of political 
detainees by security forces was routine for years according to 
such organizations 
the united nations said abuses continue but that the 
governments rights record had improved in recent years 
the world body condemned rebels for assassinating eight mayors 
in 1988 and for later killing other noncombatants 
justice minister oscar santamaria the chief government 
delegate said of thursdays human rights agreement were 
enormously satisfied this is a very meaningful advance 
guerrilla commander schafik handal who leads rebel negotiators 
agreed that the document is an accord of great value 
but he cautioned that the military overhaul issue remains and 
is the key to the quest for peace 
this human rights accord will not mean a great deal unless 
we advance in the field of demilitarization of salvadoran 
society he said 
the insurgents carried out a huge threeweek offensive last 
november and say they are ready to launch another major push 
handal refused to say if the progress made here reduced the 
likelihood of an offensive in coming weeks but other guerrilla 
sources said chances for an imminent offensive were lessened 
though el salvador has held periodic elections since 1982 and 
moved to consolidate some democratic institutions the military 
retains great power 
a joint communique said the issue would receive priority 
consideration at the next round set for aug 1722 in san jose 
it said the un humanrights monitoring mission will be free to 
document and denounce rights violations conduct unrestricted 
interviews with all people make recommendations to both the 
government and guerrillas and publish its reports conclusions and 
recommendations 
the mission will begin work as soon as a ceasefire is agreed 
its original mandate is for a year subject to extension 
both sides say they hope to agree to a ceasefire by 
midseptember 
the main sticking point in peace talks appears to be the rebel 
demand for a purge of the worst rights abusers and corrupt officers 
from the high command the government and armed forces contend a 
purge would violate the institutionality of the military

of ministers 
perez asked for the resignations as a prelude to a longexpected 
cabinet shakeup government officials confirmed 
new ministers have already been lined up but their names and 
positions have not been released 
however a top government official told the associated press 
that perez will keep all his key ministers who helped shape a 
painful and radical program that is guiding this nation of 19 
million people from a statecontrolled to a freemarket economy 
this will be the third cabinet for the 17monthold perez 
government the president first rearranged his cabinet in august 
1989 six months after taking office 
he later fired his finance minister and last friday the 
transportation and communications minister augusto faria viso 
resigned to deal with accusations that he solicited a 35 million 
kickback from a french company in exchange for awarding it a 100 
million radar equipment contract 
there are 15 official cabinet posts and five more that perez has 
elevated to ministerial level at a minimum these 20 resigned the 
presidential palace could not say immediately if other agency or 
public company chiefs also resigned prior to their being replaced 
dissatisfied with the performance of some aides perez will 
replace six ministers and the directors of several key government 
agencies said the government source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
among them are perezs top information official pastor heydra 
who directs publicity and the official news agency venpres and the 
director of the governments largest television station channel 8

of staff and his justice and agriculture ministers 
there have been rumors of changes in the perez cabinet for 
months

and central bank president pedro tinoco have clashed frequently 
and publicly speculation is that one will go other reports said

to run for secretarygeneral of the governing democratic action 
party

the health warnings on cigarette packs 
dont protect tobacco companies from liability lawsuits by smokers 
the state supreme court ruled thursday 
the decision runs counter to several federal appeals court 
rulings those decisions generally held that the warnings ordered 
by the government in 1966 absolved tobacco companies from 
responsibility in smokers deaths 
industry lawyers promised to appeal 
richard daynard a law professor at northeastern university in 
boston and chairman of the tobacco products liability project 
called the ruling the most important positive development in 
tobacco litigation in the last decade 
this decision represents the consensus of scholarly opinion 
that these earlier decisions were wrong and it is very likely to be 
upheld by the us supreme court daynard said 
six of the justices concurred in the decision one filed a 
partial dissent the new jersey high court also said that changes 
in a 1987 state productliability law didn rule out lawsuits filed 
before the law was passed tobacco company officials believed the 
law protected them retroactively from suits by smokers 
the ruling will allow a 1982 lawsuit filed by claire dewey of 
wyckoff to proceed mrs deweys husband wilfred dewey died in 
1981 from lung cancer after smoking for more than 40 years 
dewey had smoked camels tareytons and viceroys and his wife 
filed suit against the makers of those cigarettes rj reynolds 
tobacco co american brands and brown amp williamson tobacco corp 
respectively 
we are unable to decide that as a matter of public policy 
manufacturers of cigarettes should be immunized from liability for 
the harms caused by their products the court opinion said 
in this case a new jersey jury could decide that a cigarette 
manufacturer rather than an injured party ought to bear the cost 
of injuries that could have been prevented with a more detailed 
warning label than that required under the cigarette act the 
opinion said 
jim fyock a spokesman for rj reynolds said the ruling flies 
in the face of decisions in the supreme court of minnesota and five 
federal courts of appeal as well as numerous rulings in state and 
federal trial courts 
those rulings had all held that the warning labels on 
cigarettes and wide publicity about the health dangers of smoking 
meant smokers were doing so at their own risk 
martin london attorney for brown amp williamson described the 
ruling as aberrant and wrong five federal appellate courts have 
looked at the federal statute and have said that it preempts 
warning claims 
marc edell an attorney representing mrs dewey said it was the 
first time either a federal appeals court or a state supreme court 
held that the 1966 federal cigarette labeling and advertising act 
does not protect tobacco companies from lawsuits brought since then 
edell who is handling six smoker death cases pending in new 
jersey said the ruling would reinstate his cases 
the court said juries should be allowed to decide whether 
tobacco companies are to be held liable for the damages their 
products may cause 
it opens up a whole new horizon for us edell said it 
gives us back the full arsenal of the theories of liability that we 
had when we started 
edell also represented antonio cipollone who sued three tobacco 
companies on behalf of his wife rose who died of lung cancer in 
1984 in june 1988 a federal jury awarded cipollone 400000 for 
his wifes death the first such damage award required to be paid 
by a cigarette company 
but an appeals court overturned the award this year and ordered 
a new trial cipollone died before the appellate decision and it 
is unclear if the case will go back to court 
massachusetts highest court wednesday threw out parts of a 
liability lawsuit against philip morris cos inc 
that court dismissed claims that the company should be held 
liable because convenience stores sold cigarettes to two minors 
but the court said the youths could pursue their claims that the 
company engaged in a deceptive act

supreme court nominee david souter brushed 
aside questions thursday about a letter he wrote nearly a decade 
ago opposing legislation that would have forced judges to make 
decisions on abortions for teenagers 
souter making a round of courtesy calls in the senate told 
reporters he would disclose what is constitutionally 
appropriate at his confirmation hearings 
meanwhile one of the justices he will join if confirmed 
thurgood marshall said hed never heard of souter before he was 
selected and suggested the nomination was a political move 
marshall in a dwindling liberal minority on the court with the 
retirement of justice william j brennan said he didnt think 
president bush had ever stopped running for president and 
this last appointment is the epitome of what hes been doing 
marshall commented in an interview thursday night on abctvs 
primetime live 
abortionrights advocates said they found no encouragement in 
souters letter although it supported their position against a 
restrictive abortion bill that was before the new hampshire 
legislature in 1981 
still the letter provided a rare glimpse at souters judicial 
actions on abortion and triggered new attempts to analyze how he 
would change the supreme courts precarious balance on the 
emotional issue that has taken center stage in the debate over his 
confirmation 
the national right to life committee the leading antiabortion 
group said it concluded the letter reveals nothing about 
souters views on abortion or its legality 
president bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater said of the 
letter we have no reaction to it one way or the other 
after meeting with souter sen strom thurmond rsc went to 
the white house to give bush a progress report on how the 
nomination was going over on capitol hill 
fitzwater quoted thurmond as saying im impresed with him 
and i think hell be just fine thurmond reported no one has 
indicated they want to fight the nomination fitzwater said 
souter dismissed questions about his views on abortion and other 
issues as he continued meeting with members of the senate which 
will decide the fate of his nomination 
i think you should save any issue of that sort for the 
confirmation hearing where im sure that issue will be 
addressed he told reporters 
souter met privately for an hour with the chairman of the 
judiciary committee sen joseph biden ddel who will preside 
over the hearings which are expected to begin in september he 
then met with other senators 
sen arlen specter rpa said the judge had told him he had 
insisted that his views on the 1973 roe vs wade 
abortionlegalizing decision not be asked if bush were to nominate 
him 
when he was invited to come down he posed a requirement that 
there not be a question which he would be asked on that subject 
said specter after meeting with souter 
i look forward to making my positions clear to the extent it 
is constitutionally appropriate when the hearings begin souter 
told reporters 
souters letter made available by the national abortion rights 
action league was written while he was a new hampshire state 
superior court judge and was dated may 13 1981 
he addressed it to the chairman of a state house committee and 
said he was directed by the full court to state its position on a 
bill that would have provided for judges to rule on whether 
unmarried minor pregnant women may have abortions in cases where 
they do not have a parents consent 
he did not state a position on the bills basic requirement for 
parental consent but voiced opposition to the socalled judicial 
bypass option when there is no parental consent 
souter wrote that the requirement would leave it to individual 
justices of this court to make fundamental moral decisions 
without any standards to guide the individual judges 
state superior court chief justice richard dunfey said he 
instructed souter to write the letter because souter was chairman 
of the courts legislative committee 
my recollection is that discussion on abortion itself never 
included right or wrong dunfey said 
new hampshire abortionrights activist peg dobbie said souters 
letter was critical to successful efforts to kill the legislation 
similar letters signed by other judges were used to oppose later 
bills 
kate michelman director of the national abortion rights action 
league said the letter was reason for the senate to probe souters 
views on constitutional issues surrounding abortion but did not 
reveal his inclinations on the central abortion issue 
no one wants to find a silver lining in this nomination more 
than we do but this letter does not provide it she said 
dawn johnsen the groups legal director said the letter 
suggests that judge souter might vote with conservatives on the 
court to allow a law that mandated parental consent without any 
escape valve for teenagers who are victims of child abuse and 
family violence and are unable to discuss an abortion with their 
parents 
i dont see much reason for encouragement johnsen said 
at best its neutral its a complicated letter on just the 
judicial bypass 
at the time of souters letter the us supreme court had ruled 
that states could require a parents consent for a minor to obtain 
an abortion so long as the state provided an alternative route 
such as a judges approval the court in june of this year ruled in 
a pair of cases that a state may require notice to both parents as 
long as judicial bypass is an option 
melanne verveer executive vice president of the liberal people 
for the american way said the letter seemed to support bushs 
depiction of souter as a judge not inclined to judicial activism 
she pointed to a section of the letter in which souter said the 
courts have been criticized for the imposition of individual 
judges views in the guise of applying constitutional terms of 
great generality he added that the provision of the bill he was 
opposing would force the superior court to engage in just such 
acts of unfettered personal choice 
it is of concern verveer said

three weeks after a teacher was blamed for the 
accidental death of a 15yearold student japanese authorities on 
thursday decided to fire the teacher and discipline five other 
educators 
the case raised a storm of criticism about the strict rules that 
most schools in japan impose on their students and the rigorous 
enforcement that sometimes includes corporal punishment 
support for harsh disciplinary measures is widespread among 
teachers according to government polls parents and students 
generally do not complain about the rules or their enforcement 
until tragedies strike 
on july 6 teacher toshihiko hosoi 39 closed the front gate of 
a senior high school in kobe promptly at 830 am in line with 
school policy of starting classes on time 
ryoko ishida the student was caught in the heavy metal gate 
and died a few hours later of a crushed skull published accounts 
said 
on thursday the hyogo prefectural education board in western 
japan decided to fire hosoi for failing to take adequate safety 
measures police are questioning him 
the takatsuka senior high school principal atsuo nomura was 
given a warning and his resignation was accepted at the meeting of 
the education board 
the board also cautioned the schools head teacher and the local 
superintendent of education ryoji shimizu and reprimanded two 
vice superintendents of education 
commentator morse saito writing in mainichi shimbun newspaper 
said the schools strict gateclosing rule was designed to give 
students a way to earn recommendations for employment after 
graduation 
if students followed the ontime rule he wrote by 
graduation teachers could recommend most students as being 
prompt even though some had low grades this is important for 
students seeking employment after high school the elite dont 
need it 
other school rules require students to wear school uniforms even 
on sundays bar them from riding motorcycles or visiting bookstores 
or tea shops 
enforcing school rules includes keeping records of behavior 
such as promptness in files not accessible to students and 
parents files are passed on from junior high schools to high 
schools 
discipline also often includes corporal punishment according to 
morikatsu imahashi a professor at ibaraki university and a 
longtime critic of such methods 
teachers often slap punch kick he said in an interview 
justice ministry figures show that reports of corporal 
punishment more than doubled between 1984 and 1988 
extreme punishments can draw national attention last september 
teachers buried two junior high school students in fukuoka a city 
on the southern island of kyushu in sand up to their necks media 
reports said the teachers suspected the students of bullying their 
classmates the case caused a nationwide sensation when it came to 
light earlier this month 
with competition so intense for higher education students and 
parents arent inclined to protest out of fear it will be held 
against them those who imahashi said 
japans educational system is highly competitive and many 
students are being sent to cram schools called jukus to 
prepare for tests to get into good schools some children start 
intensive tutoring at ages as young as 3 in order to get into the 
best kindergartens and elementary schools especially those of 
respected private universities that automatically admit students 
from their own preparatory schools 
critics say some students who are under constant pressure to 
study rebel with truancy or acts of violence 
the number of pupils refusing to go to school has quadrupled to 
more than 42000 in the past 10 years according to a recent report 
by the prime ministers office 
police say reports of students attacking or murdering their 
mothers often in retaliation for enforcing study discipline are 
not uncommon 
the report by the prime ministers office placed much of the 
blame for juvenile problems on the educational system 
in their zeal for children to excel in exams that largely 
determine their future chances in life the strict school system 
and surrounding social environment have produced a generation of 
immature selfcentered unemotional youths the report said

the government thursday played down the importance 
of soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs brusque refusal to 
discuss japans claim to the disputed kuril islands 
the issue has prevented the two countries from agreeing on a 
peace treaty to end world war ii officially it is a main cause for 
chilly relations even while other countries have made great strides 
in improving ties with moscow 
gorbachevs latest statement was the banner story in every 
national japanese newspaper because it appeared to reverse moscows 
grudging willingness to discuss the 45yearold argument 
it could also indicate negative fallout from what japan had 
touted as a diplomatic victory at the houston summit of the seven 
major industrial democracies this month prime minister toshiki 
kaifu was able to persuade other countries to mention the kurils 
dispute in a summit communique 
kaifu also rejected japanese participation in a western european 
drive to give financial aid to moscow saying the territorial 
dispute stood in the way 
the soviet leader met in moscow on wednesday with a delegation 
led by yoshio sakurauchi speaker of the powerful lower house of 
parliament gorbachev turned aside the politicians effort to raise 
tokyos claim to be the rightful owner of sovietheld islands off 
the northern japanese island of hokkaido 
gorbachev quoted by the official tass news agency said the 
issue had been decided after world war ii and the soviet union 
abides by postwar arrangements 
i do not want to launch a discussion today on the issue that 
was repeatedly discussed with representatives of japan tass 
quoted gorbachev as saying i can repeat today we do not have a 
territorial issue 
the kyodo news service said gorbachev went on to hint he may 
cancel a trip to tokyo tentatively set for early 1991 if japan 
insists only on talking about the territorial dispute 
japan is banking on gorbachevs trip to tokyo as a chance to 
make progress on the issue both the foreign ministry and chief 
government spokesman misoji sakamoto said thursday they believe the 
trip will take place as planned 
as far as the government is concerned there is no need to be 
overly affected by gorbachevs comment sakamoto said at a news 
conference 
a foreign ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said it appeared gorbachev was simply stating the official soviet 
position the official said japan has an earnest intention to 
improve relations with the soviet union but stressed the most 
important problem is the territorial issue 
soviet troops captured the islands in the last days of world war 
ii and claims them as historically russian territory japan demands 
their return on grounds that they had been ceded to japan in 
19thcentury agreements 
the kurils make up a string of three islands and a cluster of 
islets lying in waters rich with salmon and other marine resources 
the islands also have strategic value as a barrier to access 
between the pacific ocean and the sea of okhotsk

secretary of state james a baker iii 
on thursday sought to dampen speculation that a settlement of the 
afghan civil war is imminent said officials traveling with him 
he made his remarks on the flight from washington before he 
arrived in jakarta on the first leg of a fournation swing through 
asia 
us officials quoted baker as telling reporters on the flight 
that the united states had not yet reached agreement with the 
soviet union on afghanistan 
theres no agreement on afghanistan its a product of the 
rumor mill he was quoted as saying 
prior to bakers departure us officials had indicated the 
secretary of state would try to clear the remaining roadblocks to a 
ceasefire in afghanistan during the trip 
they said baker and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze who are to meet aug 1 meeting in irkutsk soviet 
siberia would discuss a timetable for afghanistans president 
najibullah to step down 
the soviets hinted at a deal they havent fleshed it out 
said an administration official tuesday on condition of anonymity 
the thread of the deal is going to be pursued in irkutsk by 
baker 
abc news had said earlier this week that shevardnadze and baker 
already had made a deal to end the afghan civil war but the 
administration official disputed that report 
the bush administration has been hoping for a breakthrough to 
end the war between afghan government forces armed by the soviet 
union and a guerrilla coalition fighting with americansupplied 
weapons funneled through pakistan 
the soviets have not yet told the united states how najibullah 
might be removed from power in kabul said the administration 
official 
the soviet union installed the najibullah government in 1979 
but the government in kabul has been unable to impose its will on 
the countryside the soviets withdrew their troops last year but 
continue to supply arms 
in indonesia baker will attend a meeting of the association of 
southeast asian nations on friday and saturday 
asean said in a statement wednesday that a change in cambodias 
representation in the united nations would hurt the search for 
peace in indochina last week the united states withdrew its 
recognition of the guerrilla coalition that holds cambodias un 
general assembly seat 
baker was quoted as telling reporters on the plane that the 
change of us policy on cambodia was an example of our need to 
adjust to new circumstances 
washington also announced last week it would open talks with 
vietnam on a settlement in cambodia and would no longer support the 
right of the guerrilla coalition to represent phnom penh in the 
world body 
those steps could open the way to a broader rapprochement 
between the united states and hanoi shifting the balance of power 
in southeast asia hanoi supports the cambodian govenment 
us officials said the policy shift was designed to prevent the 
khmer rouge the strongest of the three guerrilla groups from 
gaining power in cambodia the communist khmer rouge took power in 
1975 and slaughtered hundreds of thousands of civilians before 
being ousted by vietnam in 1978 
later in the asian trip baker will hold talks in singapore and 
visit outer mongolia

the federal aviation administration adopted a 
rule thursday designed to ground pilots who violate drunken driving 
laws or are convicted of traffic offenses involving drugs 
this kind of behavior indicates an attitude that we believe is 
not compatible with safe flying said faa administrator james b 
busey 
individuals applying for an faarequired medical certificate 
must consent to the release of information from the national driver 
register to enable the faa to obtain and review motor vehicle 
offense information 
pilots also would be required to provide written notification to 
the faa on each alcohol or drugrelated driving conviction or 
administrative action within 60 days after it occurred 
the faa could deny an application for a pilot certificate or 
take action to suspend or revoke an existing certificate if the 
pilot received two or more alcohol or drugrelated convictions or 
administrative actions within three years after the effective date 
of the rule 
the air line pilots association called the rule a witch hunt 
and said the existence of alcoholrelated driving convictions 
does not correlate to flying a commercial airliner while 
intoxicated a federal district court upheld this principle when it 
ruled that there was no basis for drawing a similar connection for 
commercial truck drivers 
the union said in a statement it would help any pilot who 
falls victim to the faas oppressive and invasive ruling

a project to broaden a freeway running through the 
heart of town has uncovered a forgotten layer of dallas history 
hundreds of unmarked graves belonging to generations of former 
slaves and black settlers 
clearing a path for the expansion of the north central 
expressway earlier this year a backhoe scraped across portions of 
caskets wooden markers and gravestones archaeologists were 
brought in to relocate some of the graves an excavation that was 
supposed to take a few weeks to complete 
that was three months ago 
that was a naive estimate i made last spring said jerry 
henderson the archaeologist overseeing the project for the state 
highway and transportation department 
as more and more graves at freedmans cemetery are uncovered 
along the freeway where theyve been covered for years some 
containing fascinating relics officials now say the dig may take 
two years 
its an emotional archaeological and historical issue ms 
henderson said you didnt do it and i didnt do it but lets 
face it the people who were buried here were wronged and its up 
to us to see that their final resting place is restored and their 
memories preserved 
about 800 graves have so far been marked off with twine and ms 
henderson said the final count may exceed 2000 she said no more 
than 500 graves will have to be moved to make room for the highway 
expansion 
there is little written record of the cemetery located just 
north of downtown but ms henderson said most of dallas blacks 
apparently were buried there from 1861 to 1925 
when youre looking at black history its very difficult to 
track down because you have no paper trail to follow unlike white 
history said steve mabry a local preservationist 
underlining this fact freedmans cemetery is bordered on one 
side by an equally old but wellkept catholic cemetery 
more than a century ago the area was dubbed north dallas 
freedmentown for the emancipated slaves who lived there mabry 
said many of the communitys residents worked on the nearby 
railroad and others worked for welltodo whites 
freedmentown was virtually wiped out in the 1940s when north 
central expressway was built right through the middle of the 
cemetery in the 1960s a memorial park was built over part of the 
remaining cemetery 
the relocation of the graves will be difficult because most are 
bunched together in what appear to be families ms henderson said 
we dont want to disrupt the internal integrity of the 
organization ms henderson said for example we dont want to 
move the mother right here and then move the baby over there 
the sensitivity ms henderson and her crew have displayed is one 
reason the excavation hasnt caused controversy in fact local 
historians and preservationists say theyre excited by the 
prospects 
the thing that impresses me about that project is that the 
people working with it have gotten some input from the community 
that has more of a relationship with that cemetery said harry 
robinson jr director of museum of african american life and 
culture 
funerary objects such as shells ceramic figurines glass vials 
marbles and a watch have been found atop some graves items 
unearthed at the site will eventually be put on display at his 
museum robinson said 
robinson plans to organize a junior archaeological camp this 
summer where children will help wash the materials found in the 
graves 
of course no bodies will be bothered he said if they 
were doing that then people would say whats going on out there

the survivor of the 1986 plane wreck in nicaragua 
that helped unravel the irancontra affair tearfully recounted the 
crash as he testifed thursday in his damage suit against a retired 
general and a cialinked airline 
eugene hasenfus who was a cargo handler aboard planes carrying 
aid to the contras filed a federal lawsuit along with the family 
of copilot wallace sawyer jr who was among three killed when a 
sandinista rocket downed their plane 
hasenfus his voice cracking and tears in his eyes said he 
stood in the open cargo door as his c123 flew into southern 
nicaragua on oct 5 1986 with a load of supplies for a contra 
force pinned down by sandinistas 
there was a loud explosion from the right i was astounded 
the whole plane was on fire hasenfus said 
sawyer yelled what happened it was the last thing he ever 
said 
wearing a skydiving parachute supplied by his brother in 
wisconsin hasenfus tried to jump but initially became entangled 
in a machine gun aimed out the door finally he freed himself and 
pulled his ripcord 
i was in a state of shock he said i could see the 
aircraft in a spin there was nothing but black smoke and flames 
hasenfus and sawyers family are suing retired air force maj 
gen richard secord and miamibased southern air transport 
alleging they misled the crew and negligently used aircraft without 
adequate safety equipment 
following the crash president reagan denied there was any us 
government connection to the flight but hasenfus and documents in 
the wreckage of the plane told another story linking the crew to 
us officials 
and after the disclosure the following month that proceeds from 
the reagan administrations secret arms sales to iran had been 
diverted to the contras congressional investigations showed that 
the plane was part of white house aide oliver norths secret contra 
resupply network the contras were seeking to overthrow nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government 
as hasenfus testified about the crash his wife sally and 
sawyers widow kasanee of magnolia ark watched intently their 
eyes glistening 
hasenfus said he evaded the sandinistas overnight in the 
rainsoaked jungle but was captured the next day they brought him 
to the crash site where he said the soldiers showed him a bag 
containing the remains of sawyer pilot william cooper and the 
missions contra radio man 
they laughed they thought it was funny hasenfus said the 
sandinistas eventually convicted hasenfus of terrorism and 
sentenced him to 30 years in prison but released him after three 
months 
before recounting the crash hasenfus 49 now a construction 
worker in marinette wis said he worked for ciaowned air america 
during the vietnam war 
when central american hostilities heated up in july 1986 he was 
contacted by cooper and brought to the southern air headquarters at 
miami international airport he signed a contract with corporate 
air services but said he understood it was a front for southern 
air which was paying his expenses 
he said the crews complained that there was no safety equipment 
such as parachutes or survival gear and that the navigation radios 
did not work properly but he said he accepted the defects 
thinking it was a patriotic shoestring effort to fight communists 
in central america 
only when the irancontra affair became public he said did he 
become aware that reagan aide oliver north secord and southern air 
were running the supply effort as a profitmaking enterprise even 
buying a lear jet 
on crossexamination southern air attorney robert beckman 
focused on the role of corporate air services forcing hasenfus to 
show that his pay drafts tax returns and even unemployment 
compensation claim all reflected that companys name rather than 
southern air 
beckman also sought to show hasenfus had violated a secrecy 
agreement he signed riling the witness hasenfus said the case 
was already blown by congress when he later sold the rights to 
his story for 10000 to cbs 
beckman referred to the hostilities as a war to bolster the 
defense contention that hasenfus and sawyer had willingly accepted 
the risks when they signed on 
it wasnt a war and vietnam wasnt a war hasenfus 
responded 
under questioning by secords attorney thomas spencer hasenfus 
agreed he had never met the man he was suing nor did he have any 
documents signed by secord 
hasenfus also acknowledged he had received some money after the 
crashhe said a brown bag containing 6000 was given to his wife 
by a man who said this is from the boys 
secords attorneys have said their client never had any legal 
relationship with hasenfus and sawyer and had never met them 
secord pleaded guilty on nov 8 1989 to lying to congressional 
investigators when he said he wasnt aware of any money that went 
to norths benefit from the maze of companies he used in the 
irancontra affair he was sentenced to two years probation

a closely guarded truck convoy 
thursday began spiriting away a vast cache of deadly nerve gas 
secretly stored by the united states near this small west german 
town for more than 20 years 
west german authorities said someone phoned in a bomb threat 
against the toxic convoy but that the transport of the first 
shipment of nerve gas proceeded without any hitches 
it was the beginning of the end for the united states sole 
chemical weapons depot in europe a huge arsenal of 102000 
artillery shells covertly bunkered here since the cold war days as 
a deterrent against soviet aggression 
clausen residents breathed a collective sigh of relief while 
watching the removal of deadly weapons whose existence they were 
told about just a few months ago 
im glad theyre going said deputy mayor emil cronauer 
among the citizens lining clausens main street to watch the us 
army container trucks rumble by i think the same thing thats 
now happening with chemical weapons is going to happen to atomic 
weapons 
joseph wadle a 72yearold clausen resident echoed concerns 
among many germans about the safety of the transport im 
relieved that theyre being removed i just hope that everything 
goes well he said 
german residents werent the only ones curious about the parade 
of lethal chemicals 
soviet observers permitted to monitor some military operations 
under agreement with the west also watched the convoy us 
military officials said 
the lethal cargo destined for destruction on an atoll in the 
pacific ocean is being removed under a 1986 uswest german 
agreement the operation is costing 83 million 
a massive security operation guarded the cargo as a convoy of 
nearly 80 military vehicles left the us army depot at clausen 
west german police helicopters followed the convoy as it snaked 
along its route and crack west german paramilitary squads stood in 
fields along the highway or manned positions on overpasses 
green vans filled with west german paramilitary troopers were 
interspersed within the convoy riot helmets and shields could be 
seen through the vans rear windows 
the first trucks arrived at miesau 30 miles from clausen about 
2 hours later both towns are in the southwest part of the country 
clausen is 15 miles south of kaiserslautern and miesau is 18 
miles west of kaiserslautern 
at miesau the containers are to be loaded onto special trains 
that will take them to nordenham on the north sea where they will 
be placed aboard us navy ships for transport to johnston atoll 
the weapons will be destroyed at a later date in a specially 
built incinerator on the us atoll 800 miles southwest of hawaii 
the chemical weapons were hauled on 20 giant us army 
tractortrailer rigs the cargo was sealed in airtight containers 
other vehicles contained decontamination crews firefighters 
west german and american soldiers police monitoring teams and 
medical staff 
only four demonstrators were spotted they draped posters 
including one that said evil is simply being shifted from here 
to the pacific over a stone wall next a church along the convoy 
route in clausen 
west german activists were also angry that even though the 
presence of us chemical weapons on german soil was widely 
assumed washington refused to acknowledge their exact location 
until march 
the west german government is paying 31 million for removal of 
the chemical weapons and the us cost is 52 million 
the artillery shells some 6 inches in diameter some 8 inches 
are loaded with liquid nerve agents us military officials 
said they were brought to clausen between 1958 and 1968 where 
they have remained ever since 
one convoy will take the weapons daily from clausen to miesau 
over the next 30 days the rail transport to the north sea port 
will take about a week and will be conducted at night 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and former president reagan 
agreed in 1986 to remove the chemical weapons by 1992 president 
bush advanced the timetable 
lt gen john shalikashvili deputy commander in chief of us 
armyeurope defended what he said had been a joint usgerman 
decision to keep the weapons depot a secret the safety and 
security of those weapons dictated that their location remain 
classified he said

a federal prosecutor dropped his 
obscenity case thursday against a confiscated photograph of a nude 
father and son that was described as a recognized work of art 
having completed my review of this matter i am satisfied to 
the extent that i can be that there is no actionable child sexual 
victimization implicit in or resulting from the taking and 
production of this photograph us attorney richard s cohen 
said in a statement 
the maine arts commission called cohens retreat an extremely 
strong vote for the freedom of artistic expression 
the government had at first sought to destroy the picture a 
1962 work by photographer walter chappell that has been exhibited 
throughout the nation the picture shows a naked chappell holding 
his infant son next to his erect penis 
cohen said thursday the print had been returned to the attorney 
of its owner birgit lenderink who lives in a buddhist meditation 
center in barnet vt 
the governments case entitled united states of america vs 
one obscene photograph drew fire from artists as well as 
newspaper editorial writers who noted that the photograph was 
exhibited in many galleries and reprinted in a harper amp row book on 
american nude photography 
cohens statement also cited the ready availability of this 
photograph in other parts of the country 
federal officials seized the framed black and white print this 
winter at the state line in houlton as friends were trying to bring 
it to ms lenderink 
none of the people who made or possessed the picture were 
charged in the case 
chappell who lives in el rito nm a tiny farming community 
north of santa fe did not respond to messages left at his home by 
the associated press 
maine arts commission spokesman dick dyer said he understood how 
someone unfamiliar with chappells work could question the 
photograph 
when he cohen saw the image without any explanation 
whatsoever to his credit he did investigate said dyer were 
very pleased that he has had the wisdom to see through the process 
and decide not to prosecute the photograph 
the case was withdrawn from us district court in bangor

teachers will be the students at a new school 
designed to sharpen instructors math and science skills so they 
can pass those abilities to undereducated chicago youngsters 
i hope it will make the chicago public school system the 
number one system in the country a prototype for other big 
cities nobel laureate leon lederman said of the academy for 
mathematics and science teachers in chicago which was dedicated 
thursday 
classes at the academys south side campus are to begin in as 
early as september 
plans call for all elementary teachers and all secondary 
teachers of math and science a total of about 17000 public 
school instructors to attend the academy over the next six years 
teachers will typically attend the academy two or three days a 
week for up to 10 weeks with the rest of the week spent at their 
schools so they can try out their new skills 
we have to recognize that inner cities represent a repository 
of human resources not represented in math science and the 
technical areas said lederman who won the 1988 nobel prize in 
physics the world can get along very easily without us if we 
want to be a player we have to do something about math and 
science 
american public school students rank 18th out of worlds 20 most 
industrial nations in science knowledge officials said 
new teachers who want to work in chicagos 400000student 
public school system will be asked to first spend a year at the 
academy said acting director gordon berry a physicist on leave 
from argonne national laboratory 
we must reach out and bring all of americas children into 
science in greater numbers than ever before if our work force is to 
remain competitive in the global market secretary of energy 
james watkins said at the ribboncutting ceremony attended by about 
300 teachers 
the energy department will provide initial funding and technical 
assistance to the academy he said 
by initiating the academy in a major urban area we will be 
able to create new education opportunities for black hispanic and 
other students currently underrepresented in science and 
technology watkins said in a statement 
federal funding will account for 25 million of the academys 
annual 35 million operating budget said lederman who helped 
design the program the rest would come from city state and

four christian democrat ministers resigned from the 
government thursday night in a dispute over a proposed television 
law possibly threatening premier giulio andreottis fiveparty 
coalition 
the four ministers are part of a wing of the party loyal to 
former premier and party leader ciriaco de mita who was ousted 
from his leadership role last year 
one of the four education minister sergio mattarella said they 
were resigning because the government was trying to force through 
an amendment to the bill that would clash with european community 
regulations on tv advertising 
among other things the bill would give italian tv stations 
until 1993 to limit the number of commercial interruptions of 
films while ec norms call for this to be done by 1991 
however political observers saw the resignations as a 
continuation of an internal party struggle between de mita and 
andreotti 
it was not immediately clear what effect the resignations would 
have on the government but the five parties in the governing 
coalition have been saying that a crisis should be avoided during 
the six months beginning in july when italy holds the rotating 
presidency of the ec 
other than mattarella those resigning were state industry 
minister carlo francanzani defense minister mino martinazzoli and 
riccardo misasi minister of extraordinary aid to the south 
there are 16 christian democrat ministers in the 32member 
cabinet 
the other coalition parties are the socialists and the tiny 
republicans liberals and social democrats 
andreottis coalition the 49th government in italys postwar 
history has been in office since july 22 1989 
the television bill is part of a long sought law to regulate the 
countrys public and private airwaves parties have been wrangling 
over various versions of the bill for years

it was crude even lewd but this time fans 
were spared seeing where shes tattooed 
still many people said thursday that roseanne barr was a 
disgrace for her shrill rendition of the national anthem at a 
national league baseball doubleheader and a crude onfield gesture 
afterward 
chris roberts a sports reporter for kfi radio in los angeles 
said she couldnt carry a note if she was on her way to the post 
office 
but others said simply lighten up 
they maintained the corpulent caustic comedian who stars on the 
popular abctv sitcom roseanne did the best she could or may 
have become confused by the sound systems delay and resorted to 
shtick 
kfis entertainment reporter tracy miller said barr was doing a 
parody of baseball players when she grabbed her crotch and spit 
after singing the starspangled banner at wednesday nights 
games between the san diego padres and cincinnati reds 
in the stands during a world series game in oakland last fall 
barr bared her bottom revealing a tattoo declaring tom her 
husband tom arnold 
they knew what kind of singer she is shes just an average 
singer shes not an opera singer arnold told the associated 
press thursday from the couples malibu home she did the best 
she could 
barr who wouldnt come to the telephone was troubled by the 
criticism he said 
shes very sorry shes very upset that people think she meant 
disrespect we werent trying to disrespect that song at all 
arnold said 
noting the padres won both games arnold added i think they 
should have her back every night but we know that wont happen 
with all this grief 
in a television interview arnold complained that publicity 
about barr has become vicious its just out of control its 
only negative is she selfdestructing 
you cant call it selfdestructive when its being done to 
you barr told the interviewer from nbc news thats like the 
final icing on the cake that they do it to me and then call it 
selfdestructive but they do that to all women 
tom werner who became the chairman and managing partner of the 
padres this season also is the cocreator and executive producer 
of roseanne 
he met privately with padres officials for 45 minutes wednesday 
night and then refused to talk to reporters directly repeated 
messages left at his los angeles office went unanswered thursday 
padres officials said they fielded about 1200 calls thursday 
most of them complaints about barrs performance 
the team issued an apology saying 
the padres recognize their obligation to ensure that the 
national anthem is sung with respect and dignity it is 
apparent we did not do our part because many fans were offended 
both by the rendition and roseannes gestures to those fans we 
apologize and make the commitment that in the future we will strive 
to see the anthem is presented with the dignity it is due 
national league president bill white said we have discussed 
it with the padres and are in agreement with their apology we are 
satisfied that they will take all necessary steps to assure it will 
not happen again 
opera star robert merrill who has sung the national anthem in 
new yorks yankee stadium for 18 years was among those appalled by 
barrs performance 
this woman who obviously has no taste at all went out to 
sing the national anthem and distorted the song he said 
it was to me like burning of the flag it was like here i am 
and to hell with you it was a complete mockery and outlandish 
merrill who also has sung the anthem for nine us presidents 
added shes a disgrace did you see what she did when she walked 
off i almost upchucked my dinner i was ill to my stomach i dont 
know if ive ever felt that angry 
it isnt good for baseball baseball is like apple pie 
cracker jacks and peanuts its the national pastime this is a 
national disgrace 
about 30000 people attended the doubleheader at jack murphy 
stadium the club promoted the twin bill as working womens 
night 
i was embarrassed for the women who showed up said 
spectator jannette davis of san diego this was supposed to be a 
night of saluting those who worked hard and she made us all feel 
like crap 
barr who had said last week that she wouldnt be trying for 
laughs when she sang the national anthem plugged her ears with her 
hands at the start of the song then gave a wailing rendition 
when the boos rose barr grabbed herself and spit on the ground 
said padres pitcher eric show i cant believe it happened 
its an insult there are people who died for that song our 
national anthem exemplifies a lot of things 
barrs husband later made a ceremonial pitch but the crowd 
didnt react 
when barr left the field with him later though the boos 
resumed 
i think i did great and people wanted more barr told a 
reporter for kfmbtv before leaving the field

miami accuses former strongman gen manuel antonio noriega of 
involvement in murder torture and drug trafficking according to 
legal papers obtained thursday the government is seeking up to 
65 billion in damages 
the 40page suit obtained from government sources by the 
associated press carries a laundry list of accusations with 11 
specific charges including fraud illicit enrichment racketeering 
and offenses against the panamanian people 
the suit asks that noriega and his allies repay panama at least 
500 million in damages it also asks for any damage award to be 
tripled which would make for a maximum of 15 billion 
in addition the suit seeks a separate 5 billion punitive 
payment 
panamanian officials have said they do not expect to recover 
that full amount but intend it as a statement of damage done to 
panama they said the suit will be filed within days 
the suit outlines cases of alleged assassination torture drug 
trafficking money laundering embezzlement illegal sale of visas 
and passports and abuse of authority while noriega headed the 
defunct panama defense forces 
from that position he controlled panamas government until he 
was ousted in december by the us invasion noriega was brought 
back to miami where he now faces us drugtrafficking charges 
the 1988 us indictment accuses noriega of taking 46 million 
in bribes from colombias medellin drug cartel to turn panama into 
a way station for cocaine trafficking 
panamas suit claims noriega earned about 700000 during his 28 
years as a military officer but is now worth an estimated 300 
million 
the governments lawyers john g kester gregory b craig and 
kevin j hasson contend in the suit that noriegas activities 
caused panama enormous material losses the suit says panama 
was damaged by a loss of tourism and an american trade embargo 
the suit names 19 codefendants they include marcos justines 
noriegas chief of staff who is jailed in panama city carlos 
duque the 1989 presidential candidate of noriegas party michael 
harari a former israeli military officer three former 
ambassadors noriegas wife felicidad and his mistress vicki amado 
however it was not clear if the panamanian government could 
recover money from those codefendants not in the united states 
the suit claims noriega was involved in the murder of army 
officers who plotted against him 
it also says noriega was paid 795 million for letting drugs 
flow through panama and 4 million to 7 million for protecting 
members of colombias medellin drug cartel 
it says that during the eight years noriega headed the armed 
forces he sold at least eight government planes for 7 million 
which he kept it did not name any buyer 
the suit also claims noriega diverted 12 million in government 
agricultural funds to his own use 
it claims government functionaries issued government checks for 
about 96 million to pay personal debts and that 12 million of 
that amount went to noriega 
it also accuses noriega of selling 2000 illegal passports at 
50000 each 
panamas attorney general rogelio cruz is to go to washington 
this week to further discuss the suit with the law firm of williams

portauprince haiti ap former president carter said 
thursday that haiti is not ready for elections because of a climate 
of fear following the return from exile of figures linked to the 
duvalier regime 
carter spoke after meeting haitian leaders who are struggling to 
lead this impoverished caribbean nation toward its first free 
elections 
at present the climate is not conducive to holding 
elections carter said at a news conference theres much doubt 
about security and much doubt that election laws will be followed 
but carter wrapping up a twoday visit said he thinks there 
will be the proper climate months before the scheduled nov 4 
elections 
carter heading a delegation sponsored by the washingtonbased 
national democratic institute for international affairs met 
wednesday with provisional president ertha pascaltrouillot and 
armed forces commander lt gen herard abraham to discuss election 
security 
mrs pascaltrouillot was appointed provisional president in 
march after the ouster of military ruler lt gen prosper avril at 
that time there was great hope her civilian caretaker government 
could lead haiti to democracy but she is now viewed as exercising 
little control over the 6000member military 
haiti has been ruled by military force for most of its history 
since winning independence from france in 1804 
mrs pascaltrouillot has requested the united nations send 300 
civilian and 40 military officials to monitor the vote carter said 
he believes the united nations will approve that request 
carter has recently monitored elections in panama nicaragua and 
the dominican republic 
carter also said he received assurances from the military they 
would serve a warrant for the arrest of roger lafontant lafontant 
who returned to haiti from exile in early july reportedly headed 
the tonton macoutes private militia that enforced the duvalier 
dictatorship for 29 years until jeanclaude duvalier was deposed in 
1986 
the return of lafontant and other officials linked to brutal 
regimes has cast doubt a free and fair vote can occur 
the return of williams regala a retired army officer believed 
responsible for an electionday massacre in november 1987 has also 
alarmed haitians in the massacre thugs backed by soldiers shot or 
hacked to death 34 voters 
weve heard everywhere of the dangers of the presence of roger 
lafontant and williams regala said carter 
he said he hoped lafontant would leave the country and stay 
out of the country until after elections he said regala had 
indicated he would return to the united states where he has been 
exiled 
lafontant has hired three laywers to fight a warrant and has 
told the haitian media he wants to run for president

a provision that blocks drilling for natural 
gas and oil off the midatlantic coast was tacked onto compromise 
oil spill legislation thursday in a last minute maneuver that 
caught the petroleum industry by surprise 
the drilling plans by mobil corp which bought rights to leases 
40 miles off the coast of cape hatteras nearly a decade ago have 
been the focus of longstanding controversy in north carolina 
mobil and several other oil companies have plans to drill the 
leases in expectations of finding significant amounts of natural 
gas 
but rep walter jones dnc the chairman of a conference 
committee considering the oil spill bill won approval from his 
colleagues for an amendment that would block such drilling for at 
least 14 months and could cause further complications for mobil 
after that 
the compromise bill then was approved by a voice vote it now 
will be considered by both the house and senate for final passage 
jones amdendment approved despite opposition from oil state 
congressmen calls for no drilling by mobil until additional 
environmental studies are undertaken by a scientific panel it 
prohibits any leasing oil drilling or exploratory activity in the 
offshore areas near north carolina south carolina and part of 
virginia before oct 1 1991 
rep jack fields dtexas who has championed oil industry 
interests argued against the measure and said he had been notified 
of jones plans to offer the amendment only hours before 
this is a pure and simple moratorium declared rep ron 
marlenee rmont also in opposition he said he expects the 
provision to be challenged when the compromise oil spill bill comes 
up for final approval the senate members of the conference 
committee did not object to the measure 
president bush recently postponed oil lease sales along much of 
the us coast where there have been environmental concerns the 
midatlantic lease areas including the coastal area off north 
carolina were not included in bushs action 
this amendment establishes a fair process said jones in 
proposing his amendment as a concluding piece of business before 
the housesenate conferees took a final vote on the oil spill 
legsilation 
jones said his amendment establishes an objective benchmark to 
assess the adequacy of environmental information about drilling 
in the midatlantic areas of the outer continental shelf he said 
environmental impact studies used by mobil are outdated 
mobil and several other oil companies bought the leases off the 
carolinas in 1981 and 1983 in september 1988 mobil announced plans 
to explore for natural gas in the area prompting outcries from 
environmentalists and others in the region 
residents in the cape hatteras area have expressed concern about 
the impact drilling might have on tourism and recreational fishing 
state officials have refused to allow mobil to proceed but jones 
said there was fear the state might be overruled in washington

quebecs native affairs minister said 
thursday that food and medicine will be allowed to circulate freely 
past police barricades at oka and kahnawake where police and 
mohawks are in the third week of a showdown 
police have drawn criticism from residents and human rights 
groups for long rigorous searches of everyone going behind police 
lines at the two sites 
minister john ciaccia told a news conference there will be no 
restrictions in terms of the delivery of food it has never been 
the policy of this government to do that i want to clarify this 
once for all 
food supplies have sometimes run low in the kahnawake reserve 
south of montreal and in oka where a july 11 gun battle between 
mohawks and provincial police left one officer dead and began the 
long siege 
blame in the death has not been fixed 
police were trying to remove barricades the indians set up to 
protect a parcel of what they say is ancestral land designated to 
become the back nine holes of the local golf course 18 miles west 
of montrteal 
other armed mohawks have blockaded the mercier bridge to 
montreal island forcing commuters into long detours in sympathy 
with the mohawks at oka 
ciaccia said searches of people will continue but no food will 
be confiscated and people will not be detained for hours as they 
try to get past with supplies 
red cross relief convoys brought in some food and other basics 
but the mohawks complained it wasnt enough 
free passage of food was one condition laid down by the mohawks 
to get negotiations going again 
another condition was unimpeded access to mohawk positions by 
their advisers and lawyers ciaccia has not agreed to that 
tom siddon the federal indian affairs minister indicated to 
reporters in ottawa that the federal and quebec governments may be 
on the road to defusing the crisis but he suggested federal 
efforts to work out a land deal now must be matched by provincial 
efforts to resolve police and security issues with the mohawks 
federal and quebec officials the town of oka and french 
developer maxime rousseau who owns some of the disputed land have 
reportedly been working on a deal that would see canada buy the 
land and hand it over to the mohawks 
area residents have expressed fear for their lives and property 
in the event of another clash 
but maj gerald baril public relations officer for the army in 
quebec told a news conference in montreal the canadian army has no 
plans for any attacks on mohawk barricades in the area 
baril said quebec has not asked for military intervention and 
there is no indication they will ask

thursday they believe the group has killed at least 41 people in 
human sacrifices to protect their marijuana crop

arrows they quoted the cult leaders chief aide as saying each 
arrow represents the spirit of a person killed 
fourteen men and boys suspected of participating in the occult 
rites were arrested thursday and placed in a nayarit state prison 
in the state capital of tepic after making statements to 
authorities

cultivating marijuana near acaponeta in the remote mountain region 
on the border of nayarit and durango states 450 miles northwest of 
mexico city 
group members are being held for homicide arms possession 
criminal association and drug charges

slaying people in devilworshipping rituals reminiscent of the palo 
mayombe religion from the congo in africa

clay monkey they called el amigo or the friend 
they said they had not yet unearthed any bodies but they said 
they found a dagger and bloodstains in caves 
however alleged cult leader olayo soto soto told the associated 
press on thursday he is not a devil worshiper those are rumors 
and lies of the authorities soto said in an interview at police 
headquarters before being taken to jail 
his righthand man esteban mendoza cervantes 19 testified 
that each of the 41 arrows in police possession represents the 
spirit a victim sacrificed in rituals carried on since 1983 
nayarit district attorneys investigator jose fernando armas 
hernandez said the arrows appeared to be tipped in blood 
in an earlier drugcult case police in april 1989 found 15 
bodies buried on a ranch near the northern city of matamoros across 
the usmexico border from brownsville texas 
they claimed the victims were slain by drug smugglers who 
believed human sacrifices would protect them from police 
four members of that group are on trial in mexico city and 
matamoros group leader adolfo de jesus constanzo and his bodyguard 
died of gunshot wounds as police closed in on them in a mexico city 
apartment in may 1989

the house on thursday left intact funds for 
abortions in the district of columbia but cut money for the citys 
university in what officials there say is a dispute over art and 
obscenity 
the spending bill allocating 542 million for fiscal 1991 was 
adopted by a 241178 vote 
provisions allowing abortions for poor women in the nations 
capital were included in the resolution without a floor fight even 
though president bush has repeatedly threatened to veto such a 
measure and has successfully done so in the past 
city funds not federal money would be used to pay for such 
operations said rep chris smith rnj 
dc funds pay for abortions upon demand the language was 
included even though the city budget got sent back to congress 
twice last year because of white house opposition to the inclusion 
of abortion language he said 
the house also voted 297123 in favor of an amendment by rep 
stan parris rva to cut 16 million from the 948 million 
appropriation for the university of the district of columbia 
that amount matches a bond issue approved by the city council 
that would pay for renovation of the carnegie library in downtown 
washington where the sculpture the dinner party by feminist 
artist judy chicago is to be permanently displayed 
the ceramic piece depicts a large triangular table that contains 
female genitalia on 39 place settings the universitys board of 
trustees approved spending 80000 of school funds to transport the 
work from california where it is stored to washington 
nira hardon long chairwoman of the university trustees said 
the acquisition of the sculpture would serve as the centerpiece of 
the schools endowment she called the expenditure seed money 
this has no bearing on the universitys ability to pay its 
employees she said at the news conference announcing the 
acquisition of the sculpture 
parris disputed that saying that several critics had called the 
work obscene and also that the university was lagging in paying 
its employees 
i have no quarrel with people who like the sculpture and i 
have no desire to act as a censor he said 
the senate still has to take up the bill

congressional district had mixed reactions to the reprimand issued 
to us rep barney frank thursday but many remained supportive of 
their congressman 
im torn said nicole tufo 21 who was jogging through 
newton thursday i think what he did was wrong but i guess i feel 
bad for him 
newton city clerk edward g english said thursday he still 
supports frank english cited a letter the congressman wrote him in 
1981 congratulating him for 10 years of public service 
at a time when so many negative things are being said about 
people in public life it is important to remind people especially 
young people that public service can be a noble cause the 
letter read 
i think he still believes in those principles english said 
the house voted thursday to reprimand frank dmass for using 
his influence on behalf of a male prostitute the 40818 vote 
imposed the lightest punishment the full house could have given 
frank apologized to the house and told a hushed chamber he was 
being punished in part for actions he took to conceal my 
homosexuality at a time when he had not yet made his gay 
lifestyle public 
others expressed hope that the incident would finally be over 
im sad for barney said newton mayor thomas mann im sad 
for everybody thats gone through so much i wonder how well others 
would have taken this its a very sad experience for all of us 
brookline resident kathi sadow who was shopping at a local mall 
thursday praised frank despite the house action 
im pleased he was just reprimanded even though i have some 
concerns about the whole thing hes an extremely good congressman 
who showed extremely bad judgment and well vote for him again 
tom dole a framingham mechanic paused outside his garage and 
said he did not support frank 
you got to look at it this way he said what did they do 
to gerry studds theyre all crooks i wouldnt vote for him i

dole was referring to us rep studds dmass the only other 
acknowledged homosexual member of the house who was censured in 
1983 for sexual relations with a male congressional page 
ina gibson of roxbury echoed the sentiments of many as she 
praised frank 
barney frank has been a very good politician she said i 
think hes done a good job his personal life is his own business

the fbi has a team of agents that targeted 
julian bond andrew young and other black leaders for undercover 
sting operations marion barrys lawyer said thursday at the 
mayors cocaine and perjury trial 
r kenneth mundy said the team operated in atlanta chicago and 
california as well as during the jan 18 sting in which barry was 
arrested after being videotaped smoking crack cocaine 
the fbi initially said it would be inappropriate to comment on 
an ongoing trial but the agency later issued a statement that said 
mundys allegations were totally unfounded and categorically 
denied 
after testimony ended for the day barry told reporters as he 
left the courtroom i got the impression that stern is notorious 
for going around the country trying to sting black elected 
officials 
mundys contentions came as the defense neared the end of its 
case questioning agent ronald stern one of the participants in 
the barry sting the defense spent the day trying to prove the fbi 
had entrapped barry 
stern in effect moves around the country as the head of an 
assault force of fbi agents mundy said during in a bench 
conference 
the jury could not hear the discussion and us district court 
judge thomas penfield jackson refused to allow mundy to question 
stern about the allegations 
mundy said he wanted to put his comments on the record in case 
there was an appeal in the case 
prior to coming here to organize and orchestrate the sting 
against mr barry mr stern had been in atlanta trying to set up a 
sting of julian bond andrew young and two other black politicians 
and public figures in atlanta mundy said 
alice bond then the wife of former georgia state sen julian 
bond told atlanta police in 1987 that her estranged husband and 
other prominent officials had used cocaine she recanted her story 
after a telephone conversation with thenmayor andrew young 
bond denied using drugs and was never charged young who faces 
an aug 7 runoff for the democratic gubernatorial nomination was 
criticized for calling mrs bond 
asked about mundys statements a spokesman for young nehl 
horton said in atlanta we have no knowledge of that 
whatsoever 
mundy said the information came from two lawyers for government 
witnesses in the barry case a congressional office and a figure 
convicted in the hud scandal 
mundy said the fbi approached a halfdozen women in the life 
of mr barry and tried to get them to cooperate money was 
offered to them but the women refused mundy said 
the defese mundy said had been prepared to present witnesses 
to back up his statements and that several black female fbi agents 
were offered the role of undercover agent but turned it down 
because they considered it to be morally repulsive 
a law enforcement source speaking on condition of anonymity 
denied mundys assertions that other black agents turned down the 
sting operation or that a series of women were offered money to 
participate in an undercover operation against the mayor 
stern testified earlier that agents were ready to abandon the 
sting until the mayor suddenly asked for crack cocaine an 
undercover agent carrying crack had left the room after barry said 
he didnt want any and as far as we were concerned the 
operation was over he said 
mr barry called them back into the room stern said 
barry was arrested after being videotaped smoking the crack 
stern said barry was allowed to smoke the crack because to have 
stopped the operation before he did would have provided barry too 
many possible defenses 
he could have called his security agents and said this woman 
just gave me drugs i want her arrested stern said 
a federal prosecutor was in a nearby hotel room watching the 
operation and advised the agents that barry taking the cocaine was 
not sufficient for an arrest stern said 
mundy claimed that sting operations are usually completed once 
the subject possesses the drugs he has said the government 
endangered barrys health by allowing him to ingest the drugs 
mundy said the fbi had pushed the case too far after barry 
repeatedly denied opportunities to use drugs but stern said 
barry brought up the subject of drugs as soon as he entered the 
room by asking former model rasheeda moore whether she had been 
good 
prior to the operation miss moore told me mr barry will ask 
if ive been good stern said she told me that denotes drugs 
ms moore testified earlier that she and barry used drugs over 
100 times and had code words to refer to the drugs 
stern said that while they expected barry to bring drugs to 
the room or ask for drugs after he got there the government had 
some on hand as a contingency 
barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession three 
counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy jury selection for 
the trial began june 4

a north korean broadcast said friday 
that five north korean citizens will cross the heavily fortified 
border into south korea during the day officials said 
on thursday communist north and capitalist south agreed to have 
their prime ministers meet in an unprecedented attempt to end 
hostility but within an hour of signing a row over the border 
crossing had the nations trading insults again 
the five were invited to seoul for a twoday meeting to plan a 
joint unification rally with south korean dissidents scheduled for 
aug 15 
it would be the first crossing by civilians with approval of 
both governments on the divided korean peninsula since a 1985 
family exchange 
south korean authorities quoted north korea as saying the five 
will pass over at panmunjom the truce village in the demilitarized 
zone and asking that they be met by the south korean dissidents 
south korea cautioned it will allow the border crossing only if 
north korea follows agreedupon rules to coordinate crossings 
between the two governments 
the five originally were expected to cross the border thursday 
they arrived at the frontier but a lastminute glitch developed 
over seouls housing arrangements south korea wanted the group to 
stay in a luxury hotel citing security reasons the north koreans 
wanted to stay with south korean dissidents at a church house and 
travel in the dissidents cars 
the outcome of that wrangle was not immediately disclosed 
namecalling protests and rhetoric over the accommodations 
issue threatened to cloud the premiers talks 
north and south korea were divided in 1945 at the end of world 
war ii despite years of hostility and a threeyear civil war in 
the early 1950s unification of their homeland remains a cherished 
dream by koreans on both sides of the border 
a political show said lee haehak one of three south 
korean dissident leaders who had gone to the truce village of 
panmunjom to welcome the north koreans 
down with president roh taewoo who blocks unification 
the dissidents shouted on thursday after being told the border 
crossing was canceled our desire is unification the three 
sang 
but even then south koreas unification minister hong 
sungchul insisted our door remains open 
paik nam jun north koreas chief delegate at the prime 
ministers talks warned that disputes over the unification rally 
could spill over into the premiers talks north korean radio 
blasted south korea for poking their nose into the rally and 
laying artificial hurdles to foil 
the 19point agreement for prime ministers talks calls for the 
two sides to meet in seoul sept 47 and again in the norths 
capital of pyongyang oct 1619 
by signing the accord north koreas communist government 
granted tacit recognition to the legitimacy of the seoul government 
for the first time since separate governments were formed in 1948 
this precious fruit will open a decisive chapter in a road to 
ending national division and achieving peaceful unification said 
south korean chief delegate song hanho 
songs north korean counterpart paik said the agreement will 
open a new chapter in the history of the national division 
the two prime ministers kang younghoon of south korea and yon 
hyung muk of north korea are ceremonial figureheads with little 
policymaking roles but their meeting would be symbolically 
significant as they would be the highestranking officials of the 
rival states to ever meet 
the outcome of the rally and the prime ministers talks are seen 
as a gauge of future korean relations 
the rally would mark the first contact between civilian 
organizations of the two koreas in the past south korean 
authorities have blocked such contacts out of fear they could turn 
into radical antiseoul protests 
proposed sites for the rally include the capitals of either 
north or south korea or panmunjom the aug 15 date is the 45th 
anniversary of the liberation of korea from japanese colonial rule 
and is a sentimental holiday on both sides of the border 
south korea offered last week to open its border to north 
koreans for unrestricted travel for five days starting aug 13 it 
challenged north korea to do the same for south koreans 
north korea has said it would open the border on a limited basis 
on aug 15 to koreans desiring unification

at the bottom among us presidents in terms of their civil 
rights records

explorer sir ranulph fiennes was awarded 181000 
in libel damages wednesday for an article in the canadian magazine 
macleans which said his exploits achieved nothing of historical 
or scientific value 
the magazine said it will appeal 
a high court jury in london took only 40 minutes to decide that 
fiennes was justified in complaining that an article in the weekly 
magazine was nasty meanminded and spiteful he asked the jury 
to nail the lie that his expeditionary efforts were valueless 
the april 1988 article said prince charles always supports 
him claiming great results for british exports but no one has 
ever been able to demonstrate that any scientific or historical 
benefits have resulted 
the damages and an estimated 135750 in legal costs were 
awarded against editor kevin doyle journalist allan fotheringham 
and british publishers maclean hunter the defendants denied the 
words bore any defamatory meaning 
i feel completely vindicated but i will have to wait for it 
to sink in properly fiennes 46 said after the verdict 
his wife virginia who accompanied him on many expeditions 
said the damages are astonishingly high we never expected 
anything like that 
judge sir michael davies imposed a freeze order on all but 
13500 of the award pending a possible appeal by the magazine on 
the issues of liability and damages 
in toronto doyle said an appeal has been filed 
doyle said of the amount awarded i think the award was crazy 
it was not commensurate with the words that were written 
fiennes flew home for the threeday trial from dhofar in the 
persian gulf state of oman where he is preparing for an 
archaeological expedition in search of remains of the sumerians 
founders of the babylonian culture in about 4000 bc 
he told the jury the article poked fun at him and his 
background calling him a professional bore and a cadger of 
the first order 
he said macleans sells 600000 copies in canada and only 400 in 
britain but it goes to the foreign office foreign libraries and 
embassies 
summing up the judge said the whole article might suggest that 
fiennes was an upper class twit not a real explorer but a 
bumbling playboy 
fiennes said there was danger that potential sponsors of his 
future expeditions would withdraw financial backing if they read 
the article 
the explorer is a former army officer who has led expeditions to 
both poles sudan and norway and one around the worlds polar axis 
as well as a score of research projects

a honduran drug trafficker was found guilty 
thursday of racketeering kidnapping and conspiracy in the 1985 
abduction of us drug agent enrique camarena and his pilot who 
were killed in mexico 
the jury that convicted juan ramon matta ballesteros acquitted 
him of camarenas murder a crime that has strained relations 
between the united states and mexico 
mattas lawyer martin stolar said outside court the verdict 
was inconsistent and showed jury confusion 
stolar told reporters he believed extensive testimony about drug 
trafficking and corruption in the mexican government had distracted 
jurors from the main issue camarenas killing and had created 
the confusion 
he said he would appeal the convictions and asked us district 
judge edward rafeedie to overrule the jurys findings 
matta was one of four defendants charged in the camarena case 
but the jurors did not return verdicts against the others 
they didnt give a progress report on deliberations on the other 
three defendants and rafeedie told the they could return friday to 
resume their deliberations 
the 31yearold camarena was kidnapped off a street in 
guadalajara mexico in february 1985 tortured and interrogated by 
drug lords before being slain along with his mexican pilot alfredo 
zavala avelar 
after camarenas battered body was discovered a month later 
mexican authorities eventually pinned the blame on rafael caro 
quintero a swaggering 29yearold leader of the powerful 
guadalajara drug cartel 
camarenas colleagues were skeptical that the reckless 
illiterate rafa had acted alone the american authorities 
broadened their investigation to seek out the brains in the cartel 
including members of mexicos power elite and matta a wealthy 
honduran businessman also known as el negro 
prosecutors have said the cartel was incensed after camarenas 
undercover work led to the november 1984 seizure of 10000 tons of 
marijuana 
the trial was the second stemming from camarenas murder a 
crime which angry us authorities characterized as a reflection of 
official corruption in mexico 
judge rafeedie also presided over the first trial which 
resulted in the conviction of three men in 1988 
disputes between mexico and the united states over the case have 
erupted on several occasions throughout the investigation and 
trials 
earlier this month mexico said it would seek the extradition of 
a los angelesbased dea agent and a mexican informant who allegedly 
plotted the kidnapping of a guadalajara doctor accused in the 
killing 
matta a ealthy honduran businessman showed little reaction to 
the verdict except to shake his head slightly as if in disbelief 
mattas stature in his native honduras was such that his forced 
extradition in 1988 touched off street riots that left five people 
dead and torched the us embassy annex hondurans apparently were 
angered by the extradition and alarmed that mattas prosecution 
might harm the nations economy because he owned so many businesses 
tears streamed down the faces of his family who sat in the 
courtroom as the verdicts were announced 
earlier this year matta was convicted by another jury of 
operating a cocaine smuggling business 
matta was convicted in the ninth day of jury deliberations on 
charges of racketeering in the kidnapping and murder of camarena 
conspiring to kidnap camarena and the actual crime of kidnapping 
the agent and holding him for interrogation 
but jurors rejected the count that charged matta with actually 
murdering the us drug enforcement administration agent 
sentencing was set for sept 25 
earlier the jury had suggested in a note to the judge that some 
of the counts seemed to be convicting the defendant twice for the 
same crime a possible reason for the split verdict 
stolar insisted in his outofcourt statements that matta was 
tried illegally both in the camarena case and in the earlier drug 
trafficking case because he had been kidnapped from tegucigalpa by 
american authorities 
stolar had filed numerous challenges based on mattas arrest 
and all were rejected on appeal matta has been serving a life 
sentence on the drug conviction 
the dea has vowed to capture every person involved in the 
slaying so far 22 people have been charged in this country and 
more than 20 convicted in mexico among those held is rafael caro 
quintero alleged leader of the drug operation 
the other defendants in the current trial who were present 
during the reading of verdicts against matta were ruben zuno 
arce a guadalajara businessman who is the brotherinlaw of former 
mexican president luis echeverria juan jose bernabe ramirez a 
former mexican homicide officer and javier vasquez velasco a 
former bodyguard accused of murdering two american tourists in an 
apparent mistake killing

ethiopias foreign minister said thursday the 
east african country is abandoning communist goals and wants to 
improve relations with the united states 
foreign minister tesfaye dinka also accused eritrean insurgents 
who control parts of northern ethiopia of blocking food relief 
shipments to ethiopians threatened with starvation as a result of 
the 29year rebellion he appealed for international pressure for 
the rebels to relent 
the accusation echoed a statement earlier this week by andrew 
natsios an american disaster assistance official who said the 
rebels had closed massawa port to a foodladen danish freighter 
flying the un flag 
tesfayes comments came at a news conference prior to his 
meeting with deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
marking one of the highestlevel usethiopian talks in a decade 
later tesfaye called called his onehour meeting with 
eagleburger an important milestone toward improving relations 
long downgraded in disagreement over human rights abuses in 
ethiopia 
the foreign minister denied any kind of linkage between a 
supply of weapons from israel to ethiopian jews being allowed to 
emigrate he said ethiopia had not received any arms from israel 
since reopening relations with the jewish state last november 
the ethiopian and israeli governments are in complete 
understanding on the emigration issue and the flow of emigrants 
is continuing he said 
a us official who insisted on anonymity said that a reported 
supply of israeli weapons for ethiopia was limited to rifles and 
did not include cluster bombs which ethiopia was said to be seeking 
for use against the rebels 
the ethiopian government led by mengistu haile mariam is 
undertaking economic and political changes that will result in a 
marketoriented economy greater incentives for domestic and 
foreign investors and political diversity tesfaye said 
he said 65 percent to 70 percent of ethiopias economy always 
had been operated by an entrenched private sector 
perestroika the soviet reform policy helped influence the 
changes in ethiopia he said adding that relations with moscow 
remain good 
tesfaye said he was hopeful of improved usethiopian relations 
after a meeting wednesday with assistant secretary of state herman 
cohen 
the two governments have maintained lowlevel diplomatic 
relations without ambassadors for the past 10 years amid 
disagreement over repression and human rights abuse in ethiopia

a juror who phoned members of the medellin 
drug cartel was kicked off a panel deciding a 32 million drug 
moneylaundering case thursday but the remaining 11 jurors 
continued deliberating 
us district judge william terrell hodges scolded the juror 
robert skip spanczak but decided the incident wasnt 
prejudicial enough to declare a mistrial in the case of five 
international bankers and a colombian associated with the bank of 
credit and commerce international 
it was simply curiosity on my part and nothing happened 
spanczak a 54yearold clearwater limousine driver explained to 
the judge during a threehour hearing nothing came of this you 
know no real bad intent was meant 
hodges sent spanczak home with a warning not to talk about the 
case until a verdict is reached but decided against charging him 
with contempt of court 
but he immediately sequestered the 11 remaining members of the 
panel which has sat through more than six months of testimony and 
was in its fifth day of deliberations 
in spanczaks account released in court transcripts he 
admitted making a call to colombia on friday the first day of jury 
deliberations 
he said he dialed a number taken from an address book that 
authorities seized from one of the defendants rudolf armbrecht of 
colombia when armbrecht was arrested in october 1988 prosecutors 
introduced the book as evidence and testimony indicated the 
numbers belonged to members of the drug cartel 
spanczak said a spanishspeaking man answered and later passed 
the phone to a man who spoke broken english when the juror asked 
to speak about armbrecht the reply was no no no 
but jurors said they received a different version of spanczaks 
call when he told them about it over lunch they said the voice on 
the phone simply told him to destroy the number and never call 
again 
another juror told the fbi that spanczak conducted his own 
investigation of armbrecht because he once said he would do 
anything it took to nail this guy 
the jurors husband reported the incident to the fbi which 
reportedly relayed the information to the us attorneys office 
and the judge 
attorneys and defendants in the case refused to comment on the 
judges decision to proceed with the case because a gag order has 
been in effect since the beginning of the trial 
the bank of credit and commerce international officials were 
arrested oct 6 1988 at a bachelor party and wedding staged by 
the us customs service to lure them to tampa 
they are accused of conspiring with an undercover customs agent 
to launder 14 million in proceeds from the sale of cocaine in six 
us cities during the twoyear investigation the government 
processed 32 million in partnership with a medellin cash launderer 
two subsidiaries of the luxembourgbased bank known as bcci 
pleaded guilty in january to the moneylaundering charges and 
forfeited 15 million to the government by far the largest 
laundering penalty ever assessed against a bank 
the defendants in the case are ian howard and sibte hassan of 
bccis paris branch amjad awan who is from a prominent pakistani 
family and akbar a bilgrami of the banks miami branch syed 
aftab hussain who worked in panama and the colombian aircraft 
broker armbrecht 
awan has claimed to be deposed panamanian ruler manuel noriegas 
personal banker

apparently successful in intimidating 
kuwait into ending oil overproduction iraq has agreed to pull 
thousands of troops back from the countries disputed border and 
negotiate diplomatic sources say 
official iraqi newspapers suddenly stopped their daily attacks 
on kuwait today diplomatic sources said late wednesday that tens 
of thousands of troops reportedly sent to the border earlier this 
week by president saddam hussein would begin withdrawing today 
but saddam has not backed down on demands that kuwait cut oil

field that straddles the countries border and forgive billions of 
dollars in loans 
oilrich iraq strapped for cash after a fall in crude prices 
and a costly war with iran last week threatened military action

as a state judge nine years ago supreme 
court nominee david souter urged new hampshires legislature not to 
adopt a law that would have empowered judges to approve abortions 
for minors if their parents refuse permission 
souter did not express a personal stand on the issue but said 
his fellow judges had decided that a measure then pending before 
the state legislature would promote shopping for judges because 
it did not include guidelines on how judges should act therefore 
he said the bill would unfairly leave such decisions up to 
individual judges with varied opinions on abortion resulting in 
inconsistent application of any such law 
the 1981 letter written to the chairwoman of the legislative 
committee considering a parental consent bill is one of souters 
few public actions addressing the abortion issue 
in his one abortionrelated decision on the issue as a judge 
souter gave little insight as to how he might vote if confirmed and 
confronted with the opportunity to overturn the 1973 roe vs wade 
decision legalizing abortion

some policemen react to the slaughter 
of comrades by the drug lords hired killers with the midnight 
knock torture and summary executions say witnesses and relatives 
of civilian victims 
a teenager in a medellin slum said he was standing on a corner 
a few weeks ago when a car roared up and screeched to a halt 
some men jumped out and tried to shove me into the trunk he 
said i fought back and managed to get away when neighbors of my 
family started screaming 
hundreds of other slum youngsters suspected of taking drug money 
to kill policemen have been less fortunate 
more than 200 policemen in the medellin area have been killed 
this year in a war between the cocaine cartel and security forces 
no official figures are available on slain teenagers but the 
weekly news magazine la semana said in its july 16 edition that 
medellin death squads had killed about 1500 people in 1990 
mayor omar florez of medellin said there was little doubt some 
policemen and soldiers were violating human rights 
security forces who act outside the law are aggravating the 
state of violence and must be held accountable for their actions 
he said in an interview 
so far the central government in bogota has been unwilling or 
unable to stop the killings which occur almost daily 
people are snatched from the streets of slums and their bodies 
bound hand and foot often turn up in vacant lots or along highways 
the attorney generals office has concluded in the past that 
policemen were involved in death squads medellin police deny the 
accusations and say most of the killings result from gang rivalry 
emilio suarez a 62yearold resident of medellin said of the 
war between drug traffickers and police you in the united states 
see this as a battle of the good guys against the bad guys but we 
view it as the bad guys against the bad guys 
a woman who lives in the el playon slum spoke tearfully of her 
15yearold son now dead 
the law itself killed my boy he was just a regular 
hardworking high school student that boy was my last hope we are 
poor and i was counting on him for survival 
she and many others interviewed asked that their names not be 
used they were afraid of being killed by one side or the other 
death squad activity has diluted public confidence in the 
authorities the fact that officials have so little support from 
the people explains their failure in smashing the drug trade a 
human rights activist said 
he said the human rights organization he leads had scores of 
reports of murder disappearances and torture committed by 
policemen and soldiers 
people are blindfolded hanged by the neck beaten with sticks 
or forced to spend the night with bags over their heads while being 
questioned he said 
the army and police have become a symbol of death the 
activist declared they are carrying out a policy of 
extermination 
he asked not to be identified because his three predecessors 
were murdered 
mayor florez has invited victims of police abuse to speak out 
and press charges 
we are trying to reach the people to tell them they can come 
to us the mayors office for help but they are mostly keeping 
quiet because a climate of terror has been created here he said 
the mother of the murdered 15yearold said she was too 
frightened to step forward because i have been told that i too 
would be killed if i say anything 
president virgilio barco has been praised abroad for the 
crackdown on drug traffickers he began a year ago but domestic 
critics say his emergency measures opened the way to human rights 
violations 
cesar gaviria the president elect told reporters recently the 
government cannot fight the drug war with repression alone 
the countrys gravest problem now is violence in medellin and 
this will require special treatment from my government a treatment 
that transcends just military police and public order measures 
he said 
gaviria who takes office aug 7 pledged to support florezs 
100 million plan for rebuilding poor neighborhoods in this city of 
2 million people 
julio jaramillo a priest who recently published a study of 
medellin violence said the president and national security chiefs 
still had enough public support to bring offending policemen to 
justice 
many ranking officers have been replaced during an ambitious 
reorganization of the army and police begun in june 
florez said the shakeup would demonstrate that the governments 
intentions were good and will create an atmosphere which will 
allow people to trust authorities again

rhode islands us senate race is a 
study in contrasts and a contest between soulmates it is a matchup 
between two very different individuals with very similar voting 
records 
democratic sen claiborne pell is 71 his gop challenger rep 
claudine schneider is 43 
pell is a dignified softspoken man usually with a rumpled 
suit draped over his tall bony frame miss schneider is a zealous 
energetic woman given to wearing brightly colored dresses and known 
more by her first name than her last 
the ideological differences between them are subtle if any 
says washington analyst charles cook 
name one member of congress whos like either one of them 
cook said you cant 
although intense campaigning wont begin until labor day pell 
has the early advantage he held a 51 percent to 36 percent lead 
over miss schneider in a recent brown university poll a lead that 
has grown since an earlier survey in february the latest poll had 
a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points 
pell also has the edge at the bank as of june 30 his warchest 
was double that of miss schneiders 13 million to 627000 
but those numbers could change quickly in a race where both 
candidates have popularity ratings higher than 80 percent neither 
candidate has any opposition in rhode islands sept 11 primary 
even when it comes to the paranormal there arent many 
distinctions between the two candidates both have been called a 
bit eccentric because of their wellpublicized affinities for such 
subjects pell for his interest in ufos and miss schneider for 
hers in astrology 
it is a race where both candidates have pledged to keep 
themselves out of the negativecampaigning gutter each has aired 
commercials that dont mention the others name 
last week miss schneider launched the first real offensive of 
the campaign but rather than call pell a liar she politely asked 
him to correct misleading information about a social security 
proposal 
nor does she have a monopoly on manners pell ordered his 
campaign manager mary beth cahill to call miss schneiders 
campaign to inform them that his first commercial would be airing 
the next day 
i was stunned said ellen conaway miss schneiders campaign 
manager in all my years in the business ive never seen anyone 
telegraph their moves like that 
i expect as positive a campaign as both of us can wage i know 
it will be on my side pell said ive always sought to talk 
about my own plans not to mention or be critical of my adversary 
except for correcting my record i would not want to go negative 
myself 
miss schneiders challenge is to attract democratic votes in a 
heavily democratic state she has done it in the past but not 
against pell 
after 10 years in the house she told a meeting of pawtucket 
rotarians recently i am of the opinion that if i cant be in a 
position of greater power i do not want to remain in public 
service 
the senators camp believes miss schneider cant give voters a 
good reason to make the switch 
voters hoping to find some clarity in the candidates voting 
records are out of luck miss schneider long considered a gop 
maverick voted against president bush more often than did pell 
pell supported bushs position 51 times in 1989 and opposed the 
white house 48 times according to the providence business news 
miss schneider voted with the administration 38 times and opposed 
it on 56 occasions 
miss schneider is a firm believer in the adage of former house 
speaker thomas p tip oneill that all politics is local a 
line she repeats often 
pell on the other hand is chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee a prestigious post but not one that lends 
itself to local politics 
therefore pell plays up his work in education its hard to 
find a college student or graduate who hasnt heard of pell grants 
a source of federal aid for millions of needy students 
its been a long time since either candidate faced serious 
competition 
pell won with 73 percent of the vote in 1984 and 75 percent in 
1978 miss schneider lost to democratic rep edward beard in 1978 
but beat him two years later and her winning margins have increased 
steadily since in 1986 and 1988 she won reelection with 72 
percent of the vote

it is time for another generation to learn about 
edward r murrow a cbs newsman who died 25 years ago 
and there is no better way to begin than with edward r 
murrow this reporter airing monday nights on pbs series 
american masters for the next two weeks 
director susan steinberg and writer ed apfel wisely let murrows 
story tell itself with archival footage and interviews with his 
colleagues friends and family its narrated by the gorgeous 
beefsteak voice of charles kuralt 
this reporter is a definitive tv portrait of americas 
greatest broadcast journalist murrow personified the highest 
standards of his craft and ended his 22year career as its 
conscience and its prophet 
murrows broadcast career began in 1937 when he was a cbs news 
executive sent to europe to set up a network of correspondents to 
cover the gathering storm from the start he insisted on good 
reporters not professional announcers 
murrows boys who included eric sevareid howard k smith 
charles collingwood william shirer richard c hottelet and bill 
shadel reported world war ii from all fronts murrow though 
became the greatest of them 
this is london his deep resonant baritone reported 
from the embattled city at the height of the blitz electrifying 
the us radio audience in the days before this country entered 
world war ii 
after the war with the advent of television he and his 
colleagues learned the new medium virtually inventing the form of 
tv news documentary 
murrows high furrowed brow and everpresent cigarette he 
smoked three or four packs a day were trademarks of his weekly 
prime time news show see it now which began in 1951 
he took television to cover its first war korea in 1952 
in 1953 see it now reported the case of an air force 
officer who was discharged on the grounds that his father and 
sister were communist sympathizers public reactions forced the 
officers reinstatement 
it was the first time i think that ed and all of us 
understood the power of television said murrows longtime 
producer fred w friendly who went on to head cbs news 
murrows career peaked in march 1954 when see it now 
reported on sen joseph mccarthy rwis and his demagogic 
redbaiting investigation of alleged communist infiltration of the 
us government murrows wrapup 
the actions of the junior senator from wisconsin have caused 
alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad and given considerable 
comfort to our enemies and whose fault is that not really his he 
didnt create this situation of fear he merely exploited it and 
rather successfully cassius was right the fault dear brutus is 
not in our stars but in ourselves 
then brow furrowed murrow ended with his trademark closing 
goodnight and good luck 
it was one of the greatest moments in television history it 
marked the beginning of the end for mccarthyism and it marked the 
beginning of murrows downfall 
he had become too powerful and cbs knew it over the next six 
years his declining health let the network erode his power and 
influence no journalist ever again will be as powerful 
in a 1958 speech murrow accused television of breaking its 
promise 
if this instrument is good for nothing but to entertain amuse 
and insulate then the tube is flickering now and we will soon see 
that the struggle is lost he said 
this instrument can teach it can illuminate yes and even it 
can inspire but it can do so only to the extent that humans are 
determined to use it to those ends otherwise its nothing but 
wires and lights in a box 
murrow died of lung cancer on april 27 1965 as eric sevareid 
said on that day he was a shooting star we will live in his 
afterglow a very long time 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
elsewhere in television 
further evidence that murrow was right words like 
shudderingly hideous stupid and awful just bubble 
right out of people whove seen room for romance a onehour 
anthology series starting on cbs tonight 
its brought to you by douglas s cramer whos partly to blame 
for love boat the publicity says the shows about the happy 
poignant romantic and humorous situations facing residents of an 
upscale apartment building 
right and love boat was an epic of the sea 
rebecca harrell plays an awful precocious wisecracking kid 
dom irrerra plays a sardonic concierge don novello best known as 
father guido sarducci was supposed to play him but must have seen 
the script 
room for romance takes dead aim on issues of the day 
unfortunately the day is sometime in the 70s and the issues are 
superstition breaking up and living with your fiancee its so 
stupid itll take points off your iq 
you have been warned

the strong turnout was reflected in 
clayton williams broad grin 
it was 9 am on a weekday morning and more than 150 people 
were gathered on the treeshaded lawn of the cumberland 
presbyterian church to meet williams the republican candidate for 
governor 
that he said is great 
its the biggest gathering for a republican candidate ever 
since weve been here about 20 years said harry bartlett 
whose son steve is a gop congressman from dallas this is a 
very strong democratic county 
williams is a west texas oilmanrancher who wants east texas 
votes 
to get them he knows he must attract yellow dog democrats 
party loyalists whom legend says would vote for a yellow dog as 
long as it ran as a democrat 
stumping in churchyards restaurants and courthouse squares on a 
recent campaign swing williams offers them a handshake a speech 
a little barbecue and what he hopes will be a winning message 
im a farmer im a rancher i grew up in a small town 
smalltown values oldfashioned values are still the horse i 
believe is the one to ride he said 
i probably more truly represent what texans think they need 
and what they want in a governor 
the texas governors office is one of the top prizes of the 1990 
elections texas stands to pick up three or four us house seats 
from redistricting based on the results of the 1990 census and 
both parties want to have the governor on their side when the lines 
are redrawn republican gov bill clements is retiring 
williams jumped out to an early lead in the race but his 
democratic rival twoterm state treasurer ann richards is putting 
up a spirited fight to narrow the gap williams foray into the 
democratic stronghold of east texas is part of his strategy to woo 
the rural votes that will play a big role in selecting texas next 
governor 
in his campaign speeches williams discusses a string of issues 
he believes give him a values edge over richards 
abortion hes opposed except in cases of rape incest and 
danger to a mothers life he wants a law requiring parents to 
consent before a minor daughter could obtain an abortion 
gun control no more laws we need to keep our guns he 
said 
flagburning it makes my blood boil he said 
crime williams promises to double the number of prison cells 
and introduce youthful offenders to the joys of bustin rocks 
that line from his tv commercials is so popular audiences shout it 
out before he does 
im here in east texas appealing to people whose values are my 
values i have a lot in common with the folks here he said 
the 29county east texas region is democratic territory 
williams was reminded at a stop in gilmer that no gop candidate had 
won a county office in a half century 
but republicans say they are making inroads 
in the 1984 us senate race republican phil gramm carried 18 
of the counties in 1986 democratic gov mark white lost the 
region to clements 
philosophically the people of east texas are very 
conservative said state gop chairman fred meyer their values 
are very much the values of the republican party but theyve got a 
little more of that yellow dog tradition 
with gramm seeking reelection and williams hitting small towns 
meyer is optimistic 
frankly our organization has been a little weaker in east 
texas than many other areas of the state but whatever weve 
done in the past were going to do better this time he said 
democrats say they are taking nothing for granted and richards 
is working hard to win east texas votes 
its an important region for victory for anybody running 
statewide said richards campaign consultant glenn smith shes 
been there a lot 
ed martin executive director of the texas democratic party 
said east texans wont change parties just because republicans call 
themselves the conservatives 
east texans are conservative but theyre also populists they 
think government ought to work for the little guy for working 
people martin said the republicans arent conservative what 
they do is come down to austin and try to stuff money into the 
pockets of rich people 
some conservative democrats disagree democratic state rep bill 
hollowell endorsed williams over richards last week 
her platform is so foreign to those of us who believe in 
conservative to moderate values that im going to have to cross the 
party line on this race said hollowell he acknowledged having 
voted for some republicans in the past as well 
martin downplayed such defections and accused williams of 
distorting richards record on issues such as gun control where 
she supports a waiting period for people who want to buy 
semiautomatic assault rifles 
clayton williams claims she favors gun control thats just 
not true martin said ann richards thinks a lawabiding texan 
ought to be able to buy a handgun to protect his home or a deer 
rifle to go hunting

bearing the words jungle fever the name of his next movie to 
be released in 1991 
theres also something for the fan who cant get enough of do 
the right thing which depicted racial tensions that led to a 
boycott and the eventual destruction of an italianowned pizzeria 
in bedfordstuyvesant a predominantly black neighborhood about a 
mile from fort greene 
during a recent visit to spikes joint a videotape of do the 
right thing played on two televisions one inside the store and 
one in the window with the sound piped into the street a small 
crowd stood watching throughout the afternoon

and won the student academy award from the academy of motion 
picture arts and sciences

a new wave of independent filmmaking he had made the 1986 lusty 
blackandwhite movie for an amazing 175000 
shes gotta have it grossed 8 million impressing david 
puttnam then head of columbia pictures puttnam commissioned

phone calls requesting buttons tshirts and other movie 
memorabilia

suggested that some of the stores profits might be funneled back 
to the community 
when white people start a business no one says a word black 
people want to make some money its so spike are you going to 
give all your money back to the community he mocked

at the crack of dawn one 
wednesday 1500 soldiers swarmed into this seaside town and herded 
thousands of people onto the cricket field 
one by one the people were forced to pass through a tent men 
wearing hoods picked out those believed to be tamil guerrillas or 
their sympathizers and other soldiers searched homes 
by days end hundreds of men and women were taken away from 
trincomalee according to the government press reports and a 
western aid worker based in the town the operation was repeated 
over the next few days in each sector of this town of 48000 
people the government said 
since midjune government forces and separatist rebels have 
fought for control of the north and east ending a 13month truce 
in the 7yearold ethnic civil war 
few expect an early end to the war for a separate tamil homeland 
in sri lanka the island off indias tip that once was a paradise 
noted for tea spices beauty and peace 
many fear continued conflict will bring chaos more than 20000 
tamils have fled to india which has a tamil population of about 60 
million since the latest round of hostilities began 
fighting has reached a deadlock with the government controlling 
several main towns in the east but the guerrillas in charge of the 
north and the jungles 
maj gen gerry de silva the regional commander now says a 
political solution is the only way out a far cry from earlier army 
claims that it would quickly eliminate the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam government commanders add however that negotiations 
are possible only from a position of strength 
a cycle of atrocities against civilians by both sides has 
resumed 
funerals of young children and mothers have become routine in 
trincomalee townspeople fly white flags on their bamboo fences as 
if they were surrendering to fate 
we are waiting to die said gloria williams whose small 
orphanage in a methodist church outside trincomalee was transformed 
into a refugee camp for 1000 old people and children all tamils 
all the teenagers have gone to the jungle to fight she 
said i pray to god but it doesnt help 
tamil rebels are believed to have massacred 600 unarmed 
policemen who surrendered when fighting resumed june 11 reports 
say they also killed hundreds of civilians most of them moslems 
whom the tigers accuse of helping the government 
according to other reports the government has executed many 
tamil civilians suspected of backing the militants masked police 
death squads led by members of tamil splinter groups working for 
the government comb major towns on the east coast picking out 
alleged supporters of the tigers 
the hooded ones came to my house last night ritah 
sivakamasundary a 36yearold tamil woman said in a refugee camp 
near trincomalee i heard gunshots after they took my husband 
away i dont know but i think hes dead 
western diplomats say the government has been the more 
restrained of the two sides there are no good guys in sri lanka 
but at least the government has made an effort to be disciplined 
one said on condition of anonymity 
he cited the rebels increasing use of pressure mines that blow 
off limbs a particularly inhumane type of weapon the mines 
nicknamed dice by sri lankan troops have maimed nearly 40 
soldiers 
sri lanka is one of asias most beautiful countries earlier 
this year while the ceasefire held the international monetary 
fund said its development prospects were among the regions 
brightest 
with a literacy rate of 90 percent relatively cheap labor 
liberal economic policies and abundant natural resources the 
island nation of 16 million people was touted as another singapore 
renewed hostilities will increase defense spending 50 percent 
this year to 170 million using up money neded for development a 
projected growth rate of 55 percent will not be achieved and 
international bankers say the country will be lucky to beat the 
1989 rate of 23 percent 
foreign investment which had been picking up after the united 
states helped establish a stock market is expected to lag the 
neglected southern half of the island could become even poorer 
raising the possibility of insurrection on two fronts 
a sinhalese nationalist movement centered in the south was 
crushed in 1989 
its terror campaign and the governments response cost 6000 
lives the tamil war has taken nearly 13000 
ethnic tensions between tamils who make up 18 percent of the 
population and sinhalese a predominant 75 percent go back 
hundreds of years 
in the teak and ivory drawing rooms of colombo the capital 
debate about which ethnic group arrived first harks back to 
centuries before christ 
in the modern era trouble began in 1956 eight years after sri 
lanka gained independence from britain 
tamils dominated sri lanka in colonial days the british gave 
them the best jobs and american missionaries set up the best 
schools in jaffna the tamil stronghold on the islands northern 
tip 
after independence the sinhalese majority voted its men into 
power in 1956 the government made sinhala the national language 
and buddhism the state religion 
this angered the tamils who have their own language and 
practice hinduism or christianity the day the law was passed 
riots broke out nationwide hundreds of people were killed 
the problem simmered boiled and simmered for 25 years sri 
lanka which entered the 1960s with a higher per capita income than 
south korea or malaysia fell behind in the economic race 
now the average citizen makes 367 a year near the bottom in 
asia 
ethnic tension turned into civil war in 1983 when 13 sinhalese 
soldiers were blown up by a land mine and sinhalese rioted in 
colombo killing scores of tamils 
tamil militants took to the jungles and fought until 1987 when 
india arranged a peace agreement and sent thousands of soldiers to 
disarm tamil guerrillas 
rebel groups agreed to the accord but the tigers reneged indian 
troops spent 32 months fighting the tigers then withdrew without 
success in march 1990 
western diplomats agree the tigers started the latest violence 
but say they do not understand why 
after the ceasefire in may 1989 the government gave the tigers 
wide autonomy in the north and east 
police were not allowed to make arrests unless the tigers 
approved the tigers levied taxes army troops were confined to 
barracks the tigers set up offices and roadblocks throughout the 
area and consolidated control 
one theory says the tigers jungle fighters for a decade could 
not adjust to the demands of a democratic political process 
in the past they had killed their enemies with peace they 
were forced to argue with them 
we had been thinking that we could evolve as a nation but 
this situation is terribly demoralizing said neelan tiruchelvam 
a moderate tamil leader we are back to square one

colombo sri lanka a 13yearold monk sat under a tree outside 
a temple reciting legends about lord buddha to a few children not 
much younger than he 
it is a common sight in this predominantly buddhist country 
except that the sinhalese childmonk devamitra and his disciples 
are orphans who lost their parents to ethnic violence that has 
ravaged the island since 1983 
devamitra remembers the hot july day in 1986 when he and his 
elder brother wasantha ekanayake returned from school to find 
their parents dead riddled with bullets they were among 46 
residents of morawewa a village in the northeast killed by tamil 
separatists 
the boys hid in the jungle for two days and were found by 
sinhalese soldiers who took them to the temple in colombo the 
capital which operates a rehabilitation center for war orphans 
devamitra named shantha by his parents was ordained a year 
later at age 10 because of his religious inclination and now is a 
fullfledged monk 
his second love after the scriptures is soccer the favorite 
sport of many of the 276 orphan boys at the vajra sri 
rehabilitation childrens home 
a buddhist monk vijira sri thero founded the home in 1983 
declaring that his affection for children compelled him to demolish 
some buildings in the temple to accommodate 25 orphans 
the number of orphans has grown to 326 ranging in age from 5 
months to 17 years they include 50 girls who live in separate 
quarters 10 miles away 
six tamils most of whom are hindus and 24 moslems are among 
the temples orphans 
many of the children lost both parents because of the tamil 
separatist war in the north and east or an ultranationalist 
sinhalese insurgency in the south that was crushed last year in 
other cases one parent is living but no longer is able to care for 
a child 
mothers and fathers who lost their spouses and now find they 
cannot cope with their children bring them here thero said 
ethnic violence began in 1983 when tamil militants started 
fighting for a separate homeland apart from the sinhalese majority 
nearly 13000 people have been killed 
separatists claim tamils 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people are discriminated against in jobs and education by the 
sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population 
officials of the rehabilitation ministry say more than 500000 
sinhalese tamils and moslems fled the northeast at the height of 
the tamil campaign in 1987 
colombo and several towns in the east are dotted with refugee 
camps that receive government aid to provide living quarters and 
monthly allowance 
theros center is run with private donations only it provides 
basic education and teaches the children such vocational skills as 
auto mechanics masonry carpentry refrigeration gem cutting and 
foreign languages 
while devamitra chose religion as the way out of his nightmare 
a 16year orphan from the same sinhalese village wants to become a 
soldier 
for the sake of my country i will join the army said aruna 
jayasundera whose parents also were slain in the massacre

after several seasons of deserted 
beaches and empty hotel rooms sri lanka is attracting tourists 
again this year despite a new outbreak of fighting 
the number of tourists from january to may reached 102694 a 91 
percent increase over the same period of 1989 when two 
insurgencies raged 
a 7yearold ethnic rebellion by tamils in the north and east 
and an antigovernment revolt last year by ultranationalist 
sinhalese in the south nearly destroyed tourism 
tamil rebels reached an agreement with the government in may 
1989 and the sinhalese movement was crushed but the tamils began 
fighting again in june of this year 
hotels are a barometer of the war 
going by how our windows are lit up at night the message is 
clear we are back in business said gamini fernando general 
manager of the colombo hilton the walkin guest days are over 
our guests now need to make a reservation 
occupancy slumped after fighting resumed but not 
alarmingly said another hotel executive who spoke on condition 
of anonymity nearly 2000 people have been killed since june but 
warfare has been confined to the north and east where tamils 
predominate 
officials warn tourists not to travel beyond anuradhapura an 
ancient sinhalese town 100 miles north of colombo about 85 miles 
farther north is the jaffna peninsula scene of the fiercest 
battles between the army and tamil tiger rebels 
the last good year for tourism in sri lanka was in 1982 when 
more than 400000 foreigners visited the island and spent 1258 
million last year the numbers were down to 182000 and 756 
million 
before fighting resumed in june cyril gardiner owner of the 
126yearold galle face hotel had predicted a tourist boom this 
winter if the ceasefire continued 
we have turned the bend he said we are back on the 
holiday map and the best is yet to come 
winter is the main tourist season in sri lanka because its sun 
and sand attract people from colder climates 
late last year the beaches were known more for bodies floating 
ashore than for swimmers and surfers 
colombo was under curfew nearly every other day and when it 
wasnt few residents ventured outside for fear of sinhalese gunmen 
or security forces who tended to shoot first and ask questions 
later

michael williams says he 
heard an elderly neighbor screaming dont kill me dont kill 
me so he called the police 
his family and his bishop say williams was trying to be a good 
neighbor but that can be risky in northern ireland 
williams has been driven into hiding in england and the irish 
republican army says he is an informer who will be killed if he 
ever returns 
anyone in williams neighborhood who sees masked men has only 
bad choices turn up the television confront the gunmen call the 
police and risk death as an informer dont call the police and 
risk jail for withholding information 
were pigs in the middle said williams sisterinlaw 
eileen mahony we have no comeback from anyone 
i intend to clear his name if it takes me all my life said 
mavis williams who urged her 54yearold husband to flee and is 
campaigning publicly to get the ira death threat lifted 
its the first time anybodys stood up to them and the reason 
why were standing up is because its the truth said her sister 
mrs mahony 
this family argument with the ira is not conducted by people 
cowering behind locked doors or peeping fearfully through window 
blinds the mahonys and williamses like many of their neighbors 
leave the key in the front door and no one is surprised to find a 
neighbor or stranger coming or going 
the familys defense is not that michael williams had a right 
and duty to call the police they say he made a mistake an honest 
mistake in not recognizing an ira operation 
in ireland to inform is the worst possible crime anyone can 
commit its worse than a murder worse than a rape said eileen 
mahonys husband jim so to call him an informer theyre taking 
his honor away 
mrs williams is 51 born and raised in londonderry and said 
she would not have called the police she would have gone next door 
to see what was happening and stayed with her neighbor until it was 
over she said 
when her husband told her what he had done mrs williams said 
i just went to pieces 
williams was born in london and settled in northern ireland 
after their marriage 31 years ago 
the williamses raised 12 children in the creggan estate a roman 
catholic neighborhood through the catholic civil rights marches of 
the late 1960s the street warfare of 1969 and the early 1970s the 
british army patrols and house searches and ira hijackings of 
homes and cars 
despite all that his wife said williams didnt understand what 
was happening that afternoon march 1 
at 245 pm williams saw two men in stocking caps enter rose 
garnons house his wife said later he heard mrs garnon 
screaming and since the williamses do not have a telephone went 
to another neighbors home to call the royal ulster constabulary 
mrs williams said 45 minutes passed before the arrival of 
police who have to anticipate that a call for help may be an 
invitation to an ambush 
as it turned out the ira men went to the house to hijack a car 
and hold mrs garnon hostage until the end of whatever operation 
was planned 
it was a costly afternoon for the ira police confiscated a 
handgun a rifle an rpg7 rocket launcher and several grenades 
the ira demanded an explanation and williams agreed to a 
meeting he told the sunday times of london he was taken to a 
house and told to sit facing the wall 
williams sensed the room filling behind him he said but 
there were no threats on the contrary they told me that if i was 
threatened or my children had hassle i had only to contact them 
he assumed he was cleared but on march 9 police seized more 
ira weapons in creggan mrs williams fearing the ira would blame 
her husband insisted he run away 
on march 13 four masked men called at the williams home where 
they confronted 16yearold robert williams and two sisters aged 8 
and 10 
mrs williams said her son was told tell your mother if your 
father comes back he will be executed 
the family tried to settle things through sinn fein the iras 
legal political wing but negotiations came to nothing and mrs 
williams took her case to the derry journal the local newspaper 
i think a lot of people might be frightened to confront the 
ira on their own patch bishop edward daly said i think the 
williams family perhaps is somewhat exceptional in that regard 
daly has contacted journalists about the case but thinks that 
in the short run publicity may only make the gunmen dig in their 
heels 
ultimately i think what will change their attitude will be 
the community and i think very large numbers of people now in the 
community are asking very large questions about this and feeling 
that it is wrong the bishop said 
creggan is a stronghold of sinn fein and the ira in a city whose 
very name symbolizes the feud between protestants who call it 
londonderry and roman catholics who use the old name derry 
even here sinn fein ran second in last years local elections 
to the social democratic and labor party which shares the iras 
goal of a united ireland but rejects its violent methods 
martin mcguinness the local sinn fein leader said the clerics 
and social democratic politicians supporting williams were in 
effect suggesting that nationalists should give information to 
the police 
after williams called police he encountered mrs garnons son 
clifford and one of his friends they said williams told them of 
the call and urged them not to tell sinn fein 
hugh brady a city councilor from sinn fein has said the story 
told by those two men disputed williams claim that he didnt know 
it was an ira operation 
brady now refuses to discuss the case ive said everything i 
intend to say he declared in a short telephone conversation 
on april 20 clifford garnon was found drowned in the foyle 
river an apparent suicide mrs garnon also refuses to discuss the 
case 
daly has protested ira tactics that make accomplices of 
neighbors he said many people in creggan feared their homes would 
be taken over for ambushes or their cars commandeered to ferry 
bombs or guns 
its the great nightmare here he said 
in august 1988 a creggan man who hadnt seen his neighbor for 
days broke into the mans apartment to investigate he accidentally 
set off an ira bomb intended for security forces it killed him and 
another neighbor 
mavis williams and eileen mahony share cigarettes and pots of 
tea as they talk their problem out in a sort of duet 
mrs mahony children have been terrorized thereve been 
elderly people 
mrs williams have been terrorized 
you know with a gun put to your head its no joke 
they take your car 
youre told not to report it 
if you dont report it and the police find out the car was 
used youre taken in 
and youre questioned 
and youre charged 
for withholding information

the password is litmus 
thats the test nobody is supposed to give david h souter and 
it is likely to wind up as his shield against question a whether 
hed say yes or no on abortion rights 
to ask directly would be to apply the litmus test shunned by 
president bush and most democrats only the most ardent of abortion 
rights activists argue that a supreme court nominee can properly be 
required to say how he would rule on an issue certain to confront 
him on the bench 
so souter will be asked obliquely as a democratic senator put 
it 
litmus is the compound that turns red in acid solutions the 
test of the same name is one in which a single standard determines 
the outcome 
there was no single issue no litmus test or standard 
dominating my decision to nominate bush said campaigning in 
philadelphia a day after choosing souter a new hampshire jurist 
with a nearly blank slate on abortion cases and i will add 
there should be no litmus test in the process of confirmation 
the white house began issuing such injunctions even before bush 
chose his nominee to fend off the question of whether he would 
name anyone who did not agree with his view that the abortion 
rights decision of 1973 should be reversed 
souter himself was quoted by his friend sen warren b rudman 
rnh as saying he wouldnt have been interested in his 
appointment as a federal appeals judge earlier this year or in the 
supreme court if the administration had any litmus tests to apply 
rudman said nobody should ask a nominee how he would rule on 
specific cases that it would violate judicial ethics to answer 
such questions and make confirmation proceedings into a political 
popularity contest 
in that view of the way the senate should supreme court 
nominees the issues questions should be general about a nominees 
judicial philosophy view of the constitution and its guarantees 
not about specifics 
sen paul simon dill said souter wont be asked directly 
about things he might be ruling on from the bench but i think 
obliquely you do that he said by asking about his views on the 
right to privacy underpinning of the 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion 
that route to the a word has been used before 
robert h bork whose nomination was rejected by the senate in 
1987 said a constitutional right to privacy was invented by the 
court which then used it to invent a right to abortion there 
never was any doubt about his opposition to the abortion ruling or 
his stance on a catalogue of other issues 
bork had spoken written and ruled on them which armed his 
critics with confirmation questions about positions he had taken 
for years 
it is amusing that some senators claimed that the white house 
imposed a litmus test for the presidents nominees bork wrote 
later no one in the administration asked me a single question 
about my views on any topic of law they were satisfied that they 
knew my approach to judging 
he said the litmus came at the senate hearings where by 
contrast various senators not only asked my views but insisted 
that i adopt what they thought the correct position 
justice anthony m kennedy who finally got the seat bork was 
denied said at his confirmation hearing that his personal view on 
abortion was irrelevant and that he wasnt going to signal how he 
might rule on any specific case he did call privacy a 
constitutionally protected right 
he is now aligned with what has so far been the fourjustice 
minority that favors reversing the 1973 abortion decision 
justice sandra day oconnor said at her 1981 confirmation 
hearing that while she found abortion personally abhorrent she 
would deal with the issue on the basis of the facts and the 
constitution 
when she was pressed on that and on other specifics she replied 
with a carefully prepared counter to litmus testing 
i do not believe that as a nominee i can tell you how i 
might vote on a particular issue which may come before the court 
or endorse or criticize specific supreme court decisions presenting 
issues which may well come before the court again to do so would 
mean i have prejudged the matter 
in a 1989 ruling she joined the 5to4 majority giving states 
new power to limit abortions but stopped short of providing a 
fifth vote to overturn the basic abortion rights ruling 
with the retirement of william j brennan jr the court is 
evenly divided on that question and souters position is crucial 
sen bob packwood rore said souter would not be confirmed if 
the senate knew or believed it would mean reversal of the abortion 
decision 
souter hasnt said and wont hes as litmusproof a nominee as 
bush could find

convenience foods and produce shelves are among 
the biggest attractions for supermarket shoppers perhaps showing 
that while consumers want to put dinner on the table with ease 
they are trying to eat well 
baby boomers with babies are eating at home more and that gives 
supermarkets an opportunity to provide takeout food to compete with 
restaurants timothy m hammonds senior vice president of the 
nonprofit trade group the food marketing institute said at the 
organizations seminar earlier this month 
research shows that these parents are saying they no longer have 
time to eat in restaurants not cooking is becoming a substitute 
for eating out he said 
if you think about the supermarket we really started 50 years 
ago as an outlet for manufacturers and farmers now we are the 
purchasing agent for the consumer hammonds said todays 
supermarkets carry an average of 25855 items apiece according to 
fmi 
consumers are becoming increasingly interested in convenience 
and according to hammonds convenience foods dont come wrapped in 
all the guilt they once did leaving consumers feeling that they 
were not doing all they should to provide good meals 
thats why the cake mix people had you add that egg to ease 
the feelings of guilt for not making the cake from scratch he 
said now however convenience carries another meaning it lets 
you spend more time with your family 
still none of this has hurt the sale of produce fruit 
hammonds speculated is considered natures convenience food 
and consumers still are taking time for vegetables 
in its annual survey of consumers fmi found that 46 percent of 
those surveyed buy takeout food at fastfood restaurants 27 perent 
at other restaurants and 14 percent at supermarkets however that 
number has increased steadily since 1987 when 9 percent of 
shoppers said they bought takeout food at supermarkets 
food labeling a big issue in washington these days as changes 
are proposed to current regulations is less of an issue with 
consumers just 36 percent said they always read beyond the 
expiration date to the nutrition and ingredient information though 
an additional 45 percent to 48 percent said they sometimes read 
those labels 
manufacturers health claims on labels were considered very 
believable by 8 percent of those surveyed but somewhat believable 
by 52 percent the most oftencited reason for skepticism was that 
the labels dont tell the whole story 
only 8 percent said current health claims are very believable 
theres a problem out there folks hammonds said 
fmis survey taken annually for two decades questioned 1005 
primary shoppers in a household 
the survey also found that 65 percent of those questioned said 
their diets could be at least somewhat healthier fiftyseven 
percent of shoppers said they eat more fruits and vegetables than a 
year ago 34 percent are eating less meat 27 percent eat less fat 
only 16 percent said they eat more fiber and 18 percent said they 
eat more fish 
still taste ranked first among factors influencing supermarket 
purchases rated very important by 88 percent of those surveyed 
nutrition was cited by 75 percent and product safety by 71 percent

a dog vaccine against lyme disease has 
been approved by the us department of agriculture and should be 
on the market this summer officials of a veterinary medicine 
manufacturer said 
officials said a vaccine for humans is not imminent 
unfortunately a lot of research would be needed before a 
vaccine could be approved for human consumption said michael 
gregoricka a veterinary medicine researcher at fort dodge 
laboratories which is manufacturing the dog vaccine 
lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of the deer tick a tiny 
creature found on deer mice birds and other animals in woods or 
fields it can cause arthritis lethargy heart disorders and other 
symptoms in animals and humans it is treated with antibiotics 
the disease was identified in the united states in 1975 and 
cases have been found in 44 states 
the vaccine was developed by researchers at the university of 
minnesota fort dodge laboratories bought marketing rights to the 
drug and engaged in four years of testing on dogs gregoricka said 
gregoricka said the vaccine must be approved by individual state 
veterinary officials vaccines for other animals are being studied 
he said 
researchers believe dogs and other animals can spread lyme 
disease to people and fort dodge officials said development of the 
animal vaccine is a step in curbing the disease

tampa and oakland calif have been picked 
as tentative test sites for a study of how people use water in 
their homes and how much they could save if they installed 
hightech plumbing devices 
researchers plan to attach monitors to toilets shower heads and 
water meters at a sampling of homes in both cities 
the information will enable us to project future demand and 
allow us to make realistic projections on how much water we can 
save through conservation said wendy nero conservation manager 
at the tampa water department 
the stevens institute of technology in hoboken nj will 
conduct the research pending approval by the tampa and oakland 
city councils if approved the study should begin by january 
researchers also will study whether people using devices like 
lowflow shower heads really save water or just take longer 
showers said civil engineer thomas konen the studys coordinator 
to make sure the study includes a crosssection officials will 
pick households based on income levels geography and household 
types nero said 
data collected in the homes will be transmitted via telephone 
lines to researchers in new jersey every night

old mud dumped on the sea floor by giant 
underwater landslides provides new evidence that 13 devastating 
earthquakes may have rocked the pacific northwest during the last 
6900 years 
the study by john adams of the geological survey of canada also 
suggests there is a 2 percent to 10 percent chance that a quake 
measuring 8 or more on the richter scale will shake the region 
within the next 50 years 
several previous studies furnished evidence that at least six 
great earthquakes jolted the coasts of oregon and washington during 
the past several thousand years although no such quake has 
happened since pioneers settled the region 
adams study scheduled for publication in the august issue of 
the journal tectonics revealed a new line of evidence that the 
northwest is prone to giant earthquakes it also found geologic 
signs of 13 such quakes 
adams studied sea floor sediments called turbidites or layers 
of mud 
rivers carry mud and other debris into the ocean where it 
settles on the continental shelf and on the slope leading down to 
the deep sea floor the mud accumulates until the slope becomes too 
steep collapsing in a sudden undersea landslide called a turbidity 
current 
this current carries the mud into undersea channels or canyons 
where it settles to form turbidite deposits 
adams identified 13 layers of the turbidite muds in each of 
several undersea channels the remarkable discovery was that each 
layer was deposited simultaneously in all the channels that is 
for example the sixth layer in one channel was deposited at the 
same time as the sixth layer in the other channels 
that indicated each layer was created by a great earthquake 
which shook the sea floor so intensely it triggered huge undersea 
landslides up and down the oregonwashington coast he said 
it would have to be substantial to shake loose that much 
sediment adams said in a telephone interview from ottawa 
the 13 layers correspond to 13 great earthquakes which occurred 
an average of every 590 years give or take 170 years he said 
based on the frequency and evidence strongly indicating the most 
recent big jolt happened 300 years ago adams estimated the 
northwest is 2 percent to 10 percent likely to have another such 
quake within 50 years 
adams study was based on reanalysis of core samples of sea 
floor sediments collected from 1965 to 1968 by la verne kulm and 
other researchers at oregon state university 
he was able to date and correlate the turbidite layers in the 
various channels because they all were deposited after the eruption 
of the mount mazama volcano in oregons cascade range 6800 to 
6900 years ago the eruption is best known for creating the crater 
now named crater lake but it also spewed volcanic glass formed by 
the very rapid cooling of molten lava that was carried to sea and 
deposited on the ocean floor 
adams study adds to other evidence that the northwest has been 
rocked by powerful quakes said brian atwater a us geological 
survey geophysicist who uncovered some of the first evidence for 
such prehistoric seismic disasters 
but atwater and kulm said another possible explanation for 
adams findings is that sediment perched on the continental shelf 
merely breaks loose at regular intervals after big storms or when 
enough has accumulated to trigger an undersea landslide 
you can get that kind of regularity by loading sediment on the 
ocean shelf kulm said noting that turbidity currents happen 
every 10 to 25 years near the mouth of the mississippi river in the 
gulf of mexico 
but he said sediments accumulate more rapidly there than off the 
northwest coast and that 400 to 600year intervals between 
turbidity currents is a pretty long time if the landslides were 
triggered by slope collapse rather than big earthquakes 
so earthquakes are most certainly a strong possibility to 
explain the turbidites off oregon and washington kulm said 
atwater said that early this century the great grand banks 
earthquake off newfoundlands coast sent debris crashing down the 
undersea channels of the atlantic to snap telephone cables 
adams said it is possible that simple sediment accumulation or 
even major storms could have triggered the turbidity currents but 
the range and frequency indicate the most likely cause is a major 
earthquake he said 
atwater unearthed some of the first evidence of prehistoric 
great quakes in the northwest several years ago he found that 
estuaries such as washingtons willapa bay and oregons netarts bay 
contained alternating layers of peat covered by sand that 
indicated repeated instances in which the coastline dropped 
vertically in a great quake then was inundated by tsunamis or 
giant sea waves that dumped sand on coastal marshes 
david yamaguchi a university of colorado scientist has found 
evidence in tree rings that trees along 60 miles of the washington 
coast died suddenly 300 years ago when they were submerged by a 
tsunami 
adams study certainly complements the estuary evidence and 
the tree ring studies atwater said

on a barren windswept plain kerry 
sieh digs trenches across the san andreas fault trying to unravel 
the secrets of prehistoric earthquakes so he can forecast disasters 
here in the shadow of the temblor range 130 miles northwest of 
los angeles sieh spends hundreds of hours 15 feet underground 
using a tape measure finepoint pencil and laptop drawing board 
he makes detailed maps of beds of sediment in the walls of his 
trenches 
i expose layers that go back hundreds or thousands of years 
and i see where the san andreas fault has broken those sediments 
said sieh a 39yearold geologist at the california institute of 
technology 
by dating those sediments with radiocarbon methods i can tell 
when prehistoric earthquakes occurred that helps me understand 
what is likely to happen in the future 
over the past 15 years siehs meticulous research helped alert 
millions of southern californians to a horrible secret once hidden 
in the earth 
within the next few decades there is at least a 60 percent 
chance that the region will be rocked by the big one a disastrous 
quake measuring 75 to 8 or more on the richter scale 
scientists know the last such disaster the fort tejon 
earthquake shook a sparsely populated southern california in 
1857 decades before a similar jolt at the northern end of the san 
andreas ravaged san francisco in 1906 
before siehs pioneering studies of the southern san andreas no 
one knew how often great earthquakes shook southern california so 
people had no idea when another such quake might be expected 
his work certainly has had a major impact on our view of the 
probability of major earthquakes in southern california said 
robert wallace retired chief scientist of the us geological 
surveys office of earthquake studies his work drove the policy 
of the los angeles area toward real serious planning for a major 
earthquake 
los angeles city councilman hal bernson credited siehs findings 
for triggering many of the measures weve undertaken as far as 
public preparedness is concerned he cited a 1981 ordinance 
requiring reinforcement or demolition of thousands of vulnerable 
brick buildings 
california is quakeprone because it straddles two great plates 
that make up earths crust quakes happen as the pacific plate 
grinds slowly northwest past the north american plate along the 
700milelong san andreas and a network of related faults 
the entire fault doesnt snap at once because of changes in 
rock type or bends in the fault separate segments of the san 
andreas break alone or in combination to cause quakes 
three segments that extend 200 miles ruptured to cause the 1857 
fort tejon earthquake from northwest to southeast they were the 
cholame segment in central california the carrizo plain segment 
and the mojave segment which extends from tejon pass north of los 
angeles to cajon pass north of san bernardino 
as a geology student at the university of california riverside 
in the early 1970s sieh theorized that by digging trenches across 
various segments of the fault he could determine how often great 
quakes had ruptured each section the method known as 
paleoseismology let him estimate how soon big jolts might happen 
again 
he showed seismologists they could learn something from 
geologists who study rocks and sediments instead of seismographic 
records of recent quakes 
the whole idea that we can talk about probabilities of future 
earthquakes happened because of kerrys work said lucile jones 
a seismologist with the us geological survey his work is so 
fundamental it has changed the field 
in the mid1970s siehs work indicated there was a 50 percent 
to 90 percent chance a great quake would shake southern california 
within 50 years later research by sieh and others prompted a 
formal forecast in 1988 by the geological survey which said there 
was at least a 60 percent chance of such a disaster within 30 years 
siehs early research indicated the next big one would rupture 
the faults mojave segment the segment closest to los angeles a 
1980 federal report estimated such a quake could kill up to 14000 
people hospitalize 55000 and cause 17 billion in damage 
but siehs more recent findings suggest the big one is most 
likely to rupture the san andreas faults coachella valley segment 
between the palm springs area and the salton sea 
because such a quake would be more distant from los angeles 
damage likely would be less than envisioned in the 1980 estimate 
unless the fault continued to rupture northward breaking both the 
coachella valley and mojave segments 
on the carrizo plain the most recent findings by sieh and usgs 
scientist carol prentice indicate that segment of the fault is 
unlikely to break soon in an exact repeat of the great quake of 
1857 
while siehs continuing studies changed details about the likely 
location of southern californias next big one his work provided 
hardandfast proof it is inevitable author john nance wrote 
in the 1988 book on shaky ground 
no longer could residents or government officials of southern 
california treat the prospect of great earthquakes on the southern 
san andreas as the mere armchair postulations of theorizing 
scientists nance said 
sieh said that when he digs into the mighty san andreas he 
doesnt think about the catastrophes it ultimately will unleash 
i do what i do because its fun he said but i enjoy 
doing something that helps other people 
so often what people do in response to earthquake hazards is 
stick their heads in the sand we need to do whatever we can to 
reduce the property losses and to reduce losses of life if i can 
say roughly when and where earthquakes are going to happen id 
hope people would be responsible and rational enough to deal with 
it

iben browning holds dozens of patents 
in several specialties but its his earthquake projections that 
are stirring up notoriety he says hed rather do without 
browning said at a conference in missouri last year there was a 
high probability of an earthquake along the new madrid fault this 
dec 2 
he was deluged by calls 
he insists he did not predict an earthquake 
the public always wants everything in black and white 
browning said 
no one can tell you there is going to be an earthquake on dec 
2 no one can know that everybody knows when he drives a car 
that hes taking a risk that it will malfunction or crash yet 
people do drive cars theyre dealing in probabilities 
browning 72 a large man with a graying burr haircut says the 
public does not understand and the press does not know how to 
communicate the idea of probability 
the closest you can translate probability into english is 
maybe but unless you say maybe not they take it as an 
absolute he said 
browning is chief scientist for summa medical corp an 
albuquerque biotechnology research and development company his 
summa resume says he holds 66 us and foreign patents in optics 
electronics mechanics chemistry electrooptics hydraulics and 
educational toys 
summa credits him he wont discuss what he does for the 
company with developing new technology for compressing 
electronically transmitted human speech 
over the years hes been a development physicist with american 
optical co worked in optics for bell aircraft corp and was a 
scientist for sandia national laboratories 
but gradually his interest in climatology grew and he now 
publishes the browning newslettter on world climate he said hes 
been accepted commercially as a climatologist since 1974 when he 
became a consultant for paine webber inc 
his formal training was elsewhere a bachelors degree in math 
and physics from southwest texas state university and a masters 
degree in bacteriology physiology and a doctorate in physiology 
genetics and bacteriology from the university of texas at austin 
it turned out that in my observations of climate that all of 
the soft tools with which i approached biology were applicable to 
climate he said its a subject that is comparable in 
complexity to biology 
business needs climate information because the weather 
determines how much food will be produced and where whether the 
transportation industry can get over the roads whether anything 
can be built he said 
he provided forecasts for the 1989 edition of the rocky mountain 
almanac and did as well or better than the old farmers almanac 
predictions said lee olson almanac editor 
he did predict the usual monsoons that come up in arizona in 
late august that the colorado great plains would receive extra 
moisture and store up adequate moisture for the 1990 year olson 
said he had the ski season only partly he had it right for an 
early start but it got dry around christmas as i recall and his 
timing was a little off on that 
browning said his climatological observations are based on high 
tidal forces produced by four causes the proximity of the moon to 
earth the proximity of earth to the sun the alignment of the 
earth moon and sun during the full moon and new moon and the more 
perfect alignment of those bodies during eclipses the vector sum 
would be the total tidal force produced 
such forces can trigger earthquakes he said and on dec 2 
there will be the highest vector sum high tidal force in 60 years 
from 30 to 60 degrees north latitude that area includes the new 
madrid fault running roughly from marked tree ark through new 
madrid mo to cairo ill 
since last year when browning raised the possibility of a 
december new madrid quake the arkansas national guard has 
scheduled earthquake exercises for around that time one arkansas 
school district is considering canceling classes and sales of 
earthquake insurance have picked up 
but browning said whether a given fault is actually triggered 
would depend on the pressure built up along it that information 
should come from area seismologists he said firmly 
if no earthquake occurs in or around december browning said 
people will be more inclined to ignore the danger of the new madrid 
fault 
thats what i fear more than anything else he said 
people dont trust authorities anymore they never did trust them 
much why should they what have authorities done for them except 
tax them to death 
brownings earthquake projections are controversial among 
seismologists 
klaus jacob senior research scientist at lamontdoherty 
geological observatory of columbia university in palisades ny 
said correlating earthquakes to tidal forces doesnt work 
its more likely that in the next 10 years or 20 years well 
have something quake activity rather than on this particular 
day jacob said you see earthquakes dont care about 
predictions and people shouldnt worry about predictions they 
should worry about earthquakes 
browning said he told a convention of chief executive officers 
in san francisco on oct 10 1989 that there was a 5050 chance of 
an earthquake registering 7 on the richter scale on or about oct 
16 because a high triggering force was expected that date and

editors note the governments research and development 
programs a 64 billion source of technological breakthroughs and 
national pride are also a vulnerable target for budgetcutters 
this is the third in an occasional series examining one portion of 
this years federal budget science spending 
</TEXT>

the two companies competing to build 1 
billion worth of bussized magnets for the superconducting super 
collider both have promised to manufacture them in the home state 
of a key senator 
the national science foundation a government agency hoping to 
expand its budget treated five congressional staffers to a tour of 
us research stations in antarctica and the private national 
foundation for ileitis and colitis got the actress mary ann mobley 
to beseech a congressional committee to boost spending on the 
digestive diseases 
its all part of the increasingly intense competition for 
federal research and development dollars though the kitty will 
reach 64 billion this year of a 12 trillion overall budget 
scientists say it is too small 
federal science spending is feeling pressure from within and 
without the huge federal deficit means there is less money for all 
government programs including science 
there also are demands on the governments science dollar from a 
growing number of bigticket projects like the 8 billion super 
collider an atom smasher to be built in texas and the 30 billion 
space station thus researchers are vying ever harder to persuade 
congress to give them a piece of the budget pie 
there is a lot of money out there but these sums are 
considerably less than is needed to do the job and the competition 
is greater said jerold roschwalb lobbyist for the national 
association of state universities and land grant colleges whose 
schools rely heavily on federal research aid 
the situation has driven some scientists to venture into 
congress budget process as never before 
recently two groups the american society for cell biology and 
the american society for biochemistry and molecular biology hired 
former maine democratic rep peter kyros for about 100000 to 
lobby congress to increase federal medical research grants 
our members felt the situation had gotten so bad that it was 
time for something new and innovative said peter farnham 
spokesman for the biochemistry society all of our members live 
and die on the availability of these grants 
other scientific organizations have long believed that getting 
active in the budget process is a must about 20 colleges and 
universities have lobbying offices in washington while dozens of 
others have retained lobbying firms 
john farrar president of the digestive disease national 
coalition testified before the house and senate appropriations 
committees for five years before showing up this year with mobley 
an actress who has battled her own digestive ailments 
the fact is nobody knows what his appearances accomplish 
farrar said but it seems to me if you dont show up you know 
you wont get your share 
dangling jobs is another approach 
last summer general dynamics announced that if the department 
of energy picked it to build giant magnets for the super collider 
it would manufacture them in hammond la 
its competitor grumman corp said in may of this year that it 
would build the magnets in shreveport la if it won the 
competition 
executives for both contractors cited the proximity of the 
louisiana sites to waxahachie texas where the atom smasher is to 
be built they also cited supplies of skilled workers 
but the firms also had positioned themselves to deliver hundreds 
of jobs to sen j bennett johnstons home state the louisiana 
democrat is chairman of the senates appropriations energy and 
water subcommittee and the energy and natural resources committee 
both panels play crucial rules in providing money for the super 
collider 
i guess it didnt hurt general dynamics spokesman jack 
isabel said of the relation between the companys decision to 
locate in louisiana and the fact that it is johnstons state 
thats not a factor said grumman spokeswoman miriam l 
reid adding we certainly are aware of senator johnston 
another way to draw attention to a project is to bring 
decisionmakers out to the lab all expenses paid 
last december the national science foundation one of 96 
federal agencies and agency subdivisions involved in science did 
what it does every year it invited congressional staffers to visit 
federal bases in antarctica 
five aides accepted all from congress budget and 
appropriations committees they were flown commercially to new 
zealand and carried to antarctica on a scheduled cargo run by a 
foundationowned c130 aircraft there they spent four days being 
ferried by helicopter to research facilities 
the cost to taxpayers was about 27000 according to figures 
provided by joel widder the foundations head of congressional 
affairs the benefit far exceeds that he said 
weve instilled in them a nevertobeforgotten experience 
widder said the next time a member turns to staff and says why 
should we support this that staffer has been there 
competitors for federal science dollars do battle in two 
legislative arenas one is the budget resolution which makes 
recommendations for broad areas of spending such as health defense 
and environment while not binding the blueprint is an important 
statement of priorities that frequently is heeded later in the 
budget process 
the second target is the 13 annual appropriations bills which 
actually provide the money for government each bill finances one 
or more agencies and federal science spending is spread among nine 
of the measures 
in 1988 the most recent year for which the national science 
foundation has figures the government distributed science funds 
to 2769 colleges and universities 46 academic system offices such 
as state university headquarters and 717 nonprofit independent 
institutions like hospitals 
there also are 218000 scientists and engineers on the 
government payroll and many of them are additionally eligible for 
federal grants and the foundation says that last year there were 
41270 companies involved in high technology many of which sought 
government contracts 
with that kind of competition youve just got to get in there 
and market yourself said cleon arrington vice president for 
research at georgia state university

one advertisement depicted a portion of the 
globe with only stars and the blackness of space where the united 
states should be and asked where would america be without basic 
research 
another showed a closeup of the statue of liberty and 
proclaimed this has never been a statue of limitations a 
third pictured only a horseshoe magnet and announced it takes 
more than luck to build superconducting magnets 
the ads fullcolor and fullpage have run about 20 times 
over the last two years in a pair of publications that circulate to 
many of the nations policy makers all three tout the 
superconducting super collider the 8 billion government atom 
smasher planned for waxahachie texas 
but only one ad the one with the horseshoe magnet provides 
more than a mention of the sponsor general dynamics the ad 
campaign shows how a large corporation can fight for a share of the 
federal science budget 
the st louisbased defense contractor is hot after a contract 
from the department of energy to build at least some of the 12000 
superconducting magnets the super collider will need these magnets 
each about 50 feet long will guide protons to highspeed 
collisions in the giant accelerator so scientists can study 
natures building blocks 
the energy department says the overall worth of the magnet 
contract will be more than 1 billion 
but general dynamics knows congress first has to agree that the 
super collider should be built and thats a top priority at 
general dynamics office in suburban arlington va where the 100 
employees include six registered lobbyists 
youre not goig to sell your magnets without the project 
alvin spivak washington spokesman for the company said recently 
while congress considers whether to provide 318 million for the 
super collider as president bush requested in his fiscal 1991 
budget general dynamics is keeping its name in circulation through 
the ad campaign 
company spokesman fred bettinger in san diego said the ads cost 
about 80000 more than many small companies universities and 
other groups can afford to spend in pursuit of federal science aid 
two of the ads mentioned general dynamics only at the bottom of 
the copy general dynamics a strong company for a strong 
country 
only the horseshoe magnet ads touted the companys own 
attributes 14 years of building superconducting magnets for other 
particle accelerators general dynamics is ready to join the team 
that will build americas most powerful research tool it said 
the ads were taken out in roll call a twiceaweek newspaper 
that covers congress and the national journal a weekly magazine 
that features indepth articles on issues and personalities in 
washington both publications boast readerships that include large 
numbers of lawmakers legislative aides and agency officials

a shock a day seems to send quivers through the 
world of business and economics of late and the surprising thing 
about it is that none of them should be a shock at all 
the white house announcement that the budget deficit might be 
bigger than anticipated was almost in the nature of things it has 
happened just about every year in the past 20 but it was widely 
referred to as a shock 
it should have come as no surprise to anyone said economist 
william dunkelberg except for recent arrivals from mars 
similarly presidents have a long tradition of promising to keep 
a rein on taxes but few succeed still millions were surprised 
when president bush reversed himself and said he might consider a 
tax increase 
judging by the reaction of stock market analysts one of the 
most violent shocks in recent weeks was the slide in corporate 
profits although that slide has been underway for well over a 
year and extensively documented 
perhaps equally or even more shocking is that the evidence of a 
downturn was ignored by so many people who claim to have a deep 
understanding of corporate finances did their hopes suffocate 
their intellect perhaps 
there even remains some residual dismay about the downturn of 
building and real estate in some parts of the country although 
there has never been a time this century when these areas of the 
economy were not subject to cycles 
the economy and its parts oscillate seldom do they draw a 
straight line up or down for very long and one of the more 
pronounced updown cycles is in real estate its there to be seen 
in the charts and graphs 
equally pronounced are cycles in securities markets but youd 
never have guessed it from the public display of shock when stocks 
took a dive on monday july 23 the real shock was that so many 
should have been shocked 
consider some of the evidence that investor expectations might 
have been stronger than profits 
various statistical indicators had for months shown the 
disparity price toearnings ratios stock yields in relation to 
bond yields dividend yields 
earnings improvements had crested more than a year ago 
various companies were issuing notices that earnings might be 
worse than anticipated 
you may be sure too that there will be expressions of shock if 
the economy as a whole falls into recession but thats the lesson 
of history to experience eight years of expansion as now is a 
rare experience in america 
inevitably economies disrupt themselves their own actions 
mainly their excesses undermine their health excesses such as 
overly large inventories waste overhiring sloppy management 
poor workmanship 
if these dont bring an end to expansion then poor fiscal 
policy such as excessive taxes or spending or unwise monetary 
policy such as overly tight money might accomplish the deed 
whatever the cause the economy eventually needs to take a rest 
rid itself of excesses regroup it must lay low before expanding 
again and during that time people who should know better will say 
it is down for the count 
thats the way it has been and most likely thats the way it 
will continue for a while more

tandy corps newest home computer has joined 
the ranks of hoover vaccuum cleaners and del monte canned fruit in 
earning the good housekeeping seal of approval 
the tandy 1000 rl which was unveiled wednesday and is available 
at more than 7000 radio shack stores nationwide incorporated 
dozens of tasks families said they performed most frequently like 
compiling a grocery list balancing a checkbook taking messages 
and charting expenses 
the computer the first to be sanctioned by good housekeeping 
magazine contains 30 recipes from the new good housekeeping 
cookbook and can instantly alter recipes to vary the number of 
servings 
the introduction of the 1000 rl comes a month after ibm 
introduced a relatively lowpriced home machine also designed for 
people who are not well versed in complicated computer technology 
the 1000 rl which tandy recommends be placed in the kitchen 
also provides access to tollfree phone numbers for many airlines 
and hotel chains and can link the user to other information 
services such as prodigy and compuserve 
it can become a central point in any home said howard 
elias tandys vice president of computer marketing while 
demonstrating the machine at a press conference in a manhattan 
penthouse 
the tandy systems are priced as low as 74990 but accessories 
like a mouse and modem are extra a color monitor with mouse 
modem clock and expanded memory runs about 119970 the 
comparable ibm ps1 system costs about 2105 
but the question remains whether consumers will accept the 1000 
rl as an essential home appliance or merely dismiss it as a flashy 
entertainment center 
will this create a new habit said barry bosak an analyst 
with smith barney harris upham amp co you have to leave that 
openended right now 
currently about 20 million homes have computers but experts 
suspect many of those machines are used for work taken home from 
the office rather than to help the consumer with household chores 
the home market has not been exploited because it has been 
difficult to define bosak said the office market has been 
much easier to define and of course the dollars were there to 
spend 
but tandy chairman and chief executive john v roach insists the 
tide is changing the vcr boom absorbed a lot of disposable 
income but that has abated and now there is a heightened interest 
in home computers 
he credited the latest introduction from ibm with helping to 
stir up interest in the home product category and apple computer 
corp maker of the macintosh line is believed to be working on a 
lowerpriced home computer for introduction this fall 
tandys elias said the home computer market has become the 
fastest growing segment in the industry posting annual gains of 10 
percent to 17 percent comparatively the office computer market is 
expanding at a pace of between 5 percent and 10 percent a year 
the 1000 rl has the potential to significantly increase unit 
sales in the desktop area over the next six months roach said 
the machine is designed to be left on at all times the screen 
goes dark if the machine is not used for a specified number of 
minutes but pages reappear at the touch of a key and since it has 
no fan the machine is silent 
the pccompatible 1000 rl is so easy to use that tandy 
traditionally viewed as the leader in the home computer market is 
guaranteeing consumers can figure it out in about 15 minutes we 
will work with you until we give up on you roach said 
the 1000 rl is visually appealing tiny illustrated thumbtacks 
hold notes for family members on a computer bulletin board and 
a diary which can be accessed with a secret password is 
illustrated as a book with lock and key the machine also can 
produce pie charts detailing just what percentage of a consumers 
monthly expenses went to pay utility bills 
tandy officials said the company is considering marketing the 
1000 rl software package to be used on other machines

twelveyearold megan leef and her fellow 
summer campers arent spending their time weaving baskets or 
shooting hoops theyre watching the ticker tape 
the 40 youngsters at the money management camp for young people 
at loyola college are not necessarily junior tycoons they are 
spending the week away from home to learn about earning money 
saving it and spending it wisely 
they had barely said goodbye to their parents monday when the 
dow jones industrial average fell more than 100 points in 90 
minutes as they watched the action at a brokerage house 
but it didnt dampen their enthusiasm 
i like what i already know about money when i am a teenager 
ill be able to manage money instead of wasting it i already 
wasted it today i bought a new kids on the block key chain said 
megan who will be in eighth grade at bethesdas westland 
intermediate school in the fall 
for the campers games and swimming took a back seat to sessions 
on ethics entrepreneurship checking accounts and credit cards a 
session on buying car insurance was a topic close to their hearts 
most of the campers know one thing about money they dont have 
much of it 
i wanted to learn how to manage money because theres a great 
need to know the value of money when you have money and not just 
throw it away said 13yearold jeffrey barzyk who is entering 
eighth grade at loyola blakefield high school in suburban baltimore 
county 
therese steen assistant director of continuing education in the 
sellinger school of business and management at loyola is the head 
counselor 
there is a great need for business education even for this age 
group and this can be a fun aspect of their education steen 
said 
compound interest what is a security the difference between 
being smart and being an inside trader there is a great 
concern about the misuse of credit in our society steen said 
they will learn that credit helps businesses and new homeowners 
if you dont abuse it 
the campers are students from the baltimorewashington area and 
from philadelphia who are ahead of their peers in math or english 
the camp appears to be unique 
this is the first ive heard of a camp of that nature for that 
age group said doug barber executive vice president of future 
business leaders of america a washingtonbased organization for 
high school and college students 
jim stone a professor at the university of minnesota and a 
researcher in a national study that looks at how schools relate 
class work to the world of work said some schools offer programs 
on career options but few students participate 
the summer camp idea is a little different but exciting 
stone said even though its only a oneweek shot it offers the 
opportunity to become more aware than what they would normally see 
in the course of a day

the last of the big brick textile mills 
that once dominated this little town in the berkshires is scheduled 
to close next spring putting nearly 400 people out of work 
this is a tremendous loss said mark pasquini executive 
director of the northern berkshire industrial park and development 
after company officials announced they were closing the waverly 
fabrics mill and shifting its operations to south carolina and 
delaware 
last fall officials of new yorkbased f schumacher amp co 
which owns waverly announced they planned to cut back the adams 
operation to a regional distribution and custom sewing center 
employing about 230 workers 
but on tuesday james hinthorn vice president of human 
resources for f schumacher announced the entire adams operation 
would be phased out by april 1991 except for a retail outlet store 
our concept of a regional distribution center and regional 
customer workroom was predicated on sales continuing to grow 
rapidly he said unfortunately sales in the northeast are 
substantially below what we had anticipated and that made it very 
difficult from a business standpoint to justify continuing 
operations 
for decades waverly has been known for fine fabrics for home 
furnishings the adams plant produces draperies bed covers 
curtains and pillows 
its future in this community of 9000 people has been uncertain 
since the arnold print works a dyeing plant that had been one of 
its main suppliers shut down in 1984 despite state efforts to 
save it the two plants had together employed more than 1000 
people 
the sprawling waverly plant was once part of the massive 
fourmill berkshire cotton manufacturing co complex that employed 
3000 people at the turn of the century in 1910 when the mills 
were booming they swelled the population of the town to 13106 
people a figure never since equalled 
but in the 1930s the company was sold to berkshire hathaway and 
by the 1950s the last of its operations here had left for the south 
waverly and the state department of employment and training set 
up a workers assistance center last month to help workers cope with 
the layoffs the company announced last fall 
well have to find new jobs we have no choice but where 
said norma sebastino she has worked at the plant for 18 years and 
her husband for 28 years 
my husband is 61 where is he going to start im 53 where am 
i going to start she said weve got a home weve got

federal regulators approved a rule that will 
allow a circuit breaker to limit index arbitrage on the new 
york stock exchange when the dow jones industrial average rises or 
falls 50 points 
the change was approved unanimously by the securities and 
exchange commission although all four commissioners expressed 
misgivings about the 50point threshhold 
the change is a oneyear pilot program with the big board 
required to give the sec a progress report after six months 
the proposal actually an amendment to an existing nyse rule 
would limit index arbitrage to selling at or above the previous 
lowest price when the dow jones average is down 50 points i would 
also limit buying at or below the previous highest price when the 
average is above 50 points 
index arbitrage is a computerized trading strategy through which 
traders try to take advantage of small price differences between 
the stock and futures markets by simultaneously buying large orders 
in one market while selling in the other 
critics have blamed program trading particularly index 
arbitrage for worsening market drops like the 1987 stock market 
crash the 190point drop last oct 13 and mondays 100point fall 
mondays drop triggered circuit breakers which prompted 
brief trading halts on futures markets at the chicago board of 
trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
the nyse first proposed an index arbitrage circuit breaker last 
february 
in a written statement issued after the sec vote the big board 
said the rule change would minimize excess market volatility that 
might be due to index arbitrage the move should promote market 
stabilization and enhance investor confidence the exchange said 
under the rule change when the dow jones average goes below 50 
points or more from the previous days close index arbitrage 
orders to sell any stock listed in the sampp 500 stock price index 
can only be executed when the price is at or above the previous 
lowest price 
conversely when the dow rises 50 or more points buy orders can 
only be executed when the price is at or below the previous highest 
price 
sec chairman richard c breeden said he was voting for the rule 
change although i am unhappy with some of the aspects of this 
breeden said hes rather cure the disease instead of just 
treating it for him the disease is the low level of margins in 
the futures markets margins are the downpayments or collateral 
paid by investors who buy securities or futures contracts on 
credit currently futures margins are set by the exchanges 
usually only a fraction of the amount required in securities 
transactions 
breeden has been lobbying congress to have authority for stock 
index futures and their margins transferred to the sec 
i have substantial doubts whether 50 points is the right 
trigger said commissioner phil lochner 
the staff has that concern as does obviously a number of 
commissioners richard ketchum head of the secs division of 
market regulation after the vote fifty points triggers a 
reasonable number of times in a year and there is a worry about 
any artificial impediments to trading at that level 
on the other hand trading on monday was a pretty good 
indication that where the stock prices really picked up speed 
where the slope of the decline increased was around 50 points and 
where the futures price diverged from the stock price also was 
around 50 points added ketchum who called 50 points a 
reasonable indicator

in a pair of developments reflecting difficult 
times in the magazine business woman magazine is being closed and 
womans day has been taken off the auction block for lack of an 
acceptable bid 
conde nast publications inc said wednesday it would close woman 
magazine after its september issue 
woman is the first conde nast magazine to cease publication 
since the newhouse family took control of the company in 1959 
woman has been published for 10 years but was acquired by conde 
nast about 18 months ago 
separately frances hachette sa said it no longer plans to sell 
womans day magazine saying it was dissatisfied with the bids it 
received over the past two months and now will invest in improving 
it 
both womans day and woman have had doubledigit declines in 
advertising pages for the first six months of the year amid an 
industrywide ad slump 
consumer magazine ad pages were off 33 percent industrywide in 
the first half of the year compared with the januarytojune period 
in 1989 with traditionally heavy magazine advertisers such as 
automotive and tobacco companies making major cutbacks in the 
spending 
magazine industry analyst martin s walker said the two latest 
developments show the market has really decided that there is no 
longterm future in broadlybased women service magaines 
he said the audience for such magazines is aging rapidly and 
that younger women appear to prefer more contemporary approaches 
conde nast spent heavily over the past 18 months on woman 
improving the color and graphics hiring top writers getting space 
at the checkout stands and boosting circulation to nearly 600000 
publisher rebecca darwin 
but in a statement conde nast chairman si newhouse jr said 
the magazine did not develop as we hoped it would 
newhouse was said to be unavailable for further comment but ms 
darwin said the magazine had been up for sale for several weeks and 
no serious bidders emerged the feeling was that in this market 
it might take a long time to sell and the economics of it were that 
he felt it was best to cease publication she said the magazine 
was believed to be losing money 
conde nast publishes 13 magazines including vanity fair vogue 
glamour gq gourmet and mademoiselle 
hachette put womans day up for sale in midmay saying it would 
enable the companys us operation to trim its debt while focusing 
its attention on creating or acquiring special interest 
publications with international appeal 
along with womans day a monthly magazine that claims current 
circulation of 46 million hachette had planned to sell the 21 
womans day specials that appear periodically 
the bids we received on womans day did not reflect the true 
worth of this very valuable franchise said peter diamandis 
president and chief executive of hachettes diamandis 
communications inc 
it is not in the best interests of the magazine or the company 
to sell he said in a statement hachette now plans to invest in 
the magazine 
the company never disclosed what minimum price it wanted for the 
magazine which had an operating profit of more than 25 million 
last year 
didier guerin president of hachette publications inc which 
oversees diamandis communications declined to say how many bids 
were received or who the bidders were but the bidders reportedly 
included britains robert maxwell readers digest association inc 
and macfadden holdings inc a partner in the national enquirer 
tabloid 
he said hachette publications had wanted to reduce its debt but 
was under no immediate pressure to do so most of the companys 
unspecified debt resulted from hachettes 712 million purchase of 
the cbs magazine group from cbs inc in 1988 
hachette publications owns 18 magazines including road amp track 
flying boating car and driver elle and memories guerin said all 
but two or three are profitable and that the company would now 
examine all the options for those that are unprofitable 
he said memories an 18monthold magazine that reexamines 
major stories years after they have happened is one of the 
magazines being examined for possible sale but he cautioned that a 
decision on whether to sell it has not been made

government subsidies that assure farmers 
certain income and the nation a predictable food supply are holding 
fast as congress moves toward completion of the 1990 farm bill 
after vigorous debate the house on wednesday defeated 263169 
a proposal by reps richard armey rtexas and charles schumer 
dny to strip subsidies from farmers with adjusted gross incomes 
of 100000 or more it would have affected about 20000 farm 
operations 
members of the agriculture committee persuaded colleagues to 
stick with the panels intention to support huge and small farmers 
alike as a means of controlling the food supply 
the house planned to complete debate and pass its version of the 
approximately 55 billion fiveyear bill on friday the senate was 
resuming debate today 
i honestly was surprised agriculture committee chairman 
kika de la garza dtexas said of the vote on the armeyschumer 
amendment i was feeling a much closer vote 
he said environmental and labor organizations were helping his 
side 
if you drive farmers out of the program you take acres out of 
the program that you will not be able to keep environmentally 
sound de la garza said 
as for organized labor he said i think their interest is 
jobs like i tell my friends in the uaw united auto workers in 
detroit no farmer no pickup 
armey said he and his supporters knew they were underdogs before 
the vote we wanted to shape the debate with the interests of 
consumers taxpayers and small farmers in mind and we were 
successful in that regard he said 
urban lawmakers said they did not understand why the wealthiest 
farmers could not be cut free when aid to the poor was consistently 
being reduced 
armey said the amendment would have saved 900 million annually 
from the approximately 10 billion a year the bill foresees 
spending to support wheat corn cotton soybeans and rice 
these people are not the family farmer said schumer their 
income from the farm is only 4 percent of their income 
yes they are the large agricultural businesses that dont 
need subsidies the investors and the multimillionaires who 
farm for a hobby they are investors who live far away and 
dont even till the soil 
rep edward madigan of illinois the ranking republican on the 
agriculture committee argued that the schumerarmey amendment 
would cost the taxpayers more than the program in the bill 
it would take farmers out of control of the government enabling 
them to put more land into production and cause surpluses that 
would drive prices down madigan said farmers still in the program 
would get high deficiency payments from the government if prices 
went too low he said 
besides establishing price support programs for commodities the 
farm bill sets policy for nutrition programs agricultural exports 
soil and water conservation agricultural research and extension 
work food inspection and other responsibilities of the agriculture 
department 
in other action wednesday both the house and senate fended off 
attacks on the peanut program one of the most protectionist 
programs in agriculture 
a senate amendment that would have ended quotas removed all 
restrictions on the planting of peanuts and authorized the 
secretary of agriculture to establish a new price support for the 
crop was defeated 5741 
the house ruled an identical amendment out of order after rep 
charles hatcher dga cited a congressional budget office 
estimate that the amendment would cost the taxpayers 55 million 
next year 
the house also 
accepted an amendment 256164 that would require the 
agriculture secretary to start a management program for dairy 
products if surpluses reached 6 billion pounds instead of the 7 
billion pounds originally in the bill 
approved an amendment on voice vote to gradually lower supports 
on wool and mohair from 200000 per producer in 1991 to 100000 
in 1994 
the senate meanwhile rejected 7226 an effort to tie target 
prices to the consumer price index minus 43 percent

union attorneys have asked for federal help in 
forcing greyhound lines inc to reinstate immediately its 6300 
striking bus drivers 
in a letter to the national labor relations board the 
amalgamated transit union says pending court battles against 
greyhound will take too long to resolve and even if the union wins 
members could be left with no jobs and no money 
nlrb spokesman david parker said wednesday the agency had not 
received the letter and would not comment on the request nlrb 
general counsel jerry hunter already has obtained an injunction 
against the union barring it from further violent acts in the 
dispute 
the striking employees resources are now depleted and their 
health care and homes are at risk the letter from union attorney 
martin j burns said 
the request is the latest move by the union whose drivers went 
on strike march 2 in a dispute over wages and job security 
dallasbased greyhound which operates the only nationwide bus 
system has continued running at reduced levels since the strike 
began 
the union cites the companys financial troubles in asking the 
nlrb to seek an injunction requiring the reinstatement 
greyhound filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors on june 4 citing increased expenses from fighting the 
initially violent strike 
in addition the nlrbs hunter said greyhound had committed an 
unfair labor practice by immediately instituting a new contract on 
march 2 when no impasse existed in negotiations 
greyhound maintains an impasse did exist and is challenging the 
finding in hearings before an administrative law judge in 
minneapolis if the company loses it could be forced to reinstate 
the 6300 striking drivers and give them back pay from the time the 
strike began 
hearings arent scheduled to begin on the dispute until 
midseptember however and could drag on through the courts for 
years 
meanwhile the employees who have exercised their rights 
will be confronted with financial ruin burns said 
the atu says the potential back pay is accumulating at between 
3 million and 4 million a week and the burden of such a claim 
would insure greyhounds financial failure and leave the drivers 
with no jobs and no money even if they eventually win 
greyhounds refusal to reinstate the striking employees denies 
them and the union of statutorily protected rights now which can 
never be fully vindicated burns said the boards and the 
unions interests can be served with a simple injunction directing 
greyhound to reinstate striking drivers under terms and conditions 
that existed prior to greyhounds unfair labor practice 
greyhound spokesman george gravley did not comment on the 
request he said the company was preparing for the minneapolis 
trial

shut down its principal subsidiary once a giant among the nations 
commodity brokerages

interests to wind down its commodity futures brokerage business in 
an orderly manner over the coming days

obligation on its shortterm loans and faces 76 million in 
additional obligations maturing or otherwise coming due in the next

stotler group announced the tentative bailout offer reportedly 
10 million from a taiwanese party last week but the deal was 
subject to approval from the investors board of directors which

as chairman of the board of trade the worlds oldest and largest

domestic branch offices and joint ventures with south american and 
european partners

chrysler corps chief negotiator 
has set a tone for talks with the united auto workers that will 
make it tough to agree to a contract this summer a union official 
says 
the attitude of chrysler management is far more arrogant than 
it is for the other two automakers uaw vice president stan 
marshall head of the unions chrysler department said wednesday 
that sets a tone right off i did not like the opening session 
by a long ways and im sure that will carry on through he 
said 
marshall specifically criticized chryslers labor vice president 
anthony st john for broadly outlining to the media three concepts 
the company wanted to pursue at the talks 
they included some form of an employee ownership plan a 
plantbyplant reward system linked to productivity and a 
multiemployer healthcare trust plan designed to cut rising costs 
marshall said talking about the issues with the media before 
discussing them with the uaw bargaining team made a mockery out 
of the negotiation process 
chrysler issued a statement wednesday afternoon through 
spokesman tom houston saying 
it is very important that all chryslers constituents be aware 
of the very difficult situation the company faces we put our 
concerns before the union in a general context and will be spelling 
out the details as negotiations unfold 
the uaw is a respected partner and it is our hope that they 
will work with us toward a successful conclusion to these 
negotiations 
since before the talks began last week at general motors corp 
ford motor co and chrysler there has been speculation that there 
may be a break in a tradition of pattern bargaining or arriving at 
a contract at one automaker and then more or less imposing it on 
the other two 
when negotiations opened with chrysler last friday uaw 
president owen bieber said flatly that the union was basing its 
bargaining strategy on the pattern tradition 
ford has far fewer employees on layoff status than does chrysler 
and is not planning on closing any plants chrysler plans to stop 
production at its st louis car plant a week after uaw contracts 
with each of the big three expire sept 14 
the negotiations involve about 450000 uawcovered employees at 
the big three about 60000 of them at chrysler 
marshall said chrysler is not in nearly the same financial 
health as are ford and gm chrysler which reports secondquarter 
earnings next week has said it made 71 million in the first 
quarter an 80 percent drop from that period last year ford and gm 
earnings dropped in the first quarter but not as steeply as 
chryslers

troubled columbia savings amp loan 
said it has agreed to sell its highrisk junk bonds to a 
canadianled investment group for 3 billion 
however the buyer will make only a 10 percent down payment and 
borrow the rest from columbia with the bonds themselves as 
security that means taxpayers could still wind up holding the 
bonds if there is a default and the thrift is seized 
the price is 68 million more than the bonds value on 
columbias books as last reported publicly but the gain is too 
little to offset its insolvency 
last years thrift bailout legislation forced columbia to write 
down the value of its junk bonds by 1 billion it was 215 million 
in the red at last report as of march 31 and needs hundreds of 
millions of dollars beyond that to avoid the possibility of seizure 
by regulators 
columbias former chief thomas spiegel was accused this month 
of squandering 19 million on various ventures some in partnership 
with his friend and financial ally junk bond pioneer michael 
milken spiegel angrily denied the charges which regulators made 
in a civil lawsuit 
most of columbias bonds were sold by milken to spiegel who was 
paid 9 million in 1985 the highest amount ever for a thrift 
manager 
not sold wednesday was another unusual investment a package of 
private equity securities that columbia has estimated could be sold 
at a profit of up to 200 million 
we have reason to believe that sale of those could bring us 
back to a positive capital position columbia chief executive 
edward g harshfield said in a telephone interview 
asked if columbia can avoid seizure by regulators harshfield 
said i still think weve got a fighting chance here 
the buyer of the junk bonds is a partnership assembled by gordon 
investment corp a merchant bank based in new york and toronto 
gordon america lp will pay 300 million down and give columbia a 
note for the remaining 27 billion at a 105 percent interest rate 
the contract that we executed today with columbia savings and 
loan reflects our view that the portfolio represents attractive 
investment values over the long term thomas ia allen a 
partner in gordon investment corp said in a statement 
the twist in the deal is that the junk bond package itself will 
serve as security that means the insolvent columbia or taxpayers 
if the thrift is seized could wind up holding the junk bonds 
again if gordon america defaults 
in its statement columbia acknowledged gordon america paid a 
premium for the bonds and harshfield acknowledged that the thrift 
might wind up with the bonds again 
but he said in the meantime we put 300 million between the 
taxpayer and the bondholder 
regulators allowed columbia to continue operating even though it 
was insolvent while its managers tried to find a buyer for the junk 
bonds 
as part of last years savings and loan bailout thrifts were 
forced to sell their junk bonds that coincided with a steep 
decline in the value of the securities catching thrifts with big 
junk bond portfolios in a double bind

more than 10 japanese securities companies are 
being investigated for allegedly compensating favored customers for 
16 billion yen or 107 million in losses following the 1987 stock 
market crash major japanese newspapers reported thursday 
the reports which came out in the early afternoon thursday 
appeared to have an immediate impact on tokyo currency and stock 
markets stimulating a fall in both the yen and in share prices 
yamaichi securities co daiwa securities co and about 10 other 
brokerage firms were said to have compensated favored clients after 
the oct 20 crash in which the benchmark nikkei stock average fell 
149 percent the largest daily fall on the tokyo exchange 
the reports were attributed to an investigation by the tokyo tax 
administration which refused to comment 
the securities companies allegedly sold warrants convertible 
bonds and other market instruments at bargain prices to special 
institutional and individual clients who later sold them back to 
the brokers at market rates for a profit the reports said 
the companies then recorded the sums used for repurchasing the 
bonds as losses and deducted them from their taxes in fiscal 1987 
the reports said that the tokyo tax administration has been 
reviewing such transactions and planned to assess the companies a 
total of 7 billion yen or 466 million in additional taxes 
the administration reportedly views such writeoffs as 
contributions or entertainment fees which are therefore taxable 
they said 
among the companies named yamaichi securities was said to have 
compensated clients for the largest amount of losses of up to 8 
billion yen or 533 million 
in a statement masazumi konichi a senior yamaichi official 
said tax authorities had already completed their review of yamaichi 
financil proceedings during 1987 
we understand that all bond transactions that took place 
during that time were fair transactions there is no truth in the 
reports of loss compensation he said 
the release of the report which appeared in the evening edition 
of each of japans major national newspapers had a major impact on 
tokyo financial markets 
the dollar closed higher at 15011 yen up 098 yen from 
wednesdays finish of 14913 yen on the stock market the nikkei 
stock average of 225 selected issues lost 33152 points or 105 
percent closing at 3136975

the menu included white wine pasta salad and for 
some the first taste of yahweh ben yahweh 
egypt has her pyramids india has her taj mahal france has 
her eiffel tower the selfproclaimed son of god told business 
leaders and politicians miami has the son of yahweh the worlds 
greatest attraction is in your midstim here 
yahwehs lunch appearance before the elite manatee bay club in 
may was full of selfglorifying rhetoric his trademark since 
arriving in miami 11 years ago but it also signified another 
important step in his strategy to win acceptance among business and 
political power brokers 
at times the 54yearold former hulon mitchell jr sounds more 
like a rotary club booster than leader of a whiterobed sect under 
federal investigation for alleged crimes that could include 
extortion and the murder of blasphemers 
yahweh ben yahweh boasts of his estimated 8 million in 
meticulously renovated real estate including motels a recording 
studio and a new supermarket he speaks passionately about 
improving blighted neighorhoods and using capitalism to help 
impoverished blacks 
hes hobnobbed with developers city commissioners and mayor 
xavier suarez followers have abandoned their sixfoot wooden 
staffs for briefcases and are encouraged to learn a little japanese 
to help business 
yahweh ben yahweh is just as committed to denying allegations 
against his temple of love inc subject of a federal grand jury 
probe he calls detractors jealous spiteful and drugaddicted he 
calls himself the prince of peace 
you know well that good is going to overcome evil said 
yahweh at a recent interview in his attorneys office thats 
what star wars is all about 
the story of yahweh ben yahweh could also be movie material 
drought and depression were strangling oklahoma in october 1937 
when hulon and pearl olive mitchell had the first of 13 children 
the son named after his father grew up in the black section of 
enid okla 
the mitchell children sang in the choir of their fathers 
pentecostal church one leona mitchell would become a soprano 
with new yorks metropolitan opera 
mitchell jr married at 19 and studied psychology at phillips 
university in enid after a divorce he moved to atlanta and earned 
a masters degree in economics at atlanta university a second 
marriage ended in separation 
in atlanta he began to preach interpretations of the bible 
under the name father michel 
he moved to miamis liberty city section in 1979 claiming to be 
the messiah of a lost black tribe of israel his turban is held by 
a gold pin bearing his name in hebrew god the son of god 
in the early 1980s yahweh and followers mostly confined 
themselves to miamis black neighborhoods seeking money and 
converts they began to acquire both 
they also began to establish a militant reputation in 1986 
tenants of an apartment building north of miami resisted eviction 
after the sect purchased it there were scuffles shouting matches 
and slayings 
a former yahweh member robert rozier pleaded guilty to killing 
two tenants and two other slayings he was sentenced to 22 years in 
prison and is helping federal prosecutors investigate the sect 
last year a federal judge in miami awarded 27 tenants more than 
15 million for wrongful eviction and blasted the yahwehs for a 
terrorist occupation strategy thomas equels an attorney for 
the tenants said two wrongful death suits were settled for about 
500000 
yahweh ben yahweh testified in court he had no role in the 
violence he has not been charged 
since the apartment incident and other allegations of 
yahwehrelated harassment yahweh ben yahweh has worked diligently 
to recast the groups image 
hes backed away from fistpounding messages about white 
oppression and retribution against blasphemers he says he was 
speaking figuratively about toppling whitedominated industries 
when he told followers to bring him the head of a white man 
he cultivates ties with political leaders black and white and 
belongs to mainstream business groups including the greater miami 
chamber of commerce and the american hotel motel association 
the focus is always on my detractors on negativity he 
said they may focus for two seconds on a physical building or 
something that ive swept out of the ghetto and they ignore how 
ive brought this building alive without drugs without crimefor 
all around that building is still full of crime drugs alcholism 
fights and destruction 
the yahwehs work has not gone completely unheralded 
three years ago the miamis urban league chapter gave yahweh 
ben yahweh its highest honor the whitney m young humanitarian 
award named for the leagues national president during the 60s 
yahweh ben yahweh demonstrates that you can take depressed 
properties and turn them around said urban league t willard 
fair president of the urban league of greater miami hes an 
inspiration to the entire community 
you have very few mainstream religious groups willing to 
invest in the community like the yahwehs said newell daughtrey 
director of the business assistance center a development group 
focusing on black neighborhoods i dont know where there money 
comes from i dont know why someone would follow him all i know 
is what i observe and all ive seen has been good economically 
yahweh ben yahweh denies he requires disciples to surrender 
their money but declined to give details on the groups finances 
or membership yahweh followers approached on the streets refused 
to discuss their faith or finances 
state records show the temple of love is incorporated as a 
nonprofit company but yahweh ben yahweh is not among the 
executives listed with the secretary of states office 
the sect also tightly regulates contact with its leader 
interviews with him are videotaped he claims a metal detector at 
the temple of love is used to screen guns and other weapons made 
of man 
my people are good there is nothing to hide he said i 
teach my people to drive 29 in a 30 mileperhour zone 
a federal grand jury is looking into whether yahweh and close 
aides in the temple of love ran a criminal enterprise from 1981 to 
1986 press reports suggest the probe includes allegations of 
extortion arson and murder 
but ellis rubin attorney for yahweh ben yahweh says the grand 
jury proceedings are secret and any details would just be an 
educated guess 
rozier now under the federal witness protection program is the 
principal informant said rubin the us attorneys office in miami 
refused to comment 
yahweh says he is like the pope or a rabbi and should not be 
held accountable for alleged misdeeds of followers 
i will never believe that the majority of the people of the 
earth are badi dont believe that the good people of this earth 
will ever swallow the madeup machinations of my detractors the 
real issue is what i teach

opec oil ministers said today there was general 
agreement among them to try to raise oil prices and feuding cartel 
members kuwait and iraq publicly played down their differences over 
production quotas 
we will have a new minimum reference price algerian oil 
minister sadek boussena opecs new president told reporters after 
the first twohour session of the cartels midyear meeting 
there are several positions but all of them are accepting higher 
prices 
libya indicated it wanted a higher quota for itself before it 
would agree to an overall production cap that would bolster prices 
and iraq wants a higher target price than some other members 
but ministers expressed optimism they would reach an accord 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer said the ministers 
wanted a strong pact to help in getting opec back on its feet 
in the days leading up to the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries conference iraq had threatened to retaliate 
possibly with military force against kuwait and the united arab 
emirates which it accused of exceeding production quotas 
at todays gathering kuwait and iraq made a show of 
friendliness amid indications that behindthescenes talks had 
cooled down their dispute 
iraqs oil minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi asked 
whether he would press his countrys concerns about excess 
production said we have discussed performance and we are 
going to concentrate on what needs to be done from now on 
seated next to him in the conference room at a luxury geneva 
hotel was the kuwaiti delegation 
we are friends we are shaking hands with each other said 
kuwaits oil minister rasheed salem alameeri it is just 
something which will be resolved 
iraq had reportedly massed troops along its disputed border with 
kuwait to bolster oil and land claims but diplomatic sources in 
baghdad said iraq had agreed to pull the troops back and an iraqi 
official confirmed that representatives of the countries would open 
talks this weekend in saudi arabia 
chalabi denied today that the troops were even dispatched 
there is no such thing as massing of troops along the 
border he said 
the opec ministers have been under intense pressure to try to 
defuse the crisis between the two persian gulf producers and forge 
a united front on prices and production 
boussena the cartel president said opecs fortunes have 
faded badly carrying the risk of bring member countries 
economies to the brink of collapse 
he told his colleagues today that the core of our problems 
lies in the lack of determination to keep a steady course of 
action 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have indicated a willingness 
to end the overproduction that prompted iraqs threats publicly 
however the oil ministers of both countries denied they were 
pumping too much oil 
we dont cheat mana saeed otaiba of the united arab 
emirates said today we produce what we say is our quota 
ameeri the kuwaiti oil minister said his country was 
producing within its supply quota of 15 million barrels a day 
however analysts say both countries have been pumping as much 
as 2 million barrels a day 
the ministers of the 13nation cartel appeared to be in 
agreement that their target price of 18 a barrel should be raised 
by at least 2 
there is a general feeling that we want to have the price at 
least 20 indonesian oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita said 
today iraq has proposed a target of 25 a barrel 
but any new target price would have little effect on the world 
markets without a tight rein on production the current world oil 
glut is keeping the cartels average price down to about 16 a 
barrel 
crude oil prices dropped sharply in the spring a decline blamed 
mostly on overproduction by kuwait and the uae 
the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel 
soared to 2046 a barrel in early january but plunged to 1364 
less than six months later it bounced back to 1625 last week 
to try to lift prices even more the ministers were expected to 
agree to a proposal arranged by saudi arabia and other persian gulf 
producers to limit total production to about 225 million barrels a 
day in the coming months 
such an accord would require the cartel to slice output with 
kuwait and the uae holding output to 15 million barrels a day 
each 
a confidential opec report according to sources estimated the 
groups supply at 235 million barrels a day in the apriljune 
quarter of this year 
opec secretarygeneral subroto said demand for the cartels oil 
was expected to run at 218 million barrels a day in the third 
quarter rising to 244 million barrels in the last three months of 
the year 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the uae and 
venezuela

an unassuming blue building along the 
highway north of town snags motorists eyes with a sparkling silver 
goblet atop a sign that reads salisbury pewter buses welcome 
gift shop 
sounds like one of those tourist places to buy lastminute gifts 
for relatives you forgot about while on vacation it is prices 
start at 5 
but salisbury pewter is more than an inexpensive trinket joint 
it makes pewter for presidents 
the reagans took 352 pewter jewelry boxes from salisbury pewter 
to the moscow summit in helsinki in 1988 nancy reagan gave pewter 
candy dishes engraved with her signature to senators wives the 
couple once ordered 6inch trays engraved with the presidential 
seal and both their names 
we did a mess of work for the reagans said salisbury native 
terry gladden president and coowner of the company which is 
projecting 15 million to 2 million in sales this year 
vice president dan quayle orders small rounded baby cups 
engraved with a replica of the vice presidents washington 
residence the quayle name is stamped on the bottom 
they usually get about 25 to 50 at a time i guess they give 
them out as gifts to friends with babies gladden said 
regular customers include members of the senate and house every 
branch of the armed services colleges and universities nationwide 
the maryland legislature and the du pont co among others 
tiffany amp cos 1990 corporate christmas catalog included four 
items from salisbury pewter a candy dish cup jewelry box and 
purse mirror 
tiffany has been a customer for several years but all its 
products must be stamped with tiffanys name gladden said 
the name doesnt matter gladden and his employees know who made 
it 
i never thought id be in a tiffany catalog but its because 
of the quality of the work were giving gladden said his 
employees really get fascinated when we get these special orders 
in here it builds their ego 
he said 85 to 90 percent of the business is custom work 
each piece is made by hand with a polished pewter that looks 
like silver but is much cheaper gladden said 
the most expensive item is a 10inch punch bowl for 250 the 
baby cups bought by the quayles sell for 25 an engraved sterling 
silver cup would cost about 250 and still look like one of 
salisbury pewters cups gladden said 
everything here is made one piece at a time its all 
handcrafted like it was in the 1800s he said its handspun 
then handtrademarked then handpolished 
still theres one modern embellishment some engraving is done 
by computer said lynn l parsons the engraving supervisor she 
engraves by hand if the design is not available on a computer disk 
you have to learn the right pressure for your hand so you know 
how deep to go it takes a steady hand she said

republican budget negotiators are proposing 
higher taxes on alcohol as part a 50 billion package of taxes and 
spending cuts for next year sen bob packwood said today 
president bush meanwhile is considering asking congress to 
forego its monthlong august recess if a budget deal is not struck 
soon his spokesman said 
there is a possibility that the president would ask the 
congress to stay said presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater bush would probably stay as well and give up his 
planned threeweek vacation in kennebunkport maine next month if 
that becomes necessary fitzwater said 
we would like to reach an agreement before the recess that is 
the goal certainly that we have and we hope that the democrats 
share that general time frame fitzwater said he said no 
decision has been made yet on whether to keep congress in town 
suggesting there was still time to strike a deal 
bush and congressional leaders held their third consecutive 
morning meeting to discuss the slowmoving 11weekold 
negotiations today but broke no new ground fiscal 1991 begins in 
just more than two months on oct 1 and congress plans to begin a 
monthlong recess after next week 
white house officials took a new budget proposal to capitol hill 
wednesday evening and got the backing of most gop leaders involved 
in the talks 
the package consists of slightly more than 50 billion in 
savings split roughly evenly between new taxes and spending cuts 
according to packwood an oregon republican and others the 1991 
deficit is expected to reach at least 169 billion unless action is 
taken more than enough to trigger huge spending cuts under the 
grammrudman law 
the proposal includes higher excise taxes on alcohol but 
otherwise resembles the taxes bush proposed in the budget he 
released in january packwood told reporters today 
bushs spending plan included a cut in the capital gains tax 
rate which republicans argue would increase revenues because it 
would encourage the sales of property and several minor new taxes 
the new administration proposal would raise about 3 billion by 
limiting the deductability of state and local income taxes on 
federal tax returns a gop bargainer said today such deductions 
would be limited to no more than 10000 said the negotiator who 
asked not to be identified 
the package does not include two other types of taxes on 
tobacco and on luxury items such as jewelry that the negotiators 
have been considering said the official 
the official also said the new administration package would 
slash benefit programs by 16 billion including 6 billion in cuts 
to medicare it would cut defense spending by about 7 billion 
several billion dollars less than democrats prefer and pare 
domestic and foreign aid programs by 4 billion more 
house majority leader richard gephardt speaking with reporters 
after todays white house session said major disagreement remains 
with the administration and republicans over taxes the 
composition of the package who pays and how much 
gephardt dmo said todays talks included a discussion of tax 
options including democratic proposals for raising taxes on the 
richest americans 
some democrats have advocated doing away with the socalled 
bubble in the tax code where middleincome americans are taxed 
at a rate of 33 percent but joint filers earning upwards of 
162000 pay a lower 28 percent rate 
we feel the tax code has become unprogressive gephardt 
said however ideas for eliminating the bubble by increasing taxes 
on the wealthy to 33 percent have not been well received by 
republicans participants in budget talks have suggested 
there remain large and tough and difficult disagreements to 
bridge gephardt said 
but senate minority leade bob dole rkan said were making 
some progress it may be hard to tell from the outside but from 
the inside i think were making progress 
were at the hard stage now trying to decide whether to stay 
here in august and get it done he added 
the gop plan would save more than 500 billion over five years 
relying heavily on cuts in benefit programs such as medicare but 
leaving social security untouched said one participant who asked 
to not be identified bargainers declined to discuss other details 
but it remained unclear just when and how the republicans 
would offer the plan to democrats 
well have one to present to them if they give one to us 
said packwood 
democratic negotiators met among themselves wednesday and did 
not complete a proposal of their own they are also at savings of 
50 billion in 1991 and 500 billion over five years 
we havent gotten to the point where you put it all together 
yet said sen wyche fowler dga 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that as early as 
today both sides will simultaneously put proposals on the 
table 
but democrats disputed that saying no decision had been made on 
exchanging offers they said they were reluctant to advance a 
proposal unless they knew the republicans had a serious offer of 
their own 
they also evidenced lingering distrust from recent bush attacks 
on democratic spending policies and an informal vote by house 
republicans to oppose tax increases 
if the president wants an agreement the president is going to 
have to help both publicly and privately fowler said 
separately the house ways and means committee approved 
legislation extending federal authority to borrow money 
the government is expected to reach its 3122 trillion limit on 
borrowing next month because congress will be in recess lawmakers 
must approve legislation extending that ceiling before leaving town

national power plc a british electricity 
generating company preparing for privatization on thursday posted 
a loss of 605 million pounds or 11 billion for the year and 
said it was cutting 5000 jobs over the next five years 
the stateowned company said it expected the job cuts to be 
achieved through attrition and voluntary retirements it currently 
employs about 16000 people following 800 job cuts earlier this 
year 
the results for the year ended march 31 were presented as if 
national power had been an autonomous business throughout the year 
national power and the smaller powergen are the two generating 
companies officially formed in march from the breakup of the 
central electricity generating board their shares were to be 
offered to the public next year 
but earlier this week the government said it has held 
discussions with british conglomerate hanson plc that might lead to 
the private sale of powergen which produces 18700 megawatts of 
electricity annually 
energy secretary john wakeham said that if a serious takeover 
proposal also was made for national power which produces 29700 
megawatts annually he would have to examine that as well 
if sold to the public national power could raise between 2 
billion and 25 billion pounds or 36 billion to 45 billion 
and powergen could raise 1 billion pounds or 181 billion 
analysts say 
national power said its results included extraordinary losses of 
914 million pounds or 17 billion stemming mainly from costs 
associated with its restructuring ahead of privatization and the 
revaluation of its coal stocks 
during the fiscal year national power had an operating profit 
of 456 million pounds ot 825 million and sales of 4 billion 
pounds or 72 billion

general electric co reached an agreement 
with the government today to pay a 10 million criminal fine for 
defrauding the army on an 8 million battlefield computer system 
the punishment stemming from ges conviction in a case earlier 
this year is one of the largest levied against a company in a 
defense fraud but far less than the government initially wanted 
which could have exceeded 50 million 
the agreement also called for the nations fifthlargest 
industrial company to pay 83 million to settle related civil 
suits and 117 million settle unrelated matters with the 
government that hadnt reached the litigation stage 
us district judge lowell reed jr who accepted the agreement 
and sentenced two former company employees involved in the case 
called the criminal fine against the company adequate fair and 
in the best interest of the public 
ge said in a statement that company executives felt it was 
time to close these old cases which date back to the early 1980s 
and were pleased that the government has recognized the 
significance and the value of the improved procedures that ge 
started in 1985 by recommending a fine that is far less than the 
amount they originally sought 
the judge said he had concluded the fine against ge was 
appropriate as he accepted the agreement which also says ge 
relinquishes rights to appeal 
the fine put ge into the ranks of large companies that have paid 
multimillion dollar fines for cheating the government on defense 
work in recent years 
northrop corp agreed to pay a 17 million fine in february for 
falsifying records on parts for the cruise missile and harrier jet 
in 1988 sundstrand corp agreed to pay a record fine of 115 
million the largest fraud settlement in pentagon history 
former ge employee gerald a leo 52 who was convicted of four 
counts of mail fraud and one count of trying to deceive federal 
investigators was sentenced to 10 months in prison and fined 
15000 
he never did anything yelled his sobbing wife mary when 
the sentence was imposed 
codefendant james badolato 43 convicted of misleading 
auditors and smbmitting false documents was to be sentenced later 
both had worked for a ge subsidiary management amp technical 
services co 
the company and the two employees were convicted this february 
on a case stemming from a 1983 investigation 
the government charged that the ge subsidiary did not tell the 
government in 1983 that it had found substantially less expensive 
subcontractors to help build the battlefield computer system part 
of a 250 million defense contract

economic problems in brazil and higher incentive 
costs pushed general motors corps secondquarter profits down 40 
percent and ford motor cos earnings down 45 percent from last 
years levels the automakers said thursday 
ford also said lingering effects of strikes in britain and 
belgium contributed to sharply lower european earnings longtime 
strengths for the company 
chrysler corp is expected to announce secondquarter profits 
tuesday analysts expect net income to be about half the 341 
million the company earned during the period last year 
gm the nations largest automaker said it earned 9001 
million or 132 a share in the second quarter compared with 15 
billion or 223 a share in the same period last year 
its secondquarter revenue rose 12 percent to 339 billion 
from 335 billion 
ford said it earned 7707 million or 167 a share during the 
apriljune period this year compared with 14 billion or 3 a 
share last year 
the earnings came on revenues of 269 billion up 39 percent 
from 259 billion a year ago 
the gm and ford figures were in line with what wall street 
analysts estimated 
analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co of new york said 
gms and fords automotive earnings were a shade better than he 
anticipated in light of brazils troubles and increased tax 
payments 
the earnings are much better than they look he said 
ford and gm each have large operations in brazil gm its own 
and ford with west german automaker volkswagen ag in the autolatina 
joint project 
both said their secondquarter earnings were dented by economic 
problems in that country where inflation was running at an annual 
rate of more than 1000 percent until the government put the brakes 
on the economy earlier this year with such moves as a currency 
freeze 
in europe ford had labor problems in the united kingdom in the 
first quarter and in belgium in the second although the strikes 
have ended the effects of lost production and higher costs 
continue to take their toll 
ford vice president and treasurer david mccammon said he 
expected the brazilian problems to continue draining potential 
profit from the company in the second half of the year the company 
is having to deal with higher material and labor costs which have 
not been recovered in sales of vehicles it makes in the autolatina 
joint venture 
i think brazil will take a while mccammon said europe 
probably in the third quarter will continue to be a little slow for 
us because we are launching the new escort there the fourth 
quarter should be better 
in the united states mccammon said ford spent an average of 
1050 on incentives for each of the 889043 cars and trucks it 
sold during the period 9 percent fewer sold than last year gms 
sales for the quarter fell 56 percent to 1323521 chryslers 
cars and truck sales for the quarter dropped 193 percent to 
432097 
through the first six months of the year gm said its earnings 
fell 467 percent to 16 billion or 234 a share from 3 billion 
or 460 a share a year ago 
revenue for the first six months fell 42 percent to 64 billion 
from 668 billion last year 
for the first half of the year fords earnings fell 567 
percent to 12 billion or 277 a share from 3 billion or 645 
a share during the first six months of 1989

soybean futures prices surged thursday on the 
chicago board of trade in a rally fueled by active soybean meal 
trading in europe and speculation the soviet union is preparing to 
make a large meal purchase 
grain futures ended mostly higher as bullish enthusiasm spread 
from the soybean pits to the nearby wheat corn and oat rings 
perceptions of an impending soviet purchase of soybean meal 
stemmed from reports that the soviet union received a 1 billion 
advance from the de beers diamond cartel for rough diamonds that de 
beers has agreed to market for moscow 
some analysts believe the hard currency will ease a cash crunch 
that has prevented the soviets from buying agricultural commodities 
on the world market 
the soviets also were reported to have repaid debts to soymeal 
exporters which further raised speculation they are preparing to 
buy meal 
mickey luth a grains analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
said the talk of soviet buying interest gave the soymeal market an 
excuse to rally 
they havent bought any for so long well take the rumor when 
we can get it he said 
soybean meal futures closed 80 cents to 4 higher with the 
contract for delivery in august at 17120 per ton 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 1 cents higher with the 
contract for september delivery at 301 a bushel corn was 1 cent 
lower to 2 cents higher with september at 263 a bushel oats 
were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with september at 133 a bushel 
soybeans were 7 cents to 12 cents higher with august at 593 a 
bushel

donald trump and his teetering real estate 
empire received another reprieve thursday as banks prepared to 
extend an emergency bridge loan the was part of a package that 
saved the developer from bankruptcy 
sources close to the transaction said a 20 million 30day loan 
that was to expire thursday was in the process of being extended by 
the banks involved including citibank chase manhattan bankers 
trust and manufacturers hanover among others 
the loan was approved to tide trump over until details on a 
longerterm 65 million rescue package could be finalized since 
that financing package is moving along on schedule and since trump 
has adequate cash flow there is no problem at all with 
extending the bridge loan a source said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
separately a spokesman for merrill lynch amp co had no comment 
on a report that the investment firm was advising trump on a plan 
that would allow bondholders in his atlantic city nj casinos to 
receive equity in the gambling operations for the debt they hold 
such a move would mean trump could forego some interest payments on 
the bonds 
the wall street journal said in thursdays editions the deal 
involves some 13 billion in debt on the casinos which have 
suffered from a general decline in the northeast economy 
documents filed with the securities and exchange commission and 
cited by the journal show that in midnovember trump will owe 47 
million out of 210 million in interest and principal payments on 
the casinos analysts are skeptical of his ability to come up with 
the necessary cash by fall 
the trump organization had no comment on either the extension of 
the bridge loan or the debtforequity swap plan 
last month trumps major lenders extended the bridge loan so he 
could make overdue payments on bonds sold to finance his trumps 
castle hotel and casino had trump failed to make the payments he 
would have been in formal default and the assets backing those 
debts could have been seized by creditors 
the negotiations yielded a new fiveyear commitment from trumps 
bankers that will spread out payment on more than 2 billion in 
outstanding loans over the term of the pact

reeboks board of directors let the air 
out of chairman paul firemans huge pay package cutting it by more 
than 11 million under a new fiveyear deal that begins jan 1 the 
company announced thursday 
fireman a key to the companys growth into a footwear giant 
that sells the pump athletic shoe for 170 would receive no 
more than 2 million in annual salary and bonuses under the new 
agreement 
his earnings could increase however through an option to 
purchase 25 million shares of the companys common stock 
under the current agreement which expires dec 31 fireman 
also reeboks chief executive officer received an average of 136 
million in salary and bonuses per year during the past four years 
that deal struck when reebok was much smaller based most of his 
compensation on a percentage of the companys pretax earnings 
the new agreement reached at a board meeting attended by 
fireman tuesday provides him with a 1 million annual salary and a 
maximum potential bonus of 1 million a year based on achievement 
of the firms profit objectives 
i dont imagine hell have trouble buying that new car said 
elizabeth a armstrong an analyst with prescott ball and turben 
two million dollars is still not a bad income 
fireman was on vacation and not available for comment said ken 
lightcap reeboks vice president for corporate communications 
reeboks sales have risen from 300 million in 1985 to 1822 
billion last year while net income increased from 389 million to 
1749 million during the same period lightcap said 
he said more than 95 percent of firemans compensation under his 
current agreement was in bonuses tied to pretax earnings 
forbes magazine listed fireman fifth last year and fourth this 
year in its rankings of us chief executives according to salary 
and bonuses 
his compensation before was much higher than is normal 
armstrong said largely due to the fact that a lot of his 
compensation was tied to earnings levels of the company probably 
no one really expected the company to get the earnings levels they 
achieved 
i would not be surprised if he was one of the people who 
arranged the compensation level of the new agreement she added 
his reduced compensation is really not a surprise said 
heidi r steinberg an analyst with salomon brothers inc it was 
pretty well known that he would be taking this pay cut the 
contract that hes been on was negotiated before reebok had made 
its stellar success 
the deal gives fireman the option of buying 25 million shares 
of stock in stages over a fiveyear period he can exercise the 
option for 10 years from the agreements starting date 
its not a question of him getting a big bonus as he did in 
the past lightcap said now his stock options are on the same 
basis as anybody elses stock options are 
armstrong said the new agreement is better for the company 
because just doing simple math it will save the company about six 
cents a share after tax and yet theres still the incentive 
obviously for mr fireman to be rewarded for improving the 
company not only the cash bonus but also the award of the 
options

this year 
to raise prices opec reportedly will be proposing a new 
production ceiling of 225 million barrels a day for the entire

sign of soviet buying and reports that the soviets had repaid 
debts to some us soy meal exporters raised speculation that 
moscow was preparing to make new purchases

gaming giant bally manufacturing corp accused 
merrill lynch amp co on thursday of smearing its financial 
reputation to divert attention from support that the nations 
biggest brokerage gave donald trumps taj mahal resort merrill 
denied the accusation 
bally chairman robert mullane said he was outraged because of a 
july 11 analysis by merrill analysts richard byrne and david waill 
which said bally was excessively indebted and must take aggressive 
action to stay solvent through 1991 bally is one of trumps main 
rivals in the gambling business 
the smell of this is awful mullane said 
its hard to believe they would do that unless they had a 
preconceived notion to get this company he said i think 
somebody ought to remember the people that brought you the bally 
criticism brought you the taj mahal bonds 
merrill lynch is one of the underwriters of bonds for the taj 
mahal in atlantic city nj one of the most extravagant gaming 
casinohotels in the country 
but brokerage officials denied mullanes contentions and said 
they stood by the analysis of bally a leading gaming equipment and 
hotelcasino company based in chicago 
the investment firm the nations largest had no comment 
thursday on a report that it was advising trump on a plan that 
would allow bondholders in his atlantic city casinos to receive 
equity for the debt they hold 
that would mean trump could forego some interest payments on the 
bonds which have but enormous pressure on the new york developers 
own shaky financial structure 
the wall street journal said in thursdays editions the deal 
involves 13 billion in debt on the casinos which have suffered 
from a general decline in the northeast economy 
its my personal opinion there has been a concentrated effort 
by a major brokerage house to discredit bally in an effort to help 
direct attention away from the problem they had mullane said in 
a telephone interview thursday from his chicago office 
martin fridson managing director in charge of high yield 
research at merrill lynchs new york office denied any 
relationship between the bally report and the trump bonds 
a given report has nothing to do with another company 
fridson said we see no reason to modify the bally report 
bally operates two hotelcasinos in atlantic city where trump 
opened his taj mahal earlier this year the company also has a 
hotelcasino in las vegas and one in reno 
in addition the company has a chain of health fitness centers 
and manufactures gaming and amusement equipment 
mullane spoke after issuing a financial report that showed 
ballys secondquarter earnings totaled 92 million the results 
compared with earnings of 215 million a year earlier but that 
stemmed from a onetime 34 million gain on the sale of a 
subsidiary without which bally would have shown a loss 
company revenues increased from 519 million in the second 
quarter of 1989 to 554 million in the same period this year 
mullane charged the writers of the merrill lynch report had 
grossly undervalued bally properties in las vegas and reno the 
report said the 2900room hotelcasino in las vegas and the 
2000room resort in reno were appraised at 525 million but had an 
actual value of 225 million to 300 million 
the hotel in las vegas sits on the most valuable piece of land 
in the casino business mullane said if that property isnt in 
the 500 million range id be shocked 
he estimated the value of the reno property at 100 million to 
125 million but added im not in the mode to sell them 
they went out and put ridiculous prices on them to create this 
nonsense story mullane said 
mullane said the company was considering selling its health and 
fitness division but denied the company needed to sell any assets 
to meet principal and interest payments 
he agreed with the analysts that the opening of the mirage hotel 
in las vegas and the taj mahal in atlantic city had cut into 
ballys business 
sure theyve had an impact but not to the point of being 
terribly serious mullane said everybodys off when a new 
place opens everybody goes for that first look but well weather 
that storm very nicely

opec oil ministers said thursday they agreed to 
raise the cartels ceiling price for crude oil and opec president 
sadek boussena criticized members who drove down the price by 
exceeding production quotas 
his comments were apparently directed in part at kuwait and the 
united arab emirates who are blamed for keeping oil prices low by 
cheating on their quotas 
opecs decision to raise the ceiling price came after it 
received assurances that overproduction by kuwait and the uae 
would end and that overall world production of oil would decrease 
the price of wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 22 cents a gallon 
thursday on the new york mercantile exchange settling at 6526 
cents partly in anticipation that opec members may soon reach a 
formal agreement for cutting oil production 
the market perception is that opec is serious this time 
william byers an energy analyst with bear stearns amp co said 
if opec can reach an accord and make it stick its going to mean 
higher prices for consumers at the pumps 
a row between kuwait and iraq over the quota issue appeared to 
have been defused as the ministers of the 13nation group began 
their regular midyear conference 
iraqi oil minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi sat next to his 
kuwaiti counterpart rashid saleem alameeri at the conference 
table the two chatted and laughed before the start of the meeting 
iraq on thursday scaled back a weeklong intimidation campaign 
against kuwait which reportedly included a military buildup along 
the iraqkuwait border leaders of kuwait and iraq were scheduled 
to meet in saudi arabia this weekend to try to resolve their 
differences 
a ministerial source said formal agreement was near on raising 
opecs target price several dollars a barrel and setting a new 
production ceiling of 225 million barrels a day for the entire 
cartel this would be an increase over the current ceiling of 2209 
million but far short of the 235 million barrels that experts say 
the cartel has actually been producing 
the new benchmark price is expected to be 21 to 22 per barrel 
the source said iraq had hoped for 25 a barrel 
the current 18 target price was set in december 1986 but an 
oil glut sent prices down to as low as 1364 a barrel this year 
the price rose to 1625 a barrel last week 
every dollar decline or rise in the price of a barrel of oil 
amounts to about a fivecent change in gas prices for consumers at 
the pump 
the source predicted the ministers of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries would ratify the accord friday when 
formal talks resumed 
algerian oil minister boussena opecs new president told 
reporters after a twohour midday session we will have a new 
minimum reference price 
there are several positions but all of them are accepting 
higher prices he said 
indonesian minister ginandjar kartasasmita elected opecs 
alternate president said there is a general feeling that we 
want to have the price at least 20 
libyan minister fawzi shakshuki demanded a higher production 
quota for his country before agreeing to a new cartel production 
cap of 225 million barrels a day as proposed by saudi arabia and 
other persian gulf producers 
under the proposal only the uae production quota would 
increase by 400000 barrels a day all other quotas would remain 
the same 
shakshuki said there should be no increase unless libya 
shares 
the ministers of kuwait and the united arab emirates denied 
their countries have been producing more than their quotas 15 
million barrels for kuwait and 11 million for the uae analysts 
say each has been pumping about 2 million barrels daily 
the alleged overproduction was at the heart of the recent rise 
in tensions involving iraq iraq badly in need of cash to rebuild 
after eight years of war with iran claims it has lost 14 billion 
in oil revenues because of low prices caused by overproduction 
iraqi president saddam hussein last week threatened to retaliate 
against countries ignoring their opec production caps he also 
accused kuwait of stealing 24 billion worth of oil from a field 
that includes land claimed by both countries 
boussena denounced violations of output caps 
opecs fortunes have faded badly and the nations economies 
risk being brought to the brink of collapse he said

the bush administration readied a 
budgetcutting plan thursday that would boost taxes on wine and 
beer more than fivefold next year limit the deductibility of 
state and local income taxes and cut social programs republican 
negotiators said 
their proposal to be submitted to congressional democrats at 
the 11weekold budget summit talks envisioned overall deficit 
cuts next year of about 54 billion split about evenly between new 
taxes and lower spending a gop bargainer said 
as part of the plan the 3cent levy on the standard 750 
milliliter bottle of wine would be boosted to 76 cents the tax on 
a sixpack of beer now 16 cents would be increased fivefold to 
81 cents the official said 
combined the higher levies would add 7 billion to the 
governments coffers 
democratic congressional leaders meanwhile met separately and 
all but concluded that no budget compromise will be reached until 
at least september congress monthlong summer recess begins in 
early august and many lawmakers fear that a partially completed 
pact would lose support while senators and representatives were at 
home 
that is the clear preference of the congressional 
leadership said house budget committee chairman leon panetta 
dcalif but it is also clear that if the president wishes to 
proceed the leadership will concur with that 
the third consecutive day of highlevel budget talks at the 
white house got down to specific tax suggestions as administration 
officials circulated a new proposal among key congressional 
republicans 
although details of the package were sketchy sen bob packwood 
rore said it included higher excise taxes on alcohol but 
otherwise resembled the taxes bush proposed in his january budget 
packwood and others said the proposal which may be formally 
presented to budget negotiators friday consists of slightly more 
than 50 billion in savings split about evenly between new taxes 
and spending cuts it also renews bushs call for a cut in the 
capital gains tax rate and proposes several minor new taxes 
the deficit in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 is expected to 
reach at least 169 billion unless action is taken that size 
shortfall would trigger 100 billion or more in spending cuts under 
the grammrudman deficitreduction law slashing most domestic 
programs by 40 percent and defense programs by 25 percent 
the new administration proposal would raise about 3 billion by 
limiting the deductibility of state and local income taxes on 
federal tax returns a gop bargainer said such deductions would be 
limited to no more than 10000 said the negotiator who asked not 
to be identified 
however gov mario cuomo said the administration could balance 
the budget if it raised the taxes of wealthy americans 
if you want to find wealth dont come to us and take it out 
of the pockets of children cuomo said at a news conference here 
with state and local officials who oppose limiting the 
deductibility of state and local income taxes 
the latest administration package does not include taxes on 
tobacco or luxury items such as jewelry which negotiators have 
been considering said the negotiator who asked not to be 
identified 
the official also said the package would cut benefit programs by 
16 billion including 6 billion from medicare it would cut 
defense spending by about 7 billion several billion dollars less 
than democrats want and pare domestic and foreign aid programs by 
4 billion more 
the gop plan would save more than 500 billion over five years 
relying heavily on cuts in benefit programs such as medicare but 
leaving social security untouched 
fitzwater would not comment on details of the package but said 
white house officials had had a lot of discussions with 
congressional republicans 
they know our thinking and we know theirs and weve talked 
about a lot of ideas he said 
failing an agreement there is a possibility that the 
president would ask the congress to stay fitzwater said adding 
that he assumed bush also would cancel part of his threeweek 
vacation in kennebunkport maine 
postponing the recess is one of the options out there 
gephardt said 
he said there were discussions thursday of specific strategies 
for higher taxes including a proposal favored by some leading 
democrats to even out the tax code by raising taxes on the richest 
americans 
middleincome americans are taxed at a rate of 33 percent but 
joint filers earning more than about 162000 pay a lower 28 
percent rate 
we feel the tax code has become unprogressive and that the 
middle class and the people below have been paying too much of 
their share gephardt said we would like to change those 
things 
the administration has opposed such a taxlaw change

the boeing co on thursday reported record 
secondquarter profits double those of a year earlier saying its 
soaring commercial jet sales and healthier profit margins offset 
major losses in its defense business 
boeing the worlds largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft 
had profits of 387 million or 112 a share for the quarter 
ended june 30 thats up 985 percent from the 195 million or 57 
cents a share in secondquarter 1989 sales were up 374 percent 
from 507 billion to 697 billion 
frank shrontz boeing chairman and chief executive officer 
attributed the profit growth to higher commercial aircraft sales 
and operating margins 
boeing has had five consecutive years of record jetliner orders 
which are now translating into record sales all seven of its 
current aircraft models also are well into production and past the 
expensive development and startup phases the company has steadily 
boosted its production to where it now averages better than one 
plane a day 
for the first six months of 1990 net earnings were a record 
689 million or 199 a share up 935 percent from 356 million 
or 103 a share for the first half of 1989 sales rose 477 
percent from 907 billion to 134 billion 
boeing changed its accounting for income taxes in 1989 which 
resulted in a onetime addition of 298 million or 86 cents per 
share in net earnings in firstquarter 1989 including that 
restatement firsthalf 1989 earnings were 654 million or 189 a 
share 
for firsthalf 1990 boeing turned out 186 planes including 37 
747 jumbo jets each of which are worth about 125 million that 
compares with 148 planes in the first half of 1989 including just 
13 747s boeing introduced its new 747400 in early 1989 
commercial sales totaled about 102 billion in the first six 
months of 1990 while defense and space sales totaled 295 
billion up 329 million from the same period of 1989 
but shrontz said troubles with defense programs and pressures to 
cut military spending will result in a significant 1990 operating 
loss for space and military business 
technical cost and schedule problems on certain us 
government developmental and production programs have not been 
fully resolved shrontz said including problems with the 
advanced tactical fighter or atf boeing is developing a version 
of the 21st century jet with lockheed and general dynamics 
boeing did not release quarterly profits or losses for its 
commercial or defense segments said spokesman paul binder last 
year however defense and space lost 474 million 
the company is trying to save money by streamlining its defense 
and space segments but it is a participant in a number of programs 
in danger of being cut including the b2 stealth bomber v22 
tiltrotor aircraft the atf the space station and the armys 
proposed light helicopter 
boeing did manage to gain a defense contract in the second 
quarter to develop a tactical derivative of the new shortrange 
attack missile it is developing for the air force 
boeing charged 354 million to earnings for research and 
development in the first half of 1990 and plans to spend another 
400 million on rampd the rest of the year 
it had 207 million in other business in firsthalf 1990 
including the sale of a 15 percent interest in peabody holding co 
shrontz repeated his earlier forecast of a record 27 billion in 
total sales for 1990 
boeing had a total backlog of firm orders at june 30 of 843 
billion up from 806 billion a year earlier of that total 781 
billion was for commercial customers for 1862 announced aircraft 
orders 
fifteen customers announced orders for 128 jetliners and five de 
havilland commuter planes in the second quarter worth a total 
115 billion 
boeing is negotiating with airlines to obtain orders to launch 
its proposed new 777 twinjet the plane would seat 300350 
passengers 
shrontz said boeing had cash and shortterm investments of 361 
billion on june 30 double the 186 billion on dec 31
