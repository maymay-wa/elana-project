authorities issued an arrest warrant for 
the tanker captain suspected of drinking before his ship ran 
aground causing a 1000squaremile oil slick that expanded 
saturday under shifting wind and currents 
a prosecutor said the captain admitted drinking on board the 
tanker before it went aground according to court papers obtained 
by the oregonian of portland newspaper 
one of the first investigators to board the exxon valdez asked 
joseph hazelwood what the problem was and the captain replied i 
think youre looking at it the newspaper reported in its sunday 
editions 
meanwhile alaskas governor threatened to close the 
transalaska pipeline if the oil industry fails to protect against 
future spills 
the bulk of the 101milliongallon slick began moving toward 
cordova about 50 miles southeast of here threatening the home 
waters of fishermen who have struggled to save endangered fish 
hatcheries 
about 800 miles of beach have been tainted so far in the biggest 
oil spill in the nations history officials said 
gov steve cowper said the state will require absolute proof 
that equipment is in place to combat future oil spills if its 
not done were authorized to close the pipeline he said 
some 85 percent of the states 2 billion budget comes from the 
pipeline and although the state has a 10 billion savings account 
oil production on alaskas north slope accounts for 25 percent of 
us production 
alaska attorney general doug baily said saturday that criminal 
charges were filed late friday against hazelwood 42 captain of 
the tanker that crashed into bligh reef in prince william sound on 
march 24 
exxon fired hazelwood on thursday the same day the national 
transportation safety board revealed blood and urine tests taken 
about nine hours after the accident showed he had been under the 
influence of alcohol 
charges filed in valdez district court accuse hazelwood of 
operating a motorcraft while under the influence of alcohol 
reckless endangerment and the negligent discharge of oil all 
misdemeanors 
the three offenses carry combined maximum sentences of two years 
and three months in prison and fines totaling up to 10000 
district attorney larry weeks said if convicted hazelwood would 
have to spend at least 30 days in jail because he has two prior 
drunken driving convictions in the past five years 
valdez magistrate tracee schnell signed the arrest warrant for 
hazelwood and set bond at 50000 authorities believe he left the 
state several days ago but baily said the state would seek his 
extradition 
police in hazelwoods hometown of huntington ny said 
saturday they did not know his whereabouts 
the oregonian said two crewmen told authorities they saw 
hazelwood drinking in valdez before the ship left port 
a statement filed by leonard m linton an assistant district 
attorney in valdez said one crewman saw hazelwood consume four 
alcoholic drinks while still in port 
lintons affidavit said two other unidentified witnesses said 
they smelled alcohol on hazelwoods breath when the captain was on 
the bridge the newspaper reported 
one witness said that hazelwood appeared to be under the 
influence of intoxicating beverages and that his balance was not 
good linton said in the affidavit 
however all crewmen interviewed by alaska state troopers have 
said hazelwood did not appear to be intoxicated linton wrote 
hazelwood apparently told investigators he drank one beer before 
leaving port and a couple of bottles of moussy a beverage 
containing 05 percent alcohol after he returned to the ship 
linton said 
fbi officials in washington say theyre investigating possible 
felony violations of the clean water act which prohibits the 
negligent discharge of a pollutant into navigable waters 
exxon is liable for millions of dollars in fines under state law 
if it is proven to be negligent in causing the spill and cleaning 
it up 
shifting wind drove the main body of the slick east toward 
hinchenbrook island which forms the primary boundary between the 
sound and the gulf of alaska 
the movement of the oil toward the rich fishing grounds at the 
mouth of the copper river stirred fear in cordova which lies on 
the east side of the sound some cordova fishermen who had mounted 
a bold effort to protect the hatcheries on the west side headed 
back toward their home port to battle the oil there 
larry dietrick of the alaska department of environmental 
conservation praised the cordova fishermen as the backbone of 
the cleanup and containment effort so far 
leaders in the fishing and tourist town of seward the first 
community downstream from prince william sound to the west also 
went on the offensive deploying 10000 feet of boom the town 
ordered from a massachusetts manufacturer to protect salmon river 
habitats 
were not going to let it happen said harry gieseler mayor 
of the town 125 miles southwest of valdez were taking our own 
initiative 
at the kenai fjords national park near seward a team was sent 
out to survey wildlife and evaluate the state of the park before 
oil reaches the rocky shores spokeswoman dixie dies said 
the park will count on the city of seward for boom and other 
protective measures she said 
the coast guard rejected a plea from oil producers to ease 
restrictions placed on tanker traffic into valdez following the 
spill the atlantic richfield co said tanker movement from the 
marine terminal of the transalaska oil pipeline needs to be 
stepped up to ensure adequate supplies on the west coast 
on friday wholesale gasoline prices surged as commodities 
traders speculated that the squeeze in oil supplies caused by the 
disastrous spill wont ease soon gas prices at the pump jumped by 
as much as 10 cents a gallon in parts of california 
normally three to four loaded tankers leave valdez daily since 
the spill only five have made it out the coast guard has ordered 
tugboat escorts until the tankers pass the grounded exxon valdez 
local harbor pilots are required to accompany the tankers for 
longer distances than usual 
the coast guard said the restrictions would not be lifted until 
the exxon valdez is refloated and moved to a safe anchorage 
possibly next week workers continued saturday to pump oil from the 
crippled tanker onto the exxon san francisco 
biologists walking beaches have counted 520 oiled birds 
representing 20 species fish and game officials said ten sea 
otters and 27 oiled birds were taken to valdez for cleaning and 
federal bird experts said more than 1000 tainted birds some 
alive some dead had been spotted on a single island they 
expected the number to increase dramatically 
wildlife experts also were considering the possibility of 
sending some sea otters to other states for care and 
rehabilitation biologists say they expect to be inundated by 
otters the marine mammal most vulnerable to oil contamination 
because of the loss of insulation and buoyancy of their fur 
a sablefish harvest set to open today was canceled because of 
the spill officials previously halted the shrimp harvest which 
was open for about two weeks before the spill and was to have run 
until midapril 
meanwhile another in a series of classaction lawsuits was 
filed friday a classaction complaint by san francisco attorney 
melvin belli on behalf of area fishermen asked for 2 billion 
half of it in punitive damages

south africa reported major clashes 
with guerrillas hours before namibia began its transition to 
independence saturday and said it may ask the un force monitoring 
the process to leave 
governmentrun radio said early sunday that 36 guerrillas were 
killed and two captured in fighting friday night with southwest 
african police who suffered two deaths and nine injuries 
the figures attributed to a spokesman for territorial 
administratorgeneral louis pienaar slightly revised those given 
saturday by south african officials 
foreign minister pik botha of south africa said saturday that 38 
guerrillas and two territorial policemen were killed when 
guerrillas of the southwest african peoples organization or 
swapo infiltrated from angola on friday evening 
this is a most serious development said botha 
the reported attack came hours before a formal ceasefire took 
effect and a 20nation un peacekeeping force began overseeing the 
end of south africas 74year rule over namibia 
police blocked thousands of swapo supporters who tried to march 
in the capital to celebrate the transition 
botha accused the rebels of a flagrant violation of a pledge to 
halt hostilities and said he had complained to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
unless there is a satisfactory response from the united nations 
botha said south africa would feel compelled to ask the 
peacekeeping force to leave until swapo can be brought to its 
senses 
in new york un spokeswoman nadia younes released a statement 
from perez de cuellar saying the secretarygeneral is greatly 
concerned that such incidents have been reported he has told mr 
botha that untag the un transition assistance group is 
immediately sending a team to investigate the reports 
un special representative martti ahtisaari sent four senior 
un military civilian and police personnel to northern namibia 
to investigate the south african report he was expected to make 
his report by sunday evening 
an official of swapo which has waged a war for independence 
since 1966 said the organization would need a day or so to 
determine what had happened but added that swapo has gone out of 
its way to avoid conflict 
according to botha perez de cuellar indicated he might agree 
that south africa could reactivate its troops to guard against 
swapo operations but the un spokeswoman said the 
secretarygeeneral would have no comment on bothas remarks 
later at a news conference botha said south african troops will 
be allowed to leave their bases to search for the guerrillas 
involved in the fighting if police cant control the situation 
south african and swapo forces were confined to their bases as 
of saturday under the un plan but pienaar said swapo units had 
not complied 
botha interrupted his airport news conference to take a call 
from pienaar he then said that pienaar ahtisaari and gen prem 
chand the untag commander said certain south african units would 
be released from their bases to provide support to the police and 
the un group would monitor the south african movement 
fewer than 800 of the 4500 military personnel assigned to the 
untag have arrived in namibia 
there had been no fighting since september between south african 
and swapo forces which were supposed to be restricted to their 
bases as of midnight friday under un resolution 435 
the resolution establishes a process for elections in november 
leading to independence early next year for namibia africas last 
territory 
british prime minister margaret thatcher completing an african 
tour flew into windhoek to meet with botha un officials and 
british members of the un monitoring force 
mrs thatcher said a special session of the un security 
council should be called to consider the alleged swapo incursion 
this a most serious challenge to the authority of the united 
nations and the agreement and we condemn it totally she said 
there was a tense 30minute standoff outside the capital when 
about 100 policemen confronted up to 20000 swapo supporters 
marching to windhoek from the black township of katatura seeking 
to celebrate the start of the independence process 
church leaders persuaded the marchers to return to katatura 
where celebration rallies by rival political factions were held 
during the day 
about 400 swapo supporters reached downtown windhoek and held a 
rally across from a luxury hotel about 30 policemen watched but 
did not interfere as the crowd chanted swapo we win 
until independence administration of the territory and 
responsibility for law enforcement will remain in the hands of 
pienaar appointed by south africa 
south africa has ruled namibia since it captured the territory 
from the germans in world war i 
un peacekeepers will monitor the election in november of a 
constituent assembly the assembly will later set up a black 
majority government of namibias 13 million residents about 
70000 are white 
swapo is favored in the preindependence elections but whether 
it can gain the twothirds support needed to have complete control 
over the drafting of a constitution is uncertain 
the south africans agreed to a un independence plan for 
namibia in december as part of a southwestern africa accord that 
also calls for cuban troops to be withdrawn from angola

prince norodom sihanouk leader of a cambodian 
resistance coalition said sunday he has agreed to meet hun sen 
prime minister of cambodias vietnamesebacked government 
in a statement released from his residence in beijing sihanouk 
said he had been informed by a french diplomat that hun sen was 
ready to make two concessions in regard to the problem in 
cambodia he did not reveal the nature of the concessions 
he said the meeting of cambodias four warring factions could 
take place as early as may 2 in indonesia or in september in france 
last month hun sen sent a letter to sihanouk saying there are 
elements that show that a fundamental agreement is possible 
between the government and resistance groups 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 drove out the radical 
khmer rouge regime that defeated the usbacked government in the 
spring of 1975 and installed another communist administration 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians were killed during the 
nearly three years the khmer rouge was in power as it purged 
opponents and drove people out of the cities to impose a harsh form 
of agrarian communism 
prince sihanouk who was deposed in 1970 now leads a resistance 
alliance of his supporters the khmer rouge and cambodians loyal to 
anticommunist son san 
the three alliance members met in march in beijing and formed a 
national defense council which they said would unify their 
guerrilla forces 
hun sen criticized the council saying it was part of a khmer 
rouge plot to regain power 
on sunday radio broadcasts by the resistance coalition denied 
that allegation and said the khmer rouge would not seek exclusive 
control of the future government and the council would not allow 
any faction to harm the others by force 
representatives of the resistance groups and cambodian 
government met in february in indonesia 
the meeting ended without results when no agreement could be 
reached on the formation of a transitional government to be 
established following a withdrawl of the vietnamese troops from 
cambodia they also disagreed on how to monitor the vietnamese 
withdrawal 
an estimated 70000 vietnamese military personnel are in 
cambodia vietnam has said it will withdraw its troops by september 
if the cambodian factions can agree on a political solution

divers pulled seven bodies from a murky 
rainswollen river sunday where at least that many people died when 
a 50yearold us highway bridge collapsed 
the search for more victims continued but was hampered by bridge 
debris and muddy waters said state highway patrol lt larry 
durham the cause of the collapse was unknown 
searchers did not know how many victims might be in the river 
said leroy bledsoe team director for nine divers working at the 
site 
authorities said they had found a tractortrailer rig and four 
cars which plunged into the river when a large chunk of the 
twolane roadway fell 25 feet into the river about 845 pm cst 
saturday 
they planned to continue to search until were sure there are 
no other vehicles or victims in there bledsoe said 
the collapse left a 60foot gap in the twolane northbound 
bridge carrying us highway 51 over the hatchie river five miles 
north of here and about 45 miles north of memphis a companion 
twolane bridge for southbound traffic was unaffected 
ron collins of the tennessee emergency management agency said 
bridgebuilding experts planned to study the bridge to try to find 
out why it collapsed 
weve got the state department of transportation here their 
bridge survey team is going to survey the pilings of both bridges 
and do some soundings and well just have to go from there he 
said 
state bridge inspectors plan to meet monday morning with the 
national transportation safety board according to covington fire 
chief jerry craig 
the river is slightly swollen from heavy rainfall last month 
craig said 
weve had an unusual amount of rainfall last month the river 
is out of its banks and theres backwater all over the place but 
this happens twice a year every year and has for the past 100 
years craig said 
the river is actually just barely out of its banks we dont 
feel it had any bearing on the collapse said craig 
the highway patrol closed the southbound roadway shortly after 
the collapse and traffic was routed around the area 
one victim was identified as billy herron sr of ripley 
believed to be 49 or 50 said donna pugh a spokeswoman for baptist 
memorial hospital lauderdale in ripley the names of the other six 
were withheld until relatives were notified 
the bodies of three victims a man a woman and a child were 
recovered saturday night they apparently had been riding together 
in one car collins said 
the hatchie which runs generally east to west across the middle 
of west tennessee was at 147 feet 27 feet over flood stage 
about where the accident occurred the national weather service 
reported it was not raining at the time of the collapse but it 
had been raining in previous days 
bledsoe said swift currents and the dark water were hindering 
the search 
its pitch black in there he said 
larry prater of covington said residents have been concerned for 
some time that the bridge was getting old prater said three of his 
relatives were in a pickup truck that drove over the bridge not 
long before it collapsed 
i was telling my wife the other day saying that bridge with 
as much water as weve had is a dangerous thing he said 
aging highway bridges have collapsed in other states in recent 
years in april 1987 an upstate new york span collapsed killing 
10 people in 1983 part of the mianus bridge in connecticut 
collapsed killing three people

it will be another summer of confusion 
in union city where the time of day is strictly a matter of 
opinion 
residents of this city divided by the indianaohio state line 
are victims of the time change that annually splits union city into 
what residents call slow and fast time 
when daylightsaving time went into effect nationwide at 2 am 
sunday most citizens of union city ohio went along they are on 
fast time 
but those who live in union city ind stay on eastern standard 
time yearround as do hoosiers in 76 of indianas 92 counties 
they are on slow time most of them 
most people have adjusted to it but theres still 
confusion said scott stahl mayor of union city ohio 
leroy stentzil a native of ohio has lived in union city ind 
since 1930 but still sets his clocks on ohio time its a 
nuisance until you get used to it stentzil said 
a few years ago stentzil had clocks in his house labeled 
indiana time or ohio time 
i dont do that anymore he said but it does cause 
confusion ive been late lots of times now if im invited to 
something in indiana and i dont think about it im there an hour 
early i keep reading material in my side pocket all the time 
in fact most union city ind residents will experience the 
anxiety of being an hour late for something during the coming 
months said john ford mayor of the indiana side of union city 
but theyll make up for it by being early for something else 
the time change affects families who work on one side of the 
state line but live on the other and merchants who must cater to 
customers on both times stahl said 
in some instances there are stores that stay on slow time no 
matter what stahl said the ohio stores go on fast time there 
are some stores that might split it down the middle it just gets 
confusing 
if theyre normally open until 5 oclock fast time that would 
be 4 oclock slow time so maybe theyll move it a half hour and 
close at 530 that way it would be 430 slow time 
ford said most of the larger industries in union city ind run 
on fast time despite being in indiana those include union city 
body co which produces step vans and shellerglobe corp which 
makes auto trim 
most of the businesses in cities such as detroit and new york 
expect them to be following those hours ford said 
however union city ind schools and government stay on slow 
time as a result some parents are leaving for work while their 
children are just beginning to prepare for school 
part of the people in indiana go on the ohio time just like i 
do stentzil said and part of them dont i used to laughingly 
say i dont care if they put abcs on the clock ill get along 
but im an old man now and it just isnt so easy to adjust 
stentzil said if indiana legislators lived in union city theyd 
think again about the wisdom of exempting indiana from 
daylightsaving time 
exemptions from daylightsaving time are arizona hawaii puerto 
rico the virgin islands american samoa and part of indiana 
according to the world almanac daylightsaving time starts the 
first sunday in april and ends the last sunday in october

at least 20000 people marched through 
downtown on sunday in a noisy abortion rights demonstration that 
organizers called the largest prochoice gathering ever held in the 
san francisco bay area 
police estimated the crowd at about 20000 but organizers of 
the march for womens lives said more than 30000 people 
participated in the march and rally at city hall 
margaret connell 59 of santa barbara marched with her 
85yearold mother and 30yearold daughter they carried a sign 
that said three generations for choice 
i think whats before us is a choice of whether abortion is 
safe and legal or whether abortion is unsafe and illegal said 
connell its not whether theres going to be abortion 
the march which was expected to attract supporters from as far 
away as oregon and washington state was held in conjunction with a 
scheduled april 9 abortion rights rally in washington dc 
in new york city about 400 abortion rights activists some 
hoisting giant clothes hangers pushed against antiabortionists in 
a demonstration in front of st patricks cathedral 
in a rare show of civil disobedience marking what a rally leader 
called a turning point in the abortion rights movement nine 
activists were arrested for trespassing on church property and 
disorderly conduct 
cardinal oconnor we know your position you are the head of 
the new inquisition shouted the protesters who say that 
cardinal john oconnor and the roman catholic hierarchy are 
endorsing violence against women by supporting radical 
antiabortionists 
neither oconnor nor his spokesman returned messages seeking 
comment on the protest 
activists on both sides of the issue have been galvanized by a 
recent us supreme court decision to hear a case that could 
overturn legal protections for abortion that were guaranteed by the 
courts 1973 roe vs wade decision 
many participants said that threat prompted them to gather in 
the streets to publicly express their views 
its the timing with the court said ann murphy 43 of 
berkeley our position doesnt mean were telling people to have 
an abortion because theres nothing worse than a child thats 
unloved and unwanted its a matter of respecting opinions 
the rally also comes at a time when several antiabortion 
groups including operation rescue have held numerous protests at 
clinics around the nation 
in miami a suburban abortion clinic was blockaded for more than 
an hour saturday by antiabortion demonstrators police arrested 
137 people on trespassing charges 
on friday 83 people were arrested for blocking access to an 
abortion clinic in boca raton fla and an arson fire early friday 
caused 65000 damage to an abortion clinic in ocala fla 
sundays san francisco march brought a sharp reaction from 
antiabortion activists 
although the marchers purport to represent the women of 
america i think they are deluded by their own sense of 
selfimportance carole hieatt of san jose prolife council said 
in a statement 
in its most recent poll on the subject the los angeles times 
reported on march 19 that 74 percent of the respondents in a 
nationwide survey said they believed that abortion was morally 
wrong but also believed that it was a decision best left to the 
individual 
more than 100 organizations sponsored sundays demonstration 
including now planned parenthood association the california 
abortion rights action league and the american civil liberties 
union

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev received a 
warm welcome sunday as he arrived in cuba for talks with president 
fidel castro who has criticized the soviet leaders new pragmatic 
brand of communism 
castro wearing the green fatigue uniform that has been his 
trademark for three decades walked onto the rainsoaked tarmac 
after gorbachevs ilyushin 62 jetliner landed and threw his arms 
around the soviet leader 
it was the third meeting of the communist chieftains but 
gorbachevs first visit to cuba the island nation that for nearly 
30 years has stood as a symbol of soviet influence 90 miles off the 
florida coast 
castro kissed gorbachevs wife raisa on both cheeks before 
escorting gorbachev on a review of the presidential honor guard 
hundreds of thousands of cubans mustered by local neighborhood 
committees packed the arrival area at jose marti international 
airport and lined a 10mile route through downtown havana to the 
official guest house where gorbachev will stay during his fourday 
visit 
everything is clear in our friendship in our hearts in our 
soul in our faces gorbachev said in a brief comment to prensa 
latina the cuban news agency upon his arrival at the guest house 
now the only thing left is to talk and we do have somethingg 
to talk about he said 
formal talks between the soviet and cuban leaders were to begin 
monday 
gorbachev and castro rode to the capital standing side by side 
in an open sovietbuilt parade car they waved to the cheering 
flagwaving crowd stacked several deep on both sides of the road 
although castro is known for his ability to turn out thousands 
of people in this city of 2 million the welcome for gorbachev 
appeared genuinely warm 
official media in both countries have papered over ideological 
differences to stress the closeness of cubansoviet relations 
but the contrast between castros doctrinaire marxism and 
gorbachevs newstyle openness and determination to modernize the 
soviet economy is evident just below the surface 
cuba needs perestroika and glasnost one female churchgoer 
said sunday when asked what she thought of gorbachevs visit god 
has put gorbachev in the world and we are grateful 
the woman who spoke on condition of anonymity said she hoped 
gorbachev would encourage castro to permit more freedom in cuba 
cuban security agents called a number of local dissidents to 
suggest they stay away from the welcoming celebrations for 
gorbachev said one source in the dissident community which 
remains largely underground 
political activity interpreted by the communist regime as 
counterrevolutionary is punishable by lengthy prison terms 
during his visit gorbachev is to hold several hours of private 
talks with castro who has been openly critical of the soviet 
leaders pragmatic reforms for borrowing too much from capitalism 
soviet officials have suggested the kremlin may reduce its 
massive economic and military aid to the caribbean nation as it 
seeks to rebuild the soviet domestic economy 
we are going to discuss fidel castros performance just as he 
is going to discuss our own performance soviet spokesman gennady 
gerasimov told abctv earlier sunday in an interview from havana 
we will exchange views and experiences 
before flying to cuba gorbachev stopped in ireland and met with 
prime minister charles haughey who suggested the next ussoviet 
summit be held in ireland 
gorbachevs first summit with president bush will be held in the 
united states later this year if the two nations follow the pattern 
set during ronald reagans presidency however no bushgorbachev 
meeting has been scheduled 
gorbachevs twohour stop to the politically neutral staunchly 
roman catholic ireland was the first by a kremlin leader it was 
gorbachevs first overseas visit since a december trip to the 
united states 
he was scheduled to do some sightseeing and address the national 
assembly before leaving havana to fly to london on wednesday for 
meetings with prime minister margaret thatcher 
he is to speak to financial and business leaders in a nationally 
televised address friday and will have lunch with queen elizabeth 
ii before returning to moscow 
during their meeting in ireland gorbachev and haughey were 
photographed holding glasses of stout the countrys favorite 
beverage gorbachev has championed an antialcoholism campaign in 
the soviet union and has severely restricted sales of vodka

aides met in a vip lounge outside hung a vast oil painting of the 
late john f kennedy that commemorated a 1963 visit by the

the bush administrations new plan to provide 
debt relief for third world countries received a major boost on 
sunday when it won endorsement from the worlds leading 
industrialized countries 
the endorsement was contained in a joint communique adopted by 
the united states japan west germany britain france canada and 
italy it was issued following almost eight hours of closeddoor 
discussions conducted by us treasury secretary nicholas brady and 
his foreign counterparts 
the us proposal was not mentioned by name in the threepage 
joint statement but the discussion of the changes needed in 
current policy showed that the finance ministers were in general 
support of the proposals outlined by brady in a march 10 speech 
debt strategy should be strengthened by placing greater 
emphasis on voluntary debt relief and debt service reduction in 
agreement with the commercial banks as a complement to new 
lending the finance ministers said 
brady said that he was pleased with the endorsement contained in 
the joint statement saying it was unusually detailed on what 
approaches now need to be taken and very specific on the need for 
prompt action by the international lending agencies 
there was broad support for strengthening the debt strategy 
along the lines of the us proposals brady told reporters after 
the meeting had ended 
canadian finance minister michael wilson called the new debt 
strategy an important step forward in solving the sevenyearlong 
debt crisis 
we have a good agreement and we have good support demonstrated 
for the proposal he told reporters 
a senior treasury official who briefed reporters said that 
while the communique did not mention specific support to be 
provided by other countries he expected such announcements would 
be made later in the week the administration is looking for 
countries running large trade surpluses such as japan to offer to 
support the debt reduction effort by providing money for new loans 
the brady plan represents a major departure from the debt 
approach pursued by the reagan administration which had repeatedly 
rejected proposals for broadbased debt forgiveness 
the 13 trillion burden of third world debt has crippled the 
economies of developing nations and sparked economic and political 
unrest in many emerging democracies in latin america riots left at 
least 270 people dead in venezuela in february after the government 
announced a new austerity program to please that countrys 
creditors 
the endorsement by americas major allies was the first step in 
a sales strategy the administration has put together brady now 
takes the proposal before meetings on monday and tuesday of the 
steering committees of the 151nation international monetary fund 
and the world bank 
the two major lending organizations have key roles to play in 
implementation of the new debt relief approach which the 
administration hopes will shave the current debt burden by 20 
percent 
in other comments the seven industrialized countries reaffirmed 
their commitment to stabilize the dollar saying either a sharp 
increase or decline in the greenbacks value would be seen as 
harmful to worldwide economic growth and would trigger joint 
intervention by the nations to buy or sell dollars 
the countries also told the united states that it needs to do 
more to reduce its huge budget deficits and said countries such as 
japan which were running large trade surpluses should continue to 
promote domestic demand in order to provide markets for foreign 
goods 
us allies have been complaining that americas expected 170 
billion federal budget deficit this year threatens worldwide growth 
by driving up interest rates a situation which also adds to the 
debt payment burden of poor nations 
the discussions took place at river farm an estate on the 
potomac river which once belonged to george washington 
under the brady debt plan commercial banks would be asked to 
forgive voluntarily a portion of the loans they have made to poor 
nations in return the imf and world bank would provide assurances 
that the remaining debt would be repaid 
the administration has estimated that over the next three years 
the plan could wipe out about 70 billion of the 340 billion in 
debt owed by 39 of the most heavily indebted countries 
the imf and world bank would be expected to contribute together 
between 20 billion and 25 billion to back the debt reduction 
effort with the united states looking to japan and other countries 
running large trade surpluses to assist in the effort by making new 
loans 
us officials have indicated that mexico venezuela and the 
philippines likely would be among the first beneficiaries of any 
debt relief strategy 
but the debtor nations are already complaining that the plan 
does not go far enough to provide relief some experts have said 
that any attack on the problem will have to write off 50 percent or 
more of the debt 
large us banks who hold 30 percent of the outstanding third 
world loans have reacted cautiously to the proposals fearing that 
they could cause a stampede by debtor nations demanding debt 
forgiveness 
already officials of mexico have indicated that they will ask 
their bank creditors in upcoming negotiations to either provide new 
loans or slash the value of outstanding loans or the interest rates 
being paid by half 
mexico which owes 107 billion is the third worlds second 
largest debtor behind the 110 billion owed by brazil 
the brady plan represents a major departure from the reagan 
administration approach which emphasized new lending and opposed 
any broadbased proposals for debt forgiveness 
the reagan approach was crafted by thentreasury secretary james 
a baker iii baker who is secretary of state in the bush 
administration said in a speech last week that the new policy of 
debt forgiveness would be negotiated on a countrybycountry basis 
with the relief going to those debtor nations willing to adopt 
necessary economic reforms 
at the imf meetings on sunday debtor nations issued a statement 
attacking the baker approach to third world debt while welcoming 
the new approach outlined by brady 
jeanpierre lemboumbalepandou finance minister of gabon and 
chairman of the committee representing developing countries said 
the brady plan was an important initiative and we are convinced 
that it will bear fruit 
however the gabon finance minister sidestepped questions about 
whether the us proposal went far enough to reduce the debt 
burden saying the specifics of the proposal still needed to be 
worked out in upcoming meetings
