virgilio godoy reyes brings solid 
political experience and a controversial personality to the campaign 
for which he is running as opposition vice presidential candidate in 
next februarys election 
while crowds at the headquarters of the national opposition union 
on saturday night cheered violeta barrios de chamorro the 
presidential candidate hecklers three times shouted the name of 
godoys rival for the no 2 spot 
while perhaps not an auspicious start for a political candidate 
godoys strong personality which some have described as arrogant 
and abrasive can take the heckling 
the hostility stems from his fouryear eightmonth tenure as 
labor minister under the leftist sandinista government against 
which he is running now as labor minister godoy instituted a 
system of salary levels that became widely unpopular detractors say 
his government post also makes his allegiance to the opposition 
somewhat suspect 
godoy was labor minister from july 19 1979 to march 31 1984 
when he resigned he said later that he quit because he disagreed 
with the leftist sandinista ideology his resignation however 
reflects his political talent the government gave him a goingaway 
reception showing he must have left in good stead 
the 55yearold lawyer has been better at defending himself from 
power plays within his own party the independent liberals than in 
attacking the sandinistas 
political attacks against godoy stem not only from his 
personality as from his tenure as president of the independent 
liberal party for 10 years one critic who prefered to remain 
unidentified called godoy dictatorial and machiavellian 
godoy follows a long tradition of liberalism in his family his 
grandfather gen paulino godoy was the spearhead of the 
nicaraguas liberal revolution of 1983 
he has said that the slogan of the french revolution liberty 
equality brotherhood encapsules the most important concepts for 
the individual and society 
godoy is married to sonia perez mercado a mexican they have 
three children

the latest cub born to the giant panda 
lingling died from complications caused by infections it developed 
either during or after birth a national zoo spokesman said sunday 
the female cub born to lingling on friday was found dead early 
sunday said chief zoo spokesman robert hoage 
the cub was believed to have contracted the infection either 
while it was still in its mothers womb or shortly after it was 
delivered 
all of linglings previous cubs have died had this one 
survived it would be the first giant panda successfully bred in the 
united states 
the 4ounce female cub was confined to an oxygenfilled incubator 
since late friday and was fed a milklike formula through a tube 
that was inserted down the throat and into the stomach 
she was also innoculated with immunoglobins that had been 
prepared from the blood of her father hsinghsing and given 
special formula antibiotics 
lingling was known to have urinary and reproductive tract 
infections hoage said 
the cub was the fifth that lingling had given birth to while in 
captivity none of them had survived as long as the latest one 
one of the cubs was born stillborn and the other three died 
shortly after birth previously linglings longestlived cub was 
born in 1987 and lived about 40 hours before dying possibly because 
of the same infection that took the life of her most recent 
offspring hoage said 
lingling and hsinghsing were given to the united states by the 
chinese government during president nixons visit to china in 1972 
since that time they have mated on numerous occasions but lingling 
has only given birth four times

bloomingdales the lavish department store that 
new yorks conspicuous consumers know as bloomies will open two 
shops in moscow next year soviet newspapers reported sunday 
bloomingdales began capitalizing on gorbymania in the united 
states by selling soviet goods in its new york store in may 
but the opening of two shops in moscow would be more significant 
given the marketoriented reforms aimed at filling the nations 
store shelves 
the newspaper moscow pravda said bloomingdales and the moscow 
city council signed a letter of intent for the joint venture 
bringing the stores to the capital they are to open in january the 
paper said 
in its report on the venture the newspaper pravda noted that the 
new york store sells soviet products in a special perestroika 
department a reference to president mikhail s gorbachevs reform 
program 
the brief articles did not say whether the two moscow shops would 
accept soviet rubles or limit their sales to hard currency which 
ordinary soviets are prohibited from possessing

former president carter in the mode of his camp 
david triumph is staging talks this week between the ethiopian 
government and eritrean rebels on the 28yearold war that has 
killed hundreds of thousands 
ten years ago carter brokered the camp david peace agreement 
between israel and egypt the sessions beginning thursday have a 
more modest goal getting the two sides to sit down together 
in the history of political affairs the most significant 
single step is the first meeting carter said last month in 
announcing the talks 
previous attempts have failed to arrange talks between the 
ethiopian government and the wellorganized heavily armed rebels 
fighting for independence for their province but carter during a 
july visit to the east african nation said the opportunity for 
peace has never been better 
the war has turned more than 1 million people into refugees it 
has drained the ethiopian economy contributed to the suffering from 
famine and drought and led the government to bring in soviet and 
cuban military aid 
the two sides now have agreed that carter should act as a neutral 
observer for the preliminary talks which the participants say they 
hope will lead to more substantive meetings 
neither ethiopian leader mengistu haile mariam nor isaias 
afwerki general secretary of the eritrean peoples liberation 
front will attend the meetings at the carter center the center 
opened in 1986 houses the carter presidential library and museum as 
well as a think tank a conference center and offices of foundations 
devoted to peace and public health 
carter center officials will not disclose the size of the 
negotiating teams where the groups will stay or security plans the 
meetings will be closed and no one knows how long they will last 
dayle e powell the carter centers director of conflict 
resolution programs said extensive efforts have been made to ensure 
the negotiators feel comfortable during their stay 
not just their physical comfort but the feeling of 
neutrality she said we are making every effort to provide for 
them a congenial environment in every aspect 
for example carter center personnel are careful not to term the 
ethiopianeritrean conflict a civil war which ms powell said 
implies support for the governments view of the struggle as a 
conflict within a single state 
eritrean guerrillas which share some marxist principles with the 
ethiopian government believe their province at the northern tip of 
ethiopia with 35 million people should be an independent nation 
an ancient ethiopian kingdom eritrea has been ruled by the 
ottoman turks the italians and finally the british during world 
war ii before becoming part of a federation with ethiopia after the 
war fighting broke out between ethiopia and eritrea in 1961 and 
ethiopia annexed eritrea in 1962 
eritrea has long been coveted territory because its location on 
the red sea gives ethiopia its only ports 
mengistu came to power after the 1974 ouster of emperor haile 
selassie who had ruled since 1930 with the change in power came an 
increase in the soviet presence in ethiopia and the withdrawal 
during the carter administration of us military aid and advisers 
the united states has continued to provide humanitarian aid the 
soviet union recently has directed less attention to ethiopia 
a second rebel group the tigre peoples liberation front took 
up arms 14 years ago in a fight for increased autonomy in its 
province which borders eritrea it also has made overtures for 
peace and accepted carter as an observer but that conflict will not 
be a part of this weeks talks 
the ethiopia talks mark the second time this year carter has been 
at the center of an major international event last spring he served 
as an observer in panamas elections and then briefed president bush 
on the voting which he said was rife with fraud 
carter plans to play a background role in the ethiopian talks he 
and his center will serve mainly as a vehicle for bringing the 
opposing sides together according to ms powell 
some of the principles of the 1979 camp david talks can be 
applied here ms powell said what worked at camp david was that 
the parties met on neutral ground she said neither side had 
the upper hand and a third party was present with a sincere 
interest in resolution 
though the camp david talks lasted 13 days israels menachem 
begin and egypts anwar sadat actually met facetoface for only two 
days ms powell said 
president carter literally shuttled back and forth ms 
powell said we hope that part wont be replicated we hope 
theyll meet in the same room

authorities this week will begin the 
longawaited exodus of east germans seeking asylum in west germany 
red cross officials disclosed on sunday 
west german red cross official wolfgang wagner also said 
authorities believed east german police have infiltrated the 
emergency camps in hungary that are holding thousands of people 
awaiting safe passage to the west 
we reckon thats so but were not equipped to do anything 
about it he said in response to a question 
he sought to dampen speculation that the transfer would begin 
sunday telling reporters the east germans would leave sometime 
this week asked what was holding up the exodus wagner said 
were awaiting word from the west german embassy 
since vacationing east germans began crowding the embassy in 
budapest to demand passage to the west in july the embassy has 
declined to comment on the developments 
while legal travel to the west is difficult for most east 
germans they have relatively little difficulty getting permission 
from their communist government to visit hungary a liberal soviet 
bloc country more than 1 million have vacationed here annually in 
the last few years 
more than 200000 east germans were thought to be in hungary 
before the weekend and premier miklos nemeth has estimated that up 
to 20000 of them want to go to west germany 
a bilateral agreement obliges hungary to send east germans trying 
to flee to the west back to their homeland but hungarian officials 
have refused to do so and their decision to permit the east germans 
to go west has led to tensions with east berlin 
it also has resulted in a strengthening of ties with west 
germany where government officials have praised hungarys handling 
of the problem 
karsten voigt a senior west german opposition official last 
week called on government officials to provide financial and moral 
support for hungarys reformminded communist leaders 
on saturday west german chancellor helmut kohl appealed to 
countrymen to welcome the east germans while other officials and 
politicians called on the east berlin leadership to stop the exodus 
by introducing reforms 
holidaying east germans frustrated by political rigidity and 
economic stagnation at home began using hungary as a springboard to 
the west after it started removing barbed wire and other barriers 
from its border with austria in may 
since then more than 6000 are estimated to have fled to austria 
en route to west germany which grants them automatic citizenship 
and helps them start new lives by giving them financial and social 
aid 
others seeking to emigrate first crowded the west german embassy 
in budapest with government approval hungarian charitable 
organizations opened the first camps for east germans in midaugust 
after the crush of wouldbe refugees staying in the embassy forced 
bonn to close it 
wagner said that 4000 east germans had been placed in four camps 
and a small boarding house by early sunday afternoon following more 
than 1000 new arrivals during the weekend 
hundreds more were staying in tents and trailers near the zanka 
camp about 90 miles southwest of budapest said other red cross 
officials 
while no official details of plans to move the east germans had 
been made public by sunday developments in austria and west germany 
over the past week indicated they would be moved by rail through 
austria to temporary quarters in bavaria the main west german state 
bordering austria 
in bavaria sunday volunteer workers put the finishing touches on 
five tent communities with room for more than 5000 people austrian 
rail officials continued to hold up to 50 railway cars ready for 
quick movement to border points with hungary 
many of those in the budapest camps huddled in tents or trailers 
to escape occasional showers while others attended religious 
services on camp grounds or in city churches

areas of social concern child care minimum 
wage parental leave and greater opportunities for the disabled 
will be among the issues facing congress when it returns this week 
but no one is predicting quick action 
child care legislation the issue that became a focus of the 1988 
presidential campaign has passed the senate the bill calls for 
direct grants to child care providers and would establish 
nonbinding federal guidelines 
but in the house a companion bill is embroiled in a dispute 
between two committees with jurisdiction over it 
besides that house republicans are pushing the white house plan 
tax credits for lower and middleincome parents of children under 
age 4 regardless of whether both parents actually work and pay for 
outside child care 
whether child care legislation passes the house before it 
recesses for the year sometime in november is anyones guess but 
legislative staffers believe if the house does agree on a bill it 
will be one that will be acceptable to the senate and the white 
house 
the child care issue has been kicking around since 1971 when 
president nixon vetoed legislation similar to that under 
consideration now calling it antifamily another bill was 
considered by congress in 1975 but never made it to the president 
it remains at hot issue with six of 10 americans surveyed this 
summer in a washington postabc news poll saying they think the 
federal government should provide childcare assistance to low and 
middleincome families 
the main disagreement now is between the house education and 
labor committee and ways and means committee 
basically the ways and means approach is to put money for child 
care programs into block grants that go to the states with no 
strings attached the committee already has acted by putting 
language on child care into the budget reconciliation bill that 
legislation is the omnibus bill into which all committees are 
expected to contribute deficit reduction plans 
a committee said the markup of the committees proposal for the 
child care bill is scheduled for thursday and will include an effort 
to make it conform to the budget reconciliation proposals 
the provisions of the bill passed by education and labor include 
putting more money into head start so those programs can run all 
day instead of half a day 
using public school systems to help care for children over 3 
years old 
grants to providers for the children of parents who cant afford 
the full cost of day care 
improving day care quality through training programs 
while containing the provisions of the senate bill the education 
and labor version goes further 
as for minimum wage congress must reach a compromise with the 
white house if there is to be final action 
after the first attempt at raising the minimum wage fell to a 
presidential veto sen edward kennedy dmass reintroduced the 
very same measure 
it has been voted out of committee and awaits a full senate vote 
but staff members say talks are going on with the administration to 
determine how it might be changed on the floor in a compromise with 
the white house 
meanwhile rep austin j murphy dpa introduced a bill in the 
house that would raise the minimum wage from 335 to 425 by 1991 
the maximum amount acceptable to president bush 
but it does not contain a provision demanded by the white house 
that would allow employers to pay new workers a lessthanminimum 
wage for up to six months 
the issue of family leave has gained the attention of congress 
and awaits debate on the floor of both the house and the senate the 
measures would require employers to provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid 
leave for family emergencies 
another measure that may see its way through congress this 
session is called the americans with disabilities act 
this bill is considered the most comprehensive civil rights 
measure since the 1964 civil rights act 
it would prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities 
in private sector employment public accommodations transportation 
public services and telecommunications 
it expected to be on the senate floor soon with house action 
later in the fall

in the cocaine capital of the world 
the new war between the government and traffickers is one of nerves 
as well as firepower 
an industrial city of 2 million cradled in lush green mountains 
medellin suffers almost daily bombings and burnings by the henchmen 
of drug bosses in a war that began with the aug 18 assassination of 
a presidential candidate 
but bloodshed since that killing has been limited to unlucky 
bystanders in the past two weeks property not people has been the 
principal target fear the main weapon 
the city continues to function its shops opening each day and 
its workers and businessmen filling the streets factories and 
offices but fear and tension is pervasive 
theres no direct confrontation but instead subversive actions 
sporadic and surprising mayor juan gomez martinez said 
its harder to combat them than in a regular war 
the government has arrested thousands of people and seized 
hundreds of millions of dollars in assets since it declared a 
crackdown on drug kingpins on the same day presidential hopeful luis 
carlos galan was assassinated drug traffickers have responded with 
more shootings and bombings 
in response to the traffickers campaign of terror martinez last 
week imposed a strict 10 pmto6 am citywide curfew he concedes 
that the measure was as much psychological as tactical 
the curfew is not just to prevent the attacks the bombs he 
told foreign reporters at a news conference its also so that the 
entire community knows that we have a problem 
for a city like medellin its a drastic measure the townspeople 
are known for a kind of restless joy of life and the night has 
always been vibrant with the bars and dance halls full of loud 
music and people drinking shots of the licoriceflavored local 
aguardiente 
for the moment the partys over 
at 10 pm the citys 4000 police aided by thousands of army 
soldiers take over the streets armed with automatic and 
semiautomatic rifles they round up curfew violators at gunpoint 
hustling them down the streets to gathering points and packing them 
into city dumptrucks headed for a volleyball arena 
most of the violators are illdressed sometimes barefoot drunks 
and tramps as well as male and female prostitutes many stumble and 
sway their eyes glazed by cheap alcohol they yell and whistle 
derisively at their military guards creating a din in the 
tinroofed arena 
the violators are held until the curfew ends at 6 am those 
found to have criminal charges pending are shipped to the police 
jailhouse the rest are set free 
this is just what the city needed now there are no more 
wounded there are no more dead at night said an army officer 
now the people can sleep in peace 
but real peace has remained elusive the morning after the curfew 
first took effect wednesday a bomb strapped to a juice vendors 
bicycle blew up in broad daylight several people were injured 
it hasnt stopped people from going outdoors but when you do 
go out you always carry a fear that something will happen while 
youre passing by said rubiela toro a medellin housewife 
so far the traffickers targets in medellin have been political 
or economic political party offices statesmens homes and country 
clubs banks and factories have been bombed or burned 
in recent days theyve been seeking a truly big bang evidently 
to further fray the stretched nerves of the community 
they set up rockets to fire at a liquor plants huge tanks of 
alcohol but police interrupted the attempt they fired rockets at 
gasoline storage tanks but missed 
on thursday the bomb attached to the bicycle was placed outside 
the countrys largest paint factory and according to a company 
source inside were 3000 gallons of highly explosive nitroglycerin 
if that bomb went off 30 yards down the street half of 
medellin would have blown up said the source who spoke on 
condition he not be identified 
on saturday the traffickers took the battle to bogota setting 
off a powerful bomb outside the offices of the daily newspaper el 
espectador 
since medellin was founded in 1616 by spanish immigrants its 
people have developed a repution for being keen traders and 
industrious entrepreneurs but since the drug underworld emerged in 
the 1960s dealing first in marijuana and now primarily in cocaine 
that reputation has been sullied by gangland violence 
bloodshed reached new horrific heights in the last 18 months 
with an underground war between the medellin cartel and that of the 
southeastern city of cali for control of the 1 billion new york 
market a medellin journalist said that up until the curfew which 
put the feud on ice his newspaper was reporting an average of six 
killings a day 
the traffickers also have killed the provincial governor and 
police commander as well as scores of medellin judges in a 
successful effort to avoid arrest 
judges and law enforcement officials are known to receive threats 
in the most terrible forms such as a mutilated photograph of their 
children 
the traffickers new aim is to get the government to end its 
nationwide crackdown and agree to negotiations the government so 
far has categorically rejected the suggestion 
mayor gomez however favors talks with the cocaine barons and 
sees them as inevitable no one knows when the war is going to 
end he said but i think its going to end at the negotiating 
table

she was once the most dangerous woman 
in america for close to half a century coal miners from west 
virginia to colorado knew her as a fiery champion of organized labor 
in an era when picket lines were often met with bayonets 
today memories of mary harris mother jones have faded even 
in the coalmining country where she is buried in the only 
unionowned cemetery in the nation but a handful of labor activists 
and scholars want to ensure she is more than a footnote to the 
history of the labor movement 
she serves as kind of an inspiration to workers who wont be 
satisfied until they are on an equal plane in control of their 
destiny said labor historian ralph stone of sangamon state 
university in springfield which holds an annual mother jones 
commemoration 
from the 1870s almost until her death in 1930 her whitehaired 
grandmotherly figure was in the thick of some of the nations most 
bitter labor disputes at a time when miners bought food from the 
company store and slept in company houses on company land she was a 
fierce socialist who once bristled when called a great 
humanitarian 
get it right she retorted im not a humanitarian im a 
hellraiser 
her history is a litany of clashes with police prosecutors and 
government authorities most of whom she saw as tools of the 
highclass burglars who owned mines and factories the 
authorities saw her as a subversive of the worst kind 
there sits the most dangerous woman in america a west 
virginia prosecutor said of her in the early 1900s she crooks her 
finger 20000 contented men lay down their tools and walk out 
historians say mother jones was given to rewriting her own 
history and indisputable facts about her early life are few an 
irish immigrant trained as a teacher she lived briefly in chicago 
but settled in memphis tenn in the 1860s she married an 
ironworker who was an active union member and had three children 
her husband and children died in an 1867 epidemic of yellow 
fever and the young widow moved back to chicago where she worked 
as a dressmaker and was drawn into union work 
despite nearly 60 years as a labor organizer she was by her 
reckoning 100 years old at her death in 1930 her tangible legacy 
is limited in part because of her distaste for institutions though 
closely associated with the united mine workers she feuded with 
some of its bestknown leaders such as john l lewis 
the miners union gave her permission to organize but she never 
held office stone said it is also unclear how she made the leap 
from dressmaking to the coal fields 
she wasnt an administrator she wasnt a functionary stone 
said she suffered the bureaucrats very poorly she would be 
just as upset today as she was in 1910 or 1920 and shed be upset 
in some ways with the labor unions 
years before her death she requested burial in mount olive about 
40 miles northeast of st louis in a cemetery bought by miners as a 
resting place for four comrades killed in the virden massacre an 
1898 clash between striking workers and mine guards in a nearby 
town for years mother jones tomb was the site of an annual 
pilgrimage 
they would have speakers prominent labor people thousands of 
visitors says viola krivi a coal miners daughter who as a 
10yearold filed past the tomb you couldnt walk down the 
sidewalk the streets were so crowded 
the annual tributes stopped as many of the areas mines shut down 
some of the tradition has been revived in recent years with the 
mother jones dinner at sangamon state that includes a pilgrimage to 
the gravesite it is held the second saturday in october 
in the last 10 years she has started to get some attention but 
until the 70s she was pretty much neglected stone said its 
true not only in illinois but in most of the country one reason 
she is better known now is the existence of the 13yearold san 
franciscobased magazine mother jones a liberal journal best known 
for its expose on the problems of the ford pinto 
today a handlettered sign along interstate 55 guides visitors 
to mother jones grave a 22foot edifice of pink granite that 
towers over a oneacre cemetery bordered by cornfields

thousands of blacks marched 
picnicked and waded at a whitesonly beach sunday police made 
58 arrests but waited more than two hours before breaking up the 
protest 
the crowd estimated at 5000 to 10000 stretched for more than 
a mile along the shore the biggest beach protest ever in south 
africa 
organizers claimed a victory over segregation and vowed further 
acts of protest during a nationwide defiance campaign 
several dozen whites some carrying whips and wearing whites 
only tshirts yelled abuse as the throng paraded along the 
segregated sections of south africas most heavily used beachfront 
other sections of the hotellined shore have been opened to all 
races in recent years 
one angry white man barged into the crowd yelling and pushing 
but police said they could control the situation on their own some 
whites yelled to the officers shoot them dead 
at one point police arrested about 10 black youths who unfurled 
a flag of the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement 
they remained in custody late sunday but police said the other 48 
people arrested during the course of the protest were released after 
a few hours 
the police contingent of several hundred officers was equipped 
with shot guns and a water cannon but they made no efforts to stop 
the protesters from moving onto segregated addington beach 
in contrast police used clubs and whips and arrested 500 people 
saturday in cape town while breaking up a planned protest march to 
parliament 
white lifeguards remained at their posts during the beach protest 
and white surfers continued to paddle off the shore while black 
children splashed nearby 
after about 2 hours police officers announced that the protest 
was illegal and began moving the crowd away 
at a news conference later protest leaders said they considered 
the event a success 
its the dawn of a new age said the rev stanley mogoba a 
prominent methodist leader 
more than 1300 people including prominent activists such as 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu have been arrested since wednesday 
in connection with the defiance campaign most have been released 
pending possible court action 
the defiance campaign began aug 2 and has intensified steadily 
in the days leading to wednesdays segregated parliamentary 
elections which exclude the black majority 
a twoday national protest probably including a general strike 
is planned for tuesday and wednesday by major antiapartheid 
groups 
the majority of the beach protesters were youths many wearing 
yellow caps with the slogan free the beaches the crowd included 
many indians and some whites as well as blacks 
local police officials had warned activists last week that the 
protest could trigger violence and some roadblocks were set up in 
an attempt to keep protesters away from the beach 
police reported that several small bombs exploded friday night in 
trash bins along the beachfront near the bins pamphlets 
purportedly written by white rightwing extremists warned activists 
not to proceed with the protest 
previous targets of the defiance campaign have included 
segregated hospitals schools and buses many activists have defied 
restrictions imposed on them following their release from detention 
and several banned organizations have declared that they were 
resuming operations 
protesters were whipped by police at a defiance protest at a 
whitesonly beach near cape town on aug 19 at least two cabinet 
ministers of the governing national party have expressed regret for 
that incident but the government has given no public indication 
that it is ready to make major changes in remaining segregation laws 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

striking eastern airlines employees coal 
miners and phone workers are the symbol of both the uncertainty and 
solidarity the american labor movement reflects on this labor day 
in an extraordinary year labor has suffered some major losses 
yet won some impressive victories although the spotlight on the 
negatives has tended to obscure the bright spots 
a number of unions have proven that labormanagement cooperation 
can work but as in the case of the united auto workers learned as 
well that too much of a good thing can prove troublesome 
others have found hope in their solidarity particularly in the 
eastern and miners strikes but will spend labors traditional 
holiday wondering if their jobs are the price they will pay for 
their pride and determination 
the movement has lost one nemesis ronald reagan but gained 
another frank lorenzo 
union workers here can take pride in remarkable developments in 
poland their dues helped support the solidarity trade union from 
its underground days to its historic rise as leader of the first 
noncommunist government in the east bloc through the aflcio us 
unions funneled thousands of dollars worth of printing equipment and 
other supplies to solidarity while it was outlawed 
i think the role of the american trade union movement in this 
should not be overlooked aflcio president lane kirkland said 
last week 
kirkland head of the 14million member aflcio the major 
umbrella group for the nearly 18 million americans who belong to 
unions says those who are eulogizing the labor movement dont 
understand it 
the key to any evaluation of the labor movement ought to 
examine what we regard as the most important measure and that is 
internal cohesiveness and solidarity he said and i think its 
fair to say that we do have a higher degree of solidarity and 
cohesion today than weve had in many many years 
a number of developments bolster kirklands point among them 
the virtually unprecedented support of the pilots union when 
the machinists union struck eastern on march 4 
joint negotiations between former enemies the communications 
workers of america and the international brotherhood of electrical 
workers with atampt and the baby bell regional telephone 
companies that solidarity continued in a number of strikes against 
the regional companies 
nationwide wildcat strikes to support 1700 miners who struck 
pittston coal group after lengthy and bitter negotiations failed to 
bring a settlement pittston is seeking to halt its contributions to 
union pension funds a move that likely would cause other companies 
to follow suit 
still there have been setbacks for labor as well 
a trickle of defections among union pilots turned into a steady 
flow that has allowed eastern and lorenzo to move ahead with 
plans to reorganize the carrier as a smaller nonunion airline 
labor still hopes to use congress and bankruptcy court to oust 
lorenzo but its chances appear slim as the strike reaches the 
sixmonth mark on labor day 
the most highly publicized failure of big labor was the auto 
workers defeat in an election at a nissan plant in smyrna tenn 
its first attempt to organize a us plant fully owned by the 
japanese 
at nissan and at other industries that traditionally have been 
the backbone of trade unions the labor movement is running into two 
main obstacles management programs to undermine union support by 
giving workers more say and perks and intricate antiunion 
campaigns to defeat organizing drives including screening applicants 
to determine their attitudes toward unions 
at smyrna nissan screened more than 100000 workers for about 
3000 jobs 
but kirkland said the japanese arent to blame for doing that 
they are led into this course in some cases not by anything 
inherent in their culture or their own countries because in many 
instances they have a history of dealing with trade unions in their 
own countries with good faith but are following the advice of 
hustlers american hustlers who have made a new profession out of 
trying to guide employers for a fee kirkland said 
to counter such tactics labor is changing the way it looks at 
organizing and now accepts as associate members workers at 
plants where organizing efforts failed and immigrant workers looking 
for residency status in the united states 
by getting its foot in the door and offering those workers 
benefits such as cutrate credit cards insurance and legal 
services unions hope to foster goodwill that will bring success in 
later elections 
such a concept once reviled by traditionalists in the movement 
has brought in 300000 associate members in the past three years 
and according to kirkland and other federation officials is 
beginning to pick up steam 
the federation also is now stepping in to avoid most fighting 
among unions by deciding which affiliate should get the chance at 
nonunion companies targeted for organizing and the affiliates are 
making fresh efforts at attracting women minorities and workers in 
the growing service sector 
the noisy year for labor has to some degree obscured some 
remarkable contract agreements 
the steelworkers union won back many of the concessions workers 
were forced to give earlier in the decade when the industry was 
nearly crippled 
the cwa and ibew came out of the atampt talks and the regional 
negotiations settled so far with contracts that include innovative 
packages of parental leave elder care and child care benefits 
and uaw workers at a joint chryslermitsubishi plant in illinois 
last week agreed on a new contract believed to have the best 
jobprotection provisions ever included in a major industrial 
contract 
in the final months of 1989 the eastern strike and legislative 
initiatives are likely to dominate labors agenda 
pending on capitol hill are efforts to raise the minimum wage and 
a number of other laborbacked measures including expanded child 
care benefits and a number of bills designed to curb mergers and 
acquisitions also pending but unlikely to pass is a measure 
designed to force president bush to intervene in the eastern strike 
kirkland refers to bush as reagan lite sharing his former 
boss promanagement bent but not his virulent antiunion philosophy 
labor secretary elizabeth dole said sunday the bush 
administration was striving to maintain close contact with the 
organized labor leadership 
we talk at least once a week with the aflcio she said 
appearing on cnns newsmaker sunday program mrs dole noted 
that what i have been very pleased to see and were urging a 
continuation of this approach is cooperation between management 
and labor 
that trend has been occurring over the last 10 years its very 
important that it continue if were going to become ever more 
competitive on a global basis that there not be so much 
confrontation and more cooperation between management and labor 
she said 
even though bush is regarded as no friend of the labor movement 
he is not seen as its no 1 enemy as was reagan 
that designation has been passed to lorenzo who was successful 
in making continental airlines a nonunion carrier and appears on 
the verge of winning again at eastern 
his recent talk of selling continental has sparked hope in the 
labor movement that the airline unions might yet pull a victory out 
of defeat 
kirkland said there will be no winners even if the carrier 
returns to the union fold but his contempt for lorenzo was clearly 
evident as he added a caveat 
scorched earth on both sides is not a victory he said of 
course its better than scorched earth on just one side

heavy air force and artillery 
bombardments by the afghan army have failed to break rebel control 
of a strategic post near the border city of khost government 
officials and diplomats said sunday 
but the major assault by usbacked rebels against the city 
appears to have stalled they said 
also sunday the afghan foreign ministry issued a statement 
criticizing the united states for continuing to arm the 
pakistanibased rebels saying it underscored an american desire for 
war in afghanistan 
government sources and diplomats said the assault on khost which 
began 10 days ago was aimed at gaining recognition from the 
nonaligned summit that begins in belgrade yugoslavia on monday 
president najib said in a statement released sunday that he would 
seek special backing for his peace proposals at the conference 
in the khost fighting government sources said the afghan troops 
had recaptured three posts but still were trying to take four more 
fortified positions lost in earlier fighting 
the most strategic of those was at daragai 10 miles south of the 
city because it controls the main supply routes between pakistan 
and the capital 
the provincial capital just 18 miles from the pakistani border 
is considered the most vulnerable to rebel assault because supply 
lines are so short 
we have felt a lot of pressure in the last week said one 
government official speaking on condition of anonymity the 
threat has diminished but their effort has not collapsed 
the guerrillas issued a statement saturday in pakistan saying the 
afghan army had failed to take the position at daragai 
the official described the fighting around the city as 
serious 
he said khost remained secure because the strategic routes into 
the city were heavily mined the government supplies its troops by 
air because the road to the capital has long been controlled by the 
rebels 
government troops also have been fighting rebel assaults around 
the city of jalalabad 120 miles east of the capital and in the 
southeastern province of kandahar the officials said 
kabul was quiet a day after rocket attacks killed 16 and injured 
52 
the afghan foreign ministry issued its criticism of the united 
states in response to remarks made thursday in pakistan by peter 
tomsen special us envoy to the guerrillas 
tomsen said the united states would continue to arm the 
guerrillas in their effort to topple the sovietbacked government in 
kabul pakistan and saudi arabia also support the rebels 
tomsens statements indicate the warmongering policy of the 
united states the statement said 
the soviet union withdrew its 115000 troops in afghanistan in 
february under a unsponsored agreement to end the fighting that 
started in 1979 
the rebels formed an interim government but have failed in 
repeated efforts to capture a provincial capital to use as its seat 
the president speaking to the official agency bakhtar before his 
departure late saturday said he would propose that the nonaligned 
movement set up a committee to pursue his peace proposals 
pakistan and saudi arabia are expected to lead the fight against 
the committee 
najib has proposed negotiating with the rebels in conjunction 
with a six month ceasefire to be followed by nationwide elections

vietnamese leader nguyen van linh 
sharply rejected a multiparty system for his communist nation and 
declared that freedom of speech amounts to anarchy 
expressing unease with the kind of changes sweeping the soviet 
union poland and other communist countries linh said vietnam 
would keep liberalizing its economy but not its political system 
it is not our policy to hasten renovation of the political 
system while preparations are still inadequate the communist 
party leader said neither is it our intention to effect limitless 
democratization 
the communist party of vietnam is the leader initiator and 
pacesetter in renovation linh said we shall not allow any 
force to set up any opposition party to work against the people and 
against socialism once again we declare that we resolutely reject 
pluralism a multiparty system or opposition parties 
his comments came in a 10000word speech laden with marxist 
terminology and dogma linh an economic reformer who has also taken 
some steps toward political liberalization gave the address at a 
meeting in hanoi on friday to mark vietnams national day a text 
was seen in bangkok on sunday 
its basic thrust reflected a recent conservative trend in hanoi 
with official media lashing out at liberal reform in hungary and 
poland 
some observers believe the trend stems from leaders fears that 
vietnams opendoor economic policy will lead to a popular 
prodemocracy movement such as occurred in china 
others however believe the recent conservative declarations are 
a tactical ploy by party liberals to appease conservative elements 
democracy does not mean that one is free to say what one wants 
to say write what one wants to write and do what one wants to do 
no matter what the consequences may be the communist leader said 
these are essentially anarchist acts 
linh said that while vietnam believes in the reform occurring in 
some communist countries there were opposition forces of all 
colors which are misusing liberalization and openness to fish in 
troubled waters 
he accused the united states and other imperialists of trying 
to undermine the communist camp and launching frenzied attacks 
against socialism 
however linh said capitaliststyle reforms would continue in 
vietnam he said the pace of such changes has quickened considerably 
since they were first launched two years ago

two years ago the calvert cliffs nuclear power 
plant in maryland was on a roll today its on its back and federal 
regulators are wondering whether the traumatic tumble is symptomatic 
of broader problems in the nuclear industry 
one concern is that owners of some plants dissatisfied with the 
profit outlook in nuclear energy are turning too much of their 
corporate attention to other businesses sometimes taking on 
projects far removed from the nuclear field 
baltimore gas amp electric which owns the calvert cliffs station 
denies that its move into new enterprises in the early 1980s 
including ownership of nursing homes led to the nuclear plants 
decline it says complacency was its downfall and that an infusion 
of new senior managers will put the plant back on track 
whatever the reason regulators are stunned that a nuclear plant 
long considered one of the best in the business could suddenly drop 
to near the bottom of the heap 
both of calvert cliffs nuclear reactors have been closed since 
may because of mechanical problems one may be restarted in october 
the other next spring although the utility must first get a 
goahead from the nuclear regulatory commission which has had the 
plant under special surveillance since last winter 
calvert cliffs is not the only source of worry for regulators 
although the nuclear industrys overall record in safety and 
efficiency has been improving lately the nrc is concerned that 
signs of trouble are cropping up unexpectedly at some plants 
they cite as examples the surry plant owned by virginia power 
co which last may was hit with a 500000 fine for violating 
nuclear regulatory commission rules one of the largest fines ever 
imposed by the agency and the salem plant of new jerseys public 
service electric and gas which in late august drew especially low 
marks in a regular nrc review of its operating performance 
one of the dilemmas facing regulators is determining when a 
dropoff in performance at an individual plant may be serious enough 
to force a shutdown there are no clear guidelines for making this 
judgment officials said 
the nrc now is mulling the case of the turkey point nuclear 
station in south florida which has been ranked among the worst 
performers for three straight years in the commissions biannual 
review of operations at all 112 us nuclear plants 
the commission has repeatedly criticized turkey points 
performance citing among other things unstable management by 
florida power amp light co the plant owner last june some nrc 
officials suggested the commission might force turkey point to close 
if it didnt show improvement by the end of the year 
also william russell administrator of the nrcs northeast 
regional office said recently he had a real concern that the 
reason for problems at the nine mile point 1 nuclear plant near 
oswego ny was a diversion of attention by its owner niagara 
mohawk power corp to its financial troubles 
the most puzzling case however is calvert cliffs which in 
august 1987 was inspected by a team from the international atomic 
energy agency and given a clean bill of health 
calvert cliffs is a good example of what is expected from a 
well managed and operated plant the inspectors report said 
adding that no shortcomings in equipment personnel and operating 
practices were found that would compromise safe operation 
the report included some mild criticism of the plants 
maintenance and industrial safety training programs but the overall 
judgment was that calvert cliffs was above the average of nuclear 
plants inspected in other countries 
then the trouble began last spring and summer calvert cliffs 
suffered a series of mishaps and was fined by the nrc for violations 
of safety regulations the toughest blow however was an 
extraordinary incident last september in which a diver at the plant 
drowned in a water storage tank after disregarding safety rules 
that shook them up it shook us up said thomas murley 
director of the nrcs office of nuclear reactor regulation 
three months later the plant was put on the nrcs list of 
worstrun plants in the country and this summer it was reaffirmed 
on the list 
their fall from grace came so quickly and they fell so far 
given the good performance that theyd had over the years james 
curtiss a member of the nrc said in a meeting with baltimore gas amp 
electric officials in midaugust 
murley says calvert cliffs had such a consistently good operating 
record in the past that its own managers and federal regulators 
may have become complacent 
they had a halo effect for years he said 
murley said he is confident that nrc methods of monitoring 
nuclear plant performance including special onsite audits about 
once a year are adequate to ensure public safety but some other 
officials have expressed doubt about whether nrc warnings to plant 
owners are enough to force improvements 
my problem with yearly inspections is they are so late nrc 
chairman kenneth carr told a recent commission meeting they come 
out so long afterward the guy can lull himself into saying well 
we fixed that we are in better shape now

wonderful that the court made them come out here and apologize 
last october the four young people all residents of this rural 
western kentucky town pleaded guilty in logan district court to 
breaking into the 116yearold church and setting it on fire in may 
1986 
before their sentencing the four had paid 6000 to rebuild the 
church and prosecutors agreed to amend the charges from felonies to 
misdemeanors but when logan district judge dale l prince sentenced 
them he ordered them to apologize to the congregation of face 
contempt of court with possibly a year in jail and a 500 fine 
prince also put each of the four on probation for two years

the superconducting super collider 
project has got three towns on a super collision course over 
bragging rights to the giant atom smasher bringing out their big 
artillery on billboards and bumper stickers 
all three waxahachie ennis and midlothian want people to 
think of their town first when they think of the collider which is 
slated for ellis county and in fact wont touch any of the three 
the fight isnt quite so heated as the battle that preceded it 
when politicians all over the country sought to get the 
multibilliondollar federal project in their state instead its a 
battle fought with bumper stickers and billboards 
ennis proclaims itself super collider country and midlothian 
boasts its the gateway to the super collider 
so far waxahachie has smashed the competition at 18150 people 
it is the biggest town in ellis county and will be encircled by the 
53mile collider ring it calls itself the center of attention 
home of the super collider 
the other two towns are on the outskirts of the ring which is to 
be built in the country south of dallasfort worth 
shortly after the us energy department announced in november 
that ellis county would be the collider site the waxahachie chamber 
of commerce printed hundreds of bumper stickers proclaiming itself 
the center 
the town also rented billboard space off interstate 35 to carry 
the same message 
that was enough to make officials in ennis and midlothian stomp 
in protest 
ennis a town of about 14150 people east of waxahachie 
countered with its own boast on a billboard on interstate 45 
the only thing waxahachie has is its name said kipp burnett 
executive vice president of the ennis chamber of commerce it 
sticks even though its hard to say you dont forget it 
bob sokoll waxahachie city manager scoffs at such talk 
we are not going to let one peon city to the east like ennis 
think they are the home of the super collider sokoll said the 
only thing ennis does better than us is play football 
midlothian population 5000 wont be left out said pam mundo 
executive director of the towns chamber of commerce shes the one 
who came up with the slogan we are the gateway to the super 
collider 
the texas national research laboratory commission the state 
agency in charge of acquiring the land for the collider is shying 
away from the feud 
we have tried not to get caught up in the local competition 
commission spokeswoman catherine burns said last week we have 
always referred to the super collider as being in ellis county 
ground has not been broken for the colossal project but 
officials say it should be operational by 1996 
the collider is expected to reveal new information about the 
nature of matter and the origins of the universe it will hurl 
minute beams of protons toward one another inside a 53mile tunnel 
it is expected to create 4000 temporary construction jobs and 3000 
permanent positions

hungarian communist party chief karoly 
grosz promised that the party will not use force to hold onto power 
if it loses the nations first multiparty elections next year a 
newspaper reported sunday 
in an interview by the daily helsingin sanomat newspaper grosz 
acknowledged that hungarian communists want to wield power 
however he added that the party would draw its own 
conclusions if it were to lose the elections due to be held at 
the latest in 1990 according to the paper 
we would not be satisfied with such a situation grosz was 
quoted as saying however he ruled out using force as a political 
weapon saying we would not use tanks but political arguments to 
get back into power 
he said he will step down as party general secretary during a 
party congress on oct 6 but that he would continue to be active in 
politics i want to remain in the party leadership he said 
in finland grosz was scheduled to meet with president mauno 
koivisto on monday 
groszs power was diluted in june when party reformers 
established a ruling presidium with the general secretary as one of 
four members party chairman rezsoe nyers has described himself as 
first among equals on the new body 
in hungary on sunday the reformers preparing for the party 
congress clashed over how far to go in revamping the party 
presidium members imre pozsgay miklos nemeth and nyers spoke at 
a twoday conference of reformist communists held to plan strategy 
for the october congress 
nyers told the nearly 400 delegates that the partys political 
and economic policies must be revamped 
however pozsgay went further calling for a copernican 
revolution invoking the polish astronomer whose discovery that 
the earth was round shook conservativeminded colleagues in the 16th 
century 
nemeth in comments saturday appeared still more radical he 
said dyedinthewool bolsheviks who cannot accept farreaching 
reforms should be free to split and form rival parties 
party central committee secretary gyoergy fejti told a rally 
saturday that 10000 members a month have been leaving the party in 
the recent past he said only 200 new members had been enrolling 
each month 
since endorsing the idea of a multiparty democracy in february 
the hungarian communists suffered upset defeats in three 
parliamentary byelections the voting represented hungarys freest 
voting in over 40 years 
party reformers who advocate a freemarket economy in addition 
to a pluralistic political system hold views that often put them 
closer to some noncommunist opposition groups than to conservatives 
in their own party

when president bush announces his strategy to 
combat illegal drugs tuesday hell be striding down a path similar 
to one trod 20 years ago by president nixon and by presidents 
before him 
in the marijuana smokefilled days of antivietnam war protests 
when turnon tunein and dropout were the watchwords for much 
of a generation nixon launched an aggressive law enforcement attack 
on drugs 
he wasnt the first 
cocaine and heroin were outlawed by the harrison narcotic act in 
1914 
marijuana was outlawed in 1937 
the nation focused on heroin again in the 1950s two decades 
after prohibition was repealed and two different versions of the 
boggs act passed in 1952 and 1954 called for severe sentences for 
drug traffickers 
president kennedy convened a white house conference on drug abuse 
in 1963 
now top government officials are talking of the possibility of 
us troops fighting drug lords in a foreign land 
white house chief of staff john sununu said sunday that if the 
colombian government were to request more assistance bush probably 
would order american troops to take an active role 
is the president willing to risk american servicemen in this 
war on drugs he was asked 
well if that request ever came in im sure the president 
would recognize that the american public thinks that the drug 
problem is so tough and so important that there is a great feeling 
amongst american citizens that we probably should take even that 
risk replied sununu 
defense secretary dick cheney interviewed on abcs this week 
with david brinkley also said american personnel in colombia 
would be at some risk and would be prepared to defend themselves 
i cant guarantee that its absolutely riskfree said 
cheney the possibility exists that they would become targets for 
the cartel there is some risk involved they us personnel will 
be able to defend themselves 
in the last two decades millions people have been arrested on 
drug charges billions of dollars worth of illegal drugs have been 
seized rock n roll stars and famous athletes have died of 
overdoses and some inner cities have added deadly drugrelated 
gunfights to existing problems of poverty unemployment 
discrimination and alcohol and heroin abuse 
billions of dollars have been spent on law enforcement less for 
treatment and prevention 
from fiscal 1981 through 1989 the federal government spent 165 
billion for law enforcement 24 billion for drug abuse prevention 
and 24 billion for treatment for a total expenditure of 213 
billion according to the general accounting office an arm of 
congress 
most of that 136 billion was spent in the last three years 
104 billion for law enforcement 17 billion for prevention and 
15 billion for treatment 
meanwhile cocaine is pouring over the nations borders domestic 
growers produce 25 percent of the nations marijuana supply and the 
heroin problem is growing the price of the three drugs is going 
down and the purity is going up 
the arrest and incarceration of carlos lehder a leader of the 
medellin drug cartel who was extradited by colombia to the united 
states two years ago did not make a dent in the operation of that 
cartel reputed to be the worlds largest cocaine organization nor 
in the availability of cocaine 
william j bennett director of national drug control policy and 
the person who developed the basis for bushs strategy by order of 
congress acknowledged over the weekend that you can cut off the 
head and the body will still move and other heads will come in to 
replace it 
however he said in the interview on cnn we think that when 
you disrupt a major criminal organization like this you are 
disrupting the doing of their business and thats a good thing 
the strategy will hit hard on socalled casual users with calls 
for more arrests more seizures of personal property and more 
widespread drugtesting bennett said 
the idea he said is to increase the sanction for drug use at 
every link in the chain 
bennett believes a turning point may already have been reached in 
the casual use of illegal drugs pointing to the 1988 national 
household survey on drug abuse 
the survey found a 37 percent decrease from a 1985 survey in the 
number of people who said they had used marijuana cocaine or other 
illicit drugs in the previous month in addition the survey 
indicated that the number of people who said they had used an 
illegal drug in the previous year fell by 25 percent over the three 
years 
we are making some real progress in this war bennett said 
when the survey was released in july people who have been saying 
all is lost we cant win lets legalize have never been more 
wrong 
the survey found that the number of heavy cocaine users 
including those using the highly addictive form of the drug called 
crack rose sharply from 1985 to 1988 by 33 percent for those 
using it once a week or more and by 19 percent for daily and 
almostdaily users 
on the other hand bennett attributed a drop in casual use to a 
triumph of changed attitudes 
the just say no campaign launched by former first lady nancy 
reagan a host of antidrug advertisements on television and 
incessant verbal attacks by bennett and others on casual users 
apparently have had some impact at least on what people say they do 
but it is unclear whether theyre really doing what they say they 
are 
the national institute of justices drug use forecasting report 
for the fourth quarter of 1988 based on confidential interviews and 
drug tests of people arrested in various cities found that many of 
those people lied 
each person interviewed knew that a urinalysis would be done yet 
in most cities two to four times more drug users were detected by 
urinalysis than by selfreports the nij found for example among 
men arrested and interviewed in phoenix ariz 8 percent said they 
had used cocaine urine tests found 34 percent had done so

a majority of britons blame bad management rather 
than labor unions for the nations economic woes a public opinion 
survey reported 
the sunday times which commissioned the poll said 60 percent of 
respondents believe management is more to blame than unions 
when asked if unions have too much power 42 percent said no and 
41 percent said yes the first time since 1975 that more 
respondents took the unions side on that question in the poll the 
report said 
britain had a labor government in 1975 it was ousted in 1979 
after a winter of strikes against a pay freeze prime minister 
margaret thatchers conservatives are still in power 10 years later 
after restricting union power to call strikes and to support them 
with sympathy actions 
a majority said most unions are controlled by a few extremists 
and militants but 77 percent said unions are needed to protect 
workers interests 
the polling company market and opinion research international 
said it questioned 1946 adults including 440 union members across 
the country no margin of error was reported 
britain has low economic investment which results in steadily 
falling manufacturing capacity low economic growth unemployment 
ranging up to 25 percent in the older industrial areas and a 
declining share of world markets

syrian and christian forces fought with 
artillery in lebanons central mountains on sunday shattering an 
18hour lull 
police said one person was killed and 11 were wounded in sundays 
exchanges the latest casualties raised the toll since the fighting 
broke out march 8 to at least 826 killed and 2449 wounded 
sundays battle flared around the mountain town of douar one of 
four routes into the besieged christian heartland north of beirut 
the clashes which ignited forest fires occurred on the eastern 
flank of the coastal enclave ringed on its landward sides by the 
syrians and their moslem allies 
they have reportedly been massing their forces in recent days 
but they made no clear move to push into the christian enclave 
sunday 
though beirut has been battered nearly incessantly in the six 
months of fighting the capital was quiet during sundays clashes 
christian and moslem sectors of the city were hammered for 36 hours 
between thursday and saturday when at least 20 people were killed 
and more than 100 wounded in one of the hardestfought 
syrianchristian duels 
on sunday syrian howitzers and mortars pounded douar and the 
resort towns of kekfaya and btighrin that are clustered around 
twisting roads leading into christian territory where an estimated 
1 million people are trapped 
the christian forces led by gen michel aoun retaliated by 
hitting syrian positions in the mountains with 155mm howitzer and 
tank fire police said 
pine woods burned out of control because firefighters could not 
reach the battle zone northeast of beirut said a police spokesman 
who cannot be identified under standing regulations 
the rival forces also skirmished with machine guns and 
truckmounted 106mm recoilless guns around the mountaintop christian 
stronghold of souk elgharb southeast of beirut the spokesman said 
aoun began the current round of a 14yearold civil war by 
blockading ports controlled by moslem militias he then declared a 
war of liberation to drive syrian forces from lebanon 
the 40000 syrian troops came to lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate however aoun says they are backing the moslem 
side in the civil war 
the fighting has forced all but an estimated 150000 of beiruts 
15 million population to flee their devastated city

half of americans say workers are better off with 
unions than without but more people regard management favorably 
than view unions favorably a poll has found 
many respondents in the media generalassociated press poll saw 
unions as weakening and few objected to that trend still by a 49 
percent to 31 percent margin they said workers are better off with 
a union than without one 
in what could be seen as a positive sign for the future of 
unions young respondents ages 18 to 29 were the most likely to 
favor unions they scored higher than their elders on questions 
about their opinion of workers and about whether they think 
employees are better off under unions 
overall however nonunionized respondents were more unwilling 
than willing to join a union 4737 percent with the rest unsure 
moreover while 44 percent thought of unions favorably 64 
percent had a positive view of management and seven in 10 favored 
socalled righttowork laws which ban mandatory union membership 
on other issues the poll found most workers this labor day 
satisfied with their salaries working conditions and time off but 
41 percent rated their pensions fair or poor and 37 percent rated 
their pay as fair or poor 
nearly nine in 10 respondents backed raising the minimum wage 
which has been 335 an hour since 1981 most supported the 455 
minimum approved by congress over the 425 urged by president bush 
but most also liked bushs plan allowing new workers to be kept at 
335 for their first six months 
bush vetoed legislation in june that would have phased in a 455 
minimum wage by 1991 and did not include his training wage 
proposal congress is expected to take up the issue again this fall 
the poll was conducted by telephone among a random sample of 
1163 adults from july 617 it had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 3 points for the entire group and 4 points for the 812 who 
were employed 
when rating their own circumstances at work respondents gave the 
highest grades to the safety of their workplace 87 percent said 
excellent or good and their overall working conditions 
with 81 percent favorable 
sixtynine percent expressed satisfaction with their time off 61 
percent rated their health benefits favorably and 60 percent said 
their salary was excellent or good as opposed to only fair or poor 
the lowest ratings went to pension benefits of those with an 
opinion just 46 percent viewed their pension plans as excellent or 
good while 41 percent were dissatisfied a quarter overall rated 
their pension benefits as poor 
benefits were not the prime concern however fiftyfour percent 
said they would prefer better wages to better benefits 
concern over wages lessened among whitecollar management 
workers seventyone percent of them rated their salaries favorably 
compared with 57 percent of bluecollar workers and of 
nonmanagement whitecollar workers 
union members also were less likely to be concerned about their 
wages seventyone percent were satisfied equal to the salary 
satisfaction among management workers 
union and management split on another point union members said 
by 8310 percent that workers are better off with unions while 
management employees said by 4637 percent that workers are better 
off nonunionized 
southerners also were more dubious of unions they split about 
evenly on the question while the youngest group by 5329 percent 
and the oldest group those over 64 by 5221 said workers are 
better off with unions 
union membership declining over the years now accounts for just 
under 17 percent of the nations work force 
in the poll among those not in unions now 38 percent in the 
youngest group ruled out joining one that rose to about 50 percent 
of their elders 
similarly 52 percent of the youngest had a favorable view of 
unions and 29 percent viewed unions unfavorably while older people 
were split about 4040 the rest had no opinion 
fortythree percent overall said unions are getting weaker and 
just 15 percent said they are getting stronger still 33 percent 
said unions in this country are too strong while just 20 percent 
said they are too weak

president bush was called on to 
deliver his own impromptu sermon at church sunday and promptly went 
out and caught a fish the first of his vacation 
the jinx is broken a jubilant president exclaimed as he came 
ashore with a twofootlong bluefish 
he had started the day at st anns episcopal church where the 
rev laman h bruner jr after his own sermon turned the pulpit 
over to the president who told his fellow parishioners he was ready 
for the end of summer 
tomorrow it starts all over again said bush i dont know 
what you guys have to do but i know what ive got to do head back 
to work 
like a student beginning the new school year after labor day 
bush said he needed to start studying hard for the drug speech 
he will deliver to the nation tuesday night 
its the first speech ill give from the oval office im not 
going to be scared said bush who began the talk recalling how as 
a young child he would shake when called upon to recite a verse 
during the summer services at st anns 
bush spoke of the signs of faith he has encountered in communist 
lands and said were living in a time of real hope 
he exhorted young people to involve yourselves in the lives of 
others do what you can to strengthen community life 
indeed ill be asking our country to do that as part of the 
antidrug strategy bush said 
remember dont ever forget that we are one nation under god 
said bush who was joined at the service by barbara his mother 
dorothy walker bush and other relatives 
then after a fast change of clothes it was out to sea in his 
speedboat fidelity with wife barbara son marvin and national 
security adviser brent scowcroft 
what a day said bush who had vowed to end his dry fishing 
spell before returning to the white house on monday after 20 days 
here at the familys oceanfront retreat it was a long dry 
summer but it all worked out 
its what we call sticktoitivness said the president 
holding the glistening fish aloft with one hand as he steered the 
boat to the dock with the other a tremendous fish a very 
strong fish he estimated it weighed nine or 10 pounds 
he said they had been led to the magic spot by some birds 
circling overhead 
there was no weighin for bush personally cleaned and filleted 
the fish immediately upon docking 
were just going to get the steak he said tossing fish 
entrails into the cove waters this is nature return to nature 
he said because in about two hours youll see the gulls in here 
picking this guy clean 
bush performed the operation on a plastic bag saving the head 
for soup 
bush got his bluefish after only a few minutes in the water at 
the outset of a 2hour expedition they caught nothing else 
my boy marvin was steering the boat at the time he did a 
heckuva job and as for general scowcroft and bar they were 
along he said 
bush who prides himself on his fishing abilities had become the 
butt of jokes including a portland press herald no fish 
insignia that became a bestselling tshirt 
bush went golfing later sunday and planned one final fishing 
outing monday morning before flying back to washington early in the 
labor day holiday afternoon

president bush said he wasnt out to 
look busy on his vacation no this was a real vacation pure 
and simple he insisted 
just to make sure everyone got the point bush spent the last 
three weeks showcasing his good time 
americans saw him boating playing tennis golfing dining out 
jogging playing ball and otherwise having daily doses of fun 
his selfascribed nickname mr smooth became almost a household 
word his badluck fishing streak was the subject of media accounts 
nationwide 
and when the president on a dare stripped off his shirt and 
leaped into the sea with his slacks on the burst of goofiness was 
carried on the nightly news 
bush spent more hours in the public eye during his vacation than 
he normally does at the white house 
unlike many past presidents who used vacations to get out of the 
limelight bush seemed to relish the chance to show off his 
recreational penchants 
away from the suitandtie world of washington bush was a study 
in perpetual sports motion his golf speed 18 holes in around two 
hours was dubbed aerobic golf by presidential physician 
lawrence mohr 
a keen competitive streak tempered by apparent good 
sportsmanship was evident in everything he did from fishing to 
horseshoes 
some might even say the president showed himself to be something 
of a ham 
there was the sunday when he could have sent the press corps home 
for a few hours after taking them to two church services instead he 
invited them to his walkers point compound to watch his tennis 
match 
typically the presidents activities on walkers point are not 
observed by the press corps but on this day he suggested maybe the 
reporters would like to see mr smooth in action on the courts 
mr smooth is the name bush uses for himself in horseshoes and 
golf as in here comes mr smooth 
when the press corps began covering the presidents kennebunkport 
golf outings some months back reporters and photographers watched 
him tee off then picked him up again on the last hole 
now the small press pool that accompanies him to the course 
covers anywhere from four holes to all 18 with bushs approval 
he was even heard to mutteri do better when theyre here 
when he made a good drive after the cameras showed up on the 17th 
tee during an otherwise lackluster round 
in fact bush seemed to enjoy the golf audience clowning for the 
cameras especially when he made a good shot 
on the ocean there was no solitude for bush on his daily jaunts 
in his speedboat fidelity in addition to a coast guard cutter and 
secret service boats that escorted him he was trailed by a 
fiveboat flotilla of media chase vessels 
that didnt seem to bother bush except he contended at one point 
they were scaring off the fish that excuse was not heard after bush 
friends began catching fish off fidelity even when the presidential 
hook remained bare 
the chase boats generally were beyond shouting distance but bush 
sometimes allowed them in close for a photograph 
far from seeming to have had enough of the omnipresent media 
coverage bush often invited it 
one day he piloted fidelity filled with children and 
grandchildren close to shore where a handful of reporters were 
engaged in other matters he began a shouted chitchat with them 
across the waters 
he stayed until a camera crew was positioned on the shore then 
roared off into the sunshine framing a picture perfect shot 
instead of holing up in privacy like ronald reagan at his santa 
barbara ranch or richard nixon at his seaside san clemente bush 
was out every day he surprised tourists and local residents by 
driving his boat up to dockside restaurants or gasoline wharfs 
he and first lady barbara bush had small or large dinner parties 
almost every night 
on sundays there was church with bush shaking hands with the 
congregation afterward on the last sunday of his vacation he made 
some remarks from the pulpit and promptly went out and caught the 
first fish of his summer break 
he had a steady stream of overnight visitors to walkers point 
including the honeymooning danish prime minister poul schlueter and 
his bride the family of canadian prime minister brian mulroney and 
evangelist billy graham 
reporters who showed up in running clothes to cover his morning 
jogs were invited to join him 
bush took note of all the fun he was having in a speech the 
only one of his trip to the local chamber of commerce 
we are doing some work but i have confessed at the very 
outset that this is a pure total vacation and im not going to 
look busy in order to convince people in america that its something 
other than a vacation he said

west german officials and red 
cross volunteers battled cold rainy weather and growing public 
resentment as they prepared sunday for the arrival of thousands of 
east german refugees 
groups of curious bavarians lingered at the outskirts of an old 
concrete factory in this medieval town across the donau river from 
austria watching relief workers erect tents and feeding stations 
for the first of as many as 20000 east germans who are expected to 
begin arriving monday 
five red cross encampments capable of taking in about 5000 
refugees were readied during the weekend in vilshofen and in other 
small border towns in this staunchly conservative farming region in 
southeastern west germany 
steady downpours and temperatures dropping to near freezing 
overnight hampered the work by 300 red cross and bavarian state 
civil defense workers 
nevertheless they met their sunday night deadline for completing 
basic facilities in vilshofen tiefenbach and in the border towns of 
freilassing trostberg and hengersberg 
while west germanys constitution regards east germans as 
citizens and a generous social security system offers financial 
support and help in resettling some have expressed resentment about 
the refugee tide 
i wouldnt mind if it was just temporary but i know its 
not grumbled an elderly vilshofen man in traditional bavarian 
dress of lodengreen knickers highbuttoned jacket and plumed cap 
this is a small town and theres no industry here to take them 
in added his wife 
the couple moved off when asked for their names 
the reluctance of some west germans to take in those fleeing 
economic stagnation or repression in the east is a subject few will 
discuss openly 
but some resent the immediate benefits afforded the new arrivals 
who are entitled to the same unemployment or pension funds collected 
by west germans who contributed to the system for decades 
if it were wartime one could understand this but not now 
complained anna berger a local farmer selling produce in the 
vilshofen public market on saturday how can all these people just 
simply abandon their native land they ought to stick it out over 
there a little longer 
bavarian state interior minister gebhard glueck who visited the 
tent cities in vilshofen and tiefenbach on sunday declared the 
expected influx of east germans the largest refugee movement in 
germany since the postwar expulsions 
echoing a plea from federal chancellor helmut kohl a day earlier 
glueck called on west germans to welcome those driven from their 
homeland in the same spirit that allowed the assimilation of 12 
million refugees in west germany following the forced migrations 
after world war ii 
we want and we will handle this situation as a community 
glueck stated in a speech in the town of marktredwitz before 
visiting the tent camps 
kohl on saturday called on west germans to show solidarity 
with the refugees apparently attempting to ease public strains over 
the shortterm burdens imposed by the newcomers 
west germans owe the refugees support because we have had the 
good fortune after the war to live in this part of germany kohl 
said 
the east germans are expected to strain the public coffers 
initially 
but federal labor officials have pointed out that the mostly 
youthful and healthy refugees crowding the government reception 
camps are relieving the national shortage of bluecollar workers and 
will probably provide an economic boost after a few months

a gay former congressman forced out of office 
by a sex scandal nine years ago came to the defense sunday of 
embattled rep barney frank saying the capitol hill brouhaha sounds 
all too familiar and could backfire 
it has the strange familiarity of what yogi berra might have 
called deja vu all over again former rep robert bauman a 
republican wrote in a lengthy article in the washington post on the 
current controversy involving frank a democrat and his 
relationship with a male prostitute 
last month frank who in 1987 acknowledged to being gay 
confirmed published reports that he had solicited and then 
befriended a male prostitute allowed him to use his washington 
apartment and paid him 20000 a year from private funds to do 
various chores 
the prostitute steven gobie claimed he operated a prostitution 
service out of franks apartment and that the massachusetts 
congressman knew about it frank has denied any such knowledge and 
despite the controversy recently received signs of continuing strong 
support back in his home district 
bauman a staunch conservative had no such luck and was defeated 
in his maryland district in 1980 ending eight years in congress 
after it was revealed he was gay and had been arrested for 
soliciting a male prostitute 
bauman wrote in the sunday edition of the post that he probably 
would disagree with frank a liberal on 95 percent of the issues 
facing america and likely would not vote for him 
but i surely would not vote against him for what happened with 
the likes of steve gobie bauman wrote chastising gobie as a 
louse and a despicable character who thinks nothing of 
turning on his former mentor for personal gain frank has said 
he befriended gobie because he wanted to help him recover from past 
mistakes including a prison record 
referring to the possibility that congress may move to censure or 
reprimand frank bauman now a washington lawyer wrote 
one thing i do know the house of representatives both 
collectively and individually is not equipped to judge barney frank 
in this matter they may well decide to censure or reprimand him for 
his private now very public past conduct but they do so at 
their own peril 
this is not an easy case of jim wright venality it is not a 
case of a congressman taking advantage of a page boy or page girl 
it is a case involving consenting adults one of whom happened to be 
a congressman and the other a louse and if such private acts become 
the jurisdiction of congress the lines of the miscreants might as 
well begin forming on the right and the left 
bauman continued while the media and the public might enjoy 
the titillation of this incipient reign of terror the end result 
will be the decimation of government 
bauman also urged against frank resigning saying the matter is 
for the voters in his district to decide

paid off as she scrambled to victory in the 42nd national hard crab 
derby 
jason byrd 14 owner of the winner said throughbred crabs need 
to be riled up to prepare for competition his mother kathy byrd 
said that was accomplished by taunting it with a stick for two hours 
to get it mangy 
chopper survived a preliminary heat and beat 15 finalists 
saturday to top the field of 283 
jason said another key was that he caught his own entry instead 
of using one furnished by race organizers 
one race worker however said the real key is finding a lively 
small crab 
a lot of people bring the big ones and think they are going to 
win said glenn stewart of crisfield but its the little ones

nhl team has gone before when they leave monday night for a 
preseason tour that includes four games in the soviet union but 
theyre not going overseas emptyhanded 
packed among the 400 rolls of tape 200 pucks and 57 pairs of

selfcontaining idea were going to russia and basically be 
russians for 11 days

here is a text of the statement issued sunday in 
paris by three roman catholic cardinals who negotiated a 1987 
agreement to move a convent away from the auschwitz death camp it 
was translated from french by the associated press

if the jewish delegation at the geneva meetings led by mr theo 
klein then president of the european jewish congress is not 
competent who would be 
and if four cardinals including the archbishop of krakow are 
not qualified to represent the catholic side who might be 
the auschwitz camp is in the krakow diocese according to church 
law its archbishop has full authority there the cardinals who 
accompanied him belong to nations who in the west were among the 
chief victims of the hitler barbarism 
these accords were patiently and loyally negotiated over two 
years the catholic signatories promised that the financing would 
not fall on the krakow diocese and still less on poland 
cardinal glemp could only have been speaking for himself in 
talking of a renegotiation of the geneva accords particularly since 
until now he has always let it be known that cardinal macharski was 
solely responsible and that the polish conference of bishops on 
march 9 1989 had committed itself in turn by giving its support to 
the realization of this accord 
the signed engagements must be carried out they recognize the 
legitimacy of the auschwitz carmel at oswiecim outside the 
perimeter of the concentration camp which unesco in consideration 
of its exceptional universal value has placed on the list of 
world cultural heritage in october 1979 at the request of the 
polish government then in place

in other cities hate crimes typically 
decrease markedly after a racially motivated killing authorities 
say but reported hate crimes are booming in this nearly allwhite 
city since skinheads beat an ethiopian immigrant to death in 
november 
police report heightened activity by skinheads young white 
racists who affect shaved heads and military garb since the 
killing of mulugeta seraw police also blame increased violence on 
recruitment by racist groups targeting the northwest with its small 
minority populations for an aryan homeland 
in their minds its easier to get rid of blacks and chinese 
and whatnot in oregon than in new jersey said loren christensen 
of the portland police bureau 
from may 1988 until seraws death nov 12 nine racially 
motivated crimes were reported in multnomah county which 
encompasses portland and suburbs but 77 were reported after the 
killing through may 10 this year the metropolitan human relations 
commission said 
georgia owens who compiled those figures said it was possible 
publicity about seraws death may have prompted more victims to 
report such crimes 
christensen who tracks skinheads for the police said he began 
getting calls after the killing from teachers reporting some 
students had shaved their heads 
a lot of people got caught up in the glamour of that 
homicide christensen said streettype people looking for a 
cause something to identify with 
he also cited recruiting efforts by tom metzger a southern 
california television repairman who heads the white aryan 
resistance and metzgers son john president of the aryan youth 
movement 
christensen said organized groups like war arent as active in 
portland as freelance skinheads who travel in groups of three 
to 20 
two skinheads have pleaded guilty in seraws killing and a third 
is awaiting trial authorities say the skinheads attacked seraw and 
two companions outside seraws home in southeast portland clubbing 
him to death with a baseball bat 
skinheads were responsible for at least 46 of the 86 hate crimes 
reported in the portland area during the year ended may 10 owens 
said of those incidents 26 involved violence most of the rest 
were harassment intimidation and vandalism 
a lot of the victimless crimes leafleting and vandalism those 
were not counted in the skinhead category if we couldnt say a 
skinhead group had done it we didnt include it said owens 
whatever the reason for the increase in reported hate crimes 
marvin stern of the antidefamation league of bnai brith in 
seattle said it defies the trend in other cities 
in every other city in the country where skinheads are active 
once an act has been committed and responded to by law enforcement 
weve seen a great decline in activity or almost disappearance 
stern said 
stern also said racist groups believe primarily that the states 
of washington oregon idaho and wyoming because they have 
relatively few minorities are the last great region of the country 
that that they can take over for themselves and basically have 
declared this to be a colony for the white aryan people 
according to 1985 us census statistics whites make up more 
than 92 percent of portlands population more than 560000 people 
live in multnomah county 
we have an essentially caucasian society here said kathy 
dimond spokeswoman for mayor bud clark that might possibly make 
someone who is interested in maintaining a white society more 
comfortable 
residents incensed by racism are coming to community meetings to 
learn how to spot warning signs in children who are drawn to 
skinhead groups 
residents are shocked that these people exist and live among 
them in their own community said peg caliendo of southeast 
uplift a citysupported group that helps neighborhoods with crime 
prevention we tend to think of crime as existing outside of our 
particular areas 
she helped organize a rally attended by 75 people saturday at 
brentwood park where a hispanic girl and two other teenagers were 
attacked earlier last week six people have been arrested in that 
attack three men described as skinheads and three teenagers 
the rally provided a way for residents to reclaim the park by 
cleaning up graffiti meeting their neighbors and expressing their 
unity caliendo said 
we want the community to feel safe by banding together she 
said

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
appointed former prime minister hussein musavi a longtime rival as 
one of his advisers sunday irans official islamic republic news 
agency reported 
musavi 48 served as prime minister from 1981 until last month 
when the post was abolished in constitutional reforms approved by 
national referendum held alongside the presidential election july 28 
musavi was the second key radical leader who has been absorbed by 
rafsanjani leader of tehrans socalled pragmatists into his 
administration in recent weeks 
former intelligence minister mohammad reyshahri was appointed 
prosecutorgeneral last month 
former interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi dumped by 
rafsanjani is the only major radical figure who has not been given 
a position in rafsanjanis government 
irna monitored in nicosia reported rafsanjani told musavi in a 
letter that the former premiers experience in government should not 
be wasted 
musavi has frequently clashed with rafsanjani over foreign and 
economic policy he favors tight state control of the economy and 
opposes unrestrained links with the west 
rafsanjani favors a more open economy with greater private sector 
participation and has sought to rebuild bridges with the west to end 
irans isolation and help rebuild the economy following last years 
ceasefire in its 8yearold war with iraq 
musavis appointment gives the radicals a voice in rafsanjanis 
administration but the former premier was not expected to wield 
substantial power 
rafsanjani 55 has inherited a presidency with wider executive 
powers than his precedessors under the constitutional reforms 
these were aimed at eliminating competing power centers in tehran 
that had virtually paralyzed the decision making process and holding 
up badly needed economic changes 
but analysts believe he still faces problems if he tries to move 
too fast on economic and foreign policy those moves could leave him 
open to charges of deviating from the political legacy of irans 
revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died june 3

more workers are killed on the job in the united 
states than in most other major industrialized countries according 
to a report that says the deaths cost the nations economy at least 
15 billion each year 
workers in this country are 36 times more likely to be killed 
than a swede and nine times more likely to be killed than a briton 
the national safe workplace institute found in its annual labor day 
report 
in addition a us worker is more likely to be seriously injured 
on the job than a twopackaday cigarette smoker is to contract 
cancer according to the report 
the evidence indicates that the united states is slipping in 
its efforts to reduce job injuries joseph a kinney the groups 
executive director said in the report issued saturday 
the chicagobased institute is a independent nonprofit 
government watchdog group devoted to job safety issues 
more muscle and money are needed from the government and the 
private sector before it can be concluded that americans are on 
the road to safer work according to the report 
but it noted that some encouraging signs from the department of 
labor and occupational safety and health administration indicate 
policy may be shifting in the workers favor 
according to the groups report 
more than 10000 men and women die each year from onthejob 
injuries 
another 70000 workers become permanently disabled each year as 
a result of jobrelated conditions 
one out of 11 workers will be killed or seriously injured at 
work 
the problem is increasing despite factors such as an aging and 
theoretically more experienced workforce and new technology that 
should reduce or eliminate risk of injury the institute said 
bureau of labor statistics show that in 1987 83 us workers 
per 100 fulltime employees were injured on the job up from 76 in 
1983 
in 1986 the nation had 10700 occupational fatalities the 
figure would have been just 300 if the united states fatality rate 
were equal to swedens and 6838 if it were equal to japans the 
report said 
but it said there are signs of promise 
they include labor secretary elizabeth doles pledge to make 
occupational safety and health a high priority and recent action by 
osha the report said 
for example the group noted that on july 27 osha imposed a 
272 million fine and sought a court injunction against friction 
division products inc of trenton nj for alleged failure to 
protect workers from asbestos exposure 
the company was accused of violating almost every provision of 
oshas asbestos standard in the process of threatening the health 
and even the lives of many of its workers the report said 
the report also cited a 2 million proposed penalty mrs dole 
issued july 7 against ford motor co for failing to live up to its 
november 1987 agreement with the department of labor to accurately 
record injuries and illnesses 
while the final chapter of doles leadership is far from 
written the opening pages provide americas workers with the most 
encouraging signs of safe work that they have had in several 
years the report concludes

soldiers were restricted to using plastic bullets against the 
suspects after they refused to stop on order and after a warning 
shot was fired but other sources said on condition of anonymity 
that firing live ammunition at masked suspects had been allowed at 
night 
in his announcement on israel radio rabin said the new measure 
was needed to crack down on palestinian militants who are 
terrorizing the population 
he spoke after palestinian enforcers killed one suspected 
collaborator and wounded another in an attack with knives and 
hatchets 
an arab journalist reported seeing the mutilated body of 
25yearold riyad abbas salem nasrallah on a gaza city street 
sunday awaiting medical treatment next to the body was 18yearold 
raed majed husseini he had been beaten and stabbed 
a crowd gathered as the body was put into an ambulance and 
shouted death to collaborators other witnesses said some 
passersby spit and threw tomatoes 
masked palestinians are blamed for most of the 105 arabs killed 
by other arabs during the uprising at least 557 palestinians have 
been killed by israelis 
israeli defense forces will receive in the next few days 
permission to use live fire to stop suspects who are wearing 
masks rabin said he said they would be allowed to do so day or 
night 
assad saftawi an elementary school principal in the gaza strip 
and a prominent activist predicted the new orders would lead to 
more palestinians being shot by soldiers and more enmity 
this is a serious crackdown on the intefadeh he said using 
the arab word for uprising political and military leaders in 
israel talk about a political solution for the intefadeh but in 
practice what they do contradicts what they say 
in other comments on israel radio rabin also warned jordan that 
israel would not tolerate attacks on its territory from jordan 
he spoke after the clash between israeli soldiers and a 
palestinian guerrilla near the jordan river on march 17 an israeli 
soldier was also killed and the two attackers fled back into jordan 
jordan must find a way to prevent fire or infiltration from its 
border if it wants to have neighborly relations with us he 
said 
in amman a high government official denied the palestinian 
entered israel from jordan 
we have no proof that a civilian crossed the ceasefire line 
the official said on condition of anonymity usually when someone 
crosses we could figure it out either he crosses a certain fence 
or sometimes leaves a footprint theres nothing 
in another development palestinian sources estimated 20000 
palestinians crossed into israel to work sunday using new 
israeliissued identity cards normally nearly 50000 go to work in 
israel 
leaders of the palestinian uprising have tried to keep residents

president ranasinghe premadasa said 
sunday he would not allow international human rights groups into sri 
lanka to investigate alleged rights abuses 
also sunday an information department statement said 24 people 
were killed over the weekend by sinhalese radicals from the peoples 
liberation front an ultranationalist guerrilla group seeking to 
overthrow the government 
the victims included five women relatives of security force 
personnel 12 civilians five soldiers a doctor and a postal 
official the statement said it gave no further details 
premadasas declaration regarding human rights came after he met 
with a sixmember opposition group called the committee of 
parliamentarians of the opposition for fundamental and human rights 
the group urged the president to safeguard human rights the 
statement said premadasa said the government was not prepared to 
permit international human rights groups including amnesty 
international to visit the country 
he told opposition leaders that human rights is not the 
preserve of one party or group according to the statement 
opposition politicians and human rights groups have accused the 
military and progovernment vigilante groups of killing hundreds of 
civilians suspected of sympathizing with sinhalese radicals 
at least 1222 people have been killed since june 20 when 
premadasa imposed a state of emergency and gave security forces 
special powers 
in midaugust the londonbased human rights group amnesty 
international appealed to the sri lankan government to stem what it 
called the rising tide of killings torture disappearances and 
detentions perpetrated by its forces 
the government denies the charges and says sinhalese extremists 
are responsible for most of the 5000 killings reported since the 
front began its campaign two years ago 
the front claims the government made too many concessions to 
tamil secessionists in an indiabrokered peace accord of june 1987 
it also protests the presence of indian peacekeeping soldiers 
deployed in the northeast under the accord to disarm tamil militants 
the front in letters sent to colombo newspapers sunday accused 
the government of killing more than 5000 people in the last two 
years 
the letters signed by the groups leader rohana wijeweera 
called upon opposition political parties to unite saying people 
know who is doing the killings and what is taking place in the 
country 
the statement was the fronts first known appeal to political 
parties 
it also warned that people must be prepared to make sacrifices 
to save their motherland indicating they might enforce another 
strike after last weeks successful work stoppage 
sri lankan businessmen say a series of radicalenforced strikes 
have crippled the countrys economy 
the countrys ethnic troubles surfaced in 1983 when the tamil 
minority began demanding a separate nation in the northeast the 
armed insurrection has claimed 11000 lives according to government 
figures 
the tamil community which comprises 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people allege discrimination by the majority sinhalese in 
jobs and education sinhalese are mostly buddhists and tamils are 
mostly hindus

fort worth the dallas cowboys are living up to their billing as 
americas team at least 12 percent of the club is 
a chunk of the nfl franchise has fallen into the hands of the 
federal deposit insurance corp and officials are looking for a 
buyer according to a fort worth newspaper 
the government gained a stake in the cowboys when the fdic helped 
ncnb corp of charlotte nc take over first republic bank corp of 
dallas in july 1988 
first republic bank took control of the shares after s foster 
yancey jr l bradley camp and jl huffines all of whom were 
limited partners in the franchise encountered financial problems in 
their real estate businesses 
the bank foreclosed and collected the shares which were pledged 
as collateral on loans 
after the takeover the bank assumed the name ncnb texas the 
cowboys share sale is being handled as part of the banks agreement 
to manage the 5 billion asset pool for the government 
were certainly looking for a bidder bank spokesman joe bowles 
told the fort worth startelegram we are actively looking for a 
buyer 
although the sale price ncnb is seeking is uncertain sources say 
the 12 percent share is worth about 72 million the fort worth 
newspaper reported 
that figure is based on hr bum brights sale of his 40 
percent general parternship of the cowboys to arkansas millionaire 
jerry jones who paid 60 million this year to gain controlling 
interest of the national football league team 
jones says he controls a 56 percent holding with 51 percent in 
his name and five percent in the name of associate mike mccoy the 
limited partners are ed smith jr with 27 percent arthur buddy 
temple with five percent and the government with 12 percent 
the nfl has to approve any new partner before the government can 
complete a sale 
jones has told the startelegram that he has no plans at this 
time to acquire the governments stake other shareholders said 
they plan to keep their shares because investing in the cowboys is a 
good investment 
with new tv rights a big gate and new radio contract the 
cowboys could be profitable said john veatch managing director 
of salomon brothers dallas operations who handled brights sale of

drugrelated killings of police officers hit a 
record high in 1988 but the rate of officer deaths to narcotics 
enforcement remains surprisingly low a private study concludes 
according to the study issued sunday by the washingtonbased 
crime control institute 14 officers were killed in drug enforcement 
activities such as raids arrests and serving warrants including 
one who was assassinated in new york 
by contrast killings of police officers have averaged seven a 
year since 1972 when the fbi began publishing narratives on how 
police officers died in the line of duty 
by another measure the proportion of all police murders 
attributable to drugs has risen from 6 percent in 1985 to 18 percent 
in 1988 the report said 
university of maryland professor lawrence w sherman who also 
heads the institute said part of the reason for the increase is the 
increased drug enforcement activity 
estimated drug arrests have set a record each year since reaching 
708000 in 1984 rising to 11 million in 1988 sherman said the 
numbers of police murders per drug arrest rose from 71 to 100000 
in 1984 to 122 per 100000 in 1988 
the alltime record rate of drug arrestrelated police killings 
was in 1976 when 196 officers died per 100000 arrests followed 
by 1980 when there were 189 police killings for every 100000 drug 
arrests 
while the risk of death per arrest is still not as high as in 
the record years of 1976 and 1980 this trend is still an ominous 
one the study said the record levels of drug enforcement 
combined with rising risk levels per arrest suggest that the total 
murders of police in drug enforcement will increase in future 
years 
putting the risk in perspective the report noted that officers 
who make two drug arrests a day 220 days a year for 25 years will 
make only 5500 drug arrests 
career drug arrests may total on average less than 100 for 
the typical officer it said at these levels of drug 
enforcement activity odds of one death per 100000 drug arrests are 
pretty safe bets 
of the killings since 1972 33 percent happened during undercover 
buy and bust operations 32 percent while serving warrants or 
conducting raids and 5 percent were ambushed during 
surveillance or killed to prevent their testimony 
referring to the ambush killings the report said these cases 
are a mere handful compared to the 220 judges and other court 
officials slain in colombia apparently by drug dealers since 1981 
but it is striking that four out of six of these us cases occurred 
in the period from 1985 through 1988 
the study did not count killings outside drug enforcement even if 
the killer was under the influence of drugs was a known or past 
drug dealer or in possession of drugs 
additionally the report did not mention nonfatal injuries to 
officers

jesse jackson and united mine workers 
president richard trumka on sunday blasted the republican 
presidential administrations of the 1980s for what they called a 
hostile attitude toward labor 
the 1980s was a decade of great symbolism over substance 
jackson said at a daylong rally of about 10000 people in 
southwestern virginia where coal miners have been striking the 
pittston coal group since early april 
many people in the crowd wore camouflage which has become the 
unofficial uniform of striking miners in virginia west virginia and 
kentucky 
during the past 10 years political leaders such as president 
george bush have used the american flag to pull the wool over our 
eyes jackson told the cheering crowd 
jackson accused bush of defending an american flag that is made 
in taiwan but not fighting forus textile workers 
bush stands for solidarity with workers in poland but not in 
virginia he said 
both trumka and jackson said the national labor relations board 
has become an instrument for strikebreaking under the bush and 
reagan administrations 
the 1980s were a shameful shameful period in our history 
trumka said 
multinational corporations have intimidated workers into 
submission in recent years often by moving their plants abroad he 
said 
the labor movement was unable to fight back because it was 
divided trumka said when air traffic controllers went on strike in 
1981 they fought alone and large corporations saw that as a 
sign of weakness in the labor movement he said 
trumka said the 1990s will be better times for the labor movement 
never again will working people stand alone in a struggle which 
threatens their well being

camp in this southeastern province to return to iraq voluntarily 
the semiofficial anatolia news agency reported sunday 
the agency quoted mus governor adil yazar as saying the group 
left the camp in three trucks and five buses saturday night and 
would leave the country through the habur border gate 
a group of 380 kurdish refugees returned to iraq last month 
the kurds are an ethnic minority of 20 million living in turkey 
iran and iraq and small enclaves of 500000 each in syria and the 
soviet union 
the iraqi government has been accused of forcibly evacuating 
thousands of kurds from their homes razing towns in the northern 
kurdish homeland and resettling kurds in the south of the country 
the government says the resettlement is to improve life for the 
impoverished kurds 
last year iraqis dropped poison gas on the kurdish town of 
halabja killing an estimated 4000 civilians the kurds claim 
thousands more were killed in similar chemical weapons attacks last 
fall 
following the attacks by the iraqi army about 60000 kurds fled 
to turkey some have since gone to iran and a few thousand have 
returned to iraq 
about 40000 remain in tent camps and crowded apartment houses in

at the request of city officials gov gerald l baliles 
dispatched a military police detachment from the national guard and 
state police troopers to the area 
it is a local law enforcement situation and it is being managed 
by city officials and state police officials who are on the scene

reports on i dont know if its an hourly basis but hes received 
several reports today 
at 8 pm sunday city officials closed the downtown beach area 
to incoming traffic state and local police patrolled the area on 
foot and by helicopter 
several people threw bottles at state troopers who began making 
arrests and onlookers taunted national guardsmen who marched 
through city streets armed with batons and assault rifles 
shortly after 930 pm about 75 virginia beach police officers 
formed a wedge and began moving south on atlantic avenue which runs 
parallel to the oceanfront one block away 
the virginia beach officers were followed by a state police 
armored truck which announced over a public address system that the 
approximately 350 young people in the street represented an unlawful 
assembly 
officers were pelted with bottles as they walked along the street 
and made arrests several officers who went into an adjoining motel 
parking lot to arrest someone were showered by bottles thrown from a 
balcony above 
by 1005 atlantic avenue was empty except for several hundred 
police officers dozens were arrested during the course of the 
35minute sweep 
the initial disturbances began around 2 am and stretched along 
a 30block section of the street police said 
a witness said police had attempted to disperse groups of 
fraternity students most from predominantly black colleges along 
the east coast who were showing off dance steps on atlantic avenue 
at one point in the fracas police lobbed a smoke bomb into a crowd 
of people 
its been like were being singled out because we are young and 
black said charles stone 23 of new york city 
city officials were considering imposing a curfew to prevent 
further violence in addition the city has asked state officials to 
suspend the sale of alcohol in the city until tuesday 
i can assure you that this type of behavior is not condoned and 
will not be tolerated now or in the future said mayor meyera e 
oberndorf she declined to answer questions saying she did not have 
details 
the majority of the mob were college students in town for the 
annual labor day weekend greekfest for members of fraternities and 
sororities authorities said during last years greekfest police 
were forced to clear smaller groups of young people from the street 
some witnesses said police overreacted to the students 
activities 
theyve been trying to regulate things that dont need 
regulating said paul williams a 21yearold temple university 
student who said he watched the confrontation begin from his motel 
balcony 
last year everything was real nice there was no violence 
but this year the place was jammed with police and they were 
hassling people he said 
they said police formed a v with six to eight mounted 
officers backed by police in riot gear and began moving south down 
atlantic pushing students off the street and sidewalks with clubs 
several witnesses said they saw tear gas or a smoke bomb fired to 
disperse the crowd 
city officials first said neither was used later they said a 
smoke bomb was fired into the crowd to indicate wind direction 
should tear gas be necessary 
diane roche a spokeswoman for the city said tear gas was not 
used nor were any shots fired by police she said police were 
unsure what set off the incident

beachfront avenue of hotels and shops merchants said it looked 
chaotic 
i didnt know these kinds of things existed said arnie cohen 
whose atlantic avenue shop was spared a jewelry story next door was 
looted its display cases left shattered on the sidewalk

eyes of flakjacketed mps armed with assault rifles by 6 pm the

week that something was going to happen she said 
denise pinto and maria badinno stood in the ruins of a clothing 
store of the 7000 garments in the store 100 were left about the 
floor 
the only things left on the shelves were signs warning that 
shoplifters would be prosecuted 
its awful we dont even have our cash register ms 
pinto said 
police closed off atlantic avenue through most of sunday 
merchants said they were losing business in what is generally the 
best weekend of the year for resort merchants traditionally the 
labor day weekend is the grand finale of the summer beachgoing 
season 
its a major loss ms basnight said we would have made 
about 3000 now its down to zero 
brenda kanz front desk manager at the kona kai motel on atlantic 
avenue said sunday morning that authorities were not allowing 
guests to leave the motel unless they were checking out to go home 
this is a heck of a way to end the season she said 
a nursing supervisor at sentaranorfolk general hospital who 
asked not to be identified said shooting victim john thomas 28 of 
forestville md was in stable condition the other wounded man 
charles robinson 25 of roselle ny was listed in fair condition 
at virginia beach hospital 
authorities said two other people were also injured but it was 
not clear if those injuries were related to the riot one man was in 
critical condition with ijuries suffered when he fell from the 
fourth floor of a hotel while another was critically injured in a 
car accident near the area where the riot occurred 
in 1986 a crowd of unruly college and high school students on 
spring break rampaged through palm springs calif pelting police 
with rocks and bottles 
beerdrinking youths on the crowded main boulevard of the desert 
resort dumped water into passing cars and ripped bathing suit tops 
off of several young women during the melee which lasted several 
hours 
since then police have called in reinforcements to monitor 
spring break crowds and make hundreds of arrests for relatively 
minor offenses such as public drunkenness but there has been no 
repeat of the violence
