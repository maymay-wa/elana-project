cardinal john oconnor on thursday warned that 
roman catholic officials who support abortion rights could face 
excommunication but church experts and politicians dismissed the 
threat 
the cardinal delivered his strongest and clearest statement yet 
on the subject of excommunicating prochoice catholic politicians 
in a 12page piece in catholic new york the weekly archdiocesan 
newspaper 
where catholics are perceived not only as treating church 
teaching on abortion with contempt but helping to multiply 
abortions by advocating legislation supporting abortion or by 
making public funds available for abortion bishops may decide that 
such catholics must be warned that they are at risk of 
excommunication wrote oconnor who is the chairman of the 
bishops committee for prolife activities 
if such actions persist bishops may consider excommunication 
the only option he added oconnor did not mention any 
politicians by name and said any bishop would engage in 
considerable prayer and discussion before taking such action 
excommunication blocks a catholic from receiving most sacraments 
within the church 
us rep charles rangel who was barred from speaking at a high 
school graduation at st patricks cathedral last week because of 
his prochoice stance said he did not want to believe oconnor had 
issued such a meanspirited statement 
the cardinal obviously has a closer working relationship with 
god than i do so therefore i would not risk challenging his 
authority rangel dny said in washington on the other 
hand i feel very comfortable that comes judgment day we will be 
on equal footing 
gov mario cuomo speaking at city hall reaffirmed his position 
of personal opposition to abortion but public support of a womans 
right to decide the governor then acknowledged the talk of 
excommunication bothered him 
i dont like to hear it how could you this is something 
fundamental to our family said cuomo 
experts in church policy disagreed with oconnor saying support 
of a prochoice stance was not grounds to expel politicians from 
the church 
hes wrong said the rev richard mcbrien chairman of the 
theology department at the university of notre dame in south bend 
ind on the question of abortion the only person clearly 
subjected to excommunication would be the person who procures the 
abortion 
that would mean the woman and perhaps her doctor but not 
politicians he said 
mario cuomo is not performing abortions mario cuomo is not 
running an abortion clinic on the side said mcbrien he 
oconnor doesnt really have a canonical leg to stand on 
the rev robert drinan a former massachusetts congressman 
agreed that oconnors statements were misguided 
that goes against what the bishops have been saying said 
drinan a georgetown university law center professor i think 
that wont be taken that seriously catholics and everyone else 
would resent it 
but the rev joseph penna speaking for the archdiocese of new 
york said thursday evening that a person could be excommunicated 
even if they do not directly take part in an abortion 
it goes beyond who procures an abortion said penna of st 
josephs seminary in yonkers if church officials determined that 
an individual served as an accomplice to an abortion by giving 
scandal to other people that person could be excommunicated he 
said 
and by giving scandal i mean a person would look at someone 
else and say if that person can do it so can i said penna 
speaking of the leadership roles that politicians play in society

the men were declared missing tuesday one day after a troubled 
japanese climbing party that suffered the seasons first fatality 
was airlifted off the mountain 
there was no effort to remove the bodies from the 15800level 
because of the slope of the mountain and the threat of avalanche 
officials will decide later when it will be safe to return quinley

the men were roped together and appeared to have died after a 
fall the spokesman said they were last sighted june 1 at the

jack henry abbott fighting to keep the rewards 
of the writing career he developed in prison with norman mailers 
help said thursday that when he killed a young actor in 1981 he 
caused no financial loss to the widow 
acting as his own attorney in defense against a 17 million 
wrongful death lawsuit abbott said his victim richard adan had 
no more than 500 when he was killed and was being supported 
largely by his wife ricci now 32 
he also has insisted that he killed adan swiftly with a knife 
stab to the heart and therefore mrs adan deserves no payment for 
adans pain and suffering 
following the judges final instructions the jury deliberated 
briefly then was excused until friday 
abbott 46 gained fame from writing in the belly of the 
beast a bestseller composed of letters he sent from prison to 
mailer from 1978 through 1981 
mailer supported abbotts parole that year abbott had been out 
of prison six weeks when he slew adan outside the binibon 
restaurant on manhattans lower east side on july 18 1981 
abbott spent more than three hours in closing arguments thursday 
trying to convince the jury of six that adan 22 was one of 
thousands of young actors of modest talent who had a 
oneinamillion chance of success before he died 
abbott sneered at a pace university economists projections that 
adan might have netted 17 million in his lifetime abbott said the 
projections assumed that adan would have been a movie star of the 
caliber of paul newman 
mrs adans lawyers have proceeded on a theory of adans 
future value abbott said because they have nothing more to 
go on 
as abbott belittled adan he stood at a lectern dangling his 
left hand which has the letters jack tattooed on the four 
fingers 
mrs adan reacted to abbotts argument by laying her head on the 
knee of henry howard her stepfather 
on wednesday abbott reduced mrs adan to tears then said her 
weeping would prejudice the jury against him 
mrs adan i noticed you have a lot of tissues he said as 
he crossexamined mrs adan did you anticipate weeping on the 
stand do you have any children 
no she said 
just you abbott said 
yes she said as she started to weep more loudly 
abbott then demanded a mistrial because of prejudice and 
bias the judge denied the motion 
daniel leonard one of mrs adans lawyers told the jury in a 
12minute summation thursday that the future was all the couple had 
observing the defendants constant references to himself 
leonard told the jury that the case was not about abbott its 
about the promise of a great life about two young peoples future 
together the lawyer said 
abbott who said he has been out of prison a total of 11 months 
since he was 12 is serving 15 years to life for a firstdegree 
manslaughter conviction in adans death 
mrs adan sued him for 10 million for wrongful death and pain 
and suffering her lawyers upped the lawsuit to 17 million after 
testimony by the economist edmund mandell 
while abbott maintains adan endured no pain because the knife 
thrust killed him almost instantly leonard said there was proof 
that richard suffered greatly for 10 or 15 minutes before he 
died 
mailer very visible during abbotts criminal trial has been 
absent from this one he has not been reached for comment 
mrs adans lawyers estimate that abbott has a little more than 
100000 in escrow held by the manhattan sheriff in case of a civil 
judgement in mrs adans favor abbott also has 15000 earned 
from his writings that is being held by the state crime victims 
board 
abbott asked each witness did you read my book at one 
point he even asked judge carol arber she replied that she had 
looked at parts of it 
he attacked mrs adan and her family saying they wanted to 
punish him by insuring that no publisher will deal with him because 
of the legal lien on his finances 
these proceedings have been brought by mrs adan to stop me 
from publishing again abbott said

dermot finucane northern ireland 
jailbreaker and ira gunman wanted by britain is enjoying a fine 
dublin summer savoring freedom and drawing welfare checks 
its a great victory said finucane 29 who has spent most 
of his adult life in jail or on the run for someone suddenly to 
say youre free its also frightening and bewildering and 
wonderful at the same time 
to the british government his freedom is infuriating and the 
reasons are disturbing 
in march the irish supreme court refused to extradite finucane 
to britishruled northern ireland it said his offense of 
possessing weapons was politically inspired since the irish 
republican army is fighting to unite ireland 
the five judges added that finucane probably would be beaten by 
prison guards if returned to the jail from which he escaped in 1983 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain called the ruling 
deeply offensive and said it encouraged terrorists to the 
view that they will probably find a safe haven in the republic of 
ireland 
disputes over extradition have long clouded relations between 
the two countries but things reached a new low after finucane and 
an ira comrade james clark walked free march 13 into the arms of 
jubilant supporters both were convicted in northern ireland and 
sentenced to 18year prison terms 
prime minister charles haugheys fianna fail party political 
heirs of the irish nationalist heroes who wrested independence from 
britain in the 1920s is instinctively opposed to handing irish 
people over to the british 
the ira is dedicated to overthrowing the institutions governing 
the irish republic as well as british rule in northern ireland 
ireland like britain outlaws the organization and keeps its 
supporters off radio and television 
extradition remains a problem however because of the deeply 
rooted belief that an irish nationalist will not get fair treatment 
from the british 
in the past year british appeal judges have quashed the 
convictions of four irish people jailed for ira bombings in britain 
in 1974 and three who were accused of plotting to assassinate a 
british government minister 
six irishmen serving life sentences for a 1974 bombing in 
birmingham that killed 21 people have won widespread support for 
their campaign to prove they were unjustly convicted 
it all reinforces widespread unease about the conduct of court 
cases in britain in which irish people are charged with terrorist 
offenses said columnist mary holland of the irish times which 
opposes the ira 
among those who got away is a roman catholic priest patrick 
ryan the irish attorney general refused his extradition on 
terrorism charges in 1988 declaring british politicians and 
newspapers had damned ryan in such intemperate language that a fair 
trial was impossible 
britain and other irish political parties are putting pressure 
on haughey to amend the extradition laws critics want it spelled 
out that such crimes as murder or possessing weapons cannot be 
deemed political 
the idea that such barbarism should somehow be construed as a 
form of political action is nauseating and immoral and cannot 
continue said desmond omalley leader of the progressive 
democrats the fianna fails junior coalition partner 
recent bombings in london have increased the pressure on haughey 
the british say the attacks herald a summer onslaught in 
mainland britain as part of the ira campaign to unite 
protestantdominated northern ireland with the overwhelmingly 
catholic republic 
haughey says a 1987 act curtailing the plea of political 
motivation will do away with the present difficulties he tells 
critics to wait and see how the courts apply the 1987 statute 
which incorporates the european convention on the suppression of 
terrorism 
our extradition laws are amongst the best in the world he 
told fianna fails annual convention soon after finucane was 
released 
also however delegates endorsed a resolution opposing any 
extraditions to northern ireland and britain in present 
circumstances it said suspects should be tried instead under the 
republics antiterrorist laws 
although finucanes case predates the 1987 act some critics say 
his release has undermined it and is good news for five northern 
ireland fugitives fighting extradition under the stricter law 
cases still take a year or more to grind through appeals and 
scope remains in the 1987 act for fighting extradition on political 
grounds2 britain has made 112 applications for extradition of 
security offenders northern ireland officials say with seven 
granted 41 refused and five still being fought the rest lapsed 
to northern irelands unionists the protestant 
since 197 majority 
ireland looks like a haven for their terrorist foes the british 
feel let down because improved extradition procedures were 
supposed to be the reward for giving ireland a say in the running 
of northern ireland under the 1985 angloirish agreement 
irelands progressive democrats began a campaign may 14 to 
toughen the extradition law and found the opposition fine gael and 
labor parties generally supportive 
it is a huge scandal that that man finu on suspected safe houses 
in 1987 
his brother patrick a lawyer who defended ira suspects was 
shot to death and protestant militants claimed responsibility 
another brother gerard is in an irish jail for ira activity and 
john finucane was killed in an auto accident en route to an ira 
operation

three men 
the largest of seven cylindrical tanks at the greene county farm 
bureau coop exploded about 230 pm and was still burning 
wednesday night state police cpl omar davis said in bloomington 
davis said officials of the us environmental protection agency 
were determining whether to smother the blaze with foam or let it 
burn itself out 
although fears that the fire would spread to the other tanks 
subsided residents up to two miles away were evacuated 
two businesses are very close and there are a few scattered 
homes nearby but its mostly rural said sheriffs dispatcher 
sheri campbell 
the size of the tank and the amount of gasoline it held had not 
been determined davis said noting conflicting reports that it 
contained 8000 gallons or 42000 gallons 
davis said the accident occurred as workers emptied a gasoline 
truck into the tank using a pump 
the pump apparently sparked and ignited the truck and from 
there somehow or other the tank caught fire he said 
the three injured were taken to hospitals to be treated for 
burns 
leo goodwin listed in critical condition was taken to riley 
hospital in indianapolis dick smiley also listed as critical was 
taken to wishard hospital in indianapolis and richard knight who 
was in serious condition was taken to deaconess hospital in 
evansville davis said their ages and hometowns were unavailable 
dark smoke was seen as far away as six or seven miles from the

europes most prosperous city followed by brussels venice 
munich and amsterdam a university report says 
the belgian italian dutch and west germany cities led 117 
urban areas ranked by university of reading economics professor 
paul cheshire 
only european community cities with a minimum population of 
300000 were considered and portugal and greece were not included 
because they could not provide adequate figures said cheshire 
to determine the cities rankings cheshire said he looked at 
their per capita gross domestic product unemployment migration 
and other factors 
the three poorest cities in the survey were all in spain 
malaga cordoba and seville 
the results based on figures up to 1988 are to be published in 
the july issue of urban studies an international journal published 
in britain cheshire made a copy of his article available to the 
associated press on wednesday 
the cities that fared best are large have big service sectors 
and are centrally located in europe cheshire said european 
economic integration is of much greater benefit to the more central 
regions of europe than it is to the more peripheral ones

slight genetic mutations allowed a monkey aids 
virus to kill within days rather than months a finding that could 
improve scientists understanding of human aids researchers 
reported today 
the result raises the possibility that a human aids strain may 
exist that kills within days or weeks of infection rather than 
years said study coauthor patricia fultz 
a federal aids expert said he strongly doubts such a human 
strain exists but he and fultz said the monkey virus may still 
help scientists study aids 
the new work is presented in the british journal nature by 
fultz of the yerkes regional primate research center at emory 
university in atlanta with scientists there at harvard university 
and the stanford university school of medicine 
they studied a recently isolated strain of a simian 
immunodeficiency virus scientists study these monkey viruses 
called sivs to gain clues about aids 
in monkeys called pigtailed macaques the fastacting siv 
produced bloody diarrhea and death in as little as six days after 
it infected the animal researchers reported in contrast the 
virus from which this strain evolved allows eight months or more of 
survival after infection fultz said wednesday 
the genetic makeup of the fastacting virus strongly resembles 
that of other sivs and gained its wallop by acquiring only subtle 
mutations so the possibility that a fastacting human aids virus 
exists must be considered the researchers said 
but malcolm martin of the laboratory of molecular biology at the 
national institute of allergy and infectious diseases in bethesda 
md said it is highly unlikely such a virus exists 
no such virus has been observed in the hundreds of thousands of 
people infected with the aids virus and if a fastacting human 
version were going to appear it would have shown up by now he 
said 
further study of the fastacting siv strain may identify the 
genes that make it act so quickly which in turn may give clues for 
fighting the human aids virus fultz said 
martin said that since the virus causes severe disease more 
quickly than other sivs it may also provide a way to test aids 
therapies more quickly

hes a mature easygoing bachelor hes a good cook and he even 
does windows 
boy does he do windows 
every day this week martin scales the sheer face of the 
30story gannett co inc headquarters building one of the tallest 
in metropolitan washington dc to scrub its 5000 windows from 
the outside 
the annual spring cleaning takes martin 53 and his buddy 
lucien coleman 62 about three weeks they finished gannetts twin 
usa today building last week and both gleaming towers will be 
washed again this summer and fall 
from his perch on a gently swaying platform only three feet 
wide martin has a breathtaking view of washingtons monuments and 
treeshaded malls across the potomac river the 380foot plunge 
from gannetts rooftop to the busy streets below is an acrophobics 
nightmare but a downward glance doesnt bother martin 
its a good job he says a lot of people look up to you 
martins been a professional window washer for 30 years and hes 
never suffered high anxiety from the time he climbed trees as a 
kid no sweaty palms no churning stomach no dizzy spells he 
doesnt take tranquilizers and sleeps like a baby at night 
he did utter a prayer once when his platform tipped over and he 
took a fourstory free fall until he was caught by the heavy safety 
rope attached to his belt he escaped with only rope burns on his 
hand 
martin is such a relaxed fellow that when one of his platforms 
electrically powered hoist cables stalled leaving him swinging 100 
feet in the air for half an hour he simply laid down until an 
engineer fixed the problem 
it wasnt going anywhere so i took a little nap he said 
martin likes the fresh air and sunshine the pay is good 140 a 
day and the solitude of working at great heights gives him plenty 
of time to think he says 
for entertainment he waves at startled office workers as he 
suddenly drops into view a sort of highrise peeping tommy the 
other day an airliner roared so close to the gannett building on 
its approach to nearby national airport that i could see the 
passengers inside he said 
martin says he can ride up or down the building in 20 minutes 
swabbing windows and aluminum paneling with a sudsy solution of 
household detergent and ammonia and scraping them dry with a 
squeegee 
a lifelong bachelor martin cooks his own dinner when he returns 
home for the evening his favorite is meatloaf and collard greens 
but he offers a warning to any females who might be hunting for a

mayor marion barry struggling against drug 
possession and perjury charges said wednesday he would not seek 
reelection to a fourth term now is a time for healing the 
embattled mayor said 
barry hastily summoned his cabinet to reveal his decision 
shortly before he told his constituents via a televised 
announcement 
his move sparked speculation of an effort to rekindle plea 
bargain talks that broke down over a week ago however barry 
denied that his political decision had anything to do with his 
trial 
barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession 
charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three 
felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use 
as jury selection crawled along us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson said he hoped to seat a jury on monday 
now is a time for healing healing for me personally and for 
you politically barry said 
barry said public opinion polls indicated he could win another 
term but he added what good does it do to win the battle if in 
the process i lose my soul 
barrys pretaped address was broadcast on howard university 
radio and television 
barry is seeking to portray himself as a victim someone whos 
given up something very important in the wake of these charges 
said one source who has spoken to barry several times in the past 
week the thinking is the jury may go easy on him if they feel 
hes voluntarily dropped something so dear 
barry decided over the weekend not to seek reelection but 
postponed making the announcement because of publicity surrounding 
the efforts of jesse jackson and others to act as mediators in 
barrys case sources said 
barrys decision was expected to boost the mayoral candidacies 
of dc council member john ray and walter fauntroy the district 
of columbias nonvoting delegate to congress barrys successor 
will take office jan 1 
barry said his decision will go a long way toward lifting the 
shadows over other candidates campaigns he noted that some have 
called on him to resign immediately but said that would be 
disruptive for the city 
barry supporters have organized a rally for thursday outside the 
courthouse where the mayors case is being tried anita bonds 
barrys campaign manager has circulated a letter to city workers 
urging them to attend 
meanwhile six potential jurors questioned wednesday said they 
would not be affected by either an announcement that barry would 
forgo seeking a fourth term or a declaration that he would run 
prosecutors had raised the issue with the prospective jurors 
interviews of the prospective jurors will end at noon friday 
the jury will be seated monday and opening statements will be 
tuesday morning said jackson seventyseven people have been sent 
into a pool of potential jurors since the process began june 4 
barry aides had floated the idea of a plea bargain last week in 
which the mayor would agree to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges 
but sources close to us attorney jay stephens office said the 
prosecutor would not accept a deal that did not include a felony 
conviction 
stephens has said any decision barry made on reelection would 
be irrelevant to the criminal case 
but for the first time on wednesday lawyers raised questions 
with the prospective jurors about barrys political plans 
assistant us attorney judith retchin asked one woman if her 
work on the criminal case would be affected if she learned barry 
were not going to seek reelection 
no replied the prospective juror who had worked a number of 
years ago in a city summer youth employment program nor would she 
be affected if barry announced he would run said the woman who 
reiterated her answers when questioned similarly by r kenneth 
mundy the mayors lawyer 
a second prospective juror said he wouldnt be affected by a 
barry announcement on his political future 
if its not part of the trial i would not consider it said 
the man 
one man said that he would regard a decision by barry not to run 
for reelection as an admission of guilt he said he thinks barry 
should resign because the publicity surrounding the investigation 
and prosecution of the mayor has hurt the city that man was 
one of seven excluded from the jury pool

a plan to reduce logging by 46 percent in 
washingtons largest national forest was announced wednesday and 
more drastic reductions may be ordered to protect the northern 
spotted owl officials said 
mount bakersnoqualmie national forest supervisor doug 
macwilliams briefed a few dozen interestgroup representatives on 
the 10to15year plan for land and resource management 
he said it represents a major shift in favor of recreation and a 
very severe blow to the timber industry 
the proposed timber harvest reductions would cost about 1800 
jobs macwilliams said every one of us in this room will feel it 
in some way or another he said 
when you go to buy a 2by4 youre going to be paying through 
the nose for it he said 
the plan replacing one dating from 1963 takes effect 90 days 
after publication friday in the federal register and will remain in 
effect pending the outcome of appeals macwilliams said 
representatives of industry landowner and environmental groups 
all say they will appeal various aspects of the plan it is the 
product of 10 years of research and debate but is subject to 
amendment by the forest service 
mount bakersnoqualmie covering 17 million acres from the 
canadian border to the area around mount rainier national park is 
the second largest timberproducing national forest in washington 
at the same time it probably has the heaviest recreation 
demands of any national forest in the state said forest spokesman 
warren olney 
the plan would set the average annual timber harvest at 108 
million board feet 46 percent less than the average for the past 
decade and 36 percent less than proposed in a draft plan two years 
ago 
the forest would produce 526 million in income a year 
macwilliams said 
the harvest would drop to 45 million board feet however if a 
scientific report on protection of the owl is accepted by the us 
fish and wildlife service he said 
fish and wildlife officials are scheduled to decide by june 23 
whether to list the owl as threatened a decision that would 
trigger further logging restrictions 
however macwilliams said the harvest would rise by a total of 
roughly 40 percent over the two decades following the planning 
period and then level off at a sustainedyield level 
about 95 percent of the roadless acreage would remain intact and 
97 percent of the 643000 acres of old growth would remain in the 
year 2000 
old growth was defined in the plan as trees at least 21 inches 
in diameter measured 4 feet from the ground 
using the wilderness societys definition of at least 32 inches 
however there is only about half as much virgin forest left said 
jean durning regional director of the environmental group 
other features of the plan include a recommendation that 30 
rivers stretching along 462 miles be designated as wild and scenic 
a protection now accorded in washington only to the skagit river 
system the draft plan had proposed wildandscenic designation for 
five rivers 
the plan also calls for construction of 220 miles of trails 
rebuilding of 493 miles and maintenance of 891 the draft plan had 
called for 80 new miles 240 for rebuilding and 1144 for 
maintenance

a gasoline barge sprang a leak wednesday night 
spilling at least 1200 gallons and prompting officials to close 
two busy waterways that have been plagued by spills authorities 
said 
the source of the spill into the arthur kill waterway was 
believed to be a tank on the barge holding more than 222000 
gallons of unleaded gas said coast guard petty officer don burt 
the tank was emptied about two hours after the leak was reported 
to the coast guard at 805 pm but officials were waiting for 
divers to confirm no other tanks were leaking into the arthur kill 
waterway dividing new yorks staten island and new jersey 
it was not immediately known what caused the spill more than 10 
million gallons of fuel were loaded into 10 tanks on the barge at 
carteret nj during the afternoon then the vessel traveled 
across the arthur kill to a mobil corp operation on staten island 
after the spill the fire department sent about 10 units to the 
port mobil section of staten island spokesman john mulligan said 
the arthur kill and adjacent kill van kull were closed shortly 
after 9 pm as a safety precaution while firefighters attempted to 
disperse the gasoline to speed evaporation 
brooks said it was not immediately known how long the kills 
would remain closed booms were laid at entrances to nearby creeks 
to prevent the gasoline from spreading inland he said 
he said the barge was owned by bouchard transportation of new 
york calls to the company were not answered wednesday night 
the amount of oil accidentally released into the two kills this 
year is four times as much as was reported in all of 1989 
the most recent accident occurred last week when an 811foot 
tanker leaked 260000 gallons of oil into the kill van kull on 
jan 2 a pipe from an exxon refinery leaked more than 567000 
gallons of oil into the arthur kill

two huge spending bills to help cities and 
states cope with the aids crisis are heading to a conference 
committee now that the house has approved its 4 billion version 
the house bill was approved 40814 on wednesday sending it to a 
panel that will compromise it with a senate version that would 
spend 1 billion less over five years 
the overwhelming house vote came in the face of opposition by 
the office of management and budget which argued that the bill was 
too costly and should not have been focused on a single disease 
the bills narrow diseasespecific approach sets a dangerous 
precedent inviting treatment of other diseases through similar ad 
hoc arrangements a budget office statement said 
this approach also runs counter to the governments existing 
health care financing system which will provide more than 870 
million in federal medicaid payments for hiv disease in 1991 it 
said referring to the aidscausing human immunodeficiency virus 
the house bill authorizes 400 million in each of the next five 
fiscal years for grants to provide a variety of aids preventative 
health services half the money would go to state governments and 
the rest directly to health care facilities 
it authorizes another 275 million a year for the next two 
years and such sums as may be necessary for the following 
three years to go directly to cities with the largest number of 
aids cases the money would go to aids health care and support 
services 
the bill authorizes smaller amounts for a series of other aids 
projects including 20 million a year for research into helping 
pediatric patients and grants to states for purchasing drugs to 
treat aids and related conditions 
the house adopted amendments that scaled back the estimated 
fiveyear cost of the bill from 46 billion to around 4 billion 
it rejected amendments that would have required states to test 
all citizens annually for the aids virus and would have required 
institutions to report anyone who tests positive to state 
authorities 
rep charles schumer dny likened aids to natural disasters 
that have prompted congress to appropriate money to local 
governments 
this bill says to cities like new york which has 25 percent 
of total aids cases in the country that we understand your 
problem he said hospitals are collapsing with the financial 
burden placed on them by aids 
besides new york other cities expected to receive emergency 
grants under the house bill are atlanta boston chicago dallas 
houston jersey city nj los angeles miami newark 
philadelphia san diego san francisco san juan puerto rico and 
washington dc 
the senate last month approved 954 to approve a similar bill 
that would spend an estimated 29 billion over five years 
the aids virus is transmitted through blood and other body 
fluids homosexual contact and intravenous illicit drug use are 
primary transmitters 
the 14 members voting against the bill were all republicans 
they were philip crane rill john duncan jr rtenn mickey

the us government is illegally withholding from 
manuel noriegas lawyers file cabinets full of thousands of secret 
panamanian documents seized during the american invasion a defense 
attorney says 
michael okane attorney for codefendant daniel miranda said 
an inventory that a private investigator found in a us army 
warehouse in panama showed the government gave a shorter list of 
all seized material to the defense 
we found wadded up in one of the boxes as garbage what we 
think is the real inventory okane said wednesday 
he said the defense was given a sanitized list as part of a 
coverup effectuated in panama by unknown elements within the 
government of the united states 
omitting evidence would violate a us magistrates order that 
an inventory of all noriegarelated documents seized in the 
december invasion be turned over to the defense okane said on 
wednesday he filed a motion demanding a full accounting of the 
files 
okane said there was no indication the miami us attorneys 
office knew its list was sanitized 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office had no 
comment on the motion nor did pentagon spokeswoman maj kathy 
woods 
the newly discovered list indicates the army confiscated file 
cabinets containing panamanian intelligence files weapons 
importexport records confidential correspondence and files on 
antinoriega coup plotters okane said 
the lawyer emphasized that many of the missing documents 
appeared to be essential 
noriega contends many of his activities were sanctioned by the 
united states and that us and panamanian records would show he 
cooperated with the cia drug enforcement administration and other 
investigative agencies 
jon may an attorney for noriega said he had not seen okanes 
list but that the generals defense is eager to examine the lists 
and documents 
okanes client miranda is charged with helping to fly drug 
profits from fort lauderdale to panama he faces up to five years 
in prison 
noriega faces up to 145 years in prison on charges of accepting 
46 million from colombias medellin drug cartel to turn panama 
into a haven for usbound drugs

dave durenberger has been in the senate for 12 
years but his colleagues now regard him from across a great divide 
they the judges and he the judged 
no attempt at mild humor no appeal to mutual concerns no 
allusion to past relationships was enough to evoke a smile or even 
a change of expression from the six solemn men who will decide 
durenbergers future 
they are trying one of their own a republican from 
squeakyclean minnesota a man who has served on goodgovernment 
panels for decades a former member of the senate ethics committee 
itself and now accused of intentionally skirting and violating 
senate rules to make himself richer 
the ethics committee had scheduled up to two weeks of hearings 
but it agreed to a request wednesday from durenbergers lawyer jim 
hamilton to end the hearings early because of the legal fees the 
senator would incur 
instead durenberger turned over 23 volumes of documents into 
evidence for the committee to consider 
the panels lawyer robert s bennett has recommended that 
durenberger be denounced by the senate a severe reprimand that 
while short of expulsion usually leads to the end of a lawmakers 
career 
gentlemen i dont need to tell you that reputation is the 
lifeblood of public service durenberger said amiably as he began 
his statement of selfdefense on wednesday 
no flicker 
i have never once worked the facts in this case with my 
colleagues even though we have all of these political and personal 
relationships he continued 
no flicker 
durenberger chuckled that a sons college graduation last 
weekend had entailed eight years and four different schools he 
wondered jokingly who in his right mind would try to evade senate 
rules by creating an outfit called piranha press to publish his 
books 
no one on the panel smiled 
he spoke of his four sons his first wifes early death his 
marriage to a vietnam war widow the sorrow that made bonding 
difficult in our family he talked of religion lessons learned 
his acute sense of sadness and resolve to be a model public 
servant 
his six judges sat impassively 
if no sympathy was apparent from those behind the long 
velvetdraped dais durenberger did command some support among 
spectators in the huge marbled hearing room there was his youngest 
son dan 23 and there was sen rudy boschwitz rminn a 
surprising presence to some 
durenberger is too wellliked to have become a pariah at least 
not yet he was appointed last week as expected to a conference 
committee on the clean air bill he is scheduled to speak friday at 
his states independentrepublican party convention 
nevertheless senators arent rushing to do photo 
opportunities with him as one capitol hill staffer put it 
durenberger defends himself partly by saying he did only what he 
believed other lawmakers were doing he also says his aggressive 
approach to his job created strains and vulnerabilities in his 
family life and in his decisionmaking process 
neither argument seems to be going over well there is concern 
that durenbergers wellpublicized troubles will tar an institution 
that gets little enough respect as it is there is also a feeling 
that while many senators have financial and personal problems they 
have managed to play by the rules 
durenbergers fans in the audience are worried that his case 
could be used as a warning to other senators at his expense 
it sounds like they feel like they need to make a statement 
to say this just cant continue said meredith musaus 33 pastor 
of a visiting church youth group from faribault minn 
in durenbergers pleasant senate office two receptionists and a 
couple of young aides watched his speech on television the wall 
behind the tv set was covered with photographs of prominent 
minnesota politicians and a sign that said no mans life 
liberty or property are safe while the legislature is in session 
business proceeded as usual except for a smattering of calls 
from people expressing support for the senator and an occasional 
righton sign at the tv screen when durenberger made an emphatic 
point 
my life and my reputation are at stake durenberger on 
television was saying emotionally as a man walked into his office 
and plunked down a briefcase 
for the mistakes i have made i repeat that i am sorry said 
the senator an imploring note in his voice 
i have an 1130 appointment with anthony the man with the 
briefcase said he never even glanced at the tv

researchers have created a wand that 
alters living animal cells by bombarding them with microscopic 
dnacoated pellets duke university scientists said wednesday 
there is a whole range of genetic applications said stephen 
johnston a molecular biologist at duke 
i think we are just at the frontier of realizing what the 
potentials are of being able to modify cells in the living 
organism he said 
the scientists say the technology could be ready for use within 
a year and eventually could help treat liver and heart diseases 
but they added that its future depends on further breakthroughs 
and on societys attitude toward genetic engineering 
the research results were reported wednesday at the annual 
meeting of the tissue culture association in houston 
duke researchers in collaboration with scientists at cornell 
university and the dupont co used the wand to alter cells of 
living mice by injecting new genes with little or no adverse 
effects they said 
the wand eventually may be used to treat some liver diseases 
by supplying the missing gene that causes certain defects to alter 
pancreatic cells to produce insulin or to alter muscle cells to 
treat heart diseases the scientists said 
its an interesting new approach to a very important problem 
in modern molecular biology said lee hood professor of biology 
at california institute of technology 
using pressurized helium gas the wand propels at 1000 
feet a second microscopic dnacoated pellets into the tissue 
about 10 million pellets each containing about 30 genes are 
introduced the pellets are so small 00003 inches across that 
they do not cause extensive damage researchers said 
dna or deoxyribonucleic acid is the collection of genes in 
living cells that determine individual characteristics 
because the pellets do not penetrate deep into the tissue the 
animal does not suffer any trauma or skin irritation johnston 
said adding that a human subject might feel a slight stinging 
sensation 
the wand must be improved before it can be applied to human 
diseases researchers said they said questions remain about 
whether the altered genes can permanently take hold in animal cells 
to date the genes have been effective only as long as the 
pellets remained in the tissue about 10 days in the ear of a mouse 
existing techniques for modifying the dna of living organisms 
such as bonemarrow transplants involve an indirect process in 
which cells are removed from the patient altered and then 
reintroduced the researchers said 
dupont said it will make a version of the wand available to 
researchers 
the precursor to the wand is a mechanism that uses gunpowder 
to fire genecoated tungsten pellets into plant cells the 
researchers said that instrument was invented by john sanford of 
cornell university who also worked on the wand team 
dupont bought the rights to the earlier instrument and markets 
it to agriculture and industry

smalltown and rural soviet citizens are 
missing out on many of the new freedoms urban residents enjoy under 
glasnost a state department official says 
residents of outlying areas still must contend with the old 
communist party power structure richard schifter assistant 
secretary of state for human rights said wednesday 
in those areas a persons job assignment and housing remain 
dependent on the good will of the local party boss who will most 
assuredly discriminate against anyone who steps out of line 
schifter told the house foreign affairs subcommittee on human 
rights and international organizations 
however he said what we might refer to as first amendment 
freedoms have come to the soviet unions urban areas and the clouds 
of fear which hung over them have lifted 
schifter noted that restrictions on religious freedom are not 
being enforced and that on tuesday the supreme soviet approved a 
law ending media censorship 
on wednesday the soviets agreed to begin easing its 2monthold 
economic embargo against independenceminded lithuania the tass 
news agency quoted lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene 
as saying the soviet government had agreed to restore some fuel and 
raw material supplies to the baltic republic 
curtis kamman deputy assistant secretary of state for european 
and canadian affairs noted that under the soviet embargo 
lithuania by now should have been brought to its knees and 
obviously it has not 
lithuania got help from the other two baltic republics latvia 
and estonia and from other sources he said 
also attending wednesdays hearing was mart niklus an estonian 
who spent most of his adult life in soviet prisons and labor camps 
for political dissidence 
he said he agreed that conditions are vastly improving but 
added that if the soviet union removed its troops from the baltic 
republics many other problems would be automatically resolved 
niklus who was released from prison in july 1988 is traveling 
through the united states canada and europe to seek support for 
baltic independence 
schifter said the soviet union faces serious problems with its 
economic crisis and severe ethnic conflicts in some areas 
but he added one cannot help when visiting the country but 
be encouraged by this resurgence of the human spirit 
yet the kgb is still in place schifter told the house 
panel although it no longer pursues political dissidents he said 
there was concern that the kgb could quickly revive the apparatus 
of repression if ordered to do so 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said the end of censorship means 
there is little that cannot be said or written nowadays in the 
soviet union provided one can find the paper and ink

dave durenberger would become the ninth 
senator to suffer the senates second most severe punishment if his 
colleagues agree he should be denounced for financial misconduct 
the senate ethics committee is weighing possible punishments for 
the minnesota republican after abruptly ending triallike hearings 
against him on wednesday by accepting 23 volumes of documents into 
evidence 
the committees special counsel robert s bennett suggested 
the panel recommend to the senate that durenberger be publicly 
denounced for reprehensible financial misconduct that brought 
dishonor and disrepute on the chamber 
denouncing a senator is tantamount to condemning or censuring 
him and it usually leads to the end of the lawmakers career 
authorities said 
in a collegial body its a severe reprimand said don 
ritchie associate senate historian 
the committee had scheduled up to two weeks of hearings but it 
agreed to a request from durenbergers attorney jim hamilton to 
end the sessions early because of the legal fees durenberger would 
incur 
the panels vice chairman sen warren b rudman rnh said 
the committee could make its decision based on written documents 
and statements by durenberger his lawyer and bennett 
there is not a great deal of dispute about the facts rudman 
said theres obviously a great deal of dispute about what those 
facts mean 
a decision is not expected for several weeks 
durenberger made an emotional appeal to the committee wednesday 
to show compassion he denied he intentionally broke ethics rules 
but acknowledged he had caused the senate real damage 
the committee has found substantial credible evidence that 
durenberger violated senate rules and the law by evading honoraria 
limits through a book promotion deal and hiding his ownership in a 
minneapolis condominium so he could collect travel reimbursement 
for staying there 
ritchie said the committee can essentially render or recommend 
one of three different punishment for a senator 
a reprimand also called admonishment or rebuke that would 
require only the approval of the committee 
censure denunciation or condemnation this would require a 
majority vote of the senate 
expulsion a twothirds vote of the senate is required to 
remove a member the senate has almost never acted to expel a 
member who wasnt convicted of a serious crime bennett said 
sen joseph mccarthy rwis was condemned by the senate in 
1954 for his witch hunts of supposed communists two others have 
been censured since then thomas dodd dconn in 1967 and herman 
talmadge dga in 1979 both for financial misconduct 
in this century two others have been censured benjamin tillman 
and john mclaurin south carolina democrats who were punished for a 
brawl on the senate floor ritchie said 
the damage to a senators career has almost always been mortal 
tillman is the only censured senator who won reelection

the nixon presidential library opening next 
month will become the most complete source of materials about 
president nixon and his life and presidency even though it will 
have no original white house documents a spokesman says 
the white house announced wednesday that president bush will 
attend the library dedication in yorba linda calif on july 19 
almost 16 years after nixon resigned the presidency in the wake of 
the watergate scandals 
former presidents reagan and ford also will attend former 
president carter was invited but said he had another engagement 
nixons assistant john taylor said from the former presidents 
office in new jersey that nixon would be accompanied by former 
first lady pat nixon and members of their family 
only the exhibit portion of the library along with the restored 
home in which nixon was born in 1913 will be immediately opened to 
the public the archival portion containing pre and 
postpresidential nixon papers and copies of white house documents 
is scheduled to open sometime next year 
nixon resigned from office on aug 8 1974 after the house 
judiciary committee had voted to impeach him on grounds that 
included a coverup of white house involvement in a breakin at 
democratic party headquarters in the watergate office building 
both reagan and bush have conferred at times with the former 
president but bushs appearance in yorba linda will mark one of 
the few times since nixons resignation that a president has shared 
a public platform with him 
reagan spoke at a departure ceremony at the white house on oct 
9 1981 as nixon ford and carter left for egypt to represent the 
president at the funeral of slain egyptian president anwar sadat 
nixon has not attended any of the four republican national 
conventions since his resignation 
unlike other presidential libraries the nixon library will be 
operated by the private foundation that raised the money to build 
it the eight others are run by the national archives as the 
reagan library will be after it opens its doors next year in simi 
valley calif 
also unlike the other libraries the nixon library will not 
contain original white house documents they are stored in a 
national archives building in alexandria va where they are being 
processed and made public 
taylor said the library will contain papers from nixons years 
in the house and senate his campaigns and the period since he left 
the white house he said it will also house some of his vice 
presidential papers some were deeded to the government and are in 
a national archives facility in laguna niguel calif 
in addition the nixon aide said preliminary discussions are 
being held about making copies of some 15 million pages of 
presidential documents now in the alexandria archives building 
when the archival level of the library opens in 1991 the 
nixon library and birthplace will be the most complete source of 
materials about president nixon and his life and presidency 
taylor said it will include copies of all critically important 
presidential documents 
the national archives holds about 40 million pages of nixon 
white house documents but taylor said these include a lot of 
christmas cards and life magazine collections of staff members and 
various less important documents 
he said copying would focus initially on the special files of 
the archives nixon project containing work papers of the 
president and key staff members 
we have not even begun to investigate how the copies are going 
to be made said taylor it may even be that technology will 
enable us to transfer the documents to a laser disk at a much 
reduced cost 
jill brett public affairs director of the national archives 
said agency regulations permit people to do copying on their own 
with approved equipment under staff supervision 
congress gave control of nixons presidential papers to the 
archives in 1974 nixon challenged the acts constitutionality but 
it was upheld in 1977 by the supreme court the former president 
also lost a challenge to regulations adopted under the act

the agency that put men on the moon rescued 
lost satellites and sent spacecraft to distant planets is looking 
for new worlds to conquer and it wants ideas from you 
the national aeronautics and space administration decided 
recently to go outside the agency away from its normal 
contractors to get fresh thinking on ways to establish a permanent 
base on the moon and put humans on mars 
not only the public but universities engineering schools and 
professional science and engineering organizations were invited to 
contribute 
nasa even set up a tollfree telephone line for the ideas 
8006777796 
nasa administrator richard h truly has sent more than 3200 
letters to the heads of schools asking for their help the rand 
corp in santa monica calif will filter the good ideas from the 
bad before passing them on to washington the tollfree number 
reaches rand 
the search for ideas from an agency noted for turning science 
fiction into reality started last july with a pledge by president 
bush that the united states was headed back to the moon this 
time to stay and would push on to mars 
bush set that goal in a speech observing the 20th anniversary of 
mans first footsteps on the moon more recently he said the mars 
landing should be accomplished by the 50th anniversary of the neil 
armstrongbuzz aldrin moon landing in the year 2019 
a nasasponsored study estimated the cost of going to mars at 
500 billion or more a sum that would require more money each year 
than the agencys current budget for all space activities 
vice president dan quayle as head of the national space 
council has been pressing nasa officials to go outside normal 
channels and cast their net widely for more efficient and 
cheaper ways to return to the moon and to plant the us flag on 
mars 
the space agency also has been challenged by others such as 
lawrence livermore national laboratory which said astronauts could 
be landed on mars for 11 billion using existing rockets and 
inflatable spacecraft and the aerospace industries association has 
urged that a study group be set up outside of nasa to receive 
proposals and evaluate them 
in answer to such unaccustomed outside pressure truly announced 
his agency was organizing a formal searchforideas program called 
the space exploration initiative 
he named retired air force lt gen thomas p stafford a former 
astronaut who has four times flown in space including a trip 
around the moon the plan calls for staffords group to study the 
ideas after theyve been cleared by rand 
truly said his outreach program will leave no stone unturned 
to reach out the best and brightest in our nation that includes 
even a phone call to 8006777796

foreign countries that rely on imports of corn 
and other coarse grains are getting edgy about the global supply 
and price outlook for the year ahead an agriculture department 
analysis says 
while the outlook for the 1990 world wheat crop continues to 
be generally favorable heavy rains across the major corngrowing 
areas of the united states have delayed corn planting the report 
said wednesday 
as a result it added this is causing concern in the 
marketplace about prospects for the 1990 us crop and because of 
the united states dominance the worlds coarse grain price 
outlook as well 
in addition analysts said there has been rather strong 
lateseason import demand for coarse grains that will result in 
a large drawdown in world coarse grain stocks during the 
remainder of the 198990 season 
on tuesday the usda projected 1990 corn production at 81 
billion bushels up from 753 billion harvested last year despite 
the increase in production total exports and domestic use are even 
larger meaning that the nations stockpile will dwindle further in 
199091 
also the projections are highly tentative and were based on 
yield trends and planting indications derived from march surveys 
wet weather however has delayed planting this spring and has 
prompted concern about reduced yields and acreages 
the departments first official corn estimate will not be 
released until aug 9 along with prospects for soybeans sorghum 
cotton and other 1990 springplanted crops 
looking further at the global coarse grain situation which 
includes sorghum barley and rye as well as corn the report said 
shifting trade patterns are beginning to affect the outlook for 
the 199091 marketing year 
crop shortfalls especially in brazil are already influencing 
import patterns it said in addition foreign exportable 
supplies will be limited until newcrop output is available for 
export 
thus it said there will be continued greater reliance on the 
united states for coarse grain particularly as the 1990 crops 
develop 
according to the projections corn prices at the farm may 
average in the range of 235 to 275 per bushel in the 199091 
marketing year that will begin sept 1 prices in the current 
season are forecast to average 235 to 240 per bushel

agricultural scientists 
the five new inductees included 
retired biologist theodore c byerly who died may 17 for his 
investigations of how nutrition genetics and the environment 
affect the hatching of chicken eggs his findings helped boost the 
hatching rate to 85 percent from 65 percent 
his studies were based at the agencys beltsville md research 
center until 1963 when he left for a series of highlevel usda 
administrative posts 
retired geneticist gordon e dickerson who was responsible for

public comment is being sought on an 
agriculture department proposal to allow salty whey to be covered 
by federal whey standards 
salty whey is the moisture removed from cheese curd through a 
salting process the standards would apply to whey after the salt 
is removed 
daniel d haley administrator of the departments agricultural 
marketing service said wednesday that current rules allow us 
grading only on whey that originates as saltless 
at present salty whey represents a small amount of the total 
whey that results from cheesemaking and is discarded because it is 
so salty he said but new technology can economically remove the 
salt from salted whey 
dried and condensed whey are significant sources of vitamins and 
protein for humans and are used to some extent in animal feed 
haley said 
comments on the proposal can be sent by aug 13 to director 
dairy division ams usda room 2968s po box 96456 washington 
dc 200906456 copies of the proposal are available from that 
office or telephone 2024474392

barbara bush capped her springtime round on 
the commencement circuit exhorting black high school graduates to 
remember their most important role model is the man or the woman 
in the mirror 
if you want to make the world a better place take a look at 
yourself and make a change the first lady said quoting a line 
from a michael jackson song at the graduation ceremony wednesday 
at dunbar high school 
she proffered much the same advice about the importance of 
family joie de vivre and altruism that she gave the graduates of 
wellesley college in a nationally televised address june 1 
but if some seniors at that exclusive womens college had 
misgivings about whether president bushs homemaker wife was a 
suitable role model the 287 dunbar graduates gathered in 
constitution hall seemed thrilled to hear from her 
senior class president michael watts said he was proud that 
such an outstanding lady and the first lady of our nation cares 
so much to take the time to encourage motivate and demonstrate to 
us that we can better ourselves 
dunbar once was a showcase school for the district of columbias 
brightest black students in an era of official segregation today 
it is a regular public school in a crimeridden neighborhood 
mrs bush read from the roster of such famous graduates as blood 
plasma pioneer dr charles drew and brig gen benjamin o davis 
and called dunbar one of the most illustrious high schools in the 
country 
she urged the graduates to believe in something bigger than 
yourself get involved in some of the big ideas of our time such 
as cleaning up the environment or fighting hunger and homelessness 
the most important role model you will ever have is the man or 
the woman in the mirror she said if you think you cant you 
wont and if you think you can you will 
she reminded the graduates that life is supposed to be fun 
find the joy in life 
and finally as she told wellesley graduates she admonished the 
dunbar students to put family ahead of career 
however important your obligations as a doctor a lawyer or 
business leader will be you are a son or a daughter first a 
husband or a wife first a mother or a father first she said 
if you decide to have children love them listen to them put 
them first 
mrs bush also was the commencement speaker at southeast 
community college in cumberland ky the university of 
pennsylvania and st louis university last month and she spoke at 
kennebunk high school near her summer home in maine last sunday

it was a rare sight on capitol hill a 
hungarian teaching a texan about horses 
it started when rep tom lantos a hungarianborn democrat from 
california used a hungarian proverb to illustrate to secretary of 
state james a baker iii why the united states should stop its 
dialogue with the palestine liberation organization 
unfortunately it backfired 
it seems to me that there comes a point where we cannot square 
the circle and our desire to continue the dialogue with the plo 
and our desire to live up to our own commitments and fight 
terrorism conflict lantos said at a hearing of the house foreign 
affairs committee 
the united states has threatened to cut off the dialogue begun 
in 1988 because of a thwarted attack by a plo faction on an israeli 
beach may 30 
as an old hungarian proverb says you cant ride two horses 
with one rear end and i believe that thats really what we have 
been attempting to do for some time and if you think about it 
thats an awkward posture lantos said 
ive never seen two horses with only one rear end responded 
baker a houston lawyerturnedpolitician 
no riding the rider has to have one rear end lantos 
tried to explain 
i understand said baker laughing 
but lantos wasnt sure 
two separate horses one rider he insisted 
i understand one rear end i was only baker said before 
being interrupted 
ok i just want to be sure

the white house says moscows easing of 
economic pressure on lithuania is a positive step but doesnt go 
far enough 
its better than doing nothing presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said its not the ultimate objective 
even so the administration clearly was pleased by an 
announcement wednesday that the kremlin would restore 15 percent of 
lithuanias natural gas supplies the fuel and other raw materials 
were cut off april 18 to pressure lithuania to abandon its drive to 
secede from the soviet union 
the crisis over lithuania has emerged as a major stumbling block 
in ussoviet relations bush has called on the soviet union to 
lift the sanctions and conduct a dialogue with leaders of 
lithuania as well as the other baltic republics of estonia and 
latvia 
bush told a news conference it was good news that soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev had met tuesday with the leaders of 
three baltic states 
i hope that what we saw is a first step in a dialogue that 
will lead to the selfdetermination that we strongly support he 
said 
the president did not comment on the easing of the economic 
sanctions but his national security adviser brent scowcroft 
said its encouraging 
on capitol hill senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said i am hopeful that the soviet union will lift its 
economic blockade against lithuania and i welcome soviet steps 
toward that end both sides should exert every effort to ensure 
that negotiations are conducted in an equitable and respectful 
manner 
however sen alfonse damato rny said i think 15 
percent is a slap in the face youre trifling with people the 
embargo remains in place 
fitzwater said the administration still wants a full lifting of 
the embargo 
our role is to nurture this process toward a dialogue that 
will result in selfdetermination he said fitzwater said the 
easing of the embargo was a positive step how significant it is 
we dont know it may not be a big step 
lithuanian officials said moscow offered to lift the embargo 
only if they agreed to stop implementing the march 11 declaration 
of independence for the duration of negotiations over the future of 
the lithuania 
at his news conference bush said the united states hopes for a 
peaceful resolution of this confrontation one that will result 
in dialogue negotiation in lifting of this economic blockade 
against lithuania 
referring to gorbachevs meeting with the baltic leaders he 
said i dont want to overstate it but i was very very pleased 
to see this occur in the wake of what i think was a successful 
summit meeting 
the reporters representing newspapers outside of washington 
also quizzed bush on several other subjects including offshore oil 
drilling and the fate of the northern spotted owl 
bush said his longdelayed decision on restricting oil drilling 
off the coasts of florida and california would be made within days 
he said he wanted to make sure he had all the information he 
needs were still getting opinions the president said its 
a very hot item as you know 
bush said protection of the northern spotted owl under the 
endangered species act left him very much concerned about the 
potential loss of jobs 
vast tracts of forest in the pacific northwest would be shut to 
timber operations if the owl is deemed endangered and bush said 
the law gives the administration very limited control in making 
such a determination 
on another subject the president said the soviet union should 
stop subsidizing the government of cuba which he said receives 5 
billion a year 
if that totalitarian and brutal society were not propped up by 
an enormous subsidy from the soviet union i have every reason to 
believe that cuban people would have a right to achieve the freedom 
that other countries have achieved he said

composers and publishers are making a 
lastditch effort in congress to ban us sale of tape recorders 
that can make nearperfect copies of musical recordings 
with foreign manufacturers poised to introduce socalled digital 
audio tape or dat recorders this summer a group of music 
publishers writers and composers urged a senate panel wednesday to 
reject legislation that would allow the machines to be sold if they 
incorporated anticopying technology 
the bill before the senate commerce communications subcommittee 
sponsored by sen dennis deconcini dariz would require 
manufacturers to install computerchip technology called a serial 
copy management system on dat machines this system would allow a 
user to copy a compact disc onto as many digital audio tapes as 
desired but the tapes could not be copied 
the bill is based upon an agreement reached in athens last year 
between manufacturers and record companies but songwriters and 
composers who like musicians earn a percentage of the price of 
each recording sold in stores complained that their interests were 
disregarded 
the artists believe the virtually perfect copying ability of dat 
machines will make them more popular than todays relatively 
inferior tape recording systems that use analog technology to 
duplicate sound waves digital taping use the 0s and 1s of computer 
language to recreate sound 
artists claim the bill for the first time would legalize home 
copying a gray area of copyright law that congress increasingly 
is being pressed to resolve through legislation 
george david weiss representing the copyright coalition said 
the bill forces songwriters to give away copies of our music 
without payment of any kind 
manufacturers say these claims are unfounded and that home 
taping actually stimulates record sales 
however the artists found sympathy wednesday from several 
subcommittee members including the panels chairman sen daniel 
inouye dhawaii 
the time has come for the people who create to get a piece of 
the action inouye said 
a move for quick passage of the senate dat bill hit another snag 
wednesday when a recording industry executive said he wanted to 
hold talks with manufacturers on a new technology called digital 
compact cassette 
the new compact cassette machines from philips consumer 
electronics will record and play both digital and analog tapes 
jay berman president of the recording industry association of 
america said the philips machine had not been discussed in athens 
and he wanted to talk to manufacturers about it 
he suggested an amendment to the senate bill that would allow 
the commerce secretary to bring such new technology under the 
proposed dat law 
berman said 380 million blank tapes are sold in this country 
each year and that home taping costs record companies at least 1 
billion in lost sales annually but he said japanese manufacturers 
oppose a royalty system for copying 
ralph oman us register of copyrights told the hearing that 
because of the unresolved issues on dat it is questionable 
whether it will ever be mass produced 
edward murphy president of the national music publishers 
association said the coalition had asked commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher and us trade representative carla hills to look at 
the dat problem 
he also said the coalition still was considering suing to block 
imports of dat machines

a house vote on a proposed constitutional 
amendment to ban flag burning is likely to be close even though a 
powerful subcommittee is recommending against tampering with the 
bill of rights 
i dont want to see it change and become america the land of 
the free as long as you agree that loses me rep pat 
schroeder dcolo said wednesday as the plan emerged with an 
adverse recommendation from the house judiciary subcommittee on 
constitutional and civil rights 
supporters said the flag deserves special protection it 
represents all that america stands for embodies all that 
american means rep craig james rfla told the subcommittee 
the panel voted 53 to send the proposed amendment to the 
judiciary committee with an adverse recommendation 
the adverse label is guaranteed to have little or no impact 
as the measure races toward the floor where both sides say the real 
decision will be made 
five subcommittee democrats all critics of the amendment voted 
in favor of sending it forward with the adverse recommendation 
three republicans voted against because they wanted a 
favorable recommendation 
plans call for a house floor vote as soon as the amendment 
clears the judiciary committee perhaps as early as next week 
both sides say the vote is likely to be close 
house speaker thomas foley dwash says he plans to break 
custom and participate in the vote aides said wednesday that in 
the year he has been speaker he has voted only once on nov 16 for 
a governmental ethics bill 
as much as i deplore and decry flag burning much as i am 
alienated and annoyed and repulsed by it as are other americans 
this is not a time when we should rush to tamper with the most 
sacred political document of our countrys tradition foley told 
reporters on tuesday 
supporters are openly threatening to use this falls campaign 
season to bombard critics with television ads in a rerun of the 
flagwaving politics of the 1988 presidential campaign 
to become part of the constitution the measure would have to 
win twothirds majorities in both houses and approval in 38 state 
legislatures 
retired supreme court chief justice warren e burger who has 
cautioned against amending the constitution declined to give 
advice to his former colleagues or anyone else on the subject as he 
appeared with barbara bush on the white house lawn along with 
students who won a poster contest honoring the constitution 
retired justices shouldnt have any thoughts as to what 
present justices should do burger said 
the proposed amendment will not come under senate scrutiny until 
june 21 when judiciary chairman joseph r biden jr ddel plans 
a hearing 
i dont think its going to be an overwhelming vote but we 
will get the twothirds said rep james sensenbrenner rwis 
subcommittee chairman don edwards dcalif a leading opponent of 
the amendment merely said it would be very close 
the amendment would allow the federal government and the states 
to pass laws outlawing desecration of the flag 
the supreme court on monday threw out last years statute 
barring flag mutilation saying it violated the right to free 
speech 
edwards was asked if democratic critics were hurrying the 
measure to the floor to head off lobbying campaigns by supporters 
we ought to get it behind us so we can go on with the 
countrys business he replied 
edwards told of passing out copies of the constitution to 
students in prague recently and how eagerly those young people 
snatched up the document 
i hate to think that id have to stand before the same 
students and say yes heres the bill of rights but weve just 
weakened it weve just mutilated it edwards said

when the saints come marching in southern 
baptist evangelists hope a few bourbon street regulars will be 
among them 
the bluesuited evangelists who have been attending a convention 
by day descended into the notorious french quarter at night 
wednesday to distribute bibles and religious tracts outside such 
places as le booze bar and the orgy 
i was here eight years ago and bourbon street was still 
bourbon street not one thing has changed said glen harlin of 
odessa texas our witnessing may not have an effect on the 
atmosphere of this part of the city this street but it will 
affect the individuals we reached 
the more than 40000 southern baptists in the city for their 
annual meeting this week have proved to be a mixed blessing 
bar owners for example were singing the blues 
i think they ought to go back to where they belong said 
cw williams as he stood idle in one of the doorway bars along 
bourbon street its the worst week ive had since december 
tourism officials said the baptists nevertheless are filling 
hotel rooms and restaurants during a traditionally slow period 
they might not be the highest ticket items but theyre 
certainly a boost at this time of year said beverly gianna 
spokeswoman for the greater new orleans tourist commission we 
love them anyway 
so do those assigned to keep the peace in the french quarter 
john laine a security guard said things are a lot quieter on 
bourbon street since the baptists came to town 
it makes things a lot easier for us he said 
still the scattered evangelists along bourbon street only 
served as a reminder of the dismal business being done this week by 
the strip joints and bars in what one southern baptist referred to 
as the edge of hell 
jim monaghan owner of mollys at the market said he and other 
bar owners would prefer a convention of auto dealers were 
looking for twofisted hard drinkers he said 
a woman who gave her name only as bunny said a group of baptists 
insulted her and other dancers at the bourbon burlesque club 
i think they should stay out of our club she said 
jay strack president of the conference of southern baptist 
evangelists said he was able to reach an amiable agreement with a 
youth trying to con him into paying 30 for a shoeshine 
i said would you settle for 5 and i wont preach to you 
more than 15 minutes he said its a deal 
before he went to bourbon street on wednesday strack challenged 
thousands of church workers attending the conference of southern 
baptist evangelists to distribute 10000 new testaments and 
religious tracts on city streets 
strack who said he was physically and sexually abused as a 
child and once participated in the seamier side of life in the 
french quarter said it is important for baptists to evangelize in 
such places 
i think one of the things thats happening to a lot of 
southern baptists is were against those sins but not against 
those people he said 
some doubted whether visiting religious groups such as the 
southern baptists would have any lasting impact 
they think theyll go down there and convert a few pimps and 
prostitutes and drunken people but theyve done it before and it 
hasnt worked said the rev robert fisher of st augustine 
catholic church and it probably wont work now

not everyone in the town of 10000 was happy with the 
intrusive political statement as resident gloria stier put it 
in omaha neb merchants said flag sales have been booming 
since the supreme court ruling 
a lot of it has to do with the flag controversy paul 
cullen sales manager at cosgrave church goods said tuesday 
cullen said the store sold 40 flags in two days this week 
compared to just five on an average day although sales increase 
around memorial day and the fourth of july he said customers

flags for flag day said dave anderson owner of anderson catholic

secretary of state james a baker iii wants to 
discuss elements of a final settlement of world war ii at a major 
meeting in berlin june 22 a state department official says 
baker will meet with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
and their counterparts from france britain and east and west 
germany 
raymond gh seitz assistant secretary for european affairs 
said at a house foreign affairs subcommittee hearing wednesday that 
baker will not present a draft treaty 
he said possible topics include the principles that will guide 
the resolution of the borders issue of germany part of that 
affects the polish question of course 
and secondly there will be an effort to at least have a 
discussion of the elements that would make up a final settlement 
poland is eager to have a reaffirmation of germanys present 
eastern border to forestall any future claim by a united germany of 
territory that is now polish 
seitz said the united states wants to terminate the rights of 
the four victors of world war ii over germany such as their 
occupation of berlin 
that would be part of the final settlement he added 
our belief is that the victors rights ought to be 
terminated as quickly as possible and probably at the time of 
german unification he said 
the united states would then recognize the unification though it 
may not be legally necessary he said explaining that was because 
the united states already recognizes west germany as the successor 
state to adolf hitlers third reich which included both east and 
west germany 
earlier in the day baker outlined to the full foreign affairs 
committee his ideas on a settlement 
it would be counterproductive to perpetuate a special status 
for germany or to prolong any limitations on german sovereignty 
he said 
discriminatory limitations could only sow the seeds for future 
instability for this reason we are opposed to using these 
discussions to put limits on strictly german military 
capabilities 
he added that limits could be discussed at different 
negotiations at the same time as other confidence building 
measures such measures are usually discussed at the conference 
on security and cooperation in europe they include advance notice 
of military maneuvers arrangements for foreign officers to observe 
them and other ways to assure governments that they will not be the 
victims of a surprise attack 
many europeans see csce as the major security organization of 
the future it includes the united states canada the soviet union 
and 32 european governments seitz said that at its meeting in 
copenhagen denmark last week the united states approved observer 
status for albania the only european government which has not 
joined 
seitz told the subcommittee that baker would support making the 
conference into an international organization with a permanent 
headquarters an aide told a reporter that germans would like to 
see the headquarters in berlin while czechoslovaks are pushing for 
their capital

congressional democrats are likely to react 
negatively if the bush administration tries to use highlevel 
budget talks to help shield the space agency from spending cuts 
officials said wednesday that the white house will ask 
congressional negotiators at the talks to give special treatment to 
the space program which is one of president bushs top domestic 
priorities 
but following the latest session of the bargaining on wednesday 
democrats said opposition was likely if the administration wants 
its favorite programs singled out for protection from budget 
slashes 
weve had a lot of committee chairmen who say hey i want 
mine protected as well said sen wyche fowler dga a budget 
negotiator 
officials speaking on condition they not be identified said the 
white house would propose that negotiators work out a specific 
spending figure for next years budget for the national aeronautics 
and space administration 
in budget summits of past years administration and 
congressional officials agreed to a single spending amount covering 
thousands of domestic programs including nasa the budgets for 
individual agencies were then determined by congress during the 
regular legislative process 
bush would thus greatly enhance his role in determining nasas 
budget if it is negotiated directly between white house and 
congressional negotiators 
that would be important to the administration because congress 
does not want to increase the space agencys budget by as much as 
the president would like 
the administrations proposal to consider nasa separately would 
also leave the thousands of remaining domestic programs vulnerable 
to cuts that may be agreed to by budget bargainers negotiators are 
looking for ways to shrink next years federal deficit by 45 
billion to 60 billion 
in his budget for fiscal 1991 beginning oct 1 bush proposed 
giving nasa 152 billion a 24 percent increase over this years 
123 billion that was the largest increase requested for any of 
the governments major agencies 
the exploration of space has benefits for the united states 
that go far beyond the quantifiable the president said in the 
budget plan he presented in january 
the democraticcontrolled congress has been less generous with 
the space agency 
nasa would receive 14 billion next year under a spending 
blueprint approved in may by the house a separate plan developed 
by the senate budget committee last month would give the agency 
142 billion

a senatepassed bill to restrict logging in 
americas largest national forest will make the united states 
better able to argue for protection of rain forests elsewhere in 
the world a leading sponsor says 
no longer are we going to be embarrassed about what were 
doing in the tongass sen timothy e wirth dcolo said after 
the senate voted 990 wednesday to approve the tongass timber 
reform act 
the bill would ban logging on more than 670000 acres of 
oldgrowth timber in the 17millionacre alaskan forest which 
besides being the largest us forest is the largest remaining rain 
forest in the temperate zone 
the rain forest larger than west virginia shelters bald 
eagles grizzly bears and prime salmonspawning grounds but it 
also sustains a logging industry that provides 3400 jobs and 
sustains 25 percent of the economy in southeastern alaska the 
states two senators argued 
sponsors say the bill was needed because too much timber was 
being cut from the public land and taxpayers were receiving too 
little in fees because of old exclusive contracts favorable to the 
logging industry 
sens frank h murkowski and ted stevens ralaska said they 
supported the senate compromise version over a stricter version 
passed by the house the white house has also endorsed the senate 
bill which must be reconciled with the house version in 
negotiations 
the vote came after senators set aside a disputed amendment that 
would have required the us forest service to trade mining rights 
in the greens creek area of admiralty island in southeastern alaska 
the exchange with the nativealaskan owned sealaska corp would 
have given the government other mining rights and land including 
the last 6000 acres of oldgrowth timber on admiralty island 
under an agreement worked out among senators the secretary of 
agriculture will try to speed up negotiations on a voluntary land 
and miningrights trade also the senate energy and commerce 
committee will hold hearings beginning june 28 to determine if the 
items to be traded are of comparable value 
the senate bill would modify rather than cancel two existing 
timber sale contracts canceling the exclusive contracts with the 
alaska pulp co and louisiana pacificketchikan would require the 
government to pay higher compensation payments to the two 
companies the office of management and budget says 
besides setting aside protected areas and modifying the major 
contracts the senate bill would eliminate a timber harvest quota 
of 45 billion board feet each decade instead the harvest will be 
more actively managed by the forest service 
wirth and others argued that the current contract enabled the 
two companies to cut only the highest grade timber and sell it at 
below market prices 
the bill also prohibits logging in socalled buffer zones along 
spawning streams

a 158 billion foreign aid bill for the 
coming year includes new penalties aimed at discouraging the world 
bank from making loans to china for anything other than basic human 
needs 
the house appropriations foreign aid subcommittee approved the 
sanctions on a voice vote late wednesday saying the united states 
must hold back its share of any amount lent to china beginning this 
year from whatever contributions it normally would make to the 
world lender 
us contributions amount to about 20 percent of money the world 
bank lends and the gesture underscored congress continuing 
impatience over what it sees as an inadequate american response to 
chinas bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators a year ago 
this provides the bank some incentive not to go forward with 
these loans said rep matthew mchugh dnj sponsor of the 
amendment if they disregard it inevitably we are going to be 
talking about heavier punishment next year 
two weeks ago the world bank approved a 300 million loan for a 
treeplanting program the largest approved since the crackdown in 
and around tiananmen square that brought the total of loans 
approved for china since the massacre to 440 million 
the overall foreign aid bill for the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 seeks to begin what subcommittee chairman david obey 
dwis called an adjustment of foreign aid to new world realities 
it would shift some 200 million from funds the administration had 
sought for military aid to support the political and economic 
reforms in eastern europe 
rep mickey edwards rokla sought and failed to boost the 
military aid total from 38 billion to 41 billion to bring it 
closer to this years 425 billion and to the nearly 5 billion 
sought by president bush 
the threat to the west is not from soviet tanks obey argued 
in a vehement rebuttal but from the possibility that soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs reform efforts could fail the 
world has changed he said 
for eastern europe the bill would provide 430 million for 
economic development of countries undergoing the transition to 
market economies and 70 million for the european bank for 
reconstruction and development 
the bank contribution would be made contingent on forgiveness of 
what obey termed uncollectable debts owed by poland to foreign 
creditors primarily in west germany 
the subcommittee also moved to grant to pakistan another 
oneyear waiver of a requirement that it refrain from developing 
nuclear weapons in order to be eligible for us aid but even 
pakistans supporters abandoned what one lawmaker called a 
longrunning charade that the weapons do not exist 
rather than contend that pakistan does not possess nuclear 
weapons as supporters have in the past rep charles wilson 
dtexas argued that the country has not detonated one 
the bill also includes a provision that would withhold half of 
el salvadors expected 85 million in military aid and make further 
cuts or release of the withheld amount dependent on the progress of 
peace talks between the government and the leftist rebels who have 
waged a 10year civil war 
that provision was seen primarily as an incentive for the bush 
administration to resume discussions with congressional democrats 
aimed at finding a new bipartisan policy toward el salvador where 
70000 have died in the decade of fighting 
the bill also would reduce the aid now flowing to turkey and 
greece to 400 million and 280 million respectively turkey is 
getting 500 million this year and greece 350 million

injured 
so they went to visit friends on wednesday night to describe 
their miraculous escape driving home at 2 am they found 
themselves behind a speeding stolen car and in front of a pursuing 
police cruiser 
as elchaar pulled over to get out of the officers way the 
driver of the stolen car dodged traffic skidded on wet pavement 
and veered across several lanes to make a turn 
he nearly collected us said ms hopwood 20 
the stolen car stopped shortly afterward and police arrested

throughout the city the smell of 
burned paint mixed with the odor of gasoline fumes recalling a day 
and night of violent clashes between police and antigovernment 
protesters 
the streets were no longer so crowded 
still about 400 progovernment demonstrators just as many 
soldiers and police occupied victory square in front of government 
headquarters early today 
they had responded to a call by presidentelect ion iliescu to 
protect the building and were backed by armored personnel 
carriers 
government supporter alexandru nicolae was diverting cars from 
the square much the same way people did during the december 
revolution that toppled nicolae ceausescu he said his people had 
to be very careful 
we apprehended someone who was about to set the cars parked 
here on fire and shouted death to communists is this 
democracy he asked 
dan iosif a leader of iliescus ruling national salvation 
front announced over a loudspeaker that workers would come from 
various counties including 27 trainloads of miners to protect the 
government 
the square was rather quiet 
not so at television headquarers where cordons of soldiers 
blocked the entrance and ambulances went in and out taking injured 
people to the hospital 
they provoked us and we planned not to answer back but when 
they hurt our colonel we could not take it any more said a 
steelhelmeted soldier at the gate 
at a different part of the station about 200 demonstrators 
threw stones and firebombs the protesters accuse state television 
of biased programming and have demanded that an independent station 
be established 
someone poured water down from the upper floors to keep the fire 
under control but the demonstrators persisted and every time a 
bottle touched the wall or a window the crowd gave a loud 
hurrah 
later the army advanced far enough to make the 
firebombthrowing impossible 
the situation took a more dramatic turn at the devastated police 
headquarters where demonstrators threw firebombs at soldiers and 
two tanks which fired lengthy rounds to repel them 
it was impossible to get too close to the building because of 
the firing demonstrators had earlier ransacked the headquarters 
and set it ablaze along with cars and other vehicles parked nearby 
finally it was back to university square where the violence 
started before dawn wednesday when police cleared a square where 
anticommunist demonstrators had held out and blocked traffic for 
53 days 
with the pro and antigovernment demonstrators scattered in 
different parts of the capital the square was very peaceful only 
about 50 people were there along with charred buses trucks and 
cars 
nearby streets looked like they had been through a civil war 
thousands of bits of shattered glass tracks on the asphalt from 
passing tanks a big pool of blood on a boulevard traces of 
gasoline from the firebombs 
asked what the few people in the square thought they were going 
to do next marian falticeanu shrugged his shoulders lets wait 
and see what the new morning brings he said

when lt kobori of the japanese imperial 
army died in the arms of his pregnant thai wife blase teenagers 
and staid society matrons alike confessed to breaking down in tears 
and millions of other thais were left with images of the 
japanese very different from those they previously held the 
fanatical samuraistyle warriors of world war ii or todays 
aggressive economic leaders 
since january the thai public has become addicted to a 
serialized tv drama called khuu kam or starcrossed 
lovers the series ended last weekend bangkoks notorious 
traffic jams thinned when episodes were broadcast and social 
engagements often were canceled senior government officials have 
reportedly cut meetings short in order not to miss the program 
fans wrote the producers pleading for a change to the tragic 
ending others proposed marriage to the stars 
the series was based on a still enormously popular novel penned 
by vimol siripaiboon in the late 1960s it tells of a japanese 
officer who falls in love with a thai college undergraduate during 
world war ii 
although kobori carries his army sword even into the bedroom he 
is willing to do anything for his love even neglect some of his 
soldierly duties angsumalin the thai woman hides her own strong 
feelings for him out of thai patriotism until the moment kobori 
dies in an allied bombing raid 
thais already have seen the novel adapted twice on the screen 
and twice for television 
the popularity of the latest version has stemmed in large part 
from the appeal of tongchai mcintyre one of thailands top pop 
singers the handsome son of a thai mother and scottish father put 
in a soulful performance 
many thais say the portrayal of the hero is an effective 
antidote to the hardedged image of japanese in thailand japanese 
are resented by many thais for their aggressive business dealings 
and what thais see as an attempt to gain an economic stranglehold 
on the country 
one thai who has criticized aspects of japanese behavior is 
mechai viravaiyda a leading development expert and former actor 
who portrayed kobori in the first adaptation in 1969 
this is very very good public relations for the japanese 
he said but if you look at koboris character this type of 
japanese has yet to be born 
with koboris notions about the heart being more important 
than flag and country he would have been put in jail or at least 
given a lowranking job in a japanese corporation mechai said 
some in the large japanese community here agree that khuu 
kam makes for some of the best public relations for japanese in 
years 
but some have reportedly taken offense at a scene in which 
kobori releases an american prisoner of war as well as depictions 
of japanese soldiers as lax and rude 
nonetheless it is unlikely that such a basically sympathetic 
portrayal would be featured in countries like south korea the 
philippines indonesia and other asian countries which suffered at 
the hands of the japanese army in the last world war 
thailands wartime experience was mixed the japanese army was 
allowed to use thai territory to invade neighboring burma and in 
1942 bangkok declared war on the allies 
the thai ambassador in washington however refused to deliver 
the declaration and started an antijapanese free thai 
movement as the war drew to an end the japanese in thailand became 
increasingly harsher but many were unaffected 
some of thailands wealthiest families owe their fortunes to 
dealings with the japanese 
among most thais today khuu kam evokes emotion rather than 
history 
ive read the book several times and every time i have to 
cry said pharadee narkkarphunchiwan an office administrator 
her father she said was due to have an eye cataract operation but 
postponed it so he could watch the final episode

and friday he said producer prices for may are scheduled to be 
released later thursday with consumer prices for may and trade for 
april due friday

weakness in new york overnight 
masato hayashi a bank of tokyo trader said a rumor that the 
bank of japan sold dollars in the sydney market prompted selling of 
the us currency in tokyo 
yuichi tsuchiko a dealer with fuji bank said the dollars 
decline resulted from market players buying the yen in exchange for 
the british pound to take profits on the pounds recent

new or remodeled chemical plants will have to 
meet tighter standards to cut the release of smogproducing 
compounds under new environmental protection agency rules 
the agency also announced new requirements wednesday for 1400 
hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities that 
should cut emissions by 76 percent 
the synthetic organic chemical industry will need to spend 385 
million initially to comply with the new antismog rules designed 
to cut emissions by 30 percent and will bear an additional 216 
million in annual costs the agency said in a statement 
the rules require use of best demonstrated technology for 
air oxidation distillation and reactor processes involving 
production of more than 200 chemicals 
the epa estimates the rules will reduce the emissions of 
smogforming volatile organic compounds by 58000 tons per year on 
equipment built or substantially modified since 1983 
about 70 percent of the 3300 plants likely to be affected by 
the new rules are in texas louisiana and new jersey 
the hazardous waste rules are supposed to cut emissions by about 
28000 tons per year from all affected installations no matter 
when built complying with the rules will cost the industry 128 
million to 151 million initially and then 33 million to 46 
million per year the epa said 
in many cities waste treatment plants are major sources of air 
pollution because chemicals stripped out of the sewage stream are 
released into the atmosphere

ive come to realize that i cannot neglect the spiritual side of 
my life that is i take one day at a time i must take it with god 
as my guide 
now is a time for healing for me personally and for you 
politically and whatever i can do to help you heal im willing to 
do it im willing to go to any lengths 
my supporters and political polls have indicated that if i were 
to run i could win but what good does it do to win the battle if 
in the process i lose my soul and in my heart i believe its time 
for me to serve you and god in other ways 
therefore tonight im announcing that marion barry would not be 
a candidate for reelection for my fourth term 
im proud to say to you tonight with the grace of god and a 
good treatment program today is my 145th day clean of any 
chemicals for some thats a short time for those of us in the 
recovery community its a long time i continue to try to keep 
this achievement one day at a time 
in terms of my decision i know many of you probably feel that 
my decision not to seek reelection is the wrong thing for me to 
do but i hope that you will let go of your strong feelings and 
believe that my announcement tonight is the best thing for me 
personally best for my family that is my wife and son but 
also for my beloved city that i respect so deeply 
i prayed on this and i think its the best decision 
let me say to you in strong terms this decision is not related 
to my legal situation it is related to my recovery and to what i 
know is best for my wife and son whove suffered so long in this 
ordeal 
the candidates whove announced for political offices in the 
district particularly those who are running for mayor have not 
been able to address the issues to the full time and attention of 
you all because of the distraction that my personal situation has 
caused 
i want to assure you though that even though im not seeking 
reelection im not abandoning my commitment to the city ive not 
forsaken you ive been reminded over and over that god is not 
through with me yet and in my heart i believe its time for me to 
serve god and you in other ways

believe it or not ripleys plans to 
feature in its new museum the smashed car in which a 57yearold 
man survived for 89 hours in the rubble of an earthquakeflattened 
oakland freeway 
buck helm the burly oakland longshoreman who survived without 
food or water was rescued on oct 21 but died less than a month 
later of respiratory failure 
ripleys believe it or not said wednesday that displaying the 
smashed chevy sprint at its new buena park museum would be a 
tribute to helms heroism the museum opens in august 
dubbed lucky bucky helm gave hope to weary rescuers and 
came to symbolize human indomitability said edward meyers vice 
president for exhibits and archives for ripley entertainment inc 
in toronto 
thats the whole angle a memorial to the will to survive one 
mans heroism amid widespread devastation he said 
helms car will be displayed amid twisted metal bars and actual 
pieces of the freeway to offer a sense of what it was like in the 
tiny pocket of rubble meyers said 
until two weeks ago helms car had been stored with 55 other 
vehicles towed from the fallen freeway at an auto yard in east 
oakland 
helms exwife lorrie helm donated the car to ripleys in 
december she said she she hoped the exhibit would be a reminder of 
natures fury and of the alleged faulty construction that led to 
the freeway collapse 
because of buck and all the people who died there should be 
something out there to remind us that it could happen again she 
said 
the quake that struck northern california on oct 17 had a 
magnitude of 71 on the richter scale killed 67 people and caused 
an estimated 7 billion in damage

government troops backed by helicopter 
gunships artillery and thousands of reinforcements fought fierce 
battles with tamil rebels today in the embattled north and east 
witnesses and officials said 
the governments latest bid to end the fighting collapsed when 
rebel leaders said they were unwilling to come to the strifetorn 
eastern town of batticaloa for talks said deputy defense minister 
ranjan wijeratne 
defense secretary gen cyril ranatunge told a news conference 
that government troops were launching aerial attacks against the 
rebels in batticaloa 
in such a situation there should be civilian casualties he 
said 
so far at least 90 government troops rebels and civilians are 
believed to have died in four days of fighting the worst violence 
since negotiations began between the government and the dominant 
rebel tiger militia in may 1989 
one unconfirmed report said tiger rebels also killed 125 to 150 
policemen who were among 600 officers captured by the tigers when 
they overran 11 police stations monday 
the bloodshed has raised the specter of a return to the allout 
war between tigers and government forces that prevailed before 
india sent thousands of peacekeeping troops to sri lanka in july 
1987 
india withdrew its forces in march on sri lankas request after 
an unsuccessful 32month effort to disarm the tigers 
tamil rebels have been fighting for more political autonomy in 
sri lanka since 1983 they claim they are discriminated against by 
the majority sinhalese tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people while sinhalese make up 75 percent 
today residents of vavuniya 135 miles north of colombo said 
tamil tiger rebels continued their seige on police stations in the 
east and northwest vavuniya was the only northern town reachable 
by telephone from colombo 
residents said government troops using helicopter gunships 
artillery and reinforcements were repulsing attacks by the rebels 
they said the rebels lost at least 15 men in an abortive attack 
on the kilinochchi garrison 45 miles north of vavuniya two 
defending soldiers were also killed 
wijeratne described the fighting as fierce but said that did 
not mean the government had closed the doors on negotiations 
still the prospect for a quick settlement appeared bleak a 
ceasefire announced tuesday night for wednesday was ignored and 
the government has rushed about 4500 fresh troops to the region 
wijeratne said that while president ranasinghe premadasa hoped 
to resolve the problem through discussions military steps were 
being taken to protect lives and government property 
he said he was confident government troops would defeat the 
tigers if war again broke out 
the tigers took virtual control of the northeastern districts 
after indian peacekeeping forces withdrew 
at least 11000 people including 1200 indian soldiers have 
been killed in the tamil war since it started in 1983 another 
6000 have been killed since 1987 in a backlash to tamil demands 
whipped up by ultranationalist sinhalese guerrillas

the government said today that the 
fundamentalist islamic opposition has won a clear majority of seats 
in algerias municipal and provincial elections 
the fundamentalist victory in the countrys first multiparty 
elections since independence from france in 1962 was the first 
outright election victory for an islamic fundamentalist party in 
any arab country 
in neighboring tunisia and morocco which have refused to 
recognize the fundamentalists as political parties leaders 
expressed fears that the apparent success of extremism in algeria 
would eventually affect all the countries of northern africa 
in france the ruling socialist party called the fundamentalist 
victory cause for deep concern it cited the fact that numerous 
women had their right to vote confiscated by their fathers or 
husbands 
under the islamic family code men can vote on behalf of their 
wives or daughters without their permission 
sheikh abassi madani president of the victorious islamic 
liberation front thanked the algerian people and government 
wednesday for the high level of political maturity that made 
his victory in tuesdays voting possible 
he demanded the dissolution of the national peoples assembly 
to be followed by legislative elections but he stopped short of 
asking for the resignation of president chadli bendjedid 
national elections are now scheduled for february 1992 the 
government had no immediate response to abassi madanis demand 
the ruling national liberation front for 28 years algerias 
only political party had been widely expected to win because of 
its grip on government machinery and the media as well as its 
greater financial resources it holds every seat in parliament 
but the official algerian news agency said today that with a 
third of the official results tabulated including those from most 
of the large cities the 16monthold islamic salvation front had 
won by absolute or relative majorities 
earlier interior minister mohamed salah mohamedi told reporters 
the fundamentalists had won 327 seats of the first 612 races 
tabulated the ruling party was running second with 208 seats 
the french news agency agence francepresse citing sources 
said the fundamentalists captured councils in algerias four 
largest cities algiers oran constantine and annaba and swept 
45 of the 48 provincial councils 
final official results were expected this evening 
abassi madani dismissed as incidental the decision of two of 
algerias major political parties to call for a boycott of the 
elections 
however it was the boycott by former president ahmed ben 
bellas movement for democracy in algeria and berber leader ait 
ahmeds front of socialist forces that made the fundamentalist 
victory possible 
the average total of abstentions was above 45 percent the 
highest in any algerian election since the end of colonial rule in 
the kabylie region which is ait ahmeds homeland average voter 
participation was less than 15 percent 
the parties urged the boycott because they feared the balloting 
was rigged in favor of the ruling party they also objected to the 
short period of time they were given to prepare for the ballot 
the boycott weighed heavily in the islamic fundamentalist 
victory the state news agency said 
officials of all parties complained wednesday of widespread 
irregularities including multiple voting missing ballots and 
interference at polling places by outsiders and election officials 
it was not clear exactly what the impact of the fundamentalist 
victory would be in algeria a country of 24 million 
politically most major decisions are made by the central 
government local councils cannot for example impose islamic law 
on a local basis 
but the victory clearly has emboldened the fundamentalists who 
are now likely to operate as a governmentinwaiting and expect 
their demands will be taken seriously 
socially the victory is likely to make algerians concentrate 
more on the issue of what kind of society they want 
nonfundamentalists are likely to realize they will need to become 
more active and organized if they want stop the fundamentalists 
advance 
abassi madani a 59yearold philosophy professor denied his 
movement wishes to turn the country into a oneparty religious 
state we guarantee the freedom of all who have ideas on 
algerias future he said 
the islamic salvation front seeks to establish the islamic legal 
code the sharia as law the party assigns women to a subservient 
role none of the fronts 12000 candidates for office in tuesdays 
voting were women 
for months fundamentalist supporters have been accused of 
harassing single women and disrupting nightclubs in algiers 
the party boasts 650000 members many are drawn from the ranks 
of unemployed youth who are attracted by the partys fiery mix of 
islam and politics 
the national liberation front was the sole political party until 
constitutional changes in february 1989 opened the way to competing 
parties 
the party was forced to end its monopoly on power after soldiers 
killed scores of people in october 1988 riots sparked by 
deteriorating economic conditions

the house of commons early today approved 
legislation to allow 50000 heads of households from hong kong and 
their families to enter britain when the colony is handed back to 
china in 1997 
some members of the conservative party fought their governments 
proposal saying it would flood the country with hong kong refugees 
in beijing the chinese government reiterated its objection to 
the plan 
the chinese government has repeatedly expressed its just and 
solemn position and demands with regard to this question foreign 
ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said at a weekly briefing 
now the british side still is pursuing its plans to change the 
citizenship of some chinese citizens in hong kong the british side 
will be held responsible for all the consequences arising 
therefrom she said without elaborating 
in london conservative lawmaker tony marlow said the household 
heads and their families could total 250000 people of different 
culture and ethnic background he said the governments duty was to 
put britain first 
foreign secretary douglas hurd has said he wants key people to 
remain in hong kong after chinese rule he says the best way to 
achieve that is to guarantee them a british passport so they know 
they can always leave 
the house passed the bill by a voice vote sending it for 
consideration to the house of lords the nonelected upper chamber 
of parliament 
the lords can approve the bill amend it with the commons 
approval or reject it rejection which is unusual would probably 
result in the government trying to reintroduce the proposal with a 
new bill 
under an agreement with britain the colony on chinas 
southeastern coast reverts to chinese rule in 1997 china has 
pledged to retain hong kongs capitalistic and legal systems for 50 
years after the takeover but fear has mounted in the territory 
that beijing may renege on its promises 
those fears grew deeper after the chinese governments bloody 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in beijing one year ago in 
which troops killed hundreds of unarmed civilians 
former conservative party chairman norman tebbit led opposition 
to the bill and tried with other tories to persuade legislators to 
reduce the number of immigrants from hong kong 
labor legislators opposed the bill on opposite grounds calling 
it elitist and divisive

the coast guard has tentatively approved 
the experimental use of oileating bacteria on the spill from the 
supertanker mega borg 
state officials had suggested the approach and discussed it 
wednesday with the environmental protection agency coast guard and 
other agencies 
its worth a try anything we can do to clean up the spill 
well try coast guard capt thomas greene said he said 
however he did not consider the technique a major part of the 
cleanup which also involves skimmers booms and chemical 
dispersants 
as the federal onscene coordinator he asked state officials to 
submit a plan today on how they will conduct the test without 
interfering with the salvage efforts in the gulf of mexico 
the process called bioremediation uses naturally occurring 
bacteria to reduce oil to an emulsion of fatty acids this emulsion 
sinks and is consumed by marine life 
bioremediation has been used for years to clean up hazardous 
waste sites treat sewage and wastewater extract oil from tight 
geologic formations and clean some rocks on shore after the exxon 
valdez accident in alaska last year said texas land commissioner 
garry mauro 
but this will be the first time bioremediation has been used in 
the water to clean up an oil spill he said 
now we have the chance to put to real use innovation and new 
technology that can provide all of us with a means to avoid the 
potential environmental devastation of an oil spill mauro said 
greene said the coast guard would provide a boat to scientists 
to apply the sandlike bacteria to the oil slick 
bj buck wynne iii chairman of the texas water commission 
said he expected to mix the bacteria in 100gallon tanks of salt 
water and shoot it through hoses from a coast guard cutter 
wynne and mauro suggested using 100 pounds of the bacteria a day 
for three to four days on freshly spilled oil near the vessel the 
test will cost the state about 50000 mauro said

capt dick tracy of the chicago police 
department loved the movie but he couldnt solve the crime 
i suspected somebody else said tracy after watching the 
movie dick tracy judging from the gasps from the audience 
very few people suspected the culprit 
tracy yes thats really his name was among 500 guests at a 
preview of the movie here wednesday night woodstock was the home 
of chester gould who created the dick tracy comic strip the movie 
opens nationally friday 
it was great said tracy who at 56 is just two years 
younger than the comic strip it had an interesting plot lots of 
action the scenes were uniquely done 
others agreed 
it was fabulous said woodstock resident betty hamilton i 
was never a dick tracy fan but now i am im going to go back and 
read all the comic books 
the cinematography is phenomenal and madonna is great said 
bob billimack a real estate broker from woodstock 
guests paid 100 each for seats at the woodstock opera house 
proceeds will benefit the chester gould memorial library a museum 
planned to commemorate the late cartoonist and his famous 
characters like 88 keys mumbles breathless and pruneface 
blackhaired steelyeyed dick tracy first appeared during the 
depression the first comic strip to deviate from the funnies 
approach and venture into graphic violence 
gould created and knocked off enough bad guys and really bad 
guys for woodstock and the whole country 
i told myself im gonna draw a guy that shoots them 
gould said before his death at age 84 in 1985 it was kind of 
nice to have a cop who would shoot first and ask questions later 
theres plenty of shooting in this fastpaced rock em sock em 
walt disney movie but its not graphic enough to jeopardize the pg 
rating on the other hand madonna playing the sultry speakeasy 
singer breathless has some racy scenes that probably wouldnt make 
the comic pages of a family newspaper 
capt tracy a 34year veteran officer said the flirtatious 
scenes were important 
the fact that dick tracy didnt succumb to that is part of the 
movie warren beatty played the role the way we would like to 
imagine police were in that time at least dick tracy wasnt 
wearing an earring tracy said alluding to two peotone ill 
police officers disciplined recently 
besides madonna was in town and unfortunately she didnt 
crawl around on my desk like that tracy said laughing 
the movie culminated a week of dick tracy days in this town 50 
miles northwest of chicago 
disney officials were adamant that the real premiere with 
stars 3000 invited journalists and all is today at floridas 
walt disney world 
but woodstock mayor jim shoemaker said that showing wont be the 
same youll see brighter red carpet bigger celebrities fancier 
limousines he told jean oconnell goulds daughter who planned 
to travel to orlando for the premiere 
the one thing that orlandos not going to have is 14000 
people who loved your dad dick tracy youre finally home 
shoemaker said his voice choking with emotion

a highly influential cabinet minister is denying he 
blamed japans plunging birthrate on the higher educational levels 
being reached by women news reports and government officials said 
the alleged remark received extensive news coverage and one 
womens leader said finance minister ryutaro hashimoto had no 
understanding of the concept of equality between women and men 
hashimoto was quoted as telling a cabinet meeting tuesday that 
japanese women are having fewer babies in part because more are 
receiving higher educations 
hashimoto acknowledged wednesday that he had called for a review 
of education policies in view of the dropping birthrate but denied 
having singled out womens educational levels kyodo news service 
reported 
i am afraid we will not be able to discuss this matter 
seriously now it quoted him as saying 
a senior administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the government has no intention of denying the 
need for a high academic level for women 
the comments appeared intended to head off further criticism of 
the reported remarks by hashimoto a powerful figure in the 
governing liberal democratic party and a likely future candidate 
for prime minister 
liberal democrats remember the socalled madonna boom in 
last years upper house elections women voters dissatisfied with 
a series of governing party bribery and sex scandals propelled a 
record number of opposition women candidates into office 
last week a government report said only 125 million babies 
were born last year and the average japanese woman had only 157 
children the lowest levels since statistics were first compiled in 
1899 
cabinet members reportedly expressed worry that a lower 
birthrate would result in a smaller work force unable to support 
japans growing number of older people 
hashimoto reportedly was quoted by several cabinet ministers 
including health and welfare minister yuji tsushima as having 
questioned whether all young people needed higher education and 
adding that womens higher education may also be related to the 
matter 
but a health and welfare ministry official denied today that 
tsushima had reported such a comment by hashimoto 
another cabinet minister management and coordination agency 
head jun shiozaki said he had misunderstood and therefore 
misstated hashimotos remarks 
hashimoto has no understanding of the concept of equality 
between women and men said aiko carter secretary of the womens 
committee of the national christian council of japan 
he hasnt learned the real lesson of last years election 
women are advancing in society and its the men who cant keep 
up 
in 1925 the average japanese woman gave birth to 51 children 
the birth rate has dropped since as population pressures have 
compressed housing space average marriage ages have risen costs 
of educating and raising children have climbed and fewer people 
depend on children for support in old age 
in 1989 245 percent of 847153 male high school graduates 
entered universities and 367 percent of 853636 female high school 
graduates entered twoyear or fouryear colleges the education 
ministry says

a woman who falsely accused a man of raping 
her has been ordered to run advertisements apologizing to him 
district judge john murphy also sentenced elizabeth irene 
richardson to six months in jail for perjury 
ms richardson 24 of lexington is sorry about the incident and 
will spend about 1000 fulfilling the judges order friday that 
she run halfpage ads in each newspaper in the county and 10 radio 
spots said her attorney tod mckeone 
ms richardson told authorities she was raped in 1988 by a 
painter who had visited her home inquiring about a job 
gary nitsch 44 of overton was arrested several days later ms 
richardson identified him from a police photo and later testified 
he raped her 
charges against nitsch were dropped in february after ms 
richardson admitted she made the accusation up to get attention 
from her husband charles k kenning a truck driver often away 
from home 
she was desperate to get him back and acted very impulsively 
without giving consideration to the thing and it kind of 
snowballed on her mckeone said wednesday 
nitsch said wednesday that although the judge is letting him 
approve the wording of the ads they wont make a difference 
you cant change a wrong to a right and i think the sentence 
could have been stiffer he said i lost a job i had to get a 
lawyer the kids at school were saying to my kids your dads a 
rapist 
nitsch has sued four sheriffs deputies for 100000 alleging 
they arrested him and searched his home without sufficient cause

a plan that would cut logging by almost half in 
washingtons largest national forest came under attack by 
representatives of the timber industry environmental and landowner 
groups 
the groups said they would appeal various aspects of the plan by 
the us forest service for the mount bakersnoqualmie national 
forest it will determine logging rights there for the next 10 to 
15 years 
the plan revealed wednesday is a major shift in favor of 
recreation and deals a very severe blow to the timber 
industry said doug macwilliams supervisor of the forest 
he told interest group representatives at a briefing the 
proposed 46 percent reduction in timber harvesting would increase 
retail lumber costs and affect 1800 jobs 
although representatives of affected groups had not seen copies 
of the complete plan they said the would appeal the plan was made 
after 10 years of research and debate 
it takes effect 90 days after publication friday the plan can 
be appealed to the forest service 
its not the last action well take on this plan 
macwilliams said 
ted j ladoux director of forestry affairs for northwest 
independent forest manufacturers in tacoma said his group was 
very disappointed by the plan 
by no means do we consider this a balanced plan he said 
whats more they clearly ignored the public sentiment 
ron d morgenthaler of woodinville chairman of the public land 
users society said he felt shock when i look at what it did to 
landowners and public land users 
both said they would appeal 
wilderness society director jean durning said the planners made 
great steps forward in addressing recreational concerns but 
greater logging reductions were needed regardless of an expected 
decision june 23 on the northern spotted owl which could further 
reduce the timber harvest 
under the plan about 95 percent of the roadless acreage would 
remain intact and 97 percent of old growth trees would remain in 
the year 2000 
the plan also calls for construction of 220 miles of trails 
rebuilding of 493 miles and maintenance of 891

hanover a west german industrial city seeking a 
higher international profile was chosen by a onevote margin today 
to be host of expo 2000 an ecologically oriented turnofthe 
century worlds fair 
hanover was selected by the parisbased international bureau of 
expositions in a 2120 vote over toronto canada the only other 
candidate after the italian government decided to drop a campaign 
on behalf of venice 
hanover a northern city of 500000 known for an annual trade 
fair was considered a strong contender because many of the 
exposition bureaus member countries have close economic ties to 
west germany 
the bureaus 43 members who vote by secret ballot include 25 
from europe 11 from the western hemisphere four from africa two 
from asia and one from australia it was not known which two 
members did not vote today 
toronto had argued that it was north americas turn since the 
next two fairs are in europe seville spain in 1992 and 
viennabudapest in 1995 
the bureau formed in 1928 seeks to ensure that contending 
cities have an appropriate site adequate transit government 
backing and enough hotel rooms the winning country then draws up 
final plans and finds sponsors financial and public support 
hanover was the first west german city to contend for the right 
to host an officially sanctioned universal exposition the 
largest type of event overseen by the bureau 
the city has proposed a theme of man nature technology for 
the fair the event is tentatively scheduled to run from june 1 to 
oct 31 providing an estimated 70000 new jobs in the region and 
costing roughly 1 billion 
in the past some cities have backed out as moscow did in the 
1960s clearing the way for canada to play host to its first fair 
in montreal 
late last year canadian prime minister brian mulroney wrote to 
the exposition bureau extolling toronto as a vibrant symbol of 
excellence tolerance humanity and pluralism 
at that time venice was also in the running but the italian 
government withdrew the candidacy earlier this week 
venetians as well as the italian government were divided as to 
whether the expositions estimated 60000 daily visitors would help 
revive the canal city or create unmanageable environmental problems

the partner of a miami police officer convicted of 
manslaughter in two deaths that sparked a race riot was charged 
with lying during her testimony in the trial 
officer dawn campbell 25 was relieved of duty with pay and 
released on her own recognizance wednesday after the dade county 
state attorneys office charged her with two felony counts of 
perjury during a judicial proceeding 
each count is punishable by five years in prison and a 5000 
fine 
prosecutors were openly skeptical of campbells testimony last 
november during the trial of officer william lozano 31 who is 
appealing a sevenyear state prison sentence he was dismissed 
earlier this year 
lozano has said the perjury charges were filed to hurt his 
appeal 
campbell allegedly changed her version about the night lozano 
fatally shot a speeding motorcyclist who crashed the crash killed 
a passenger and the deaths triggered three nights of racial 
violence in january 1989 
lozano is a white officer born in colombia and the two victims 
were black 
campbell testified she was standing in the street and did not 
duck behind her patrol car when lozano fired an affidavit filed 
with the arrest warrant said 
six other witnesses testified she was on the sidewalk and ducked 
during the shooting calling into question her view of the incident 
and her conclusion that lozano fired in selfdefense

a political party made up of former 
communists won the opening round of voting for bulgarias first 
freely elected parliament in more than five decades according to 
final results released today 
the governing socialist party formerly known as the communist 
party won the most seats in the 400seat parliament defeating the 
main opposition alliance in direct balloting for candidates and in 
voting for parties 
the socialists won 172 of the 319 seats decided in last 
weekends first round voting final results showed 
under bulgarias complex electoral law half the seats are 
distributed according to the percentage of votes each party 
receives the other half go to individual candidates elected by 
direct ballot 
the results mean the socialist party only needs to win 29 of 81 
candidate races that will be decided in sundays runoff to capture 
an absolute majority in the unicameral grand national assembly or 
parliament 
bulgaria was the only country in the disintegrating soviet bloc 
where the communists who changed their partys name in april 
remained the strongest political force 
the socialist party gained 47 percent of the proportionally 
distributed votes for 97 of the 200 seats contested among the 
parties zhivko stalev head of the central electoral commission 
told reporters the main opposition union of democratic forces was 
a distant second with 36 percent or 75 seats 
finishing third was the mainstream agrarian party with 8 percent 
and thus 16 seats and fourth was the mostly ethnicturkish 
movement for rights and freedoms with 6 percent and 12 seats he 
said 
despite recurrent charges of alleged manipulation and other 
irregularities union of democratic forces leaders accepted the 
returns in principle 
when the socialist victory was first signaled by projections 
earlier this week anticommunist and union of democratic forces 
protesters blocked traffic in sofia claiming the election was 
rigged 
however a majority of western observers said monday that the 
balloting process was essentially fair although some of them 
pinpointed individual cases of infringement of the rules

lithuanian officials said today that more than 
1600 workers who were laid off at a fertilizer plant will be 
called back to work if moscow eases its embargo and steps up 
natural gas supplies 
leaders of the baltic republics 3monthold independence drive 
said wednesday that moscow promised to restore 15 percent of 
lithuanias natural gas needs as the two sides tried to reach a 
compromise moscow imposed a crippling embargo on many natural 
resources after lithuania declared independence 
also today lithuanians paused to mark 49 years since the 
soviets deported thousands of people to siberia after seizing 
control of the republic 
lithuanian parliament spokeswoman rita dapkus said there was no 
sign the additional gas was being provided today however today 
is not a working day she said in reference to the memorial day 
and i dont think something like that would be done overnight 
anyway she said in a telephone interview from the lithuanian 
capital vilnius 
the promised supply of 122 million cubic feet of natural gas per 
day which will bring lithuania back to about 30 percent of its 
usual level will allow a fertilizer plant to reopen and 1650 
workers to return to their jobs she said 
the soviet union cut off the republics entire oil supply most 
of its natural gas and some raw materials in midapril to try to 
force the republics leaders to back away from their march 11 
independence declaration the shortages have forced factories to 
close putting 26000 people out of work 
ms dapkus said prime minister nikolai ryzhkov on wednesday told 
his lithuanian counterpart kazimiera prunskiene some gas would be 
restored 
ryzhkov made no promises on restoring other supplies ms dapkus 
said but the official soviet news agency tass quoted mrs 
prunskiene as saying after meeting ryzhkov in the kremlin that the 
embargo would probably be lifted 
the conciliatory gesture came as ryzhkov and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev offered lithuania a trade cancellation of the 
embargo and negotiations on independence if lithuania agrees to 
freeze the implementation of its independence drive during the 
talks 
gorbachev is not insisting on this precise formula his 
spokesman arkady maslennikov told a news conference wednesday 
we are searching for critical solutions acceptable to all 
sides without degrading the dignity of people who elected the 
parliament that adopted those acts maslennikov said 
gorbachev and ryzhkov met with the presidents of all three 
baltic states tuesday and significantly softening their stance on 
secession offered deals that would lead toward negotiations on the 
republics independence demands 
in washington the white house applauded the moves toward 
compromise presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater called them 
positive steps 
us lawmakers have suggested they would not approve a trade 
pact signed during the superpower summit in washington until 
gorbachev opens negotiations with the baltic states and lifts the 
economic embargo on lithuania 
the trade agreement is considered important to gorbachevs 
efforts to turn the ailing soviet economy around 
estonian president arnold ruutel told his republics parliament 
the situation was far from euphoric but that a tremendous 
change had taken place in the soviet view of the secessionist 
demands of the three baltic states the estonian news agency eta 
reported 
lithuania latvia and estonia were forcibly annexed by the 
soviet union in 1940 and are seeking restored independence 
lithuania most stridently 
ryzhkov favors having lithuania remain part of the soviet union 
under a new treaty granting the republic special status or 
privileges ms dapkus said 
mrs prunskiene did not immediately respond to ryzhkovs plan 
but the presidents of latvia and estonia were both reported on 
wednesday to have repeated their calls for full independence 
on tuesday gorbachev proposed the transformation of the soviet 
union into a looser federation of more independent republics the 
soviet leader is trying to keep together his huge economically 
troubled union of 15 republics with more than 100 nationalities and 
289 million people

the muchtouted benefits of lowering cholesterol 
may be especially effective for people who already have heart 
disease according to a study published today 
the findings based on a 10year research project confirm the 
widely held belief that people with low levels of cholesterol in 
their blood are far less likely to die of heart disease than those 
with high cholesterol 
but the study in the new england journal of medicine also shows 
that high cholesterol is especially dangerous when heart arteries 
are already partially clogged with cholesterol buildups 
the study was not intended to see what happens when people 
change their cholesterol levels 
the researchers wrote however that it suggests that the 
potential impact of changes in lipid cholesterol levels on the 
risk of death from cardiovascular disease may be considerably 
greater for men with preexisting cardiovascular disease than for 
healthy men 
the analysis based on the lipid research clinics prevalence 
study was conducted by dr juha pekkanen and others from the 
university of north carolina 
in the study desirable cholesterol levels were under 200 while 
high levels were over 240

skeletons that vietnamese refugees 
said were those of 30 americans killed in the vietnam war were 
handed over to the us embassy today officials said 
the bones were to be flown to hawaii for tests but embassy 
officials said they did not know when that would happen 
the bones stuffed into seven barrels were handed over to 
malaysian police by nine vietnamese boat people who landed monday 
on the beach at tanjung sedili 150 miles southeast of kuala lumpur 
red cross officials said they sent the bones by truck to the 
us embassy 
the embassys charge daffaires paul blakeburn said earlier he 
doubted the bones could be those of mising american servicemen but 
that only forensic tests in hawaii could determine whether they 
were 
other embassy officials said boat people previously claimed to 
have bones of americans but the claims had been proved false 
the vietnamese brought along with the latest bones 
identification tags bearing names and other details they said they 
were found on the skeletons 
police said the refugees hoped to get preferential treatment for 
settlement in the united states for bringing the bones 
us embassy press officer mary ellen t gilroy said no 
preference would be given even if the bones turned out to be those 
of americans 
malaysian officials said the boat people would face the normal 
screening process under which those deemed to be fleeing politican 
persecution are approved for resettlement in western countries and 
those considered economic migrants face repatriation 
the nine vietnamese have been placed in a temporary refugee camp 
in mersing near tanjung sedili they were to be moved in the next 
few days to the pulau bidong refugee camp 180 miles northeast of 
kuala lumpur for screening 
malaysia accepts boat people only for temporary asylum there 
are about 20000 vietnamese refugees in malaysian camps 
police said the refugees were on their way to singapore to hand 
in the skeletons to the us embassy there when their boat sprang a 
leak they were forced to land at tanjung sedili about 60 miles 
from singapore 
the vietnamese had painted signs on the boat saying they were

the bush administration announced today it 
will not impose economic sanctions on india for trade barriers the 
united states deems offensive 
us trade representative carla hills termed indias barriers to 
investment by americans and other foreigners and its exclusion of 
us insurance companies as an unreasonable burden on us commerce 
but she said that retaliation was inappropriate at this time 
given ongoing global free trade talks she said the administration 
would try to resolve its dispute with india as part of those 
discussions 
those discussions being held under the auspices of the 
96nation general agreement on tariffs and trade are due to wrap 
up at the end of this year india is considered a key participant 
in these talks known as the uruguay round because of its 
influence over other developing countries 
hills said indias announcement on may 31 that it would remove 
some of its barriers to foreign investment was a hopeful sign 
our message that foreign investment brings jobs technology 
and prosperity may be getting through hills said i hope this 
attitude will be reflected in indias approach to these issues in 
the uruguay round 
the administrations decision was relayed on wednesday to abid 
hussain indias new ambassador to washington 
the administration faced a june 16 deadline to decide whether to 
boost tariffs on indian imports or impose other retaliatory trade 
sanctions because of indias refusal to negotiate the dispute 
the case against india involves that nations barriers to 
foreign investment and its refusal to allow american insurance 
companies to do business in the country 
india was one of three countries placed on a trade hit list 
last year by the administration for erecting the most offensive 
trade barriers against american products 
the other two countries japan and brazil both successfully 
reached agreements with the united states to remove the offending 
barriers however india has refused to negotiate under threat of 
us sanctions which are provided by a section of the 1988 trade 
law known as super 301 
while the decision removes the possibility of economic 
retaliation immediately the administration in april renamed india 
to a hit list for the current year citing the same trade 
barriers the deadline for reaching a conclusion on that action 
will not come until june 1991 
the decision to cite only india in the second round of 
negotiations and to leave japan off the list triggered heavy 
protests in congress where japans huge 49 billion trade surplus 
with the united states has attracted attention 
the administration contended that japan had negotiated in good 
faith to remove barriers to sales of american satellites 
supercomputers and wood products in japan and therefore should not 
be targeted again 
the administration also pledged to press forward with separate 
discussions on broadranging structural trade barriers with japan 
those discussions are focusing on such issues as increasing 
penalties for antimonopolistic practices streamlining the 
countrys retail distribution procedures and making other changes 
to expand opportunities for foreign businesses 
there have been complaints in recent days that the talks with 
japan on structural impediments to trade had bogged down a final 
report on these talks is scheduled to be issued in july

roman catholic politicians who support abortion 
rights risk excommunication warned new yorks cardinal john 
oconnor in this weeks archdiocesan newspaper 
where catholics are perceived not only as treating church 
teaching on abortion with contempt but helping to multiply 
abortions by advocating legislation supporting abortion or by 
making public funds available for abortion bishops may decide 
such catholics must be warned that they are at risk of 
excommunication oconnor wrote in a 12page article on abortion 
if such actions persist bishops may consider excommunication 
the only option he added in the publication catholic new york 
oconnor has discussed the excommunication of prochoice 
catholic politicians in the past but the newspaper article 
appeared his strongest and clearest statement yet on the subject 
oconnor is also the chairman of the us bishops committee for 
prolife activities 
the statement appeared several days after the archdiocese 
rescinded an invitation to rep charles rangel dny who is 
catholic to speak at a catholic high school graduation ceremony 
because of his support for abortion rights 
oconnor also wrote that some bishops hoping to avoid severe 
penalties such as excommunication are imposing lighter penalties 
as a warning he cited barring speakers from church events is one 
such tactic 
in his statement the cardinal specifically criticized 
politicians who have what he described as a personally opposed 
to but position on the issue 
some politicians including gov mario cuomo have said although 
they personally oppose abortion they support a womans right to 
make a choice 
the personally opposed phrase says in effect in public 
life i will act indistinguishable from someone who sees abortion as 
a positive social good but please know that i will do so with 
personal regret the cardinal wrote 
this agenda is hardly effective since it serves the 
agenda of those who actively favor abortion he concluded 
the actions of catholic politicians oconnor wrote should be 
consistent with the faith and moral principles taught by the church 
in which they claim membership

this is not a matter of trust but a practical decision 
said deputy peoples party chairman bohumil svoboda he indicated 
the bartoncik affair affected the partys election results 
the peoples party a former communist ally that broke with the 
communists just before last winters prodemocracy revolution was 
one of three in a christian democrat coalition that finished third 
in last weekends election 
jiri cerny party general secretary said the election results 
were some 10 percent below what we expected 
havels civic forum and its slovak ally calfas public against 
violence won 170 of the 300 seats in parliament but fell short of 
the threefifths majority it needs to pass key constitutional 
changes 
bartonciks suspension will remain in force at least until the 
partys national conference in september peoples party officials 
said 
the party has failed to defend bartoncik against the 
allegations but has attacked havel for the way in which they were 
made public 
on june 5 bartoncik was hospitalized apparently suffering a 
heart attack after a meeting with havel at which he reportedly 
promised the president he would resign because of his alleged 
secret police links 
the peoples party said he would probably be released from the 
hospital within one or two weeks 
bartoncik was elected to parliament in last weekends vote his 
party said the legislatures immunity commission will decide 
whether to remove his mandate 
cerny said the peoples party would not take part in calfas 
coalition government because it had been offered too few posts 
a party must have a guarantee that it will be able to 
influence the decisions of the government if it takes part he 
said 
on tuesday jan carnogursky a leader of the christian democrats 
in slovakia said his slovak party would not participate in the new 
government

the supreme court today barred manufacturers 
from giving discounts to wholesalers and not to retailers when the 
discounts are unrelated to any savings for the supplier or to the 
wholesalers costs 
the court unanimously upheld a 135 million antitrust award 
texaco inc was ordered to pay to 12 service stations in the 
spokane wash area 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said there was 
no evidence that texacos discounts constituted a reasonable 
reimbursement for the value to texaco of the wholesalers 
marketing functions 
texacos appeal had been supported by leading business groups 
including the national association of manufacturers and the 
american petroleum institute 
they had said a defeat for texaco could undermine the most 
common distributional arrangement in american business the dual 
channel system in which a manufacturer or supplier sells to 
wholesalers at discounted prices lower than those it charges direct 
purchasing retailers 
but the court today said texacos discounts amounted to illegal 
price discrimination barred by a federal antitrust law the 
robinsonpatman act 
a federal jury ordered texaco to pay 449900 a sum that was 
tripled by the judge to 135 million in accord with the act 
the 12 service station dealers that sued said from 1972 to 1981 
they were placed at an unfair competitive disadvantage because 
texaco supplied gasoline to two spokanearea wholesalers john 
dompier oil co and gull oil co at discounts ranging from 25 
cents to 575 cents per gallon less than texaco charged the 
retailers 
dompier sold the gasoline to other retailers under the texaco 
trademark gull marketed it under private brand names 
the 12 service stations said they suffered because at least part 
of the discounts were passed on to consumers by competing retailers 
who bought from dompier and gull 
texaco argued that the discounts were legitimate since they were 
available to all wholesalers who purchased from the oil comany 
giant 
stevens today noted there was evidence the services offered by 
gull and dompier were insubstantial and did not justify the 
discount 
for example there was evidence that gulls role as a middleman 
amounted only to engaging in paper transactions and in fact 
texaco delivered gasoline directly to some of dompiers customers 
the case is texaco vs hasbrouck 872048

the supreme court today allowed the bush 
administration to limit how much welfare aid some needy families 
receive 
by a 54 vote the court said social security benefits paid to 
children must be considered in determining a familys eligibility 
for benefits under the governments aid to families with dependent 
children afdc program 
the decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling in a 
virginia case last year that favored welfare families in a dispute 
over how afdc eligibility is to be determined 
at issue was whether the first 50 in social security benefits 
received by a familys children each month must be taken into 
account when calculating the familys eligibility for afdc benefits 
the richmondbased 4th us circuit court of appeals said no 
today the supreme court said yes 
todays decision is a defeat for the virginia welfare families 
who had successfully challenged the bush administrations 
interpretation of the relevant law 
the disputed welfare law language says participating states are 
to disregard the first 50 of any child support payments 
writing for the court today chief justice william h rehnquist 
said bush administration officials were correct in limiting that 
language to payments from absent parents and not applying it to 
social security benefits received by children 
congress used child support throughout the relevant welfare 
law as a term of art referring exclusively to payments from absent 
parents rehnquist said 
he was joined by justices byron r white sandra day oconnor 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices harry a blackmun william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and john paul stevens dissented 
this crabbed interpretation of the statute is neither 
compelled by its language nor consistent with its purpose 
blackmun wrote and arbitrarily deprives certain families of a 
modest but urgently needed welfare benefit 
justice department lawyers had told the court that the 
50disregard provision enacted in 1974 could cost 44 million 
more each year in afdc benefits if interpreted as the 4th circuit 
court had 
the case is sullivan vs stroop 89535

the soviet legislature today delayed for at least 
two months the governments plan for a controversial increase in 
the price of bread the main staple of the nations diet 
the supreme soviet in a rebuff to the government of premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov said that plans to triple the price of bread in 
stages starting july 1 would have to wait until september or later 
the vote was 31933 
government officials had said the price increase would have 
brought in 24 billion but that all the money would be turned back 
to soviet consumers by other means however they acknowledged that 
they had not fully worked out plans to turn the money back to them 
the bread price increase was one of the most visible and 
controversial parts of an economic program presented to the supreme 
soviet by ryzhkov last month the program touched off panic buying 
in moscow and led the capitals government to require proof of 
residence to make purchases 
on wednesday the supreme soviet ordered the government to have 
other elements of the plan to move toward a market economy ready by 
october 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has said that bread is so 
cheap that children sometimes use a loaf for a soccer ball in the 
meantime the country spends its hard currency reserves to buy 
grain from foreign countries 
one deputy complained after the vote that because producer 
prices for grain already have been raised keeping bread prices 
constant would swell the government budget deficit by several 
billion rubles 
but the lawmakers rushing toward a summer adjournment with a 
slate of several other pieces of major legislation still pending 
voted against lowering the producer price again 
the producer price increase is to provide farmers with an 
additional 126 billion in an effort to improve agricultural 
incentives 
the government needed the supreme soviets approval for the 
price increases because of its 1989 pledge it would not raise 
prices on any essential items throughout this year

scientists say they have made the most 
detailed look at the center of the milky way galaxy and found what 
appears to be a massive black hole gobbling up one star every 5000 
to 10000 years 
computergenerated pictures released wednesday at a american 
astronomical society meeting show an object 1 million times the 
size of the sun that seems to be spinning off what appears to be 
clusters of gas said northwestern university astronomer farhad 
yusefzadeh 
this is the most detailed look at the center of our galaxy 
and it is similar in a scaleddown version to what we expect to 
see in the nuclei of active galaxies said yusefzadeh in a 
telephone interview wednesday nightsupermassive black holes are 
believed to be imbedded at the center of these galaxies 
a black hole is believed to be an imploded star a massive 
object so dense that even light cannot escape its gravitational 
pull it is sucking in one star every 5000 to 10000 years he 
said it is 25000 light years from earth 
its an arena where gravity has a complete triumph over all 
other forces he said of his research that involved three years 
of observations through the very large array radiotelescope 
the pictures of the object called sagittarius a show at least 
seven clumps of gas surrounding it and seeming to spiral outward 
from it as if being sprayed out from something rapidly spinning 
this is the first time you can actually see bloblike sources 
near the galactic center yusefzadeh said 
until now he said it had not been clear whether sagittarius a 
or a star cluster called irs 16 was really at the center of the 
galaxy 
we believe that we have good evidence that sagittarius a is 
truly at the center of our galaxy and is responsible for energizing 
its immediate vicinity he said 
although nothing can escape the interior of a black hole 
yusefzadeh said that gas dust and stars drawn toward it are 
believed to form a swirling disc the black holes gravity 
astronomers believe heats this material to such an extent that 
some of the matter is blown back outward by the radiation pressure 
and by a wind similar to solar wind 
scientists cannot actually see the black hole but can record the 
energy spewing out from it an amount roughly equal to the power 
that would be radiated by 10 million suns the radiotelescope can 
measure radio waves and infrared radiation 
the study was done in collaboration with astronomers mark 
morris of university of california los angeles and ron ekers of 
the australian telescope at epping australia

the first direct peace talks between 
mozambiques government and rightwing rebels have been postponed 
a communique wednesday by officials of mozambiques leftist 
government and mediating countries said the talks did not begin as 
scheduled tuesday in malawi which borders the troubled southeast 
african nation 
the discussions were to include mozambican cabinet ministers and 
alfonso dhlakama head of the mozambique national resistance 
guerrilla army known by its portuguese acronym renamo 
the communique said without elaboration that the talks were 
postponed because of difficulties experienced by the kenya and 
renamo delegations 
efforts are continuing to set a new date in the near future 
for the process to begin in malawi said the statement published 
by the official malawi news agency mana 
renamo has been fighting for control of the territory for 13 
years and opposes the oneparty rule of president joaquim chissano 
the war has left hundreds of thousands of people dead mostly 
civilians 
the mozambique national news agency aim had reported from 
blantyre on tuesday that mozambican cabinet ministers and the 
leader of the guerrillas had gathered in the city for the talks 
but renamo did not sign wednesdays communique the host government 
for several days declined to grant visas for western correspondents 
seeking to report on the meeting 
renamo has opposed malawi as a venue favoring either kenya or 
portugal mozambiques former colonial ruler that granted 
independence in 1975 
malawian officials contacted by telephone from the zimbabwean 
capital harare said they were not authorized to discuss the 
aborted meeting beyond what was published in the communique 
the blantyre talks were expected to focus on president 
chissanos proposals for a new constitution to allow independents 
to oppose the ruling front for the liberation of mozambique at 
elections 
but chissano has rejected demands for the creation of opposition 
parties 
kenya and zimbabwe have for several months brokered lowlevel 
peace talks

thousands of telephone calls clogged the white 
house switchboard after secretary of state james a baker iii gave 
out the phone number wednesday in a public hearing a spokesman 
said today 
during a time period when the white house might typically 
receive 100 or 200 calls between 6000 and 8000 callers dialed 
the presidential residence after baker sarcastically recited the 
number in a senate hearing 
the switchboard was finally blocked to the point where it 
couldnt handle it anymore and they had to put it on automatic 
thankyou tape white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
baker gave out the number 202 4561414 as he prodded israel on 
its commitment to the mideast peace process he said that when the 
israeli government was ready to talk seriously about peace it 
could call the presidents number 
fitzwater amplified today on bakers comments asked if the 
united states questions israels commitment to peace he said we 
have not yet seen the dialogue start there is a question 
certainly on both sides 
the united states wants to help the peace process and has tried 
to get the warring parties to the negotiation table fitzwater said 
however he said in the final analysis the parties of the 
region have to want peace for it to happen we cant want it for 
them but he was saying basically that if they want peace enough to 
get a dialogue going it will happen and give us a call 
bakers unusually blunt statements did not produce any calls 
from israels new conservative government fitzwater said 
but the broadcast of his remarks on television and radio news 
programs all day wednesday prompted thousands of calls from the 
public 
they were all over the issue on all sides he said its a 
fairly incredible volume 
apparently the white house operators tired of taking calls 
prompted by baker who works several blocks away at the state 
department 
a reporter from israel yaacov eilon said that when he called 
in and said he was calling in response to bakers comment the 
operator told him you would have to call the state department 
that number is 6474000 
asked what all this meant fitzwater quipped it means the 
white house operators can expect a thick christmas present this 
year from the state department

subpoena texas developer leonard briscoe to testify about his 
dealings with the department of housing and urban development and 
former hud officials 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the subcommittee that has 
spent more than a year probing the hud scandal said briscoe would 
be compelled to appear june 21 the subpoena was approved by a 
unanimous 50 vote of the employment and housing subcommittee of 
the government operations committee 
lantos said that despite briscoes initial statements that he 
was willing to testify voluntarily the panel had been unable to 
gain a commitment from him and briscoes attorneys had sent 
conflicting signals about whether he would appear

lightgreen light and to ensure mr briscoes appearance before 
the subcommittee on june 21 im requesting a subpoena be issued

negotiators at eastwest talks on 
reducing conventional forces in europe are close to agreement on 
limits for tanks and armored combat vehicles for each military 
bloc diplomats said today 
an accord would push ahead the overall talks and an initial 
agreement might be reached by the end of the year they said 
the eastwest talks are to cut troops and nonnuclear weapons of 
the two military alliances from the atlantic ocean to the ural 
mountains the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact countries are taking 
part 
the breakthrough proposal came from the french and the poles it 
suggests an overall ceiling for each side of 30000 armored combat 
vehicles and 20000 tanks 
french chief delegate francois plaisant said at a news 
conference given jointly with polish chief delegate wlodzimierz 
konarski today there was informal but overall consensus on the 
proposal 
diplomats said they expected imminent formal agreement on 
ceilings in the two categories 
negotiators from both sides had charged petty bargaining was 
slowing the talks western diplomats said the soviets appeared to 
be footdragging until the future security allegiance of a united 
germany was decided 
but both sides hope to have an agreement ready for signing by 
december when leaders from 35 nations are scheduled to meet in 
paris the other 12 participants in the paris talks are neutral and 
nonaligned european countries 
in his plenary statement konarski said discussions between us 
and soviet experts during last months washington summit had 
produced results which made it easier to formulate a compromise 
package 
one of the toughest issues has been finding common definitions 
for tanks and other armaments diplomats said 
the frenchpolish proposal also sets weight limits of 165 tons 
for all tanks and it would no longer distinguish between armored 
troop carriers and other armored vehicles 
according to us estimates the west has 23600 tanks to the 
warsaw pacts 52500 nato has 34025 armored combat vehicls and 
the warsaw pact has 59400 
konarski said the use of broader categories of definitions was 
the only way to conclude a deal in a situation where there is 
such a pluralism in europe of types of weapons 
but konarski and plaisant said there were still many issues to 
be resolved before a final agreement can be signed konarski said 
the issue of ceilings and definitions on aircraft and helicopters 
and terms for verification still must be resolved 
nato has proposed a maximum of 4700 combat aircraft for each 
side with an additional 500 air defense interceptors but the east 
would like a higher ceiling 
the superpowers have agreed to a ceiling of 195000 troops each 
in central europe with the united states permitted to maintain up 
to 30000 troops elsewhere in europe

the morgue for more than two weeks they were sent to hart island 
a ferry bearing a stack of 14 pine caskets containing the bodies 
of marrero diaz and other indigents chugged to the island in long 
island sound about a mile from the borough of the bronx 
diazs and marreros names were written in black marker on their 
roughhewn caskets another casket had the markings unk wht m for 
unknown white male 
the bodies headed for hart island are not embalmed and the 
caskets are thin that way nature can reclaim them and the burial 
plots can be used again in a few decades in a macabre recycling 
program 
a box sometimes falls apart as were moving it and a body 
rolls out said jerome disisto a corrections officer 
accompanying the burial detail if that happens we just get an 
empty box put the body in and thats all 
capt gene ruppert another corrections official said an 
average of 1500 adults are buried each year on the island in 
addition to 1500 infants most of them stillborn a quarter or 
more of those buried are believed to have been homeless 
the corrections department manages the island and all burials 
are performed by inmates who earn 50 cents an hour department 
spokesman tom antenen said 
the few buildings on the island such as a onetime insane 
asylum are overgrown with vegetation except for a recently 
abandoned prison barracks which still has fences with concertina 
wire 
every plot of 150 bodies has a white marker the location of 
each body is recorded in case a relative comes to claim it about 
90 bodies are exhumed each year 
al saunders a city employee uses a backhoe to dig the trench 
where the caskets are laid two across and stacked three high he 
has buried thousands of coffins since 1984 and has had to dig a 
few up 
it isnt the nicest job going but it has to be done he 
said you have to develop a callous attitude because how much 
death can you see without it having an effect on you 
saunders said one of his predecessors became so preoccupied with 
death he had nightmares and quit 
the prisoners many shirtless in the sun hoisted diazs casket 
into the trench then put three more inside no words were said as 
diaz and marrero were buried the inmates reached for the next 
casket and the next until their chore was done 
saunders dropped the soil onto the common grave with his 
backhoe the prisoners smoothed out the loam with rakes and shovels 
diaz and marrero were known as mike and joe according to a new 
york newsday article that appeared shortly after their deaths 
they were good people one friend daisy aldebedo told the 
newspaper they got high but they worked for their money they 
never robbed anyone 
the city planned to build lowincome housing on the lot where 
diaz marrero and the third man benjamin olivera were killed 
there are an estimated 70000 homeless people in new york city 
in recent weeks hundreds of homeless people have been evicted from 
train stations and bankmachine vestibules 
city shelters have a reputation for violence and many homeless 
people shun them because of rules that residents must be drug and 
alcoholfree said marjorie valleau a spokeswoman for the city 
human resources administration

the demonstrators who held out on 
bucharests central university square for more than 50 days were 
students prodemocracy activists and rowdies who seemed unclear 
what they wanted 
they claimed that more than 5 million people across the country 
had signed a petition backing their chief demand a 10year ban on 
former communist leaders such as presidentelect ion iliescu from 
entering politics 
that demand is supported by some of the countrys leading 
intellectuals who also dont trust iliescus promises of democracy 
and believe he and other excommunists in his national salvation 
front have usurped the revolution 
but bucharest and timisoara are the only cities since december 
to have seen demonstrations of more than a few hundred people 
against the government 
the overwhelming victory of iliescu and his front in last 
months elections suggest the demonstrators demands found little 
support in other areas where citizens see iliescu as the man who 
rid them of the hated nicolae ceausescu 
more than 100 of the 200 demonstrators on university square were 
arrested when police moved against them on the 53rd day of their 
protest wednesday 
it remains unclear who the demonstrators were who later set fire 
to police headquarters and attacked other key buildings such as the 
state television

a human rights group urged the hong kong 
authorities thursday to abolish capital punishment before this 
british colony reverts to chinese rule in 1997 
although the law still exists hong kong has not carried out 
capital punishment since 1966 and death sentences are commuted to 
life imprisonment 
the hong kong branch of amnesty international said it was 
apprehensive of the use of the penalty after 1997 because it is 
still widely imposed and carried out in china 
amnesty international opposes the death penalty as a violation 
of the right of life it said in a statement it is also the 
ultimate form of cruel inhumane and degrading punishment 
the call for its abolishment was contained in the human rights 
groups submission on the territorys proposed bill of rights 
which is expected to be enacted into law this year 
the bill was unveiled by the government in march in a move to 
reassure people here that their human rights will be safeguarded 
after the chinese takeover 
china has warned it would repeal the bill if contravenes the 
basic law the constitution for hong kongs post1997 
administration 
the chinese government has pledged to retain hong kongs legal 
and capitalistic systems for 50 years after 1997

three army officers accused of sharing 
bribes linked to the purchase of 25 million pairs of black socks 
for troops could face execution if convicted court officials said 
thursday 
the officers among seven arrested in the scandal allegedly 
received a portion of 109000 in bribes paid by a hosiery dealer 
last year to win the 182 million socks contract prosecutors at 
taipei district court charge 
some of the bribe money reached chiang chunglien a cousin of 
the chief of staff to president lee tenghui officials allege 
chiang chunglien was arrested wednesday 
the socks supplier hsiao chunliang told court prosecutors the 
three officers also had demanded 218200 in kickbacks to accept a 
shipment of substandard socks but he refused to pay them 
hsiao and chiang chungliens son chinghsiung were arrested 
wednesday along with tsai hsiung head of the national assemblys 
public relations department 
the three arrested officers were identified as maj gen liu 
pao col chen taoming and col liao yunhsun all three 
supervised military purchases 
if convicted of bribery the military officers could be 
sentenced to death and the civilians could receive a maximum 
sevenyear prison sentence 
formal charges will be filed when the investigation is 
completed prosecutors said 
prosecutors said hsiao complained it was difficult to meet all 
the standards set by the military for the socks including a 
guarantee the black socks would not fade even if soaked in hot 
water for 40 minutes 
hsiao said some of the socks were manufactured at factories in 
shanghai china to lower production costs

the privacy rights of motorists are not 
violated when police try to curb drunken driving by stopping them 
at sobriety checkpoints the supreme court ruled today 
the 63 ruling upheld michigans sobriety checkpoint program 
and by extension similar programs in most states 
in another decision the court allowed the bush administration 
to limit how much welfare aid some needy families receive 
by a 54 vote the court said social security benefits paid to 
children must be considered in determining a familys eligibility 
for benefits under the governments aid to families with dependent 
chidren program 
the court also ruled the government may impose severe fines 
against air polluters even when federal officials are slow to 
decide on proposals for cleaning up the atmosphere 
and it ruled that hospitals and nursing homes may sue in federal 
court to challenge how a staterun medicaid program reimburses 
their costs 
lower courts had split on the sobrietycheckpoint issue some 
had upheld the use of checkpoints at which all motorists are 
pulled off the road and checked for signs of intoxication other 
courts like those in michigan had barred police from using 
checkpoints 
no one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken 
driving problem or the states interest in eradicating it chief 
justice william h rehnquist wrote for the court 
conversely the weight bearing on the other scale the 
measure of the intrusion on motorists stopped briefly at sobriety 
checkpoints is slight he added 
drunken drivers killed 23000 people nationwide last year 
president bush called drunken driving a problem as crippling as 
crack cocaine and last december asked state and local 
governments to step up the fight against drunken drivers 
its as crippling as crack as random as gang violence and 
its killing more kids than both combined the president said 
then as he noted that federal aid was being given to promote the 
use of sobriety checkpoints 
todays ruling echoed the presidents concern 
joining rehnquist were justices byron r white sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy justice harry a 
blackmun joined in the result but not in rehnquists majority 
opinion 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall and john paul 
stevens dissented 
i do not dispute the immense social cost caused by drunken 
drivers nor do i slight the governments efforts to prevent such 
tragic losses brennan wrote but he added in the face of the 
momentary evil of drunken driving the court today abdicates its 
role as the protector of the fundamental right of individual 
privacy 
in a separate dissenting opinion stevens said the most 
disturbing aspect of the courts decision today is that it appears 
to give no weight to the citizens interest in freedom from 
suspicionless unannounced investigatory seizures 
sobriety checkpoints are elaborate and disquieting publicity 
stunts stevens said this is a case that is driven by nothing 
more than symbolic state action an insufficient justification for 
an otherwise unreasonable program of random seizures 
nadine strosser general counsel of the american civil liberties 
union said todays ruling strikes at the heart of the fourth 
amendment which bans unreasonable police searches and seizures 
this is the first time in american history that the government 
is allowed to conduct searches and seizures with a view of 
enforcing criminal laws without any individualized suspicion at all 
that the person is committing or about to commit a crime she 
said 
the traditional method police use to identify suspected drunken 
drivers is to observe traffic determining that method is not 
wholly effective states in recent years began experimenting with 
other detection methods 
michigan state police first used sobriety checkpoints which 
they modeled after a program in maryland in 1986 
at a checkpoint site police directed all traffic headed in one 
direction to a roadside area where officers talked to motorists 
if there was no immediate evidence of intoxication the motorist 
was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away the 
average delay was about 30 seconds 
if some signs of intoxication were detected a driver was 
directed to another area for further questioning and perhaps a 
breath test 
at one such checkpoint michigan state police troopers stopped 
126 cars in less than an hour and detained two drivers for sobriety 
field tests one driver was arrested on drunkendriving charges 
six michigan legislators sued state police soon after the 
checkpoint program began their lawsuit alleged that the 
checkpoints violated the fourth amendments ban on unreasonable 
police seizures and searches 
state courts struck down the practice citing the potential 
for an unreasonable subjective intrusion on individual liberty 
interests 
today the nations highest court said the michigan courts were 
wrong 
the supreme court in 1979 barred police from randomly stopping 
vehicles to check registration papers in that delaware case 
officers had total discretion over which vehicles were stopped 
but the 1979 decision did not rule out spot checks in which an 
officers discretion was not so unconstrained questioning of all 
oncoming traffic at roadblocktype stops is one possible 
alternative the court said 11 years ago 
in this case michigan courts relied on another 1979 supreme 
court ruling in which the justices said the constitutionality of a 
police seizure made without probable cause to suspect a crime 
should be determined by three factors 
the gravity of the public concerns being served 
how the seizure advances the public interest 
the severity of the police interference with individual liberty 
today the court said the michigan sobriety checkpoint program 
satisfies all three factors 
the balance of the states interest in preventing drunken 
driving the extent to which this system can reasonably be said to 
advance that interest and the degree of intrusion upon individual 
motorists who are briefly stopped weighs in favor of the state 
program rehnquist wrote 
in the pollution case the justices upheld by a 90 vote the 
environmental protection agencys power to seek fines of up to 
25000 a day against a general motors plant in massachusetts 
however the impact of the ruling for future cases may be 
limited the house and senate have passed separate bills revising 
the federal clean air act that establish new timetables to address 
the kind of problem at issue in the general motors case 
in the medicaid case the justices by a 54 vote let a virginia 
hospital association invoke a federal civil rights law in suing the 
state over virginias medicaid reimbursement rates 
officials from most of the 50 states had urged the court to rule 
against the association they said allowing such lawsuits could 
affect hundreds of millions of dollars in federal and state 
funding and lead to a litigation explosion 
the checkpoint case is state police vs sitz 881897

as many as 60 boats attacked a spreading 
oil slick with skimmers and booms to try to protect the shoreline 
today as fuel leaked from a 55 milliongallon tank on the burning 
mega borg 
the oil slick about 30 miles off galveston was an estimated 30 
miles long and 10 miles wide in spots officials said they could 
not determine where the oil might wash ashore or how soon 
a coast guard officer said at an inquiry today that the mega 
borg was in good condition in april when it passed a coast guard 
inspection 
both the engine and the pump rooms were in very good 
condition said coast guard petty officer richard miles of the 
april inspection i didnt see any excessive leaks the bilges 
were clean and the vents were intact 
fireboats showered water on a lowlevel fire still burning 
in the engine room this morning firefighters were to return to the 
vessel later today to try spraying flamesmothering foam on the 
blaze again the coast guard said 
about 880 gallons of foam was used on the fire wednesday but 
the operation was halted when it caused the fire to flare 
the oil slick was the rusty brown remains of about 3 million 
gallons of light african crude that the coast guard says leaked 
from the tanker in the five days since the first of a series of 
explosions aboard the norwegian ship 
coast guard officials said most of the spilled oil had either 
burned or evaporated but as the ships fire diminished the slick 
from the 886foot ship nearly doubled in length because oil was no 
longer being consumed by flames 
the oil was spewing from a hole in the vessels center tank 
coast guard capt thomas greene said i dont see any risk of 
losing cargo from the other tanks he said 
the leaking tanks capacity is 55 million gallons but it 
wasnt known whether it had been full or how much oil remained 
ensign david nichols said 
jim obrien of obriens oil production services said his 
company also known as oops had recovered about 30000 gallons 
along with skimming officials turned to an experimental 
procedure of dropping oilconsuming bacteria into the water 
were going to try it greene said anything we can do to 
clean up the spill well try but he said that the process 
called bioremediation is a new technology and is not considered a 
major part of the cleanup 
a day after the ship fire was declared under control 
firefighters wednesday tried blanketing hot spots with foam but 
the heat was so intense it ignited trapped vapors and caused a 
flareup forcing salvage crews to return to spraying water on the 
ship 
the reflash is a minor setback coast guard chief petty 
officer todd nelson said there is very little fire left on the 
ship 
the ships superstructure and stack are collapsed its rear has 
dropped more than 60 feet and waves wash over the deck 
the ship was carrying 38 million gallons of oil when its pump 
room exploded while it was transferring oil to a smaller vessel 
late friday the incident was reported to the coast guard about 1 
am saturday two of the 41 crew members died two were missing 
and presumed dead and 17 were injured none seriously 
the government of norway started an inquiry wednesday in 
galveston to question crew members 
the captain said he didnt know what sparked the explosion and 
that the crew went over a safety checklist before transferring the 
fuel 
cm mahidhara 36 a sailor for 17 years and captain for nine 
said he was in the radio room alone when he felt a sort of a 
bump and moments later the door swung open the lights went out 
and glass was crashing down 
in the confusion mahidhara moved his wife and children to 
safety but he said that thick black smoke kept him from locating 
and commanding his crew 
i looked forward and saw bright flames were coming from the 
pump room and ventilators he said the flames were licking up 
right over the bridge the top of the pump room had been completely 
blown off 
mahidhara said the explosion occurred around 1130 pm friday 
contrary to earlier reports that it happened early saturday 
ole leithe a norwegian maritime investigator who questioned the 
crewmen said i dont think we can find the reason for the 
explosion from this hearing maybe later when the ship is empty and 
cleaned we will know more 
officials said that when the fire is out it will take days for 
the superstructure to cool enough to start unloading oil 
an 825foot britishregistered tanker stoody by to begin 
receiving the remainder of the ships 22 million cargo from angola

president bush visited the vietnam war 
memorial at daybreak today to watch one us flag being lowered and 
another raised it was an appropriate way to observe flag day 
said spokesman marlin fitzwater 
bush who has been outspoken over the past few days in pressing 
for a constitutional amendment protecting the flag did not speak 
at the brief ceremony and would not take questions from reporters 
the white house renewed its push this week for the flmendment after 
the supreme court on monday struck down 
the 1989 federal law against flagdesecration 
fitzwater later said no link was intended between bushs active 
lobbying for the flagprotection amag 
protection aendment and his decision to 
visit vietnam memorial to be photographed watching the flag being 
raised 
he went to the memorial because he thought it was an 
appropriate place to commemorate flag day fitzwater said 
he denied that the white house was seeking to politicize the 
issue 
but on capitol hill senate democrats used flag day speeches to 
criticize the proposed amendment and bushs support for the change 
we will be whimpering wimps if we at the justice department is committed 
to the 
investigation prosecution and incarceration of those who ripped 
off our financial institutions and have left the taxpayers of the

like food education should not be used as a 
military weapon rep howard nielson said thursday as he pushed for 
a congressional resolution pressuring israel to reopen schools in 
the west bank and gaza 
nielson at a news conference opening a conference of the 
palestinian academic freedom network said he has introduced a 
resolution that urges israel to take immediate steps to reopen all 
six universities in the west bank and gaza which have been closed 
for more than two years 
israel captured the territories from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 middle east war and has maintained military control there 
israeli military authorities closed all palestinian institutions 
of higher education when the intifadah or palestinian uprising 
began in december 1987 
israeli authorities arguing that the schools served as the 
focal point of the stonethrowing campaign against israeli 
soldiers also sometimes have closed all primary and secondary 
schools in the west bank including those run by the united nations 
relief and works agency 
i think its important that we continue to send the message to 
the israeli government that education should not be used as a 
political tool nielson said education ought to transcend 
politics its as fundamental a basic human need as food i 
understand the security concerns of the israeli government but i 
still find it unacceptable that school closings be used as a weapon 
against the intifadah 
although israel has reopened west bank primary and secondary 
schools michel shehadeh of the palestinian network said 40000 
high school graduates are now languishing because they are not 
allowed to study at a university

a convicted burglar can be ordered to pay 
for a new burglar alarm for his victims as part of restitution the 
wisconsin supreme court ruled 
in a 52 decision wednesday justices upheld a lower court order 
that louis j heyn pay 4000 for the purchase and installation of 
a burglar alarm 
heyn had been ordered to pay 4082 in restitution for the items 
he stole he argued that he could not be ordered to pay for the 
alarm because it not covered by state restitution laws 
but the high court majority said such a payment aids the 
offenders reformation by educating him or her that a burglary is 
not simply a taking or destruction of personal property but also 
destroys the sense of security that each person has a right to 
expect in his or her home 
the victimized couple had told the trial court that the nov 13 
1987 burglary was traumatic forcing the woman to seek medical 
care so they installed the alarm system to ease their fears

an american miner held captive by colombian 
guerillas is surviving on armadillo and monkey meat according to a 
letter his family released today 
scott heimdal told his family he is being moved daily in the 
jungle by his captors the handwritten letter was dated june 2 and 
delivered late wednesday to his parents roy and marge heimdal in 
peoria 
the family learned wednesday that the kidnappers wanted 
612000 more than 10 times the 60000 ransom paid 
we understood that 60000 is what they wanted roy heimdal 
said theres no way we could raise 612000 thats impossible 
scott heimdals letter confirmed reports that the kidnappers 
became angry after seeing a television report week about 
fundraising efforts in peoria 
in his letter the heimdal said the kidnappers think the family 
lied about their finances after seeing their modest rented home 
i have to do everything in my power to convince them we dont 
have anything scott heimdal wrote 
he said his infected feet are healing and believes somehow 
this nightmare will be over soon 
scott heimdal was working as a gold miner for the ecuadoran 
company iminco when he was abducted by armed men april 28 while 
traveling by boat in the jungle near the colombian border the boat 
driver was killed in the attack 
the guerrillas have identified themselves as members of the 
peoples liberation army 
the elder heimdal said the family had done everything possible 
to convince the kidnappers it doesnt have any money the family 
raised the ransom during a furious fourday public appeal 
donations came in from around the country 
we sold everything we had and had to get help from strangers 
to raise 60000 we dont have anymore mrs heimdal said im 
on the verge of losing my sanity im a nervous wreck this added 
pressure is overwhelming 
jeffrey fino iminco general manager said from his office in 
quito ecuador that the 60000 was only a down payment to 
guarantee his life 
fino said a meeting with rebels monday ended in failure the 
guerrillas were upset because the gobetween had tried to deliver 
the payment in dollars instead of colombian pesos even though they 
originally demanded dollars fino said 
to make clear how irrational and unlogical these guys are 
they told our intermediary to take the dollars from the middle of 
the jungle and be back within three hours with colombian pesos or 
they were going to kill scott fino said 
he had to get back in a canoe go back to the little river 
port he had left from grab a taxi and go into the main town of 
lago agrio he cleaned out the town of pesos 
but there was not enough colombian currency in the tiny 
ecuadoran oil town 25 miles from the rendezvous site the 
guerrillas set a date later this month for the balance of the 
payment fino would not reveal the date 
at that time we will demand scotts release for that amount of 
money he said they need to understand thats all the money 
theyre going to get

president bush and thai prime minister 
chatichai choonhavan today pledged to work together to fight 
narcotics and bring peace to warravaged cambodia through free 
and fair elections under the united nations lead 
the two leaders in nearly 2 hours of meetings and a working 
luncheon at the white house also agreed to forge new ties between 
their commerce ministers to promote investment and defuse trade 
disputes 
bush called thailand one of americas oldest friends and 
closest allies 
what is most remarkable about thailand is that it has combined 
a doubledigit economic growth with the emergence of parliamentary 
democracy said bush 
bush said he and chatichai agreed to keep pressing for a 
comprehensive solution under the united nations auspices to the 
tragic conflict in cambodia 
both nations will continue our diplomatic efforts to end the 
violence and assure genuine selfdetermination through free and 
fair elections under un auspices and in the presence of an 
international peacekeeping force in cambodia bush said 
chatichai speaking in english said our two countries are 
committed more than ever to work together in bringing peace to 
cambodia and to end the suffering of the cambodian people 
bush said the two countries commerce ministers will form a new 
joint usthai committee for commercial cooperation 
chatichai said they were seeking to establish a new framework 
for economic cooperation that would allow us to regularly 
discuss any potential trade issues before they become trade 
disputes 
the united states currently imposes duties on 165 million of 
thai products to pressure the country to stop infringement of us 
patent and intellectual property rights on products ranging from 
computers to hollywood videotapes to pharmaceuticals 
bush expressed profound appreciation for thailands 
providing asylum to indochinese refugees and assured chatichai that 
america will welcome our share of vietnamese refugees 
bush said there is one kind of business we agree we will not 
tolerate and that is narcotics he promised to keep working to 
reduce us demand for drugs 
chatichai said drugs are tearing apart the very fabrics of our 
societies i pledge to you the full support of the thai 
government in the war against drug trafficking 
secretary of state james a baker iii also joined the leaders 
for the talks chatichai was also meeting with leaders of congress 
and addressing the national press club on friday 
thailand boasted the worlds fastest growing economy last year 
burgeoning at nearly an 11 percent rate 
it is a transit point for half the heroin reaching the united 
states from the socalled burmalaosthailand golden triangle 
the united states has applauded asset seizure and anticonspiracy 
measures that chatichais government recently introduced in 
parliament to crack down on drug traffickers 
thailand also bears the burden of 300000 temporary refugees 
from the civil war in neighboring cambodia it has drawn criticism 
from some human rights groups for turning away vietnamese boat 
people 
the pullout of vietnams occupying forces from cambodia has 
eased the immediate threat to thailands own security a senior 
us official said wednesday making this an opportune time to 
press for a diplomatic solution to the strife in cambodia 
the united states and thailand have worked together to encourage 
a settlement under the auspices of the united nations 
thailand recently helped arrange talks in tokyo between prince 
sihanouk and hun sen installed as head of cambodias government 
after the vietnamese invasion in 1978 chatichai also conferred 
recently with xu dunxin a top chinese official who recently 
traveled to both bangkok and vietnam 
the united states has opposed the flow of chinese arms to the 
communist khmer rouge strongest of the warring cambodian factions 
who are blamed for killing more than 1 million of their countrymen 
during their bloody 197578 rule 
some environmental groups were staging a protest march today 
against what they called crass hypocrisy by chatichais 
government in prohibiting logging within thailand while granting 
more than 40 licenses to thai companies to harvest teak and other 
rain forest timber in burma

coal miners from across the soviet 
union gathered to debate the formation of an independent union and 
a possible strike have urged prime minister nikolai ryzhkov and 
his government to resign 
the government of the ussr does not have our trust read 
a telegram sent to the national supreme soviet legislature by the 
first congress of miners of the soviet union meeting at the 
largest soviet coal field 
we urge workers in other industries to quickly cut their ties 
with the government said the resolution which was sent 
wednesday and read thursday at the supreme soviet in moscow 
the telegram also criticized an economic reform plan proposed 
last month by ryzhkov and defended on national tv by president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
in the ukrainian city of donetsk mining minister mikhail 
shchadov fielded angry questions from the workers then stormed 
from the conference hall after the delegates voted by a 33014 
margin to disband an advisory committee he had appointed and 
replace it with one named by the union congress 
resign resign delegates shouted as shchadov took their 
questions and accusations for some 30 minutes 
one miner shouting from the floor of the conference hall 
demanded to know why shchadov remained minister of the mining 
industry despite his failure to fulfill promises made to end the 
nationwide coal strike last summer 
i think i am qualified to be mining minister shchadov 
replied 
but his answer was cut off by the acting speaker of the 
congress bulat mukhazanov who accused him of not responding 
directly to the miners questions 
the miners were expected to vote friday on whether to form a new 
union in place of the old union that they say is controlled by the 
ministry which owns all mines and most related industries in the 
soviet union 
the miners also were divided on whether to organize a strike 
this summer to protest the governments failure to fulfill promises 
made to end last summers nationwide walkout 
the telegram to the supreme soviet mentioned neither ryzkov nor 
gorbachev by name but in soviet political parlance the term 
government generally refers to the council of ministers headed 
by the premier 
it accuses the government of being responsible for the 
worsening of the socialeconomic system in the country and 
lacking the ability to make crucial decisions to lead the country 
out of the economic crisis with a minimum of social suffering 
the miners congress consisting of 712 delegates representing 
every coal shaft and pit in the country was organized following 
strikes that shut down coal production last summer and crippled 
heavy industry 
delegates said they might be swayed by the newly elected 
president of the russian federation boris n yeltsin who last 
week urged the miners not to strike 
however the miners are angry they said the government has 
failed to fulfill promises to increase their supply of food and 
consumer goods improve mine safety or give them greater power in 
setting prices 
the agreement is hardly being implemented said yuri l 
makarov a member of the organizing committee the biggest thing 
is the purchase price of coal now the price is 24 rubles a ton we 
want it increased to 8085 rubles 
at a realistic exchange rate that would still be lower than the 
world price of 32 a ton for soviet coal the official exchange 
rate puts 80 rubles at 133 but it is just 13 at the governments 
tourist rate and less than 10 at the black market rate 
they offer us economic independence but leave the old prices 
fixed that is absurd he said 
safety does not appear to have improved either as fatal 
accidents have been reported this month in the two largest soviet 
coal fields the kuznetsk basin in western siberia and the donetsk 
basin 
in the donetsk each million tons of coal cost the lives of 
two or three coal miners the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda 
reported wednesday in a dispatch from the congress

widespread intimidation of voters may have 
plagued the balloting in which the party of former communists won 
opening round victories in bulgarias parliamentary elections the 
state department said thursday

running under the socialist party banner won 172 of the 319 seats 
in the bulgarian parliament that were decided in the first round of 
voting a runoff election is scheduled for sunday to decide the 
remaining 81 seats 
the problems that have come to light raise serious questions 
about the electoral process state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler said 
there are many reports of local officials threatening voters 
with loss of jobs pensions or other benefits she said 
in addition proper measures to ensure secrecy were not taken 
in all locations with uncurtained polling stations and 
transparent ballot envelopes reported in some places 
in some villages ms tutwiler said local officials reportedly 
handed out socialist party ballots to voters in polling places 
she said american observers noted the atmosphere of fear in the 
countryside during the election process 
bulgaria was the only country in the soviet bloc where the 
communists who changed their partys name in april remained the 
strongest political force

the bush administration will consider 
including problems of drugs and migration in freetrade talks with 
mexico us trade representative carla a hills told congressmen 
thursday 
she said attorney general dick thornburgh who deals with 
illegal migration and william j bennett head of the office of 
national drug control policy had been in on recent talks with 
mexican officials 
they were heartened by the kind of cooperation they got she 
said 
i think that two areas where we will benefit from the free 
trade agreement in the drugs area is by the creation of jobs and 
opportunities there will be less reason to turn to drugs as a 
means of wellbeing and cooperation is enhanced where you have a 
good economic relationship between governments hills said in 
testimony before the house ways and means subcommittee on trade 
she was pressed by rep frank j guarini dnj whose district 
is just across the hudson river from new york city where drugs and 
migration are major problems 
why not put them on the table at this point he asked why 
miss this opportunity 
he suggested that thornburgh and bennett join in the free trade 
talks agreed to earlier this week by president bush and mexican 
president carlos salinas de gortari 
well well consider that hills said there are so many 
problems you could have quite a table and 
i know but what an opportunity what an opportunity to become 
better neighbors guarini interrupted 
rep charles b rangel dny also pressed hills on the drug 
issue 
to have it inferred that a threat to our national security 
would not be on the table as we talk with our friends who are 
joining us in trying to prevent the hundreds of tons of opium 
marijuana and cocaine that are pouring across this border to me 
would be sending a wrong message to our friends in mexico he 
said 
hills said she intends to work with congress on the trade talks 
which she said would begin in earnest next year 
her prepared testimony mentioned neither drugs nor migration 
she reviewed and praised president salinas new economic policies 
but said liberalization could go further by 
further lowering of mexican tariffs and other barriers to 
imports 
passage of laws favorable to foreign investment rather than 
present regulations 
greater opening by mexico to activity of foreign firms in 
banking securities insurance and transport 
changes in mexican patent and copyright laws to protect foreign 
rights

hes one of their highest officers but 
some national organization for women members suspect dave stewart 
is like the wolf dressed in grandmas clothing trying to trick 
little red riding hood 
i think david knows that anytime he meets new women theres a 
certain suspicion admitted kathy sandrock of bettendorf former 
president of the quadcity now chapter theres a hint of 
whats he doing here how can he know our issues 
but one after another stewart has knocked down those suspicions 
and last month he was elected to a seat on nows 30member 
governing board representing the prairie states region of iowa 
minnesota nebraska and the dakotas there is only one other man on 
the board john katz representing the washington dc area 
i dont have any personal goals he said in a telephone 
interview from his home in davenport my goals are nows goals i 
didnt use my sex to get elected when youre involved as long 
as i have been you prove your point that youre not involved for 
the fun of it not just there to have friends and parties after a 
while your sex becomes moot they can see youre not a flash in 
the pan 
as for the suspicions ms sandrock said stewart puts most wary 
women at ease within minutes 
he debunks the suspicions within 10 15 minutes she said 
he has never treated anybody with less than respect there are 
still some women who resent him but theyre the women who have 
been so mistreated and abused by the system that the only way they 
can translate it is that men are bad 
she said stewart handles these women with patience asking only 
to be heard 
stewart 33 joined now in 1982 and became active in the drive 
to ratify the national equal rights amendment which eventually 
failed 
for many people that was burnout time but since i was new 
i just stayed involved he explained 
before his now days stewart was active in campus issues at 
western illinois university in macomb it was the era that drew his 
interest to now it just made such common sense i couldnt see 
the controversy 
stewart predicts the era will rise again but he is now 
concentrating on preserving abortion rights 
stewart said he never thought it unusual to pursue feminist 
issues with one of the more outspoken womens groups saying that 
its important for people to act on their beliefs 
some men might say well i couldnt join that group and i 
say if you agree with their issues you should walk your talk 
thats why my bumper sticker says walk your talk he said 
past chapter president nita eaglefrink of rock island ill 
said stewart has convinced even the more skeptical members that he 
is sincere 
she said stewart does have to be coached now and then for 
instance he once said he liked the annual sports illustrated 
swimsuit issue she said 
wed say oh david ms sandrock said ok david heres 
why we dont do that 
but he took it with grace 
aside from his now activities stewart works at a group home 
where he counsels adults with physical and mental disabilities he 
is single 
ive got two cats 13 plants and now theres no time for 
anything else he said

beetle bailey the lazy but lovable gi who has 
stumbled through comic pages for the past 40 years finally won an 
admiring salute thursday from the us army 
in a flag day ceremony at the pentagon cartoonist mort walker 
received a framed certificate of appreciation for patriotic 
civilian service from brig gen bill mcclain who declared an 
armistice in the armys decadesold hostilities against the 
slovenly buck private 
through it all you have entertained us although sometimes we 
havent always liked it said mcclain the armys public affairs 
chief he observed if you cant laugh at yourself something is 
intrinsically wrong with you 
tongue in cheek walker replied that it was always the dream 
of gen halftrack and mine to hear from the pentagon and it took 
40 years to get the call 
i cant believe im actually here walker said as hard as 
it is to find anything in the pentagon they finally found a sense 
of humor 
since walker created the popular comic strip in 1950 based on 
his experiences as an army draftee in world war ii beetle bailey 
and his cartoon friends have annoyed some pentagon brass who 
complained they presented an unflattering image of army life 
in 1954 the tokyo edition of the stars and stripes military 
newspaper drummed beetle off its pages because the strip poked fun 
at officers the official explanation was that beetle bailey had 
a low interest value but the move was denounced in newspaper 
editorials as silly 
stars and stripes banned the strip again in 1970 as did some 
southern newspapers when walker introduced lt flap a feisty 
black character miss buxley the bosomy secretary to gen 
halftrack drew protests from feminists 
putting the controversy behind the army heaped praise on walker 
in its citation thursday 
his ingenuity in portraying army members in a humorous manner 
has contributed significantly to the morale of our soldiers as they 
provide for our national security it read 
i read it and laugh at it and others do too mcclain 
confessed afterward said maj gen richard e stephenson who 
attended the ceremony beetle bailey is the vehicle that enables 
us to see the lighter side of our profession and keeps us from 
taking ourselves too seriously 
accompanied by lifesize beetle and sarge characters walker 
gave army officials a cartoon diorama based on his special flag day 
strip it appeared thursday in the more than 1800 newspapers 
worldwide that carry beetle bailey the diorama will hang on 
permanent display in a pentagon hallway near the main entrance 
while the beetle and sarge characters roamed the corridors 
waving to pentagon secretaries and taking salutes from passing 
generals and admirals walker was a guest at a cakecutting 
ceremony in the pentagons inner courtyard marking the 215th 
birthday of the us army on thursday

the government on thursday said it would not pay 
for a proposed multibilliondollar highspeed rail link between 
london and an english channel tunnel 
the decision announced in the house of commons by transport 
secretary cecil parkinson cast doubt on whether such a link to the 
capital would be built in britain one is being built in france 
critics say failure to construct such a line would hurt 
britains trade prospects with the continent and increase the 
misery of tens of millions of commuters who will have to share 
already crowded roads and trains with millions more foreign 
visitors 
parkinson said the links builders european rail link have 
declined to proceed without public money rail link is led by 
governmentowned british rail but prime minister margaret thatcher 
hopes to privatize the railway 
the opposition labor party attacked the governments decision 
britain will enter the 21st century with an inadequate 19th 
century railway link labor lawmaker john prescott said 
france already is building a highspeed link from paris to 
calais which will hook up the tunnels freight and passenger 
traffic to a highspeed system being planned across europe 
the french railways sncf last year offered to help finance a 
british highspeed rail link from london to folkestone british 
rail currently is negotiating with that company the british rail 
spokesman said 
in addition european rail link had sought about 600 million in 
public funds toward the project in return for commuter use of the 
new line 
british rail has not publicly announced how much a link would 
cost but estimates put the price tag at 44 billion to 62 
billion 
one reason the french are more enthusiastic is that their tunnel 
entrance is in one of the most depressed areas of france the 
british end is in englands rural and prosperous southeast 
many britons cling to their insularity and are ambivalent toward 
the chunnel which some think would allow an invasion of 
england 
mrs thatcher defended her cabinets decision telling the house 
of commons that british legislation prohibits the government from 
subsidizing international travel links 
mrs thatcher said the government already was spending 34 
billion on roads and railways to and from the tunnel 
the veto is another blow for the beleaguered anglofrench 
consortium which is building the 31mile rail tunnel under the 
english channel entirely with private funds 
eurotunnel has suffered from soaring costs which are forcing it 
to seek extra funding from its banks and shareholders the latest 
cost estimate is 131 billion 
the tunnel is still targeted to open in june 1993 
when finished eurotunnel will carry passengers from london to 
paris in about three hours about the same time as an air flight 
inlcuding time getting to and from the airport and half the time 
of a carferry journey

federal investigators are looking into 
what appears to be poaching and mutilation of walruses for ivory in 
the bering sea 
officials first learned of the kills tuesday after coast guard 
safety inspectors boarded a fishing boat that recently had returned 
to port from the bering sea herring fishery they found two walrus 
skulls and two sets of tusks aboard 
they were in the process of cleaning them out boiling them 
said coast guard chief petty officer ed moore 
the evidence has been turned over to the us fish and wildlife 
service 
a second seizure of walrus remains was reported wednesday by a 
coast guard boarding group after a safety inspection of the fishing 
vessel maverick 
both seizures were made at naknek a port city about 300 miles 
southwest of anchorage where the coast guard had set up a 
temporary safety inspection detachment 
according to the coast guard maverick skipper delton repnow 
said walrus parts were retrieved after they were found floating in 
the water 
and steven j hansen the skipper of the first vessel the 
tender chichigoff told investigators that on june 4 his vessel 
found a dozen walrus carcasses floating about 40 miles south of 
nome in norton sound 
ten walrus carcasses were headless and two still had their 
heads said walter e soroka a fish and wildlife field supervisor 
in the process of cleaning the heads and removing the tusks the 
crewmen found at least one smallcaliber bullet in one of the 
walruses officials said 
crew members told the coast guard they thought they legally 
could keep the walrus ivory and had intended to report their find 
as required by law the coast guard said discovery of the carcasses 
had been entered in the vessels log book 
the marine mammal protection act makes it a federal crime to 
recover ivory from walruses found at sea soroka said it is legal 
to recover walrus carcasses found on shorelines 
eskimos and other alaska natives are allowed to hunt walruses 
for subsistence use but cutting off walrus heads and leaving the 
rest of the carcass is illegal even for natives said soroka 
we dont know who removed the heads he said we plan to 
find out thats something that we look at seriously 
soroka said hansen has cooperated in the investigation he 
contacted me he told me he misconstrued the laws soroka 
said 
robert brophy president of seattlebased icicle seafoods inc 
the owner of the vessel said he doubted his employees 
intentionally broke the law 
walrus ivory is used in alaska and around the world as a craft 
substitute for elephant ivory with the recent crackdown on illegal 
elephant hunting in africa alaska ivory has become more popular 
among carvers 
penalties for poaching are strict if the crew of a fishing 
vessel is found to have been poaching walruses the government may 
seize the vessel soroka said individuals convicted of violating 
the marine mammal protection act face up to a year in prison and 
100000 fine

this city of monuments statues and memorials 
has a new attraction to stir the emotions and evoke the glories of 
the past 
this newest of washingtons monuments 22 of the original 24 
columns from the us capitol literally had to be pulled from the 
mud of the anacostia river and painstakingly stripped of 35 coats 
of white paint 
now after a mighty effort by a few people the columns stand on 
the highest point of a great meadow at the national arboretum 
cleaned up repaired and splendid again holding up nothing but sky 
and glory set between the columns are 500 marble slabs once used 
as steps on the senate wing of the capitol 
in the middle of all this is a small fountain from which water 
flows into a reflecting pool designed so that the full image of the 
columns is mirrored in the water 
the national capitol columns as they are called were dedicated 
wednesday with all the pomp due a newborn shrine the air force 
band played an allservice color guard presented the flag the 
president sent a message and heat put the audience into a patriotic 
sweat 
it is most fitting that the columns will have a permanent new 
home said clayton yeutter the secretary of agriculture they 
are a spectacular addition to the scenery of our great city 
bill allen architectural historian of the capitol was on hand 
to supply the history of the 10ton sandstone columns and a long 
one they have had twentyseven presidents from martin van buren 
to dwight d eisenhower took the oath of office in their shadow 
when they were first installed on the east front of the capitol 
in 1826 congressmen left their benches to help pull the strong 
carriage on which the columns had been placed up capitol hill 
the columns were the finishing touch to the rebuilding of the 
capitol after the british burned the house and senate wings in 
1814 the columns were put between the two wings in the rotunda 
which was completed in 1824 
sam rayburn the longtime speaker of the house went out of the 
capitol every evening to look at and be inspired by the columns 
which are unadorned except for acanthus leaves carved into the caps 
the columns were the principal feature of the capitol until a 
new front was put on in 1958 and completed just in time for john f 
kennedys inauguration in 1961 
the columns replaced by bigger ones made of marble were 
unceremoniously taken to the capitol power plant and lay there for 
15 years in 1973 they were trucked to the banks of the anacostia 
river and left to sink in the mud 
a determined woman ethel garrett campaigned for more than 20 
years to have the columns put on public display at the arboretum 
she died without seeing her plan come to fruition 
betty rae chairman of the project said all of the nearly 2 
million spent on the project was raised from private donors many 
of whom were at the ceremony wednesday 
the columns will draw people to the arboretum who never would 
have come to the arboretum she said the national arboretum 300 
acres of great trees and shrubs is one of washingtons bestkept 
secrets located miles away from the citys more famous attractions

calls swamped the white house switchboard 
after secretary of state james a bakers public entreaty for 
israeli officials to call the number when youre serious about 
peace a spokesman said thursday 
baker publicly gave out the number during a senate committee 
hearing on wednesday and by the end of the day some 6000 to 
8000 calls had clogged the white house lines said president 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater 
the switchboard was finally blocked to the point where it 
couldnt handle it anymore and they had to put it on automatic 
thankyou tape fitzwater told reporters 
on thursday the call volume remained heavy 
it took 24 rings for a switchboard operator to answer one call 
its busy here today she acknowledged 
baker whose state department office is at a different location 
and different phone number sent flowers thursday to the operators 
his spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
although bakers remark about the telephone number came during a 
discussion of israel tutwiler made the point that at several times 
in his testimony he referred to the parties in the peace 
process in the plural 
as to whether baker intended to pinpoint the israeli government 
she said he intended the phone number to be used by all 
asked if the bush administration questions whether israel wants 
peace fitzwater said we have not yet seen the dialogues start 
so there is a question certainly on both sides 
baker sarcastically recited the white house number 202 
4561414 in the senate hearing where he bluntly prodded israel on 
its commitment to peacefully settling the mideast turmoil 
asked about giving out that number instead of his own baker 
told reporters on thursday i worked over here four years and i 
had that one memorized 
baker was chief of staff to president reagan 
he said in his testimony wednesday that his message to 
everybody over there was when youre serious about peace 
call us 
but the israeli government did not call said fitzwater 
instead the broadcast of bakers remarks on television and 
radio news brought thousands of calls from the public wanting to 
talk all over the issue on all sides 
typically the switchboard might get 100 or 200 calls in the 
time period that saw thousands after bakers wednesday comments 
an israeli reporter yaacov eilon said the white house operator 
who answered his call on wednesday said you would have to call 
the state department that number is 6474000

as flower deliveries go it was spectacular 
a light plane swooped from the soviet sky without warning and 
dropped off flowers for president mikhail s gorbachev at an 
airport near turkey before zipping back across the frontier soviet 
media said thursday 
clearly at least some soviets have gained a sense of humor 
since a 19yearold west german youth buzzed the kremlin and landed 
his cessna on red square before startled kgb guards in may 1988 
that young man mathias rust spent 14 months in a soviet prison 
after the photo of his plane in front of st basils cathedral made 
front pages around the world soviet authorities fired their 
defense minister and air defense chief after rust flew from finland 
to moscow undetected 
the latest incident was reported in a mocking article in 
izvestia under the headline rust number two 
izvestia and tass quoting the labor newspaper trud said that 
on june 9 a cessna sneaked into soviet airspace undetected by 
flying barely 600 feet above the mountainous southern border with 
turkey 
it touched down at the batumi municipal airport for less than 40 
seconds just long enough to drop off a bouquet of carnations 
greetings for gorbachev and a 20 bill 
we germans are very grateful to him said the note to 
gorbachev the author signed the note hans schneider 
the ministry of defense said air defenses did not act 
izvestia reported 
translating this into simple language we dare to say this 
means they failed to notice him the newspaper concluded thank 
god the second rust had enough tact not to land at a military 
base 
trud said border guards and air defenders failed to coordinate 
their actions it said helicopters should have been sent after the 
plane 
after all he is still a violator even though he has an 
excellent sense of humor trud said

the legislature ordered a twomonth delay thursday 
in an unpopular threefold increase in bread prices a centerpiece 
of mikhail s gorbachevs market reforms 
the supreme soviet voted 31933 that the government should 
produce another version of the plan in september easing the effect 
of price increases bread prices the staple of the soviet diet 
would have increased july 1 
gorbachev had indicated the price increase was a test of the 
soviet unions willingness to tolerate a free market it was 
intended to help pay the cost of recently increased payments to 
grain farmers 
the increase was part of an economic program that touched off 
panic buying in moscow and led the capitals government to require 
proof of residence before allowing purchases 
lawmakers rejected the measure because of its great unpopularity 
among voters said one deputy alexei boiko a member of the 
committee that examined government proposals on economic reform 
the people have been cheated more than once theyre 
mistrustful and they feared they would be cheated again he said 
boiko said delegates from poor regions of central asia where 
consumption of bread is particularly high are really afraid 
theyre worried that this will give rise to real discontent 
he said the decision also was influenced by violent ethnic 
clashes fueled by poverty in central asia in the republic of 
kirghizia 155 people died in ethnic fighting in the past two 
weeks the soviet interior ministry said 
government officials had promised that all 28 billion brought 
in by the price increase would be handed back to consumers through 
compensation programs however officials acknowledged they had not 
fully worked out such programs 
the bread price increase was one of the most visible and 
controversial aspects of the economic program presented to the 
supreme soviet by premier nikolai ryzhkov last month 
on wednesday the supreme soviet gave gorbachev a mandate to 
speed economic reforms it said the government had until october to 
prepare more radical measures to move the country toward a market 
economy 
the july 1 price increases would have applied to all grainbased 
products including pasta soviet bread comes in dozens of 
varieties and is virtually the only foodstuff that is almost always 
readily available without long lines 
it remains extremely cheap at less than 33 cents a loaf 
gorbachev has said that bread is so cheap children sometimes use 
loaves for soccer balls at the same time the country spends its 
scarce foreign currency to buy grain from foreign countries 
one deputy said that because prices paid to grain farmers 
already have been raised keeping bread prices constant would swell 
the government budget deficit 
but the lawmakers rushing toward a summer adjournment with 
several other pieces of major legislation still pending voted 
against lowering the price to producers again the producer price 
increase will provide farmers with an additional 15 billion

the soviet union which has repeatedly balked 
at allowing the entry of us labor leaders has issued visas for 
two aflcio representatives labor secretary elizabeth dole said 
thursday 
soviet labor minister vi shcherbakov agreed to the visas after 
a private meeting with mrs dole in geneva switzerland mrs 
doles office said they were in geneva for the annual 
international labor organization meeting 
dick wilson the aflcios coordinator of central and eastern 
european affairs and john j banovic secretary treasurer of the 
united mine workers become the first aflcio representatives to 
ever officially visit the soviet union they plan to meet with 
soviet independent mine workers 
the soviet government has still refused aflcio president lane 
kirklands official delegation request kirkland also had sought 
visas for lynn williams president of the united steelworkers of 
america and al shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers 
the aflcio which represents 142 million americans belonging 
to 90 us trade unions has been a longtime critic of the soviet 
union 
we dont know that one granting of visas will make a policy 
it certainly is a step in the right direction we hope it is the 
start of a free and open relationship said aflcio spokesman rex 
hardesty 
mrs dole said wilson and banovic left for the soviet union 
immediately after the visas were granted wednesday 
their sole purpose is to talk to soviet workers about the free 
trade union movement not to foment unrest mrs dole said in a 
statement 
earlier this year the aflcio hosted a monthlong visit by nine 
soviet miners trying to form independent unions 
kirkland has compared the struggle of soviet miners to that of 
solidarity organizers in poland in the early 1980s he pledged to 
offer the federations support even if it meant defying the soviet 
government 
the aflcios support of solidarity included the smuggling of 
printing and other communications equipment into poland when 
solidarity was outlawed in all the federation gave about 5 
million worth of equipment and other assistance to solidarity

here are excerpts from the supreme courts 
decision that said police do not violate motorists privacy rights 
by stopping them at sobriety checkpoints 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from chief justice william h rehnquists opinion for the 
majority 
this case poses the question whether a states use of highway 
sobriety checkpoints violates the fourth and 14th amendments to the 
us constitution we hold that it does not and therefore reverse 
the contrary holding of the court of appeals of michigan 
no one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken 
driving problem or the states interest in eradicating it media 
reports of alcoholrelated death and mutilation on the nations 
roads are legion the anecdotal is confirmed by the statistical 
drunken drivers cause an annual death toll of over 25000 and in 
the same time span cause nearly one million personal injuries and 
more than 5 billion in property damage 
conversely the weight bearing on the other scale the measure 
of the intrusion on motorists stopped briefly at sobriety 
checkpoints is slight we reached a similar conclusion as to the 
intrusion on motorists subjected to a brief stop at a highway 
checkpoint for detecting illegal aliens in a 1976 ruling 
experts in police science might disagree over which of several 
methods of apprehending drunken drivers is preferable as an ideal 
but for purposes of fourth amendment analysis the choice among 
such reasonable alternatives remains with the governmental 
officials who have a unique understanding of and a responsibility 
for limited public resources including a finite number of police 
officers 
in sum the balance of the states interest in preventing 
drunken driving the extent to which this system can reasonably be 
said to advance that interest and the degree of intrusion upon 
individual motorists who are briefly stopped weighs in favor of the 
state program we therefore hold that it is consistent with the 
fourth amendment 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from justice harry a blackmuns concurring opinion 
i concur only in the judgment 
i fully agree with the courts lamentations about the slaughter 
on our highways and about the dangers posed to almost everyone by 
the driver who is under the influence of alcohol or other drug 
i add this comment only to remind the court that it has been 
almost 20 years since in a 1971 ruling i noted that the slaughter 
on the highways of this nation exceeds the death toll of all our 
wars 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from justice william j brennans dissenting opinion 
i do not dispute the immense social cost caused by drunken 
drivers nor do i slight the governments efforts to prevent such 
tragic losses 
indeed i would hazard a guess that todays opinion will be 
received favorably by a majority of our society who would 
willingly suffer the minimal intrusion of a sobriety checkpoint 
stop in order to prevent drunken driving but consensus that a 
particular law enforcement technique serves a laudable purpose has 
never been the touchstone of constitutional analysis 
the fourth amendment rests on the principle that a true balance 
between the individual and society depends on the recognition of 
the right to be let alone the most comprehensive of rights and 
the right most valued by civilized men 
in the face of the momentary evil of drunken driving the 
court today abdicates its role as the protector of that fundamental 
right 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from justice john paul stevens dissenting opinion 
the court overvalues the law enforcement interest in using 
sobriety checkpoints undervalues the citizens interest in freedom 
from random unannounced investigatory seizures and mistakenly 
assumes that there is virtually no difference between a routine 
stop at a permanent fixed checkpoint as was at issue in the 1976 
ruling involving aliens and a surprise stop at a sobriety 
checkpoint 
in my opinion unannounced investigatory seizures are 
particularly when they take place at night the hallmark of regimes 
far different from ours the surprise intrusion upon individual 
liberty is not minimal 
the most disturbing aspect of the courts decision today is that 
it appears to give no weight to the citizens interest in freedom 
from unannounced investigatory seizures the decision that seems 
diaphanous today may be intolerable tomorrow 
sobriety checkpoints are elaborate and disquieting publicity 
stunts the net effect of sobriety checkpoints on traffic safety is 
infinitesimal and possibly negative 
this is a case that is driven by nothing more than symbolic 
state action an insufficient justification for an otherwise 
unreasonable program of random seizures unfortunately the court 
is transfixed by the wrong symbol the illusory prospect of 
punishing countless intoxicated motorists when it should keep its 
eye on the road plainly marked by the constitution

president bush and thailands prime minister 
chatichai choonhavan agreed thursday to a new cabinetlevel 
committee to defuse trade disputes and promised to press for free 
elections in wartorn cambodia under the un flag 
the two leaders emerged from nearly 2 hours of talks and a 
luncheon at the white house promising to work together to stem both 
the us thirst for drugs and their flow from southeast asia 
the visit from the leader of what bush called one of americas 
oldest friends and closest allies came at a time of intensified 
diplomatic efforts to bring peace to cambodia 
four different factions are fighting to topple the cambodian 
government of hun sen installed by vietnamese invaders in 1978 
bush said the common usthai aim is to assure the cambodia 
people genuine selfdetermination through free and fair elections 
under un auspices and in the presence of an international 
peacekeeping force 
we will do all we can to accelerate the ongoing peace 
process said chatichai adding that we are prepared to work 
with the un security council on a peace initiative 
bush said the two countries commerce ministers will form a 
joint usthai committee for commercial cooperation to promote 
trade 
chatichai said its aim will be to establish a new framework 
for economic cooperation that would allow us to regularly 
discuss any potential trade issues before they become trade 
disputes 
thailand is on the us trade representatives priority watch 
list for pirating products from computer software to hollywood 
videotapes to pharmaceuticals 
the united states retaliates with duties on 165 million of thai 
products 
thailand is leading an economic resurgence in southeast asia 
and its 107 percent growth in 1989 was the fastest in the world 
assistant secretary of state for east asia richard solomon said 
chatichai asked bush to help convince the chinese to stop arming 
the khmer rouge the communists blamed for the genocide of 1 
million cambodians during their bloody rule in 197578 
bush told chatichai the united states remains strongly opposed 
to any role for the khmer rouge in a possible coalition government 
in phnom penh 
thailand recently helped arrange talks in tokyo between prince 
sihanouk and hun sen installed as head of cambodias government 
after the vietnamese invasion in 1978 
bush expressed profound appreciation for thailands 
providing asylum to indochinese refugees and assured chatichai the 
united states will welcome our share of vietnamese refugees 
chatichai whose country is the transit point for half the 
heroin reaching the united states from burma and laos pledged 
the full support of the thai government in the war against drug 
trafficking

rep james scheuer dny a congressional sponsor of the 
exhibit told a news conference that the documents betray a deep 
persistent strain of antisemitism in the soviet union that is 
flourishing under president mikhail s gorbachevs glasnost policy 
of openness 
in the 70 years since the communists seized power in moscow 
scheuer said the soviet government has adroitly and cynically 
manipulated the antisemitic genes of its people through 
statesubsidized propaganda materials 
he said he hoped president bush and secretary of state james a 
baker iii would urge gorbachev to denounce antisemitism and allow 
the soviet union to become a cradle for nurturing freedom for 
all its people

a young policeman who was shot by tamil 
separatists and left for dead among the bodies of his colleagues 
said thursday he crawled into the jungle and hid while more 
policemen were killed 
piyeratna ranaweera said he was one of 115 policemen who were 
captured at kalmunai police station monday when the rebels overran 
11 police stations in the eastern province 
the fighting which began monday was the worst violence since 
negotiations began between the government and the tigers in may 
1989 
at least 110 government troops have died but one unconfirmed 
report said the tamil tiger rebels also killed 125 to 150 policemen 
who were among the 600 officers captured a spokesman for the 
tigers said the report could be antirebel propaganda 
ranaweera said that all 115 policemen captured with him were 
blindfolded and the tigers took their watches and wallets tied 
their hands and gave them water they were then taken in three 
buses from kalmunai 135 miles east of colombo to a rebel camp 20 
miles to the south 
ranaweera lying in a hospital bed with his broken left arm in a 
sling and bloodstained cotton on the bullet wound in his left ear 
said one busload of the captive policemen were taken from the tiger 
camp shortly before midnight monday 
at 1245 that night they took the second busload again to 
the jungle he said in a weak voice 
he said he was blindfolded when he got off the bus so he could 
not see if the men from the first bus were there 
they lined us all up and made us lie on the ground face down 
and they opened fire with t56 rifles then they held a torch to 
our heads and if they heard a cry they shot again 
ranaweera said the bullet grazed his left ear the tigers 
apparently thought he was dead and left 
he said he crawled into the jungle and realised his left arm was 
broken and he fixed a sling for it 
while he was lying in the jungle he heard the third bus arrive 
and then he heard more shots he estimated it was about 3 am he 
said he saw no one else alive 
after the third bus left he started making his way inland 
towards government lines but i fainted a couple of times i was 
very thirsty i found a lake with elephans and i drank 
the young sinhalese policeman said he came to a small farmers 
hut some tamil people were there i explained what happened but 
they left me 
about 3 pm tuesday when he estimated he had walked about 14 
miles towards damana a sinhalesedominated town 18 miles southwest 
of kalmunai he reached a second hut he said 
i saw a sinhalese man and he took me and there were sinhalese 
boys and they took me on a motorcycle to damana 
ranaweera was admitted to the government hospital in kandy the 
largest town near damana 
the spokesman for the tigers dominic said the mass killings of 
policemen could have happened or it could be antitiger 
propaganda communications are difficult and we are trying to find 
out what really took place 
dominic who uses only one name was speaking to reporters in 
the northern town of jaffna the headquarters of the tigers 
the tamils who are mainly hindu have been fighting for an 
independent nation claiming discrimination by the majority 
sinhalese who are mainly buddhist 
at least 11000 people including 1200 indian soldiers sent to 
the region as peacekeepers have been killed in the tamil war since 
it started in 1983

police seeking to curb drunken driving do not 
violate motorists privacy rights by stopping them at sobriety 
checkpoints the supreme court ruled thursday 
the 63 decision upheld michigans checkpoint program and by 
extension similar operations in most states 
the balance of the states interest in preventing drunken 
driving and the degree of intrusion upon individual motorists 
who are briefly stopped weighs in favor of the state program 
chief justice william h rehnquist wrote for the court 
the three dissenters said the decision sacrificed individual 
liberty in favor of a police tactic that might not make any 
difference in the fight against drunken driving 
in other decisions the court 
ruled 54 in a virginia case that hospitals and nursing homes 
may sue in federal court to challenge how a staterun medicaid 
program reimburses their costs 
ruled unanimously in a case from massachusetts that the federal 
government may impose severe fines against air polluters even when 
regulators are slow to decide on cleanair proposals 
allowed the bush administration by a 54 vote in a virginia 
case to limit how much welfare aid some needy families receive 
the sobrietycheckpoint ruling was hailed by various groups 
seeking greater crackdowns on drunken drivers but was denounced by 
the american civil liberties union 
micky sadoff national president of mothers against drunk 
driving called the decision a great victory for all of us who 
care about the safety of our loved ones on the highways 
the chairman of the national transportation safety board also 
applauded the ruling but said more needs to be done he called 
on states to allow police to confiscate licenses on the spot if 
motorists fail or refuse to take chemical tests 
but the ruling will have no effect in at least one state 
louisiana state police said thursday they are barred from setting 
up sobriety checkpoints by their state constitution which affords 
greater individual privacy than does the federal constitution 
and police in michigan may not be able to reinstate their 
checkpoint program until a challenge based on that states 
constitution is resolved 
nadine strosser the aclus general counsel said the ruling 
is fundamentally wrong both as a matter of constitutional 
principle and as a matter of public policy 
this strikes at the heart of the fourth amendment which 
bans unreasonable police searches and seizures ms strosser said 
writing for the court rehnquist said no one can seriously 
dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving problem or the states 
interest in eradicating it 
he said drunken drivers cause an annual death toll of over 
25000 and in the same time span cause nearly one million personal 
injuries and more than 5 billion in property damage 
the courts dissenters however cited statistics indicating 
that those figures have been declining steadily 
conversely the weight bearing on the other scale the 
measure of the intrusion on motorists stopped briefly at sobriety 
checkpoints is slight rehnquist said 
he was joined by justices byron r white sandra day oconnor 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy justice harry a blackmun 
joined in the result but not in rehnquists opinion 
the decision echoed president bushs stated concern about 
drunken driving 
its as crippling as crack as random as gang violence and 
its killing more kids than both combined the president said 
last year as he noted that federal aid was being given to promote 
the use of sobriety checkpoints 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall and john paul 
stevens dissented from thursdays ruling 
calling sobriety checkpoints no more than elaborate and 
disquieting publicity stunts stevens said the net effect on 
traffic safety is infinitesimal and possibly negative this is a 
case that is driven by nothing more than symbolic state action an 
insufficient justification for an otherwise unreasonable program of 
random seizures 
he added the court is transfixed by the wrong symbol the 
illusory prospect of punishing countless intoxicated motorists 
when it should keep its eyes on the road plainly marked by the 
constitution 
the traditional method police use to identify suspected drunken 
drivers is to observe traffic determining that method is not 
wholly effective states in recent years began experimenting with 
other detection methods 
in michigan police who set up such a checkpoint directed all 
traffic headed in one direction to a roadside area where officers 
talked to motorists 
if there was no immediate evidence of intoxication the motorist 
was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away the 
average delay was about 30 seconds 
six michigan legislators sued state police soon after the 
checkpoint program began 
michigan courts banned the checkpoints relying on a 1979 
supreme court ruling in which the justices said the 
constitutionality of a police seizure made without probable 
cause to suspect a crime should be determined by three factors 
the gravity of the public concerns being served 
how the seizure advances the public interest 
the severity of the police interference with individual liberty 
the court thursday said the michigan checkpoint program 
satisfies all three factors

britain on thursday said hong kong will have to 
forcibly return more vietnamese boat people to their communist 
homeland unless the united states agrees to house about 9000 of 
the refugees on guam 
in the philippines the government allowed more than 250 boat 
people to debark from us navy ships only after us and other 
foreign officials agreed to resettle them outside the philippines 
within three years 
britain representing its colony hong kong and six asian 
nations are expected soon to warn the us state department 
formally that they will abolish boat peoples right to debark 
unless they can send the wouldbe migrants back forcibly 
tens of thousands who fled vietnam since the communists defeated 
ths usbacked south vietnamese government in 1975 have jammed 
refugee centers in neighboring countries 
the united states has a responsibility it cant evade 
foreign office minister francis maude said in an interview 
either it joins in the consensus of other nations on forced 
repatriation or it provides an alternative 
but it is quite indefensible to block the consensus and at the 
same time to refuse what one might call an intermediate solution 
he added referring to the guam proposal which washington rejected 
three weeks ago 
maude however will press his proposal for uscontrolled 
holding centers in guam during a us visit next week 
last december 51 vietnamese were sent home from the hong kong 
camps against their will bundled on to an aircraft in tearful 
scenes that caused an international uproar 
on monday a philippine envoy delivered a formal warning to the 
vietnamese foreign ministry in hanoi that britain and the 
sixmember association of south east asian nations may abolish 
landing rights for new arrivals the foreign office said 
the warning carried no deadline but amounts to an ultimatum that 
drastic action may follow the state department will get a similar 
warning within days 
the asian group comprises brunei indonesia malayasia the 
philippines singapore and thailand some have warned they will 
push boatloads of refugees back out to sea 
in the philippines more than 250 vietnamese rescued on the high 
seas last month by us navy ships were allowed to leave the ships 
thursday ending a twoweek dispute 
the philippine government said it received assurances from the 
us ambassador the british ambassador and the manila 
representative of the un high commissioner on refugees that the 
refugees will be resettled in another country within three years 
the issue has been a sensitive one for the us navy since a 
military jury at subic bay convicted a navy captain of dereliction 
of duty for turning away a boatload of vietnamese in the south 
china sea in june 1988 thirtyone of the vietnamese died and 
survivors turned to cannibalism to stay alive 
there are more than 109000 boat people in camps in southeast 
asian countries including 54541 in hong kong according to un 
and british figures 
britain has classified 10500 of the vietnamese in hong kong as 
genuine political refugees britain wants to send to guam about 
9000 it says are purely seeking a better way of life and have no 
right to asylum 
the rest are awaiting screening and british officials expect 
nearly 90 percent to be classifed as economic migrants

an israeli human rights group said thursday 
that soldiers violated firing orders by shooting 14 palestinians in 
the head chest or back despite regulations calling for them to aim 
for their legs 
the israeli center for human rights in the occupied territories 
said another woman reportedly died after a solider hit her with a 
club and that the army failed to investigate how all the deaths 
occurred 
an army statement attributed to military sources did not respond 
to allegations that firing procedures were violated and said 
investigations into the deaths were incomplete 
the human rights group examined deaths that occurred during 11 
days of disturbances following the may 20 massacre of seven unarmed 
arab laborers by an israeli civilian 
the study showed that 14 of the 18 people killed in the 
subsequent unrest were shot in the head chest or back although 
regulations call for aiming at rioters legs 
many victims were shot at close range according to the 23page 
report based on medical reports and witness testimony those killed 
included an 8yearold boy four children aged 13 to 16 and three 
women it said 
army orders were tightened three days into the rioting 
requiring soldiers to get permission from senior officers before 
shooting 
it was obvious that they didnt stick to the regulations in 
this case said zehava galon the director of the rights group 
it wasnt necessary to shoot at the upper body 
the group said it could not investigate all 18 deaths because 
army curfews kept researchers from reaching witnesses the army 
also blocked journalists from visiting the shooting scenes for more 
than a week 
victims families also complained that soldiers broke into their 
homes and beat them that live ammunition was often used instead of 
plastic and rubber bullets and that some soldiers provoked rioting 
and humiliated grieving families 
the rights group said that in at least six of the deaths 
military police had not talked to the victims families more than 
two weeks after the killings reporters who have inquired into 
other deaths have often been told for months that investigations 
were not complete 
an army officer said we investigate every single case you 
can hardly say that in cases where a few days or a couple of weeks 
have passed we can be criticized for not speaking to all the 
people involved the officer spoke on condition of anonymity 
the army said 107 soldiers had been indicted for misuse of force 
in the 30month uprising against israeli occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip seventy have been found guilty 
the rights group apparently got wrong information on at least 
one case the shooting death of 16yearold mohammed halhuli from 
the west bank village of qibya whose uncle said soldiers entered 
the village and opened fire 
the ap interviewed more than a dozen people including the 
youths father who all said he was shot and killed when he and 
about 50 other youths stoned an army base in neighboring burdus 
village and some tried to climb the fence 
in its overall judgment on mays riots the report said soldiers 
did not give palestinians enough latitude to express their anger at 
the massacre and instead tried to nip any signs of protest in the 
bud 
the report rejected army contentions that bloodshed was kept to 
a minimum because soldiers had gained experience in handling 
disturbances during the palestinian uprising 
the rights group said 12 people were killed and 800 wounded in 
the first three days of the may riots it said four palestinians 
were killed and dozens wounded in the first three days of the 
uprising that began in december 1987 
during the uprising 717 palestinians have been killed by 
israelis and 45 israelis have been slain by palestinians

when state police received an urgent 
dispatch last fall from a desperate officer pleading for help 
dispatchers frantically tried to find offduty police units to see 
if any were in trouble 
none were 
the call turned out to be a hoax it also started a string of 
sporadic calls on police frequencies from a hacker that so far has 
eluded capture 
hes back bigtime and its a real headache trooper lon 
fields spokesman for the state police in morehead said thursday 
its aggravating for the troopers in the field and also the 
dispatchers 
and its a dangerous problem said capt john lile a state 
police spokesman 
when they put out some false information as far as pursuits 
and things like that it can place some officer and citizens in 
danger lile said 
fields said that earlier this week a dispatcher in morehead 
received a call at about 930 pm from unit 960 with sirens 
wailing in the background the officer in the car said he was under 
fire from automatic weapons and requested assistance 
one problem theres no unit 960 
for about an hour he really wreaked havoc fields said 
identical calls were received in cincinnati and columbus ohio 
the transmissions ended about 1130 pm when police sent a 
helicopter out to canvass the area and made each officer check in 
the hacker also has taunted officers telling them to wake up 
and call headquarters 
he has been cutting into transmissions since september but 
until this week he had been silent for several months 
the hacker can only be traced when he is transmitting and since 
his calls are sporadic and he changes frequencies hes hard to 
trace lile said 
irby tallant engineer in charge with the federal communications 
commission in detroit said its difficult to say how often 
something like the situation in kentucky and ohio occurs 
but if its a onetime thing tallant said its very difficult 
to pursue when the calls occur on a continual basis the fcc is 
able to trace signals electronically 
in that case tallant said you have to have a scanner up 
listening to all the frequencies he may bother 
fields said state police are trying to trace the hacker 
interfering with police broadcasts or unauthorized use of a 
police radio is a misdemeanor carrying a sentence of up to a year 
in jail a 500 fine and forfeiture of equipment federal penalties 
include a fine of up to 100000 and a year in prison

harvard university said thursday it will cancel 
the annual international aids conference in 1992 unless the united 
states removes travel restrictions on people infected with the aids 
virus 
the university is scheduled to be host of the meeting the 
principal forum for presenting scientific information on the fight 
against the disease 
many groups have protested us policy that makes aids infection 
one of several contagious diseases for which foreigners can be 
barred from the country almost 100 organizations are boycotting 
this years meeting scheduled to begin next week in san francisco 
we dont believe we can host a conference dedicated to the 
elimination of aids to which people with aids cannot freely 
travel said harvards alan fein director of the 1992 meeting 
a conference that was held under these circumstances would be so 
contentious and ineffective that it would render it not very 
productive 
dr max essex chairman of the harvard aids institute disclosed 
the threatened withdrawal from the meeting in a letter to dr lars 
kallings of the swedish ministry of health who is president of the 
international aids society 
unless it becomes clear that the restrictions will be lifted 
shortly we will withdraw as sponsor for the next usbased 
meeting and cancel the conference scheduled for boston in 1992 
essex wrote 
while harvard did not set a specific deadline fein said it will 
scrap the meeting unless it sees an indication of swift 
movement by congress or the administration to eliminate the 
travel restrictions 
a senate amendment three years ago ordered the public health 
service to add infection by the aids virus to the list of diseases 
including leprosy and tuberculosis that may bar foreigners 
in response to an outcry against the rule the immigration and 
naturalization service announced a waiver policy that allows people 
infected with the virus to stay in the united states up to 30 days 
for business conferences medical treatment or family visits the 
policy eliminated the requirement of permanent identifying marks on 
their passports 
in april it said it would issue 10day visas for those coming 
to this country for professional or scientific conferences those 
applying do not have to say whether they are infected with the aids 
virus 
we have been trying our best as have a lot of others to see 
some sign that our federal government will change its policy 
essex said in an interview but after talking to everybody we 
could find who would talk to us we came to the conclusion 
reluctantly that there is not a lot of action occurring 
he said the international aids society will decide during the 
san francisco meeting whether to try to relocate the 1992 meeting 
or cancel it 
whether the meeting could be held somewhere else is unclear 
fein said it would be difficult for another institution to put 
together a meeting with only two years planning he said that 
bostons major convention hall and 8000 hotel rooms were reserved 
a year ago 
dr robert m wachter of the university of california san 
francisco program director of the san francisco meeting said that 
even though the travel restrictions have eased considerably he 
still considers them to be unacceptable and discriminatory 
they harvard have laid their cards on the table said 
wachter we agree 
the announced boycott is expected to have little effect on the 
scientific reports at the san francisco meeting few presentations 
have been withdrawn and 12000 people are expected 
the 1991 aids meeting will be held in florence italy

the centuryold ladies reading 
circle its membership whittled down by age and changing 
lifestyles on thursday closed the book on a tradition dating back 
to a more genteel era 
a luncheon at the gideon putnam hotel in this city famed for its 
mineral waters and horse racing was the last meeting for the 
literary club which is disbanding after watching its ranks shrink 
over the years from 25 to 10 active members 
were all getting older said club president ellen qua a 
member since 1957 who turns 80 in september im one of the young 
kids 
the last book read by the club was bruce courtenays the power 
of one about south africa the first was in darkest africa 
by henry v stanley the famed explorer who published the 
twovolume work in 1890 the club was founded that year by women 
parishioners at the local baptist church 
that was before television radio and telephone thats the 
way they got together reading circles were common then ms qua 
said 
the club met once a week but over the years that was reduced to 
every other week then every month and finally whenever members 
could get together the last meeting before thursdays was in 
february although winter meetings became infrequent as more 
members spent the season in florida ms qua said 
club meetings featured readings and discussions of books on 
history architecture geology economics poetry as well as 
biographies and various works of fiction 
everything from cooking to mozart said vice president 
althea moncsko 
members chose the books they wanted to read with no 
restrictions 
even if you dont like a writer you should read him anyway to 
find out what his views are ms qua said the written word is 
sort of holy 
todays women have less time to devote to meet and talk about 
books members said 
women are too busy with families and businesses to carry on in 
the afternoon with something like this reading and reviewing 
books ms qua said 
ladies reading circle meetings offered an opportunity for 
afternoon gettogethers for its elderly members who dont like to 
go out at night ms moncsko said 
it has been quite a social closeknit group she said we 
do just hate to give that up

members of congress on thursday attacked the 
administrations request for more money to rescue savings and 
loans accusing the white house of bungling the first bailout and 
failing to pursue fraud vigorously 
a torrent of criticism greeted treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady after he warned the house banking committee that the thrift 
cleanup likely would run out of money before the end of the year 
brady testifying three weeks after the administration doubled 
its estimate of sampl cleanup costs to a range of 89 billion to 132 
billion said the administration would need from about 30 
billion to slightly over 50 billion more in the next fiscal year 
alone 
panel members clearly worried about a backlash from angry 
constituents attacked the administration for delays in prosecuting 
the growing backlog of fraud cases and selling the mountain of sour 
loans and problem real estate inherited from failed thrifts 
i think were sitting on a volcano of public opinion on this 
issue said rep richard e neal dmass i hear continuously 
at the corner store and the supermarket and at the gas station 
when are you guys going to do something about putting the crooks 
in jail 
neals criticism spurred housing secretary jack kemp along with 
brady a member of an administration board overseeing the bailout 
to warn democrats not to make sampls a partisan issue 
i think theres enough blame to go around and i just hope this 
is not going to erupt into the kind of political attack on 
either side he said 
however rep charles schumer dny distinguished between 
blame for the first bailout enacted last august and the coming 
second bailout he said president bush has paid scant attention to 
the sampl cleanup and has allowed it to founder 
the first one there was plenty of blame to go around 
in this second sampl crisis theres not plenty of blame to go 
around weve heard more from the president about broccoli than 
weve heard about this crisis he said 
even republicans including rep chalmers wylie of ohio the 
senior gop member on the panel joined in the assault 
the department of justices efforts to prosecute thrift fraud 
are well intentioned but fall way short of the mark wylie said 
apparently sampl crimes are not a high priority for federal 
prosecutors 
he like democrats complained that the administration was 
spending only 50 million on increased fraud prosecution rather 
than the 75 million congress authorized 
brady defended the administrations performance pointing to 
wednesdays 38count indictment in texas of don dixon former owner 
of vernon savings and loan association a collapsed institution 
that cost taxpayers 13 billion dixon if convicted faces a jail 
sentence of up to 190 years 
as important as the number of scalps we hang on our belts is 
the fact that when we get one theyre dealt with firmly harshly 
and with the appropriate justice for the kind of crime that theyve 
committed brady said 
he pointed out that it took four years of work before dixon 
could be charged and said 17000 suspected cases of fraud have been 
referred to the justice department 
we like everyone want to make sure the crooks are 
prosecuted but we have to realize these are white collar cases it 
isnt like a bank robbery where a guy comes in with a gun sticks 
up a bank and theres cameras taking pictures of him when 
youre talking about bringing one of these white collar people to 
justice youre talking about an enormous amount of time with 
accountants lawyers and files he said

critics of a new law thats designed to 
protect kansas laboratories that use animals for testing are 
bozos from california the states attorney general says 
any selfrespecting kansan would tell them to go to hell 
said attorney general bob stephan 
the legislation makes it a crime to photograph or destroy 
property at an animal research laboratory testing or breeding 
grounds the law was crafted to keep animalrights activists from 
entering a research lab and photographing animals for their 
campaigns against animal testing officials say 
much of the criticism led by a california assemblyman has 
centered on allegations that kansas protects puppy mills 
substandard breeding operations that ship sick animals out of state 
stephan said the measure which was signed into law last month 
does not apply to commercial dog kennels 
its very easy to say kansas has a problem because were 
dealing with those problems up front stephan told reporters 
wednesday meanwhile california does nothing frankly i think 
its very clear if those folks in california who are complaining 
could read they could read the bill 
a truck carrying 5000 pounds of dog biscuits set out from 
sonora calif for topeka on tuesday to protest the legislation 
organizers in california would not disclose when it would arrive 
the protesters originally planned to send 9000 pounds of dog 
bones but worried they would be turned back as a health hazard 
why shouldnt we react this way when some bozos from 
california decide at first to send some bones to our state then 
some dog biscuits stephan asked 
gov mike hayden said he would donate the biscuits to the humane 
society 
the two kansas officials say the states animal inspection laws 
are stronger than those in california they also say california 
officials cannot cite a single complaint involving dogs bred in 
kansas 
california state assemblyman sam farr has led the protest 
introducing legislation that would require california pet stores to 
post where dogs were bred and that would make it illegal for the 
pet stores to knowingly sell a sick dog 
were very disappointed that the governor and the attorney 
general had to resort to name calling to avoid the fact that kansas 
has a lot of puppy mills that send a lot of sick puppies to 
california said farrs aide darryl young 
theres a real problem in kansas young said the governor 
and attorney general are heavily into denial and not the problem 
the protesters want a repeal of the kansas legislation 
stephan said the 1990 kansas law does not apply to dog breeders 
but only those animals used in food fur or fiber production 
agriculture testing or education 
stephan also noted that a 1988 kansas law under which the state 
inspects federally licensed animal laboratories once a year and 
those not licensed by the federal government twice a year was left 
untouched 
hayden noted that california law does not call for that state to 
license or inspect animal dealers at all but some critics say the 
kansas inspection program is underfinanced understaffed and 
ineffective

president bush proclaimed thursday baltic 
freedom day and renewed his call for moscow to engage in 
productive dialogue with baltic leaders aimed at ending unrest 
in those soviet republics 
bush signed a proclamation the senate had requested in a 
resolution 
the right to liberty and selfdetermination free and fair 
elections a better life for themselves and for their children 
these are just aspirations of the people of estonia latvia and 
lithuania on this baltic freedom day we reaffirm our support for 
them bush said in the proclamation 
he reiterated the us position which does not recognize the 
forced incorporation of the three countries by the soviet union in 
1940 
during that fateful summer soviet troops invaded and occupied 
the baltic states the rigged elections that followed put an end to 
baltic selfdetermination 
bush noted however the selfdetermination moves in latvia 
estonia and lithuania in the past year and the democratic elections 
held 
in decisions reflecting the will of the baltic people 
lithuania estonia and latvia have asserted their intention to 
restore their independence 
we support selfdetermination for the baltic peoples and we 
call upon the soviet union to enter a goodfaith dialogue with 
representatives of the baltic governments who received popular 
mandates in free and fair elections we are encouraged by recent 
steps in that direction and hope that a full and productive 
dialogue will materialize bushs proclamation said 
bush earlier in the week lauded soviet president mikhail 
gorbachevs talks with lithuanian leaders as a significant 
change 
the baltic states all are struggling for independence from the 
soviet union 
in lithuania the most aggressive in its breakaway move the 
soviets retaliated with an economic blockade but began to lift the 
blockade by restoring a small amount of fuel export on wednesday 
the bush administration has tried to walk a fine line in its 
reaction to the soviets heavyhandedness in the baltics so as not 
to further weaken the domestically embattled gorbachev 
administration officials initially raised lithuania as a 
stumbling block to normalizing trade relations with the soviet 
union but subsequently eased off that demand saying lithuania was 
never directly linked to us willingness to enter a trade pact

singer olivia newtonjohn was honored this 
week by the united nations as a special ambassador for the 
environment then was slammed by malibu neighbors who call her 
seaside homeunderconstruction a mess 
the california coastal commission on wednesday ruled that a 
seawall built to protect the 6000squarefoot home is taking too 
long to finish but found no fault with methods used to make it 
neighbors had complained about the seawall calling the massive 
pile of sand an eyesore and an environmental hazard 
gretchen buck who lives several hundred feet away said the 
seawall construction involved dumping dirt sand and debris on the 
beach 
some washed out to sea she said and the ocean was so muddied 
for a time that she was forced to suspend her daily swims in the 
exclusive paradise cove area of malibu 
the commission ruling angered her a railroad job thats what 
id call it she said 
investigators for the state panel acknowledged that miss 
newtonjohn and her husband matt lattanzi had violated the 
coastal act by carrying out construction without a permit 
extension but no penalties were levied 
im glad its over and i know olivia is said lattanzi 
neither of us would knowingly do anything to hurt the 
environment 
the couple bought the property in 1981 theyre building a 
solarpowered house designed to resemble a sand castle 
the commission might seek civil fines later said nancy cave 
the agencys chief enforcement officer it can seek penalties of up 
to 5000 a day in cases where applicants knowingly violate coastal 
building codes 
the commission issued a permit for the seawall last june it 
expired nov 1 the panel approved an afterthefact permit for the 
work wednesday criticizing the couple for not requesting an 
extension 
this is a project out of control said william litvak an 
attorney for several neighbors who also contend that grading has 
destabilized bluffs overlooking their properties 
an attorney for the couple disagreed 
because were dealing with a celebrity who also happens to be 
an environmentalist the whole issue has been blown out of 
proportion elizabeth watson said its a hullabaloo about 
nothing 
critics said the singer was receiving special consideration 
because she is a celebrity miss newtonjohn received the united 
nations tribute this week for her work furthering environmental 
causes

a group of house democrats sought thursday to 
expand a special prosecutors investigation to include allegations 
that former housing secretary samuel r pierce jr lied to congress 
all 22 democratic members of the house judiciary committee urged 
attorney general dick thornburgh to refer the issue of whether 
pierce lied last year in congressional testimony to the independent 
counsel who is already investigating other allegations of criminal 
wrongdoing by the former housing secretary 
the lawmakers cited recent testimony by dubois l gilliam a 
former assistant housing secretary who said pierce ordered him to 
award federal housing grants to politically connected developers 
thornburgh was attending an antiterrorism conference in ireland 
and his spokesman dan eramian said we would have to evaluate the 
letter before we made any comment 
gilliam recently told a house subcommittee that pierce used the 
department of housing and urban developments discretionary grant 
program as a private political slush fund 
gilliams testimony last month prompted thornburgh to ask 
independent counsel arlin m adams to investigate allegations of 
political favoritism in the operation of the discretionary fund and 
the urban development action grant program 
adams has issued a series of grand jury subpoenas to pierce and 
former hud aides according to sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the independent counsel who is preparing to widen his 
investigation has decided to grant immunity to gilliam who is 
already serving an 18month prison term for conspiracy and 
accepting illegal gratuities said one source familiar with the 
case 
adams was originally appointed to determine if pierce and other 
top hud officials committed crimes by showing political favoritism 
in the operation of the moderate rehabilitation program 
the latest request by the lawmakers triggers a provision of the 
independent counsel statute that forces the justice department to 
determine if there is a specific and credible allegation that 
should be referred to the special prosecutor 
when he sought adams appointment earlier this year thornburgh 
declined to include allegations of perjury in the independent 
counsels mandate 
thornburgh said at the time that the questions pierce was asked 
by the house government operations employment and housing 
subcommittee and the answers the former secretary gave were not 
specific enough to provide evidence of perjury 
pierce told the subcommittee that he did not have hands on 
involvement in disbursing money through the moderate rehabilitation 
program adding that he never told these people to fund 
anything 
in their letter to thornburgh the 21 democrats said that 
gilliam described at least two instances in which mr pierce was 
directly involved in abuses of the moderate rehabilitation 
program 
but robert plotkin one of pierces defense attorneys said that 
gilliams testimony does not amount to evidence that pierce lied to 
the subcommittee 
gilliam was never asked directly about anything that pierce 
testified about that was of a specific enough nature for him to be 
able to contradict anything plotkin said 
but rep charles schumer dny who circulated the letter he 
and his colleagues signed said gilliam has added new cause to 
look into perjury

thugs wielding guns and machetes broke 
into the home of a former cabinet minister who advocates an end to 
oneparty rule seriously injuring his wife the former official 
said thursday 
the former official kenneth matiba said the attack may be 
linked to his political stand which has incensed the ruling party 
i do not want to make any insinuations but let me say it is 
very hard for me and my family not to associate my stand in public 
affairs with this attack he told a news conference 
matiba who was not home at the time said the attack occurred 
at about midnight wednesday at his 40acre farm and residence 15 
miles north of nairobi the capital 
he said a group of about 15 men calling each other corporal 
and captain broke through heavy iron grills over the windows and 
into his bedroom where his daughter and maid had sought refuge with 
his wife 
the attackers who repeatedly asked for matiba rifled through 
some drawers took a handbag and necklace of little value and hit 
his wife edith on the head with an instrument heavy enough to 
fracture her skull he said 
the swahilispeaking attackers also beat up his daughter and 
maid neither of whom required hospitalization 
the thugs fired two shots at neighbors who came to help and 
then fled matiba said 
while residential breakins are not uncommon in kenya matiba 
said the attack at his house was not over valuables 
seeing that they stole nothing what else did they want its 
me they made it clear he said 
matiba a prosperous hotelier who was at one of his 
establishments on kenyas coast at the time of the attack said his 
daughter described the intruders as ranging in age between 25 and 
35 years old 
he said police were investigating the incident 
since launching his campaign earlier this year calling for 
public debate on returning kenya to multiparty politics matiba has 
been condemned repeatedly by ruling party leaders and 
parliamentarians 
he said he also had been threatened and regularly is followed by 
what he believes are government intelligence officers 
president daniel arap moi who has described matibas campaign 
as divisive in 1982 pushed a law through parliament making the 
ruling kenya african national union the sole legal political party 
moi is president of the party which has ruled the former british 
colony since independence in 1963 
this is not the first time matiba has riled the government 
he was expelled from the ruling party early last year after he 
refused to back down on claims that party elections the previous 
year were rigged he resigned his cabinet post as minister of 
transport and communication over the same issue in late 1988

the bush administration said thursday it would 
not impose economic sanctions against india even though that 
country has refused to negotiate over trade barriers the united 
states deems offensive 
in announcing the decision the administration said it would 
pursue the issues in the current round of global freetrade talks 
but would not retaliate by boosting tariffs on imports by india 
into the united states 
india was targeted last year along with japan and brazil for a 
possible sanctions under the toughest section of the 1988 trade 
law known as super 301 the provision required the administration 
to draw up a priority hit list of the most offensive barriers 
to us trade exports 
both japan and brazil negotiated their way off the super 301 
list by reaching marketopening agreements however india has 
steadfastly refused to negotiate over us claims that it is 
unfairly blocking foreign investment and operation of foreign 
insurance companies 
but us trade representative carla hills said the 
administration was encouraged by indias announcement on may 31 
that it would remove some of its investment barriers 
our message that foreign investment brings jobs technology 
and prosperity may be getting through i hope this attitude will be 
reflected in indias approach to these issues in the uruguay 
round she said 
the administration has made the uruguay round named for the 
country where the talks began in 1986 its top trade priority for 
the year india is considered a key participant in those talks 
being held under the auspices of the 96nation general agreement on 
tariffs and trade because of its influence over other developing 
countries 
the united states hopes to win support from developing countries 
for its push to eliminate farm subsidies strengthen copyright 
protection for us companies and expand gatt rules to cover trade 
in services such as banking and insurance 
the indian government which has contended that the united 
states was violating global trading rules through its unilateral 
threats of retaliation praised the us decision 
one would hope this decision marks the return of the united 
states to the multilateral process said shipra biswas a 
spokeswoman for the indian commerce ministry in new delhi few 
would argue that our policies on investment and insurance are 
unreasonable because they have to be in line with our 
socioeconomic goals 
while thursdays decision removes the possibility of economic 
retaliation immediately the administration in april renamed india 
to a hit list for the current year citing the same trade 
barriers the deadline for reaching a conclusion on that action 
will not come until june 1991

playing a very important role in shaping the character of our 
nation 
in a proclamation recognizing sundays celebration of fathers 
day bush said the day is a time to thank dads everywhere for all

our own we become ever more grateful for our fathers love and 
discipline and for the many sacrifices he has made we begin to 
see clearly how being a father requires faith and fortitude bush

negotiators at eastwest talks on 
reducing europes conventional forces are close to agreement on 
overall limits for the number of tanks and armored combat vehicles 
diplomats said thursday 
they said they expected imminent formal agreement on ceilings in 
the two weapons categories and said this would speed negotiations 
for an initial agreement at the talks by the end of the year 
the negotiations on conventional forces in europe are designed 
to reduce troops and nonnuclear weapons of the two military 
alliances from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains 
the 16 member nations of the north atlantic treaty organization 
and seven warsaw pact countries are taking part 
the breakthrough came from the french and the poles 
their proposal suggests an overall ceiling for armored combat 
vehicles of 30000 for each side and a ceiling of 20000 tanks for 
each side 
it sets minimum weight parameters of 165 tons for tanks 
regardless of whether they have tracks or wheels 
french chief delegate francois plaisant said at a joint news 
conference with polands wlodzimierz konarski there was informal 
but overall consensus on the proposal 
a press statement by soviet delegation leader oleg a grinevski 
said an important step has doubtlessly been made this 
solution means substantial progress at the vienna negotiations 
a minor setback occurred however at a closeddoor meeting of 
delegates from all 23 countries at which the proposal had been 
expected to be made final said a western diplomat speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the soviet side said it first wanted to see an equipment list 
that is to accompany the agreement the diplomat said no one at 
the soviet delegation could be reached for comment 
the western diplomat called the development a negative step 
but expressed hope it could be worked out quickly at current 
informal meetings 
the breakthrough came after weeks when negotiators from both 
sides complained petty bargaining was slowing the talks western 
diplomats said the soviets appeared to be dragging their feet until 
the future security allegiance of a united germany is decided 
but the diplomats said they had detected a willingness to move 
forward in recent weeks 
both sides hope to have an agreement ready for signing by 
december when leaders from 35 nations including the 23 involved 
in the vienna talks are scheduled to meet in paris 
the other 12 participants are neutral and nonaligned countries 
in europe that also would be affected by reducing tensions on the 
continent 
finding common definitions for tanks and other armaments has 
been a contentious issue at the vienna talks 
thursdays proposal no longer makes a distinction between 
armored troop carriers and other armored vehicles removing a 
further obstacle 
konarski said the text in a future treaty will include a list of 
the arms they would carry classifying all the weapons the two 
sides now have 
he said this would be unprecedented in eastwest relations he 
said these lists would then become the basis for the reductions 
according to us estimates the west now has 23600 tanks and 
the warsaw pact 52500 and 34025 armored combat vehicles to the 
warsaw pacts 59400 
konarski said the use of broader categories of definitions was 
the only way to conclude a deal under the circumstances but he and 
plaisant said many issues remain to be resolved before a final 
agreement can be signed

hospitals and nursing homes may challenge a 
states medicaid reimbursement system the supreme court ruled 
thursday in a decision that could have a major financial impact 
the justices in a 54 vote said the virginia hospital 
association may use a federal civil rights law to sue virginia over 
the states medicaid payment rates 
at a time of soaring medical costs and an increasing demand for 
medicaid services the decision could force the federal and state 
governments to cough up more money for the program that provides 
medical care for the poor 
this should increase the amount of reimbursement that 
hospitals will get for providing medicaid patients with care 
said fredric j entin general counsel for the american hospital 
association 
he said he could not estimate how much reimbursements might rise 
if hospitals are successful with their lawsuits 
if the hospital association wins its case in federal court the 
states hospitals would get 25 million to 27 million more per 
year in medicaid reimbursements said laurens sartoris association 
president about half would come from the federal government and 
half from state coffers virginia hospitals now get about 230 
million from medicaid he said 
in this fiscal year total medicaid expenses for the nation are 
expected to approach 71 billion about 56 percent borne by the 
federal government and the rest by the states 
hospitals in colorado pennsylvania and michigan have won 
lawsuits similar to the virginia hospital associations though 
some of the decisions are on appeal cases also are pending in 
wisconsin oregon and ohio said mary babich a spokeswoman for the 
american hospital association 
officials from most states had urged the supreme court to rule 
against the virginia association they said allowing such lawsuits 
could affect hundreds of millions of dollars in federal and state 
funding and lead to a litigation explosion 
the medicaid program in almost every state is having financial 
difficulties said jeff harris a researcher for the medicaid 
management institute which is part of the american public welfare 
association 
this opens the door to tremendous increases in costs he 
said adding that it also ties the hands of state legislatures by 
allowing judicial rate setting for hospitals nursing homes and 
doctors 
sartoris disagreed saying i dont think the floodgates are 
going to open 
he added that it wouldnt surprise me that some states 
would file suit but he said providers have a tremendous burden 
to prove that the states program doesnt meet the federal standard 
whether the supreme court decision would help physicians who 
might challenge medicaid reimbursements was unclear harris said it 
would but martin a donlan an attorney for the virginia 
association was doubtful 
the court led by justice william j brennan said congress 
never intended to bar medicaid care providers from suing in federal 
court when reimbursement disputes arise 
the court said congress gave health care providers the right to 
sue in federal court when it amended the medicaid act in 1980 
that amendment introduced by sen david boren dokla 
requires states to reimburse health care providers according to 
rates the state finds and makes assurances satisfactory to the 
secretary of health and human services are reasonable and 
adequate 
writing for the majority brennan said the amendment creates a 
right enforceable in a private cause of action to have the 
state adopt rates that it finds are reasonable and adequate rates 
to meet the costs of an efficient and economical health care 
provider 
brennan was joined by justices byron r white thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy dissented 
in its 1986 lawsuit the virginia hospital association sued the 
state alleging that the toolow rates violate the federal medicaid 
act and the rights of participating hospitals to due process 
virginia officials sought to have the suit dismissed contending 
that only health care recipients not individual or associated 
health care providers have the right to sue under the medicaid 
act

examined by her doctors at the nurses office in the courthouse 
lawyers said mrs marcos blood pressure had shot up but then 
stabilized and the trial continued after the lunch recess

before because of mrs marcos health problems most recently on 
may 31 when she was hospitalized for a stomach ailment related to

a doctors report submitted to us district judge john f 
keenan last week said mrs marcoss blood pressure and heartbeat

dollars allegedly stolen from a governmentowned bank to personal 
purchases for mrs marcos

family especially imee whom she hasnt seen in four years and who 
reportedly is living in northern africa mrs marcos two other 
children ferdinand marcos jr and irene marcos araneta have

treasury by mrs marcos and her late husband president ferdinand 
marcos 
mrs marcos is accused of having used the stolen money for 
luxury purchases and secret investments in new york real estate

bank of which more than 3 million was used to buy jewelry for 
mrs marcos 
the remaining money was used to buy designer clothes for mrs 
marcos and her daughters fur coats and other expenses such as 
hotel and limousine bills the accountant said 
prosecutors have said mrs marcos used the philippine national 
banks new york office as her personal piggy bank for spending 
sprees during visits to new york 
jimenez said she was an accountant for the philippine commission 
on good government which was established after marcos was deposed 
in february 1986 to trace money he allegedly took from the treasury

even as crews tried to lasso a widening oil 
slick off the texas coast thursday lawmakers in washington tried 
to patch up legislation designed to prevent future oil spills 
rep gerry studds dmass proposed a compromise that he hopes 
will break a legislative logjam holding up such legislation the 
bill would toughen penalties against oil spillers quadruple limits 
on liability for tanker operators require double hulls on new oil 
tankers and establish a 1 billion fund available for cleanup 
emergencies 
the legislative manuvering comes amid a spate of oil spills 
in the past week a fire and spill on the norwegian tanker mega 
borg off galveston texas threatened the gulf coastline with a 
major environmental disaster a tanker grounding off staten island 
ny sent tar balls up on the jersey shore and a cruise ship that 
struck rocks near the cape cod canal spilled 7500 gallons of fuel 
oil soiling nearby cape cod beaches 
but a housesenate conference committee has run aground on 
whether to participate in international oilspill protocols 
the house version would have the us participate even though 
the protocols are somewhat more lenient toward ship owners 
responsible for spills in international waters the senate wants to 
hold ship owners entirely responsible when spills harm the us 
coast 
unfortunately the debate over the international convention is 
exactly where it was six months ago and six years ago studds 
said if we dont do something to break the logjam well be 
debating this issue until every beach in america has been coated 
with oil 
studds wrote to 100 members of the conference committee thursday 
to explain his compromise proposal 
under studds compromise the united states would participate in 
the international protocols for up to five years and during that 
time would try to strengthen their oil spill provisions if the 
negotiations are successful we would continue to participate in 
the global agreements studds said if not we would go our own 
way

the house overwhelmingly passed legislation 
thursday that would prevent huge corporate farms from receiving 
federally subsidized water and force growers to chose between crop 
price supports and lowcost water 
the two measures directed primarily at farmers in california 
and other western states aim at curbing what critics say is an 
abuse of the bureau of reclamation system the federal government 
has been building dams in the west since early in this century to 
supply water for farming 
both measures were amendments to a routine water projects bill 
that passed by a voice vote the projects bill authorized spending 
for modifications to the buffalo bill dam and reservoir in wyoming 
the first of the two amendments which passed by a 31697 vote 
would tighten ownership rules to end abuses of size limit on farms 
that can receive federally subsidized water 
the general accounting office and other investigations found 
that corporate farms of as much as 23000 acres were receiving 
subsidized water despite a 960acre limit this was done through 
creating a patchwork quilt of farms that were separately owned only 
on paper 
were not telling people they have to get rid of their land or 
their water said rep george miller dcalif sponsor of the 
amendment were saying that a farmer reaches a certain point 
where he no longer needs to receive a costly federal subsidy 
the second of the two amendments which passed 33855 would 
phase out irrigation subsidies to grow surplus crops that 
amendment was introduced by rep sam gejdenson dconn 
it does not do away with irrigation subsidies altogether 
said rep thomas e petri rwis in support of the amendment 
it merely requires farmers to chose one subsidy or the other 
the agriculture department says that in 1986 commodity payments 
of nearly 380 million went to farmers using bureau of reclamation 
projects at the same time according to the interior department 
figures cited by backers of the amendment farmers growing surplus 
crops received 830 million worth of irrigation subsidies 
rep charles pashayan jr rcalif said the subsidy bill could 
be particularly harmful to small farmers 
it is an amendment whose result will be to discourage 
production of that very thing at which americans are the very best 
at in the world namely food and fiber he said

government and education officials said 
thursday that the nation has failed noncollege bound youth but 
efforts are underway to better connect the path students travel 
from school to the work force 
from birth to the end of their working lives we invest less 
in our blue collar work force than any of the major countries with 
which we compete said marc tucker president of the national 
center on education and the economy 
we give them less care when they are infants and children we 
expect less of them in school we give them less job training when 
they start out we let them sink or swim when they try to get into 
the work force and we provide them with less training once they 
are at work 
tuckers comments echoed a report by the general accounting 
office that claimed the attention of a hearing by a joint economic 
subcommittee the report said 9 million americans are illequipped 
to hold entrylevel jobs while england germany japan and sweden 
all do a better job of preparing noncollege bound youth for 
employment 
raymond uhalde of the department of labor said the agency 
generally agrees with the findings but stressed the upcoming 
reauthorization of the carl d perkins vocational education act 
is likely to promote new connections between academic and 
occupational skills and curricula 
uhalde said the legislation would encourage the development of 
new curricula and technology that teach basic skills in the context 
of occupationally oriented education 
franklin frazier director of the gao office of education and 
employment issues said the study found the four competitor nations 
have national policies that guide students transition from school 
to work 
many of the countries establish competencybased national 
training standards that they use to certify skill competency the 
common us practice is to certify only program completion 
the study also found that competitors invest extensively in 
jobless outofschool youth to assure them a job or further 
education and training us employment and training programs reach 
only a modest proportion of youth in need 
the study had been requested by rep james scheuer dny 
chairman of the committees education and health subcommittee and 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif a jec member and chairman of the 
house education and labor committee they asked for a comparison of 
how the united states and competitor countries prepare noncollege 
youth for employment because of the perception that foreign 
competitors excel in world trade with bettereducated workers 
gordon ambach executive director of the council of chief state 
school officers said resolving the problem has become the groups 
top priority for the next year 
ambach noting action should begin in november said the council 
is designing new ways for youth to enter the work force including 
apprenticeships

hundreds of rioting jews rushed into a 
palestinian neighborhood and hurled stones at homes thursday after 
an arab woman stabbed an 11yearold jew in east jerusalem 
the wounding of the boy was the second such attack in mostly 
arab east jerusalem in three days mayor teddy kollek blamed the 
stabbing on arab fears of israels new rightwing government 
after dark angry jewish residents blocked a major road in east 
talpiot the jewish neighborhood where the stabbing took place 
they shouted death to the arabs while others drove around in 
their cars honking the horns witnesses and police said 
police brought in reinforcements but some rioters broke through 
police lines and threw stones at houses in neighboring sur baher 
an arab village they also set fire to bushes and an olive grove 
there police reports said 
groups of palestinians from sur baher met the attackers with a 
barrage of stones and paramilitary border police fired tear gas to 
disperse them police then forced the jewish protesters back to 
east talpiot 
there were no immediate reports of any injuries or arrests in 
the riot which lasted for about three hours the national itim 
news agency estimated about 500 jews took part in the protest 
the stabbed boy idan mizrahi was waiting at a bus stop at the 
edge of east talpiot in israeliannexed east jerusalem when the 
woman approached and stabbed him according to authorities and 
media reports 
idan was reported in good condition at a hospital after surgeons 
removed the knife from his back 
police said the woman fled toward sur baher police cordoned off 
the area and searched for her taking 25 palestinian women in for 
questioning police chief arye bibi said 
bibi said the attacker was motivated by palestinian nationalism 
on tuesday a palestinian knifed and wounded a 17yearold 
jewish seminary student outside east jerusalems walled old city 
police said they are holding a suspect who confessed 
before thursdays riots jewish residents in the east talpiot 
area angry about the stabbing had demanded better security from 
police minister ronnie milo 
there is no doubt this is a serious incident and it requires 
us to think again how to recruit the full amount of resources 
and forces to confront the problem of uprising here in jerusalem 
in israel and other places milo said 
palestinians in december 1987 began fighting occupation of 
territories seized by israel from neighboring arab states in the 
1967 middle east war most of the violence has been confined to the 
gaza strip and west bank but some palestinians want resistance 
stepped up in arab east jerusalem 
israeli also seized east jerusalem in 1967 later annexing it 
and declaring jerusalem the capital of the jewish state 
kollek a jew blamed thursdays stabbing on the breakdown of 
the peace process and also cited the formation of a new rightwing 
government in israel 
i imagine the arabs are scared and worried im certain 
there wont be war and this government would do all it can to 
bring peace about but until something happens people who are 
scared do all kinds of foolish things kollek said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir leader of the rightwing likud 
bloc took the helm of a new government this week with backing from 
hardline religious parties 
the leftofcenter labor party brought down the previous 
government saying it should have accepted us proposals to open 
peace talks with palestinians 
in the occupied west bank on thursday the decapitated body of 
ibrahim sahnawi a suspected arab informer was found on a hilltop 
near jenin refugee camp arab reporters said the army confirmed 
the death 
in the 30monthold uprising 717 palestinians have been killed 
by israelis and 45 israelis have been killed

you say 2 live crews too bad for you 
meet mary morello a 66yearold retired school teacher 
organizing some likeminded folk in chicagos suburbs and beyond to 
defend the right to rock from those who would might rather have it 
muzzled 
i think we have to be really careful about freedom of 
speech said morello who has sent about 350 letters to rally 
support for her fledgling group parents for rock and rap 
it seems sometimes people dont notice if some of their rights 
are taken away she said recently 
the former teacher of african studies and world history went to 
work for rock after seeing a promotional film by the arlington 
vabased parents music resource center which has helped in the 
fight against explicit lyrics 
the film shown by a police officer at a pta meeting in her town 
of libertyville a suburb northwest of chicago was a little 
dull but nonetheless sensationalized the impact of rock and rap 
music on young peoples thinking she said 
i introduced myself and spoke for about 10 minutes about 
the right of artists to have their music and art be uncensored 
she said 
she got another push from her son tom a 26yearold harvard 
university graduate and fulltime musician in lock up a hardrock 
band who sent his mother some material on music censorship 
the elder morello last month obtained a mailing list from long 
beach califbased rock and roll confidential which distributes 
an anticensorship pamphlet 
using 100 in seed money she asked people on the mailing list 
to be on the alert for possible censorship and to join her 
coalition 
so far she has received about 30 responses to the initial 
mailing and envisions a statebystate organization that will 
monitor legislation and be an alternate voice on this issue of 
censoring 
i dont think anyone should feel fear about writing something 
or performing something in a democracy morello said 
however the parents music resource center said the issue is 
not censorship but an entertainment culture that is increasingly 
violent and explicit 
we need to work with parents to help teach their children to 
be more critical and to make better choices executive director 
jennifer norwood said thursday 
morellos son lead guitarist for lock up said his mother comes 
to her cause naturally 
my mom has always been a very independent thinker tom said 
from dallas where his band was performing she introduced me to 
the temptations and stevie wonder i returned the favor by 
introducing her to jimi hendrix and led zepplin 
the elder morello said she even defends 2 live crew a raunchy 
rap band thrust into the national spotlight after a federal judge 
in florida last week declared their last album as nasty as they 
wanna be obscene 
i bought their album i listened to it she said 
have you heard it well that isnt the way i talk or the way 
people talk to me she said but thats the album and thats 
2 live crews own business

a powerful bomb exploded at a 
british army training area outside hanover on thursday badly 
damaging an unoccupied building and breaking windows in nearby 
homes 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack 
however the british military has been the target of a rash of 
bombings and shooting attacks in western europe carried out by the 
irish republican army as part of its terror campaign to end british 
rule in northern ireland 
maj leslie hutchison spokesman for the 4th armored division 
said no one was near the site of thursdays explosion 
however he added there was quite severe damage to the side 
of an unoccupied building which is normally used as a lecture 
hall 
the training area is on the weser river 12 miles southwest of 
hanover in lower saxony state hutchinson said it is used primarily 
by the british armys 35th engineer regiment and the 28th 
amphibious regiment 
a 4th armored division spokeswoman lynne gammond later told 
the associated press in a telephone interview that investigators 
had determined the explosion was caused by a bomb probably made 
up of plastic explosives 
she said the bomb also broke windows in german homes across a 
busy highway about 25 yards away 
its a wonder some germans were not injured ms gammond 
said 
she said it was too early to determine who had carried out the 
attack 
to say at this point it was the ira would be speculation the 
investigation is still being conducted ms gammond said 
thursdays explosion comes 12 days after the ira claimed 
responsibility for the shooting death of british army maj michael 
john dillonlee as he was returning to his home in dortmund before 
dawn on june 2 
the same day one british soldier was shot to death and two 
soldiers were wounded in a daylight attack at a rail station in 
lichfield central england 
dillonlee was the 14th person killed by the ira in europe since 
1978 
the predominantly catholic ira is fighting to unite northern 
ireland which is 60 percent protestant with the 95 percent 
catholic irish republic

the bush administration came under renewed 
attack for its policies on global warming thursday as a senator 
charged that oilrich saudi arabia was allowed to scuttle an 
aggressive response strategy at a recent international conference 
sen albert gore dtenn questioned why a united nations 
panel headed by the united states recently failed to include 
among its option for dealing with global warming specific targets 
for pollution controls 
instead you seemed to be recommending that we do nothing he 
told the head of the us delegation to the conference frederick 
bernthal at a senate hearing on global warming 
bernthal was chairman of the working group that at a conference 
in geneva recently drafted a formal series of responses that 
nations should take to deal with the global warming issue the 
final draft which will be released later this year will not include 
specific recommendations or timetables for pollution controls 
bernthal said 
gore charged that at the conference the delegation from saudi 
arabia repeatedly blocked any attempt to come up with specific 
pollution controls without the united states responding the 
burning of fossil fuels including oil is the source of carbon 
dioxide which accounts for about half of the global warming 
pollutants that go into the atmosphere 
gore questioned why the us delegation did not counter the 
arguments made by the saudi delegation which he said was 
represented that countrys oil ministry 
instead the us delegates sat on their hands saying very 
little while the saudis and some others blasted the hell out of any 
policy option that would have led to pollution reductions said 
gore 
bernthal said there was no hope of gaining a consensus on 
specific pollution control goals every country in the room would 
have had a different answer he said 
scientists generally agree that manmade pollution primarily 
from the burning of fossil fuels is causing the earth to become 
warmer the bush administration has argued repeatedly however 
that no specific commitments for pollution control should be made 
until the severity of the threat becomes clearer 
three study groups of the united nations intergovernmental panel 
on climate change have attempted for more than a year to examine 
the severity of the problem and what responses nations should take 
bernthals working group is focusing on response strategies 
environmentalists have for months criticized bush for failing to 
announce specific reductions in carbon dioxide emissions several 
european countries including the dutch west germany and great 
britain have announced such goals

president vaclav havels civic 
forum victor in czechoslovakias free elections refused to take 
no for an answer thursday and said it still wants a coalition with 
the christian democratic alliance 
the civic forum and its slovak ally public against violence 
won 170 of the 300 seats in parliament last weekend but fell short 
of the threefifths majority it needs in both chambers to pass 
major constitutional changes 
the christian democratic union a loose grouping of three 
parties won 40 seats far less than it expected but enough to 
block constitutional changes in the slovak part of parliaments 
150seat house of nations 
the slovak christian democratic movement is the strongest of the 
three parties its leader jan carnogursky said on tv tuesday 
night he will not play fifth fiddle in the government and 
wanted half the seats in the new cabinet 
informed sources close to the coalition talks said carnogursky 
also saw himself as a candidate for the job of premier havel has 
already charged the incumbent excommunist marian calfa with 
forming a government 
observers see the nomination of calfa a career communist party 
official who only turned in his party card in january as the 
likely source of friction in the talks civic forum officials said 
they still hope to break the deadlock 
civic forum spokeswoman jana ryslinkova told journalists 
thursday during the last talks between the civic forum and the 
christian democratic union there was nothing said or done that 
could be considered as the final end of coalition talks no 
ultimatums were given on either side 
on behalf of the civic forum i can confirm that we shall do 
our best to form a coalition with the christian democrats 
one key issue in the talks is the interior ministry 
richard sacher a leader of the peoples party which is in the 
christian democratic union is the incumbent minister but sacher 
has come under fire for alleged reluctance to investigate past 
operations of the hated secret police 
he has further been hurt by allegations by havel aides that 
peoples party chairman josef bartoncik was a paid secret police 
agent for 17 years 
bartonciks party announced his suspension on thursday 
peoples party general secretary jiri cerny resigned hours later 
over what party officials described as a personal matter 
the disarray in not confined to the christian democrat camp jan 
urban abruptly resigned as civic forums campaign manager on 
monday the day after its election victory 
at least two prominent people who won parliamentary mandates for 
civic forum said they will not take their seats meaning lesser 
known inexperienced people will become deputies 
talks on forming governments in the countrys two republics the 
czech and slovak republics proceeded more smoothly 
slovak interior minister vladimir meciar a member of public 
against violence was given the job of forming the slovak

energy secretary james watkins on thursday 
ordered his department to go ahead with development of a 
radioactive waste repository in new mexico saying it meets all 
required environmental laws 
but he said the plant near carlsbad nm will not receive any 
radioactive wastes until january at the earliest because of 
continuing tests 
i will not compromise health or safety concerns to meet any 
schedule said watkins 
the departments waste isolation pilot plant will accept highly 
radioactive waste over a five year test period beginning next year 
he said 
watkins signed a formal record of decision on a supplement 
to the environmental impact statement for the plant certifying 
that the plant meets federal environmental laws 
the department said however further tests would be conducted 
on some environmental issues such as gas generated from metal drums 
and wastes created as a result of corrosion or bacterial action 
the plant will be the countrys first central repository for 
radioactive wastes from nearly a dozen nuclear weapons plants the 
wastes will be placed in salt beds 2150 feet under the ground 
the department has made significant progress in resolving the 
issues under our direct control in order to conduct the test phase 
in an environmentally safe manner said watkins 
we have a consensus from the scientific community that doe 
should begin the test phase at the earliest time possible 
commensurate with satisfactory completion of applicable safety 
requirements he said 
in boise idaho gov cecil d andrus said he was encouraged by 
watkins announcement but idahoans have seen many previous 
deadlines for opening wipp come and go 
idaho and some other western states have refused to accept more

owners of small passenger planes made by 
fairchild aircraft corp have been ordered not to let passengers 
sit by windows that may be prone to break in midflight 
the federal aviation administration airworthiness directive 
issued tuesday bars passengers from riding in seat 2e on the 
right side of the plane unless a doublepaned window is installed 
horizon air president john kelly said tuesday that doublepane 
windows were being installed on the companys fairchild metro iii 
turboprop under a company decision made before the directive was 
issued 
the directive stems from an incident saturday in which a window 
broke on a horizon flight between portland ore and yakima 
leaving a hole an inch in diameter 
three weeks ago a portland man on a horizon flight from 
portland to seattle was partially sucked out of a metro iii when 
the window by his seat 2e shattered about 14000 feet over 
olympia 
a similar incident occurred in europe in 1988 
the faa has received three reports of the second passenger 
window on the right side breaking in flight on fairchild sa226 and 
sa227 series airplanes in each of these reports the airplane was 
flying in icing conditions the directive said 
ice shed from the propeller may have struck the window 
causing either holes or cracks in two reports the weakened window 
could not contain the cabin pressure which resulted in rapid cabin 
decompression 
plane owners have 30 days to follow the directive until they 
do they must post signs at 2e saying do not occupy this seat at 
any time 
michele owsley of the faa in texas said the problem of 
midflight window breakage may be unique to fairchild planes 
she said concern was raised after a cockpit window blew out and 
caused an injury in 1988 that incident resulted in an faa order 
for inspection of windows to check for cracks after every 2500 
hours of service roughly five months 
bob kennison assistant to the president of fairchild aircraft 
corp said monday he did not know whether the company had more 
window problems than other manufacturers of small passenger 
airplanes

released after he visited the memorial he proclaimed not only flag 
day but flag week 
later veterans in american legion and amvets caps along with 
cameracarrying tourists swarmed over capitol hill where rows of 
american flags hung limp in the heat while lawmakers poured forth 
flag day oratory 
on main streets across the nation americans decked front 
porches with american flags in honor of the day 
bush called on all americans to observe flag day and flag week 
by flying the stars and stripes from their homes and other suitable 
places 
he said nothing about the proposed constitutional amendment 
which passed its first hurdle in the house on wednesday two days 
after the supreme court threw out last years flag protection law 
to become part of the constitution the amendment will need 
twothirds support in both the house and the senate and 
ratification by 38 state legislatures 
on this joyous occasion may we also renew our determination 
to uphold the ideals enshrined in our constitution and declaration 
of independence the president said in his statement 
sen bob kerrey dneb who won the medal of honor in vietnam 
called the push for a flag amendment an attempt to divide 
america to divide fathers against sons he said it would reopen 
the generation gap of the vietnam era 
kerrey held up a picture of bush laughing at a white house 
meeting as sen bob dole rkan held a flag a picture the 
senator said that showed the real point of the debate was to gain 
political advantage 
i am ashamed of what he did kerrey declared in an 
impassioned speech on the senate floor 
he has chosen to divide his country on an issue that frankly 
in my opinion should not be given this much attention kerrey 
later told a rally of congressional veterans against the amendment 
sen john c danforth rmo parting company with conservative 
colleagues took the senate floor to oppose the amendment 
we thank god do not live in a brittle fragile country 
because in our country anybody is free to express himself 
danforth said 
the debate over the flag resounded in incidents across america 
townspeople of northfield minn awoke to find 3000 small 
plastic flags planted in their lawns by employees of a real estate 
company as an important part of our heritage but one local 
critic grumbled that it was an intrusive political statement 
elsewhere 
retired cincinnati librarian paul payne 81 vowed to burn a 
flag to protest a us policy of bullying little nations 
supporting murder and massacre but he changed his mind and the 
scene in fountain square turned into a celebration as a radio 
station gave away small american flags 
vermont state archivist gregory sanford in montpelier declared 
himself enflamed by the controversy over flag burning and said 
the government should require flag makers to use fireproof cloth

year that would have banned burning and other desecration of the 
american flag 
dole scoffed at the notion that flag burning represents free 
speech and thus should not be outlawed its malicious stupid 
irresponsible conduct not speech dole said

with a proposal this week the new york stock 
exchange has laid plans it hopes will lead to roundtheclock stock 
trading 
financial observers caution that 24hour trading an idea that 
has been under discussion and study for the past two decades or 
more is likely to develop only slowly and in stages 
in any event they say the image of mad midnight scrambles to 
buy ibm or sell atampt remains a distant prospect rather than an 
impending reality 
the nyse which now operates from 930 am to 4 pm eastern 
time monday through friday has come up with plans to begin 
experimenting with afterhours trading later this year chairman 
john j phelan jr said thursday the plan could lead to 
roundtheclock trading by the year 2000 
in its early stages the proposal provides for auctions to 
handle orders in individual stocks in batches at 8 pm midnight 
and 5 am starting sometime in 1991 
this presumably would provide individual investors with a chance 
to act more quickly on news that breaks or decisions they make when 
the market now is closed 
but analysts agree that is not the primary driving force behind 
the plan rather they say the nyse is trying to keep or regain 
business involving large institutional customers that is drifting 
away to competitors notably markets in europe and japan 
secondly they add the proposal is a response to pressure from 
technological advances that have made international trading by 
computer and advanced communications systems increasingly 
attractive and economical 
this is an awareness by the management of the nyse that 
electronic trading will be more and more important as we move 
through the 1990s said perrin long a securities industry 
analyst at the firm of lipper analytical services 
wall street has been moving however slowly in the direction of 
24hour stock trading for a long time in 1974 the nyse and other 
smaller markets based in the eastern united states extended the 
close of business from 330 pm to 4 pm 
then in 1985 the opening was advanced from 10 am to 930 
am in a direct response to growth of european trading in us 
stocks 
also observers point out as finance has become an increasingly 
global business markets for foreign currency exchange and bonds 
already have gone to what amounts to aroundtheclock global 
trading 
why not just adopt a weneverclose policy for the stock market 
as well and be done with the question many members of the stock 
exchanges various constituencies long have had reasons for 
resisting the idea 
brokers who deal with the public for example have been 
reluctant to take on the extra operating expense without better 
assurance that there will sufficient demand for their services 
during the offhours 
at the same time automation of trades is seen as a threat to 
the brokers called specialists who operate on stock exchange 
trading floors as a kind of meeting point for buy and sell orders 
if their function could somehow be filled at night by black 
boxes the reasoning goes it probably wouldnt be long before 
the same machines were taking over in the daytime as well 
for their part specialists maintain that they serve their 
function better than computers could any time 
the prospect of afterhours trading also raises other questions 
how would the transactions be reported in the news media and how 
would they be accounted for in the market averages and indexes 
if stocks can trade at midnight what about options and futures 
contracts on stocks and stock indexes if there no were no official 
closing price each day what substitute standard might be used 
for such legal purposes as the valuing of gifts and estates 
some of these questions might yield easy answers and others 
prove more stubborn but in the eyes of a good many observers even 
the most difficult seem likely only to delay not to prevent the 
movement toward an aroundtheclock aroundtheworld stock market 
we are on the road to 24hour trading said harrison roth a 
specialist in stock options trading at the new york firm of cowen amp 
co theres no doubt about it

tens of thousands of miners called to 
the capital by presidentelect ion iliescu to help put down 
antigovernment protests on thursday clubbed passersby and 
journalists and occupied the offices of the main opposition 
newspaper 
few police and soldiers were visible late thursday in bucharest 
the miners armed with cudgels their faces and work clothes still 
smudged with coal dust were apparently left to maintain order in 
this city of 22 million residents as they saw fit 
in reaction to the disorder in this capital and violence that 
left at least five people dead and 350 injured the state news 
agency rompress said the newly elected parliament which had been 
scheduled to meet on thursday had delayed its session until monday 
miners streamed into bucharest from as far away as 240 miles 
after two days of unrest in which security forces clashed with 
demonstrators who claim the governing national salvation front of 
iliescu is dominated by communists associated with the ousted 
regime of dictator nicolae ceausescu 
ceausescu and his wife elena were executed dec 25 three days 
after an uprising began when 94 protesters were killed by 
government forces in the western city of timisoara the government 
says a total of 1038 civilians and soldiers died in the 
prodemocratic revolution 
the latest casualties occurred when police cleared a 2monthold 
demonstration from a central square wednesday then fired on 
protesters who attacked government buildings and overturned cars 
setting them ablaze 
it was the worst violence in romania since the uprising paved 
the way for free elections last month that were won by iliescu the 
interim president and his national salvation front 
in washington president bushs office condemned in the 
strongest possible terms what it called governmentinspired 
vigilante violence white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said the violence departs from the commonly accepted norms of 
democracy and the rule of law 
iliescu late wednesday called in a televised speech for all 
democraticforces to come to the aid of his embattled government 
iliescu shortened the miners workweek and raised their pay 
after the revolt and in return the miners have been staunch 
supporters of his national salvation front 
early thursday soldiers fired at demonstrators who threw 
firebombs at police headquarters and sporadic gunfire echoed across 
bucharest 
then the miners arrived carrying clubs rubber hoses and other 
crude weapons 
dozens of people were assaulted others butted repeatedly by the 
helmeted miners estimated to number in the tens of thousands 
as a western radio reporter was pulled away from a group of 
grimfaced miners in central university square a heavyset woman 
egged the miners on urging them to kill the reporters colleagues 
in another development the government thursday announced the 
resignation of gen mihai chitac as interior minister 
no official reason was given but chitac had already been under 
fire for allegedly helping to put down anticommunist protests in 
december because his ministry is responsible for the police his 
replacement also was thought to be linked to the police attack on 
the demonstrators wednesday 
less than a mile from the square about 10 miners besieged the 
residence of iliescu critic dimitru mazilu for several hours before 
dispersing said mazilu and a neighbor the former vice president 
of the postrevolutionary government stepped down following charges 
that he collabrated with the securitate the secret police force 
that killed hundreds during the revolution 
the miners were apparently directed by several men who mazilu 
said were securitate or former securitate agents mazilu told 
reporters who arrived at his apartment that the agents urged the 
miners to kill him 
mazilu said the miners left after he called government officials 
in london the son of romanian national peasant party leader ion 
ratiu told the associated press his father had been beaten and 
taken from his house in bucharest by miners 
nicolae ratiu who lives in london said his cousin told him by 
telephone from bucharest that he saw the miners pummel ion ratiu 
and three other people and drag them from the house men who 
claimed to be police were operating with the miners he said 
in lyon france authorities said thursday that 23 romanian 
tourists fearing a new dictatorship in their country have asked 
france for political asylum 
the miners in bucharest also occupied opposition party 
headquarters 
other government suporters ransacked the headquarters of the 
opposition liberal party as well as bucharest universitys faculty 
of foreign languages 
miners milled around university square at nightfall thursday 
demanding identity papers from foreign journalists and those they 
suspected of being antigovernment symphathizers 
there was no indication when the miners would return to western 
romania some were seen leaving early friday in trucks but their 
destination was unknown 
rompress quoted an unidentified miner as saying the 
hoolingans stayed for a couple of weeks but we will stay until we 
are sure that we reinstate order in the romanian capital 
rompres quoted a miners communique demanding the closure of 
romania libera the main newspaper critical of iliescu and his 
government 
romania libera said later its editorial offices were occupied by 
people who claimed they were print workers a staff member was 
roughed up and executive offices were ransacked according to 
rompres 
a group of miners took control of the corridor outside the 
editorial boards offices disrupting work and the board appealed 
to the government in the name of freedom of the press for help 
rompres said 
during the violence thursday people in military trucks handed 
the government supporters milk and bread 
unidentified people in a van carrying loudspeakers warned 
passersby dont incite the miners you would thus give birth 
to fierce violence 
the speakers also instructed the miners to grab journalists and 
take them into the van we will take care of them the speakers 
said 
ovidiu bogdan 28 a photographer for the gamma photo agency 
said he was attacked by men armed with ironended clubs in central 
bucharest 
an ap reporter was clubbed before being rescued by an 
acquaintance in the army 
iliescu is the first excommunist to win a popular presidential 
election in eastern europe he and the national salvation front won 
may 20 elections by a landslide

police delivered another blow to the 
powerful medellin cocaine cartel by killing the man who 
masterminded a 10monthold terror campaign that has killed 
hundreds of people police said thursday

exploded near a police station in the same area thursday 
the blast killed four people including two suspected terrorists 
inside the car and injured 43 a police spokeswoman said on 
condition of anonymity 
the bomb may have been in retaliation for the police killing of 
juan jairo arias who officials said led the medellin cocaine 
cartels vast network of hired killers 
members of colombias elite police corps a group specially 
trained to fight drug traffickers were tipped off on ariass 
whereabouts and tried to arrest him at a medellin apartment the 
spokeswoman said 
arias resisted arrest and police shot and killed him said the 
spokeswoman who commented on condition of anonymity in line with 
government practice 
a woman and a 6monthold baby were also in the apartment but no 
one else was harmed in the shooting the spokeswoman said 
a national police director gen octavio vargas told the 
national radio network rcn that ariass killing represented the 
governments second most important victory in its war on drugs

cartel vargas said 
the most important victory came in december when the elite corps 
killed gonzalo rodriguez gacha the medellin cartels no 2 boss 
vargas said arias 28 was the medellin cartels fifth most 
important leader the police director blamed him for the murders of 
an attorney general a state governor a judge and a leading 
journalist

against colombias secret police chief gen miguel maza marquez 
those blasts killed at least 70 people but maza was not harmed 
the medellin cartels campaign to murder police officers 
continued wednesday when four more lawmen were slain 
the cartel said in a statement tuesday it was killing policemen 
to avenge the tortures and murders by police of its associates 
in medellin 
in april drug traffickers offered to pay 4300 to anyone 
willing to kill a policeman so far this year 110 law officers 
have been assassinated in medellin police say 
the police spokeswoman said authorities relied on the support 
and cooperation of medellin residents to locate arias police

since last august when the government of president virgilio barco 
began its most sweeping antidrug crackdown 
the cartels reputed leader pablo escobar remains at large 
despite a massive manhunt to find him 
the drug war began in august when traffickers were blamed for 
the assassination of leading presidential hopeful luis carlos 
galan two more presidential candidates were assassinated before 
last months election and traffickers were linked to at least one 
of those 
since august barcos administration has extradited 15 drug 
suspects and confiscated hundreds of properties belonging to the 
cocaine magnates

the soviet union confirmed thursday 
that a major accident occurred at a nuclear power plant in 
leningrad in 1975 finnish officials said 
the officials said the nuclear reactors in the leningrad plant 
were similar to those at chernobyl and that the accident was 
possibly of grade 3 in other words a serious accident 
radioactivity spread over parts of northern europe in april 1986 
after the reactor exploded at the chernobyl nuclear plant in the 
soviet republic of ukraine at least 31 people were killed as a 
direct result of that nuclear accident the worst in history 
however the finnish center for radiation and nuclear safety 
said no radiation from the 1975 accident was detected in finland 
60 miles at the nearest point from the plant it made no mention of 
any casualties 
the center said the accident occurred when the fuel channel of 
the number one reactor unit at the leningrad nuclear plant was 
damaged on nov 30 1975 when it was started up and shortterm 
radioactive substances were released into the atmosphere 
the recorded message said the information came from soviet 
nuclear officials after inquiries thursday by the finnish center 
the message said according to soviet authorities the release 
of radioactivity was far less than the 15 million curies reported 
in earlier press accounts the soviets have said 50 million curies 
of radiation were released in the chernobyl accident 
officials saw no reason to take special measures in the 
immediate vicinity of the power plant and the reactor was back in 
use two weeks after the incident the message added

proceedings collapsed thursday on the final 
day of the southern baptist convention because most of the 
delegates had abandoned the scene with the big battle for the 
presidency over 
discussion of major moral and social issues including a severe 
condemnation of homosexuals had to be scrapped for lack of a 
quorum with most of the circular tiers of seats empty in the vast 
louisiana superdome 
once the row over election of a president was over that was 
it said the rev felix t zeigler of venice fla the crowd 
couldnt be bothered 
but there are other issues that are more important to 
christian faith than the personality of one man 
longtime observers said it was the first time in memory that 
convention decisions had to be dropped because people didnt show 
up 
the main draw was tuesdays election of the rev morris chapman 
a fundamentalist from wichita falls texas as president of the 
149 millionmember denomination he defeated the moderate 
candidate the rev daniel vestal of the atlanta suburb of 
dunwoody by a 58 percent to 42 percent margin 
registered attendance at the convention had totalled 38478 the 
third largest in the history of the nations largest protestant 
denomination but under the rules a quarter of them were needed to 
conduct business 
from 4000 to 5000 people were estimated on hand for the 
morning session thursday and the number dwindled as the day went 
on 
the rev mark corts of winstonsalem nc chairman of a 
resolutions committee apologized from the podium for the 
impossibility of taking up 11 pending proposals some keenly 
controversial 
we worked through some significant issues and wanted your 
opinion expressed he said adding that the untended proposals 
were left for your encouragement and predilection 
the resolutions included one to oppose all efforts to gain 
civil rights protection for homosexuals on the basis of sexual 
preference 
the resolution called homoseuxality a morally unconscionable 
learned behavior and lifesytle not deserving of government support 
and special civil rights protection as a minority 
other proposals condemned government funding of offensive 
morally repugnant and sacrilegious art called for changes in tax 
laws to encourage mothers to stay home with their children and 
called for restrictions on broadcast advertising of alcholic 
beverages 
with decisionmaking on those issues gone by the wayside the 
remaining delegates listened to reports from commissions 
seminaries boards and committees interspersed with music 
hymnsinging and preaching 
for 12 years running fundamentalists have won the presidency 
whose appointive power determines the administration of the 
denominations huge network of agencies and institutions 
chapman said he would insist on adherence to specified standards 
of belief elaborated from a literalistic view of the bible 
the campaign watchword of fundamentalists has been that the 
bible is inerrant without error historically scientifically 
and in other fields that creation adam eve and biblical miracles 
happened as as recounted 
screening has been inaugurated for personnel in several agencies 
to assure conformity with those points and some seminary 
professors and others have come under fire for their views

a party made up of former communists won 
the opening round in bulgarias first free elections in 58 years 
results showed thursday and was expected to win an absolute 
majority in parliament in weekend runoffs 
the united states said widespread voter intimidation may have 
figured in last sundays firstround balloting but zhelyu zhelev 
leader of the main opposition alliance hailed the showing his 
people made in so short a time 
zhelev late thursday ruled out any coalition with the governing 
socialist party though the socialists said again they were 
reluctant to go it alone the communist party changed its name to 
the socialist party in april 
the opposition has only an outside chance of victory in sundays 
runoff 
bulgaria is the only country in the soviet unions 
disintegrating east bloc where former ruling communists remain the 
strongest political force 
final results announced thursday gave the socialists 172 of the 
319 seats decided in the first round they need to win 29 of 81 
seats at stake next sunday to capture a twothirds majority in the 
singlechamber 400seat grand national assembly they already have 
pledges of support from two independents 
zhelevs 16party union of democratic forces won 105 seats 
sunday and smaller opposition parties shared the rest observers 
said if they teamed up in the runoffs they conceivably could keep 
the socialists from controlling parliament 
allegations surfaced of election irregularities in last sundays 
balloting opposition supporters angered at the prospect of a 
victory by the former communists held protests and erected traffic 
blockades in sofia 
in washington the state department cited reports of polling 
booths without curtains transparent ballot envelopes and local 
officials handing out ballots 
there are many reports of local officials threatening voters 
with loss of jobs pensions or other benefits spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler said she said problems that came to light 
raise serious questions about the electoral process 
zhelev declared at a news conference however this is a great 
victory for the opposition which in only six months has raised

moscow city council on thursday talked of sending 
gasoline to lithuania in violation of the kremlin embargo because 
lithuania is running out of fuel to deliver milk to the soviet 
capital a local news service reported 
it was the latest sign of crumbling support for president 
mikhail s gorbachevs order to cut off all oil most natural gas 
and some raw material shipments to the baltic republic in hope of 
forcing it to rescind its declaration of independence 
on wednesday the kremlin gave the first sign it may be ready to 
ease the blockade because of mounting domestic opposition kremlin 
leaders offered a compromise that could lead to removal of 
sanctions which have idled 26000 workers 
estonian premier edgar savisaar on thursday rejected the latest 
kremlin offers of greater independence within a soviet 
confederation saying gorbachev was still presenting the baltic 
republics with an ultimatum to suspend their independence 
drives dutch media reported 
savisaar was in the netherlands to attend a gathering of 
12thcentury northern european cities known as the hansa league 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov was reported to have told 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene on wednesday that 15 
percent of the republics natural gas supply would be restored 
soon that would bring gas supplies to 30 percent of normal 
no sign of the promised gas emerged thursday but the fertilizer 
factory ryzhkov said would be supplied was closed in any event for 
a day of mourning said rita dapkus a spokeswoman for the 
lithuanian parliament 
residents in all three baltic republics held services thursday 
remembering the 36000 lithuanians and 10000 estonians who were 
deported to siberia and the far north on june 14 1941 on orders 
from soviet dictator josef stalin many died in the harsh 
conditions there 
the three republics were forcibly annexed by the soviet union 
while under army occupation in 1940 the deportations even of 
infants were allegedly due to antisoviet agitation 
postfactum news service said the moscow city council which is 
dominated by radical reformers is considering sending gasoline to 
lithuania in rail tank cars guarded by council members 
food is always in short supply in the soviet union but with 
recent panic buying touched off by the governments plan to raise 
food prices moscow officials are especially concerned about 
keeping their current sources of dairy products 
newly elected russian president boris yeltsin already has 
promised to send supplies to lithuania and presidents of several 
other republics reportedly told gorbachev in a kremlin meeting 
tuesday that the embargo should be stopped 
at that tuesday meeting gorbachev suggested transforming the 
soviet union into a new looser union of sovereign states in 
the hope that will hold his country together 
latvia and estonia have joined lithuania in demanding 
independence and several other republics have large organizations 
pushing for secession russia challenged gorbachevs authority on 
tuesday by declaring that its laws would take priority over 
national ones and the ukraine may follow suit 
a member of gorbachevs presidential council advisory board 
grigory revenko was reported as saying on thursday that the 
proposal for a new union treaty would allow each of the 15 soviet 
republics to set its own conditions for joining the union on 
federative or confederative principles 
in russian these words are used to distinguish between a 
usstyle federation of states within one country and a 
confederation of independent nations like the european community 
let them join the common market if they want it and if a 
republic has sufficient potential tass quoted revenko as saying 
revenko suggested that the central government be left with 
minimal duties including constitutional and human rights defense 
and border protection and part of foreign relations 
republics themselves when joining the union with their 
treaties will determine which rights they will delegate to the 
center tass quoted revenko as saying 
none of the three republics parliaments took action thursday on 
compromise offers made by gorbachev 
he told lithuania the kremlin will lift the embargo and open 
negotiations on independence if lithuania agrees to freeze putting 
its declaration into effect while negotiations are going on 
latvian legislators criticized president anatoly gorbunov for 
saying he is ready to discuss freezing latvias may 4 declaration 
of independence because he had no authorization according to the

state republicans rallied wednesday behind 
us sen dave durenberger who apologized to his colleagues and 
constituents as the senate ethics committee ended a hearing and 
prepared to weigh his financial conduct 
opposition politicians renewed their calls for durenbergers 
resignation saying he ducked his obligation to fully answer 
allegations of misdeeds 
he did not tell anything new and apparently did not dispute 
the evidence said robert vanasek democratic speaker of the 
state house it leads me to conclude that the senator has decided 
he can tough this out that it can go behind closed doors and that 
the public will forget about it 
in an emotional hourlong speech before the committee 
durenberger said he takes full responsibility for ethical 
lapses even though he never set out to break the rules 
the committee ended its triallike proceedings early as 
requested by durenbergers attorney jim hamilton who said 
prolonging them would cost the senator too much in legal fees 
having accepted 23 volumes of evidence against durenberger the 
committee now will weigh a recommendation by its special counsel 
robert s bennett that the senate denounce the minnesota 
republican for financial improprieties 
the panels vice chairman sen warren b rudman rnh said 
the committee would have no problem making a judgment based on 
written documents and statements by durenberger his lawyer and 
bennett 
but vanasek said minnesota voters deserved to hear from 
witnesses in an extended trial to better understand the case 
he said durenbergers apology and defense that all the key 
decisions were taken with legal advice merely repeated what he 
has said for five months 
he should go to the governor indicate to him he will resign 
and he will run in a special election this fall vanasek said 
state democratic party chairman todd otis also called on 
durenberger to resign and let voters decide whether he should 
return to washington 
if he is at peace with what hes done that should not be a 
problem otis said its just an outrage that a curtain is 
coming down in front of them the voters before the play has even 
started 
but republican bill schreiber state house minority leader 
labeled the resignation calls ludicrous 
i never expected dave durenberger to step down schreiber 
said the democratic spin doctors have been playing that 
resignation game a long time 
us rep vin weber rminn said todays statement and the 
decision by the special counsel to seek no greater sanction than 
denouncement now makes clear that dave will weather this ordeal and 
return to his work in the us senate

crews used skimmers booms and chemicals 
thursday to battle a 30milelong slick from the burning 
supertanker mega borg and officials geared up to unleash 
oileating bacteria 
officials planned to apply the bacteria friday the first use of 
microbes in water to clean up an oil spill state officials said 
also thursday the mega borgs chief engineer told a norwegian 
panel meeting in galveston that one of the vessels pumps had been 
leaking about six hours before the blast 
balinder singh said the pump leaked as the tankers crude oil 
cargo was being transferred to a smaller ship singh said he had 
stopped the leak by tightening a coupling about six hours before 
the friday blast 
six days after the first of a series of explosions in the area 
of the engine room a small fire continued to burn aboard the 
crippled norwegian vessel in the gulf of mexico 57 miles offshore 
it looks like the fire is being contained to a very small area 
in the engine room coast guard spokesman gene maestas said 
flames could be seen on the decks rear section and four 
fireboats showered the mega borg with water cannon the rear 
section shrouded in smoke continued to be awash 
oil escaping from a hole in the vessels 55 milliongallon 
center tank apparently was spilling at a slower rate although 
coast guard officials had no specifics no other leaks have been 
found 
the 886foot mega borg which carried 38 million gallons of 
light african crude oil already has lost about 3 million gallons 
of oil since late fridays explosion most of it has burned off or 
evaporated 
about 12000 gallons remained on the water thursday coast guard 
capt thomas greene said 
an oil slick stretched about 12 miles northwest of the ship 
with scattered patches extending another 18 miles its width 
varied the coast guard offered no specific figure thursday the 
previous day it said the width stretched to 10 miles in spots 
a plane spread up to 2000 gallons of dispersant on sections 
near theship thursday and at least a dozen skimmers and several 
booms sucked oil off the waters surface five booms were working 
in the ships vicinity 
salvage crews planned to begin transferring oil from the no 4 
cargo tank where the leak occurred to the no 5 cargo tank which 
is empty greene said the effort should stop the spill cut off 
the fuel feeding the fire and help correct the listing of the ship 
state officials said the experimental microbe process called 
bioremediation would be used as a demonstration and would not be a 
major part of the cleanup 
bioremediation has been used for years to clean up hazardous 
waste sites treat sewage and wastewater extract oil from tight 
geologic formations and clean some rocks on shore after the exxon 
valdez accident in alaska last year said texas land commissioner 
garry mauro 
but this will be the first time bioremediation has been used in 
the water to clean up an oil spill he said 
the dispersant works by breaking up the oil creating a light 
sheen and tar balls a rather common sight on texas beaches 
tar balls are ugly but theyre not that environmentally 
damaging said bj buck wynne iii chairman of the texas 
water commission 
coast guard officials said the slick was about 30 miles from 
galveston but they declined to give any predictions about where 
the oil might reach the shore if it does 
sharon christopherson of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said some of the tar balls could hit the texas 
shoreline as early as friday 
also thursday a pumpman testified that he was opening a valve 
when the blast ripped through the pump and engine room area last 
friday 
putham mahamood whose left leg was injured in the blast spoke 
with inspectors by telephone from his hospital bed 
about three minutes before the explosion chief officer tojo 
sagar told mahamood to open a valve for a crude oil washing 
mahamood said he did not elaborate on the procedure 
as he was trying to open the valve the explosion occurred 
mahamood said sagar 27 of india died in the explosion 
mosvold rederi of farsund norway owners of the mega borg 
already have spent 2 million for firefighting salvage and 
pollution control efforts said robert l klawetter attorney for 
firm 
two of the 41 crew members died in the blast two were missing 
and presumed dead and 17 were injured none seriously 
klawetter identified the other seaman killed in the blast as 
seaman bernardo t cortez 41 of the philippines the missing men 
who are presumed dead were 4th engineer wilfredo s gulfan 36 of 
the philippines and wiper vincent m pastor 37 of the philippines

a judge thursday upheld a federal agencys 
authority to override state branchbanking laws as it sells off 
failed savings and loans the first such decision in the nation 
the decision by us district judge santiago campos regarding 
the resolution trust corps authority could have farreaching 
effects the agency controls 248 failed thrifts in 21 states where 
branching laws for banks that could buy defunct savings and loans 
are more restrictive than those for thrifts 
campos dismissed a challenge to the regulation by the 
independent community bankers of new mexico and the state financial 
institutions division 
the ruling means the sale of the defunct new mexico federal 
savings and loan to the first national bank of albuquerque can 
proceed unless the 10th circuit court of appeals in denver blocks 
the transaction on appeal officials for the bankers group and the 
state agency did not say whether they would appeal 
the override rule which took effect june 1 would effectively 
let first national operate branches in counties outside bernalillo 
county even though intercounty branch banking is prohibited by 
state law 
the override is well within the rtcs authority campos 
said after a halfday hearing 
new mexico law prohibits banks from operating branches outside 
the banks headquarters county but savings and loans may establish 
branches anywhere new mexico federal has branches in santa fe 
espanola and taos 
the resolution trust corp was set up under the savingsandloan 
bailout law to dispose of failed thrifts under federal 
conservatorship 
campos ruling is contrary to a judicial decision earlier this 
year in a similar federal case in colorado bankers and state 
regulators also have challenged the override rule in arkansas said 
michael tucci senior counsel for the agency 
john bernstein an attorney for the resolution trust corp told 
campos that the agency was set up to salvage assets and bring 
private money into the bailout program while minimizing taxpayers 
losses 
in the colorado case splitting the thrifts branches cut the 
premium bidders paid for the thrift from 675000 to 75000 which 
will cost the taxpayers said bernstein 
the cost of the nationwide bailout was pegged at 50 billion 
last year but the bush administration now estimates the cost at 89 
billion to 132 billion 
the purpose of the override is simply to do what congress has 
told the rtc to do said bernstein to allow the state to come 
in and restrict these kinds of transactions totally defeats the 
mandate and authority granted by congress to the rtc 
bernstein said the override rule was designed to head off the 
chaos that would occur if the agency could not sell an entire 
network dividing branches would mean dividing centralized data 
processing and other common assets which would be cumbersome and 
would lower their value he said 
and if the pending sale falls through another arrangement may 
be less satisfactory for new mexico federals 21000 
accountholders he said 
the bankers and the state argued that congress never intended 
for banks to violate state branching laws 
if we lose today we will have in new mexico basically an 
unsupervised dual banking system argued state assistant attorney 
general gts khalsa representing the state regulatory agency 
leonard rubin a washingtonbased lawyer for the independent 
bankers said the override rule violates the federal mcfadden act 
which requires national banks to conform to state laws limiting 
branching 
rubin said the law creating the rtc specifically excludes banks 
from the section governing the purchase of a failed thrifts 
branches 
congress knew how to override the federal law if it wanted 
to said rubin 
he told campos the rtc prefers selling entire thrifts including 
branches with one transaction because they can get rich banks and 
thrifts to pay a premium for a network of financial institutions 
theyre selling for a premium a license to violate state 
banking laws said rubin

the senate judiciary committee on thursday 
endorsed a constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal 
budget 
the amendment was sent to the full senate by a vote of 113 
if approved by twothirds of the senate and the house and then 
by 38 states the amendment would prohibit federal spending from 
exceeding revenues except in time of war or if both chambers waive 
the requirement by a 60 percent vote 
it would also require that a majority of each chamber of 
congress instead of just a majority of those present and voting 
approve any tax increase 
the amendment would take effect in the second fiscal year after 
ratification 
balancedbudget amendments have been approved before by the 
committee the provision most recently was subjected to a full 
senate vote in 1986 and failed by one vote it passed the senate in 
1982 but died in the house 
thursdays action came as house senate and white house 
negotiators continued their budget summit in the capitol aimed 
at reducing the federal deficit democrats and republicans have 
been unable to agree on how to bring the fiscal gap below 100 
billion never mind zero 
they met for less than two hours and participants said they 
discussed a variety of budget process reforms without reaching any 
agreements the talks are scheduled to resume next tuesday 
because congress normal budget process has been sidetracked 
during the lengthy negotiations the senate approved a resolution 
thursday night to keep a legislative backlog from building 
by voice vote the senate approved the technical equivalent of a 
budget for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 but the document was 
devoid of the policies and fiscal decisions a budget normally 
embodies those details to be filled in later if the summit 
succeeds 
the purpose of the vote supported by the white house was to 
let the congress begin work on its annual spending bills for 
federal agencies 
the house on may 1 approved a 12 trillion budget spelling out 
federal spending priorities including a shift from military 
spending to domestic programs the senate then stopped short 
because of the bipartisan budget talks 
the senate resolution approved thursday night simply sets a 503 
billion total target same as the current year for domestic and 
defense programs outside of entitlement programs like social 
security and other spending not set annually 
both must agree on a single resolution for it to become binding 
on the two chambers it doesnt require the presidents signature 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said thursday that the 
house did not intend to abandon its plan housesenate talks are 
expected to begin next week even as the budget summit continues

the federal government moved thursday to 
close down a hazardous waste recycling company that the us 
environmental protection agency claims is actually a disposal site 
the complaint filed in us district court by the epa and the 
department of justice also sought more than 40 million in fines 
from marine shale processors 
sham recycling is deplorable james m strock the epas 
assistant administrator for enforcement said in a statement we 
will continue cracking down on companies that exploit what they 
perceive to be loopholes 
marine shale president jack kent accused the epa of plotting 
with his competitors in a campaign to shut down the company 
we are confident that the district court will see this suit 
for what it is an action motivated by private interests to stifle 
new technology kent said 
the company in 1985 started its 275foot kiln which employs a 
hightemperature process to transform toxic wastes such as 
petroleum byproducts into a pebblelike aggregate which is used as 
fill for road beds 
in 1988 marine shale handled toxic wastes from 2500 companies 
in 48 states and had revenues of 40 million 
environmentalists and residents who live near the kiln outside 
morgan city have long claimed it is dangerous the company already 
faces 5 million in federal and state fines for environmental 
infractions 
earlier this month the company asked the state to allow it to 
operate a second kiln while seeking airquality permits for it 
the complaint says marine shale is in the disposal rather than 
recycling business and doesnt have the proper permits to dispose 
of wastes 
the government is seeking 25000 a day in penalties dating 
back to the start of incineration in july 1985 alleging the 
company violated the clean water act and federal hazardous waste 
management law 
it also accuses the company of offering hazardous wastes for 
transport to handlers without permits and discharging pollutants 
into bayou boeuf part of the intracoastal waterway beside which 
the plant is located 
the epa said samples collected around the plant in 1989 detected 
creosotecontaminated soil containing phenols and chrysene various 
solvents such as toluene and benzene and heavy metals such as 
chromium and lead in the incinerator residue 
the inspectors did not find any immediate danger to public 
health but regional epa administrator robert e layton jr said in 
the agencys statement there was a potential for health effects 
we will be relentless in pursuing companies that operate on 
the edge he said 
kent said the epas finding of no imminent danger proved his 
point 
nothing we produce is harmful or toxic in any way he said 
they have attacked us on a technicality

word that a local hardware and farm 
tool vendor may have pulled off one of the centurys biggest art 
thefts while a soldier in germany during world war ii was the talk 
of this town of 1760 thursday 
there were more reporters than residents on the towns main 
drag about 60 miles north of dallas 
not much happens here said carolyn flaughter you see 
cameramen walking up and down the street you just dont see that 
every day 
according to a new york times report thursday joe t meador 
transported the priceless pieces to texas from quedlinburg an 
ancient castle town in what is now east germany 
the army investigated the theft but dropped the matter in 1949 
when quedlinburg became part of east germany 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified source as saying the 
treasures are in the vault of the first national bank of 
whitewright reportedly as collateral for a loan 
bank officials declined to comment on the reports harrell 
stowers bank executive vice president said he could not confirm 
whether the treasures are or ever have been in the vault 
meador died in 1980 his brother jack and his sisterinlaw 
jean declined to comment thursday 
the times based its report on interviews with art experts 
lawyers and neighbors of meador 
the treasures include a small silver reliquary inlaid with 
enamels and precious stones with side panels of carved ivory a 
liturgical ivory comb a manuscript dated 1513 several rock 
crystal flasks and gold and silver crucifixes some of the 
treasures were gifts from kings and emperors who ruled german 
states in the 9th and 10th centuries 
meador was an officer with the 87th armored field artillery the 
unit that occupied quedlinburg and guarded the mine shaft where the 
treasures reportedly were kept they disappeared a few days after 
american troops took over the area in 1945 the times said 
three years after meador died his brotherinlaw dr don h 
cook of mesquite texas sought to have two medieval manuscripts 
evaluated john carroll collins a dallas estate appraiser told 
the newspaper 
a former employee of meadors speaking on condition of 
anonymity said meador reportedly showed his employees richly bound 
gold and silver manuscripts 
but three longtime meador employees said thursday theyd never 
known their boss to show off any art works when they were around 
the three declined to give their names 
most of the people interviewed thursday said they didnt know 
meador had even been in the army or world war ii 
joe was a quiet man i think joe in my way of thinking was a 
very very intelligent man he seemed to mind his own 
business mayor clarence tillett said 
tillett said hed visited meador in the house he shared with his 
mother but didnt recall any unusual works of art 
it wouldnt have surprised me for anything to come out of 
germany tillett said 
many residents recalled meador as a loner whose most memorable 
trait was his passion for growing orchids 
he didnt seem like the type of guy to me who would do 
something like that said troyce spencer a resident

senate democrats have abandoned the idea of 
trying for a second time to override president bushs veto of the 
2 billion amtrak bill their leaders announced thursday night 
the house last week voted overwhelmingly to override but on 
tuesday the senate failed by a vote of 6436 to garner the 
twothirds majority needed to pass the bill over the presidents 
objections 
the vote would have been 6535 except majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine voted on the presidents side so that he could 
under senate rules ask for a reconsideration of the vote only 
members of the winning side may ask for a second look and mitchell 
promptly did so 
but apparently the democrats could not find the two additional 
votes they needed 
sen j james exon dnebr chairman of the commerce 
committees subcommittee on surface transportation said thursday 
night that the democrats would move a new bill deleting the 
provision which drew the veto an expansion of interstate commerce 
commission power to regulate railroad takeovers 
bush has vetoed 11 bills with no overrides

no selfrespecting capitalist economy can 
be without it tax reform 
finance ministry officials on wednesday unveiled proposals for 
polands first universal income tax and a value added tax on 
manufactured goods 
the new system could go into effect by 1991 but a lengthy 
parliament debate is expected 
polish tax laws imposed levys on government industries but not 
the people who worked in socialized industries 
people with private incomes were required to pay taxes but 
there were many legal exemptions 
restructuring the tax system is a major component of the 
economic reform plan deputy finance minister marek dabrowski said 
a new tax enforcement force will be created to make sure the 
levies are collected he said at a news conference 
the new system will have other elements familiar to the western 
tax debate it is to be simple uniform and stripped of breaks for 
special interests 
the highest income tax rate will be 40 percent dabrowski said 
according to examples presented by the gazeta wyborcza daily 
people earning the equivalent of 32 a month will be taxed 84 cents 
while people earning 1053 will be taxed 315 
about 20 million of polands 39 million people will pay taxes

the coast guard plucked a retired 
arkansas congressman and his wife to safety from their disabled 
sailboat in stormy seas a grateful ed bethune said wednesday 
as night fell tuesday a rescuer dived from a helicopter into 
the atlantic ocean and swam through 25foot waves to help bethune 
54 and his wife lana whose sailboat hit a gale about 210 miles 
south of cape cod 
if somebody would have said 60 days ago lets figure out the 
toughest scenario and put two people in their early 50s out there 
and rescue them well this was it former us rep bethune 
said in a telephone interview he added that winds had been at 40 
knots gusting to 50 knots and seas were heavy 
the bethunes who suffered only from exhaustion were taken to a 
coast guard air station officials said 
the coast guard said the bethunes boat had lost engine power 
and they were unable to hoist sails because of high winds 
after drifting for 1 days in their 30foot sailboat salute the 
couple exhausted and fearing the craft would capsize called for 
help at 3 pm tuesday the coast guard said 
bethune said he waited to call because we have a good 
bluewater boat and felt perhaps the weather might improve its 
not uncommon to hit a storm when crossing the ocean so we decided 
to see if we could ride it out 
but it became apparent that we needed to call the coast 
guard 
when the helicopter arrived the boats rigging was swinging so 
violently the couple couldnt be lifted directly from the craft 
the coast guard said 
they were told to abandon the boat and get into a life raft 
petty officer roderic parker dove from the chopper into the 
ocean and helped mrs bethune into a rescue basket to be hoisted up 
but parker then found that the life raft with bethune had been 
blown about 75 yards away and he had to swim through 25foot waves 
to reach it the coast guard said 
the basket was lowered twice more and the men were hoisted 
aboard 
bethune said the coast guard had told him theyd practiced the 
very same maneuver two weeks ago 
because of that this went off without a hitch he said 
and this young man helping us was making his first rescue 
attempt 
the next time bethune sees us rep gerry studds dmass who 
deals with coast guard matters he said im going to tell him my 
story and offer to testify about just how good these people are

two huge spending bills to help cities and

committee now that the house has approved its 4 billion version 
the house bill was approved 40814 on wednesday sending it to a 
panel that will compromise it with a senate version that would 
spend 1 billion less over five years 
the overwhelming house vote came in the face of opposition by 
the office of management and budget which argued that the bill was 
too costly and should not have been focused on a single disease 
the bills narrow diseasespecific approach sets a dangerous 
precedent inviting treatment of other diseases through similar ad

tens of thousands of miners accosted 
people at random and ransacked opposition party offices thursday 
after being summoned by the presidentelect to help put down 
antigovernment protests 
few police and soldiers were visible in the capital by late 
thursday and the miners armed with cudgels and their faces and 
work clothes still smudged with coal dust were apparently left to 
maintain order as they chose 
the miners arrived after two days of violence in which security 
forces clashed with demonstrators who claim the governing national 
salvation front is dominated by communists associated with the 
ousted ceausescu regime 
the government said at least five people were killed and 350 
injured when police cleared a 2monthold demonstration from a 
central square wednesday then fired on protesters who attacked 
government buildings later in the day

police seeking to curb drunken driving do not 
violate motorists privacy rights by stopping them at sobriety 
checkpoints the supreme court ruled thursday 
the 63 decision upheld michigans checkpoint program and by 
extension similar operations in most states 
the balance of the states interest in preventing drunken 
driving and the degree of intrusion upon individual motorists 
who are briefly stopped weighs in favor of the state program 
chief justice william h rehnquist wrote for the court 
the three dissenters said the decision sacrificed individual 
liberty in favor of a police tactic that might not make any 
difference in the fight against drunken driving

the bush administration worried about a lack

japanese honor commitments to open markets to american and other 
foreign goods 
us negotiators have grown concerned over what they perceive as 
japanese footdragging in the talks aimed at reducing the united 
states 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
critics have said japans intransigence is directly linked to a 
decision by the bush administration to remove japan from under a 
tough section of trade law known as super 301 which carries the 
threat of economic sanctions 
recent negotiations in hawaii produced little progress toward 
the text of a final report on negotiations aimed at reforming the 
economies of both countries as a way of attacking the underlying

to become part of the constitution the amendment will need 
twothirds support in both the house and the senate and 
ratification by 38 state legislatures

called the push for a flag amendment an attempt to divide 
america to divide fathers against sons he said it would reopen

in my opinion should not be given this much attention kerrey

barre toelken will tell you a navajo coyote 
story in january but no amount of prodding will get it out of him 
in june 
they have to be told in the winter or you will screw up the 
weather pattern he says 
the traditional tribal moratorium on coyote yarns begins with 
the first lightning strike in the spring then mums the word until 
the first killing frost of autumn 
toelken 55 has spent years collecting and studying the 
folklore of the southwest tales folk songs and ballads that echo 
ever fainter down the decades to many modern minds his obsession 
is well puzzling 
there is still a notion that folklore is baloney i dont know 
any other field that has to explain itself any more than we do 
toelken says if someone says they are a doctor or a plumber 
people say thats fine but when i say im a folklorist people 
say that must be wonderful for your children but what do you do 
for a living 
toelken does folklore as a professor at utah state 
university although his doctoral degree is in medieval literature 
he became enthralled with american indian culture in 1954 when he 
and a group of friends left college to mine uranium on the navajo 
reservation in southeastern utah 
we started out driving down there on weekends and got more 
interested in living among the indians than going to school he 
says 
after uranium mining played out toelken was invited to stay on 
the reservation at montezuma creek with a navajo family by the name 
of yellowman it was during that first winter that he learned about 
coyote stories which are not all humorous but always carry a moral 
instead of lecturing people the navajos tell stories about a 
coyote he says 
at first he was simply entertained by the tales but as his 
studies in folklore progressed he returned to the reservation and 
made several tapes of the stories after agreeing never to repeat 
them during the summer 
storytelling is an integral part of the study of folklore for 
toelken and others it reveals elements of society not recorded 
anywhere else 
folklore is about the live part of the culture rather than the 
dry part you get through the books he says the values and 
ideas important to a group of people are often too abstract to talk 
about and when they are told in stories they are more vivid in 
their explanation 
toelken says navajos arent the only people who use stories to 
explain themselves mormons for example tell stories about three 
nephite men from the book of mormon who have been allowed to roam 
the earth for ages never dying 
in the stories he says the three sometimes perform heroic acts 
such as saving a childs life when no other adult is around in 
some versions they appear as people in need when the faithful 
help them they are blessed 
folklorists toelken says are not in the business to determine 
the truth of the stories they study but focus on the purpose they 
serve for the people who tell them 
studying the unwritten vernacular of a society reveals 
important and mostly unrecorded facts about it he says 
while the nephite tales may promote faith among mormons coyote 
tales are sometimes used to explain nature one tells that the 
animals eyes are yellow because a coyote once threw his eyes high 
in the air so he could see long distances 
of course it didnt do any good toelken says and then 
he had to use yellow pine pitch to make them stick again 
the stories often carry a health message from the navajo 
point of view the religion is based on health and anything out of 
balance creates sickness he says 
but collecting coyote stories is not without hazard last fall 
toelken was asked to be a patient in a blessingway ceremony on 
the reservation aimed at promoting harmony in a persons life and 
warding off skinwalkers or witches 
witches take language apart and analyze it my scholarship of 
navajo coyote stories was making people nervous he said 
after yellowman died while being treated for navajo witchcraft 
toelken agreed to participate in four such ceremonies to ease the 
minds of other family members he will go through another later 
this year 
for toelken a big part of his study of folklore is the fife 
folklore conference each june at utah state this year the 
conference focused on storytelling but again served to boost the 
legitimacy of the odd discipline

ah yes mtv rock videos quickcut posturing 
minimusicals for those who love synthesizers rock stars who mouth 
the words of their hits and the roborhythms of electronic drum 
machines 
but there is weirdness afoot check out mtv sunday night it 
might startle you to see a show with flashrock king elton john 
just himself and his piano surrounded by about 100 fans in a small 
new york studio 
its part of a relatively new weekly mtv series unplugged 
wherein major and minor stars of rock do their thing in an intimate 
setting not the usual 50000seat stadium full of fugitives from 
homes for the strange 
the show is odd in other ways the musicians generally play what 
younger tads raised on microchip rock call acoustic like 
real guitars real drums and in one don henley show even real 
violins and cellos 
the video is no frills four cameras taping a complete 
performance 
and the singers actually sing which is slyly noted in sundays 
onehour show as john welcomes viewers to the program that 
lipsynchers dare not come on the audience cheers 
ooh nasty nasty he says mockchiding himself right 
since that cuts out about 75 percent of the top 100 its only the 
old ones like me that can do it 
then clad in a pink baseball cap and pink and black jogging 
togs he briskly proceeds to do seven classics among them a 
boogiewoogie version of one of his most golden oldies bennie 
and the jets 
his gospeltinged piano accompaniment at times is monotonous so 
is the closeup longshot mediumshot camerawork but it is a 
welcome change from the highgloss overproduced rock videos that 
have become new wave old hat 
billed as mtvs first acoustic music series unplugged 
began in january the first show featured the british rockers 
squeeze 
thirteen more shows since have been taped and aired starring 
such artists as sinead oconnor and 10000 maniacs the group not 
the audience new ones featuring aerosmith and eric clapton are 
planned 
the series has gotten a good reaction from all ages of mtv fans 
according to mtv senior vice president judy mcgrath 
but it wasnt started she says as a reaction to what some rock 
analysts see as an increasing turn by the public away from 
lipsynching rock stars and technorock in which the synthesizer is 
the star 
no it really isnt a reaction against anything she says 
rather it was part of mtvs goal of doing original unexpected 
things she says we wanted to say theres another way to do 
music 
unplugged might seem new to many mtv viewers for whom 
thirtysomething is a show about old folks 
but its more a backtothefuture effort resembling public tvs 
soundstage of the 70s that was an acclaimed music series that 
also put pop stars of the day barry manilow among them in a 
quiet nofrills studio setting 
when i look at unplugged i get a sense of deja vu says 
ken ehrlich who was executive producer of soundstage and now 
produces other music shows including cables showtime coast 
to coast specials 
i think that perhaps the most telling thing is that kids 
are going to be able to see once again what the music is and what 
the performers are like instead of having to follow 400 cuts in a 
video he says 
mtvs mcgrath says unplugged is aimed at a broad audience 
not just the fastgrowing aging baby boom collection of citizens 
aged 35 to 44 
ehrlich agrees saying he doesnt think baby boomers even watch 
mtv 
i think whats happening he says is that there are 
probably a lot of kids watching unplugged and saying gee weve 
discovered a new way of looking at music

a political movement associated with the 
churchgoing conservative middle class is trying to fill the vacuum 
left by the collapse of communist parties in eastern europe 
leaders of the movement say centerright christian democratic 
parties like those in western europe and scandinavia could become 
the dominant political force in the former soviet bloc 
wladyslaw silanowicki chairman of polands christian 
democratic party of labor said christian democracy should be one 
of the basic centers of building pluralism and normality in 
political life after decades of oneparty communist party rule 
christian democratic parties were born after world war i 
particularly among roman catholics in western europe they urged 
christians to participate in politics based on social teachings of 
the religion 
the doctrine advocates cooperation between employers and 
employees rejecting both marxism and unfettered capitalism 
it differs with the social democratic tradition which dates 
from the 1870s and is closely tied to trade union movements mainly 
in its attitude toward state intervention in the economy social 
democrats are more inclined to advocate state ownership of major 
industries 
east germanys christian democrats were the big winners in 
parliamentary elections in march 
democratic forum the winner in hungary that same month is more 
of a mix but emphasized christian values in its campaign it 
formed a governing coalition with two sympathetic parties one 
called the christian democrats 
in czechoslovakia christian democrats did not achieve their 
goal of finishing second to civic forum in this months election 
but did place third after the communists 
in polish politics solidarity towers above all groups its 
support ranges from morally conservative marketoriented catholics 
to liberal intellectuals and populistminded workers whose ideal is 
something on the lines of socialist sweden 
political aides of solidarity leader lech walesa have tried 
recently to draw centerright elements together in a political 
union called the center alliance with strong christian democratic 
overtones 
silanowickis party formed before world war ii has received 
quiet encouragement from the catholic church 
romania and bulgaria have budding christian democratic parties 
and one has been formed in moscow 
antongiulio de robertis an official of the christian democrat 
international in rome said it had established links with christian 
democrats throughout eastern europe 
prior to last year we had ties with skeleton committees of 
precommunist political groupings that had been kept alive by 
emigre communities he said with the liberation of eastern 
europe these parties returned to their respective countries and 
continued to work 
a reaction to communism accounts for part of the support said 
carl ordnung a christian democratic activist working for lothar de 
maiziere the new prime minister of east germany 
its because these parties are christian parties he said 
christianity to a certain extent is quite the opposite of marxism 
and communism after this whole progressive attitude of communists 
people say now let us stick to a more conservative program 
in east germany the christian democrats confounded pollsters by 
overtaking the social democrats in the last days of the campaign 
they benefited from ties to the christian democratic union of west 
germany and its leader chancellor helmut kohl who advocated 
speedy german reunification 
bruno orsini head of the international department of the 
christian democrat international in rome sees a parallel between 
eastern europe now and western europe in the late 1940s 
in the period immediately after world war ii the two 
countries which had been ruled by dictatorships chose the christian 
democratic path to achieve their reconstruction he said 
both germans and italians overcame the bitterness of the nazi 
period through their adoption of what was a christian democratic 
value the belief in unity 
now it is the same for eastern europe the hopes of east 
europeans who have escaped oppression after years of authoritarian 
rule and underdevelopment are based on liberty and solidarity 
both these values are central to christian democracy orsini 
said 
advocates say it appeals to people who suffered under extremist 
regimes 
we are a centrist party silanowicki said we are 
decidedly opponents of monoparties regardless of whether they are 
leftist like the communist party or rightist like the totalitarian 
parties of fascist italy and nazi germany 
sandor keresztes chairman of the hungarian christian democrats 
sees the movement as a counter to divisive nationalism in eastern 
europe 
with so many ethnic hungarians in neighboring countries this 
is especially vital to his party keresztes said 
christian democratic parties deny they are controlled by any 
church but tend to be linked to roman catholicism and follow 
vatican teachings on such issues as abortion and pornography 
pope john paul ii a native of poland went to czechoslovakia in 
april and plans to visit hungary and poland next year he has 
expressed hope that new public policies in eastern europe will 
reject both communism and excessive western consumerism

atop a steep slope overlooking this 
mountainous retreat is the hut of a buddhist hermit festooned with 
flags of prayer 
spring breezes puff through the evergreens the flags flap as 
they do says tibetan lore prayers inscribed on the sunbleached 
cloth are released 
outside its peaceful but inside the hut agitation reigns 
jampa tenzin the hermit fiddles with the cap on a can of 
springtime air freshener he says the number of buddhist 
recluses is dwindling and their culture once held in awe by 
tibetans is dying 
this is an age of degeneration he declares passing a 
visitor a cup of tang orange drink we have no right to compare 
ourselves to the saints of the past 
todays mind is always thinking we have no time to really do 
anything always skipping from this and that 
this day tenzin also is pressed for time hes about to set out 
on the hourlong journey to the town below to ready a water pump for 
his hermitage 
a water pump 
whats that got to do with nirvana and whats tenzin doing with 
tang and springtime air freshener 
times have changed he says 
their predecessors abandoned the material world for lonely crags 
and caves in their homeland but todays tibetan hermits are slowly 
embracing creature comforts 
from thousands in tibet the buddhist hermits have dwindled to a 
mere 50 around dharmsala headquarters of the dalai lamas exile 
government 
some hermits remain in tibet although their numbers dropped 
precipitously during chinas cultural revolution in 19661976 when 
bands of red guards routinely killed tibetan monks 
most hermits fled tibet with the dalai lama their spiritual 
leader after an abortive uprising in 1959 
at that time many ended their isolation for those who have 
remained in the woods the pursuit of enlightenment is more 
difficult 
modernity touches us and its very hard to resist tenzin 
said comfort makes us lose discipline we become soft 
few if any of dharmsalas hermits are capable of following the 
rigorous lifestyle of earlier hermits he said 
the fabled 11th century hermit milarepa spent decades meditating 
in snowbound caves legends say a diet of nettles turned him green 
todays hermits meditate for barely half the day tenzin said 
most also appear wellfed tenzin is quite rotund his happy 
round face has a double chin 
his hut is filled with books a sturdy kerosene stove electric 
lamps jars of dried fruit and packets of chocolatedrink mix 
tenzin 54 became a hermit 20 years ago he entered the tibetan 
buddhist clergy when he was 7 and studied scriptures for the next 
14 years in a monastery near his upperclass familys home in 
southern tibet 
he fled tibet with the dalai lama and after several more years 
of study decided to abandon the material world to seek 
enlightenment 
enlightenment or buddhahood is described as a state of 
nomind where the vagaries of everyday existance do not affect 
the core of a persons being 
about 50 other monks joined him in hills above dharmsala 
supported by monthly stipends of about 10 from the dalai lamas 
office and donations from tibetans and westerners 
tenzin succeeded in mastering an advanced form of meditation in 
which the body temperature is raised in 1981 herbert benson a 
harvard university medical professor studied him and several other 
hermits 
benson recorded a rise of between 7 and 15 degrees fahrenheit in 
the skin temperature particularly on the fingers and toes 
since the early 1980s tenzin said his abilities have 
deteriorated 
the pursuit of nirvana is more difficult when all these things 
line the way he said

a threatened scientific boycott over us 
travel restrictions on foreigners infected with the aids virus has 
failed but the policy will remain a major issue at this weeks 
international aids meeting 
the french and swiss governments the european parliament and 
other groups had urged scientists to boycott because of us 
immigration policy 
but officials say registration for the sixth international 
conference on aids which opens wednesday will come close to the 
original estimate of 12000 
among those registered are luc montagnier and other members of 
frances pasteur institute one of the worlds leading aids 
research centers 
only 50 research papers were withdrawn from the 2500 studies 
originally submitted conference spokesman dana van gorder said 
no one wants to see the law interfere with the work of this 
conference van gorder said people are coming here to improve 
the work they are doing in response to aids they felt this is the 
highest responsibility 
so do some two dozen aids activist groups which announced plans 
to attend the fiveday meeting to protest the immigration policy 
and publicize their claims of government inaction and drug company 
profits on aids medications 
not joining the boycott was a painful decision for us said 
tom cunningham a member of the new york chapter of the aids 
coalition to unleash power better known as act up but we do 
need the opportunity to challenge aids researchers and the 
pharmaceutical companies 
the controversy is over a 1987 senate amendment ordering the 
public health service to place infection by hiv the virus that 
causes aids on the list of contagious diseases that may bar 
foreigners from entering the united states 
the list also includes leprosy tuberculosis and five sexually 
transmitted diseases 
the restriction has been condemned by scores of aids groups 
including the national commission on aids as an infringement on 
human rights the commissions chairman dr june osborn said the 
policy fosters the impression that aids and hiv infection can be 
easily transmitted 
a number of groups involved in aids education programs and care 
of aids patients are boycotting the conference 
the list includes almost 100 nongovernmental organizations 
including the international planned parenthood foundation and the 
league of red cross and red crescent societies a genevabased 
federation of red cross organizations from 149 countries 
the world health organization also criticized the immigration 
policy and for a time contemplated backing out as cosponsor of 
the conference 
dr bruce dick health department director at the league of red 
cross and red crescent said many of the boycotting groups could 
lend valuable groundlevel experience to scientists at the 
conference 
the most negative thing about us not participating is the 
missed opportunity to use a big conference like this to form 
partnerships he said 
dick said the society had 40 people from 30 countries at last 
years conference in montreal and originally had planned to send 
more representatives to san francisco 
the bush administration twice has tried to blunt the outcry 
last year the immigration and naturalization service adopted a 
waiver policy that would allow those infected with hiv to stay in 
the united states up to 30 days for business purposes conferences 
medical treatment and family visits 
the waiver also offered foreign visitors greater 
confidentiality eliminating permanent identifying marks on their 
passports 
in april the ins said it would issue new 10day visas for those 
coming to this country for professional or scientific conferences 
those applying for the visas are not required to state if they are 
infected with hiv 
the new visa plan cooled some of the protest but many remain 
opposed to any singling out of aids or hivinfected people 
the administration has made some efforts but we still find 
the policy objectionable said sue lucas coordinator of the 
united kingdom aids consortium for the third world a group of 40 
british organizations with aids programs in developing countries 
we are particularly concerned that this type of discrimination 
in the united states would have an impact on discrimination in 
other countries she said 
the controversy has brought calls for the administration to 
remove aids and hiv infection from the list 
legislative leaders point to a government accounting office 
opinion that the secretary of health and human services can remove 
the restriction but administration officials maintain a directive 
from congress cannot be eliminated that way 
rep j roy rowland dga introduced legislation in april that 
would give the department of health and human services authority 
over deciding which diseases are on the list 
it is my opinion the administration would like a way out of 
this said rowland the present rule reflects adversely on the 
united states which has been a leader in scientific and medical 
research for many years 
the united states always has placed health and social limits on 
those entering the country in the late 18th century a prohibition 
existed on prostitutes and beggars 
today 33 separate categories limit travel to this country such 
as medical conditions mental disease political ideology bigamy 
and homosexuality 
during the wave of immigration through new yorks ellis island 
people were forced to run up and down stairs to see if they winded 
easily a sign of tuberculosis ins spokesman duke austin said 
the present law which dates back to 1952 first barred those 
with tuberculosis and leprosy by 1987 the list included five 
sexually transmitted diseases gonorrhea infectious syphilis 
chancroid granuloma inguinale and lymphogranuloma venereum 
aids was added to the list by the public health service in june 
of that year hiv infection was placed on the list by congressional 
mandate in august 
thirtythree other countries place entrance restrictions on 
foreigners with aids or hiv infection usually on those seeking 
extended stays iraq demands aids tests for anyone staying more 
than five days those seeking permanent residence or a stay longer 
than 12 months in australia also must be tested bahrain tests 
certain foreign workers such as hotel staff and hairdressers 
those seeking permanent entry to the united states must have a 
full physical examination but visitors are not tested for disease 
basically it is an honor system said austin there is no 
way to tell unless an inspector ascertains through the discovery of 
drugs or certain physical characteristics that the inspection 
should be pressed further 
opponents of us policy say the issue is one of setting a 
standard for the rest of the world they hope a final resolution 
can be reached before 1992 when another international aids 
conference is scheduled for boston 
to many countries the united states is a leader in terms of 
its policies said dick of the league of red cross and red 
crescent it is essential that we have nondiscriminatory 
policies because it is through nondiscrimination that we are going 
to control this disease

norma chavarria a former teacher has 
opened a makeshift store to keep going until president violeta 
barrios de chamorro makes the stalled economy run and times get 
better 
we have to give violeta time she said how can a 
president do in 40 days what the sandinistas couldnt do in 10 
years my husband and i are confident things will get better in 
about six months 
mrs chavarria 24 leaned on the counter in the dirtfloored 
wooden shack where she sells single cakes of laundry soap soft 
drinks envelopes of soup mix and other inexpensive items 
a neighbor who had just come in said thats right those 
sandinistas didnt do anything except make us go to meetings a 
meeting for this a meeting for that we have to give a little time 
to poor dona violeta 
mrs chavarrias husband jose is a bricklayer who brings home 
20 a month slightly more than she earned as a grade school 
teacher her teaching papers were lost they moved here recently 
from esteli so they decided she should open the store 
many people seem to share the guarded optimism of mrs chavarria 
and the neighbor but there also is a show me attitude that 
good times are not just around the corner 
nicaraguans voted the sandinistas out feb 25 and inflation 
still is high nearly two months after mrs chamorros proamerican 
government was inaugurated 
inflation reached 36000 percent in 1988 then declined to 1800 
percent in 1989 
francisco mayorga president of the central bank now gauges it 
weekly his figures were 47 percent for the first week of may then 
17 percent 12 and 11 for the next three 
mayorga who was educated at yale and devised mrs chamorros 
economic recovery plan accused the sandinistas of using the 
twomonth transition period to undermine the new government 
he said they spent money wildly and printed more to cover the 
deficit 
president bush signed a 300 million aid package may 26 the 
first 60 million arrived quickly and between may 25 and may 31 
the black market price of a dollar declined from 310000 cordobas 
to 290000 
the exchange houses are supplying dollars again thats why it 
went down said jose gutierrez one of two dozen currency dealers 
on a street near the mexican embassy 
gutierrez and his colleagues wave wads of cordobas at passing 
motorists and police look the other way 
another sign of improvement is a 20 percent increase in planted 
farm acreage over last year mayorga said food production fell 
steadily under the sandinistas 
on the negative side nicaraguas currency has been devalued 
frequently since mrs chamorro took office the parallel exchange 
rate which governs most dollar transactions had gone from 70800 
cordobas to 226600 by may 31 
some chamorro supporters are beginning to grumble 
maybe we would have been better off under the sandinistas 
said julio gonzalez 33 who runs an auto repair shop with his 
cousin former president daniel ortega he said had the economy 
more or less under control 
what does he expect to happen now maybe well see an 
improvement in six months a year but it better happen just like 
we knocked down somoza we knocked down the sandinistas well we 
can knock down this government too 
the sandinista revolution overthrew the late president anastasio 
somosa in july 1979 
rolando perez sanchez a 29yearold sandinista union leader 
listened with skepticism to gonzalez his friend and neighbor 
its not going to happen he said shaking his head this 
government if full of bourgeois who will hoard all the capital and 
leave the workers the crumbs 
what we have to do is what daniel said rule from below to 
defend the conquests of the revolution 
ruling from below took the form of a crippling strike by 
public employees in may after which the government gave broad 
concessions to unions 
mrs chamorro has had to proceed carefully because of the 
militant sandinista opposition 
her government plans to review confiscations of property under 
the sandinistas and continues to trim the huge bureaucracy firing 
public employees 
sandinista threats of more strikes if the firings continued have 
not materialized and their protest marches draw smaller crowds if 
economic improvement continues the sandinistas could lose the 
leverage of being the defenders of workers buying power 
another sandinista rallying point the contra rebels might 
disappear once the guerrillas demobilize 
im like st thomas ill have to see it to believe it 
gonzalez said 
for mrs chavarria who has three small children abolition of 
the twoyear draft for boys of 16 is great progress 
you dont know what a relief this is for us mothers she 
said as for the rest of it well have to wait at least we eat 
every day

joyce mujuru fought so fiercely in the 
war for independence that she earned the name spill blood now 
10 years later she fights for womens rights in a maledominated 
culture 
mujuru 35 is minister of community development in president 
robert mugabes government and finds the new battle in its own 
way as daunting as the old one 
we have come a long way since independence but there is still 
a lot of work to be done educating people about womens rights 
she said in an interview 
in the civil war she said we fought side by side with our 
men and they realized we deserved what we were asking laws giving 
women equal rights a woman historian who asked not to be 
identified said women have retrogreessed since independence 
they only made progress because of their contribution to the war 
but now men in government are asserting traditional attitudes 
women were a strong force in the sevenyear war that ended nine 
decades of white minority rule and transformed rhodesia a british 
colony into independent blackruled zimbabwe 
many ferried arms sheltered fighters or were spies for the 
insurgents 
others engaged in combat it was said of joyce mujuru that she 
was the first woman to shoot down a rhodesian helicopter 
women have made some advances since independence laws that once 
barred them from certain jobs and denied them full legal rights 
have been repealed they can make contracts own land and are no 
longer regarded legally as minors 
turmoil has accompanied change in this african nation of 95 
million people more than half of whom are women 
wife beating rape and baby murders are on the rise reports 
appear almost daily of newborns found abandoned in ditches tossed 
into bushes jammed into sewer pipes even buried alive 
elizabeth rider of womens action group blames the baby 
dumping and illegal backstreet abortions on economic and social 
stresses facing women 
changes in traditional culture are not keeping up with rapid 
urbanization and women are taking the brunt of it she said 
in african villages grandmothers and aunts traditionally advise 
young girls about sex without that help many schoolgirls in 
cities and towns become pregnant rider said 
faced with expulsion from school and shame in a culture that 
ostracizes single mothers they often have little choice but 
selfinduced abortions and some even kill their babies she said 
farm women still do most of the work in the fields while men sit 
under the trees drinking home brew 
my husband does the planning and i do the work said susan 
marewo a farmer in northeastern zimbabwe 
male judges carry traditions rooted in polygamy and male 
domination into their courtrooms 
one magistrate after hearing the case of a man who beat his 
wife to death because she refused to cook him a meal fined the man 
the equivalent of 100 and set him free the woman had asked for 
trouble the judge said 
another obstacle to sexual equality is the bride price a cow 
and two goats was considered a good sum 50 years ago but some 
fathers now demand several thousand dollars for a 
universityeducated daughter 
the government is reluctant to outlaw the tradition mugabe has 
said the bride price should be considered a custom of expressing 
thanks not of buying a woman or a passport for oppressing her 
but few heed his advice 
womens rights groups say many african men believe the more they 
pay for a a wife the greater their right dominate her 
attitudes and values are ingrained in our minds and 
unfortunately for women hard to change said victoria chitepo the 
information minister

ford motor cos longstanding reputation for durable rugged 
trucks is safe with the 1991 explorer the new utility vehicle that 
replaces the bronco ii at ford dealerships 
the explorer eddie bauer 4door 4x4 test vehicle included 
pushbutton shiftonthefly fourwheeldrive and large firestone 
axt radial tires 
and its electronic fuelinjected v6 engine and fourspeed 
automatic transmission handled gravel mud and sand with ease the 
4liter engine is rated at 155 horsepower and this models towing 
capacity is 5700 pounds 
the test model had sporty leather bucket seats in the front and 
a firm rear bench seat that offered decent hiproom for three 
adults rear legroom was good helped by the 112inch wheelbase 
the explorer looks compact from the outside it handles well and 
maneuvers easily into shopping center parking spaces that despite 
its nearly 80 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seat folded 
down thats 9 cubic feet more than the bronco ii 
ford compares the explorers cargo space with others in its 
class including the chevrolet s10 4door blazer 74 cubic feet 
and the jeep cherokee 72 the explorer also is the only compact 
utility vehicle that offers an optional front bench seat to allow 
it to carry six people 
as expected in a utility vehicle visibility was exceptional 
because of the explorers high ground clearance but like others 
the explorer cant handle extremely abrupt moves because its high 
stance contributes to significant body roll i also noted a 
somewhat soft suspension that allowed quite a number of jiggles to 
creep into the ride and give the explorer a rather trucklike feel 
the suspension by the way features front coils and rear leaf 
springs 
the explorer did swallow the gas in my demanding test drive and 
the epa fuel economy is rated at 15 miles per gallon in the city 
and 20 on the highway 
also buttons for tuning the amfm cassette radio were rather 
small i was thankful that the gear shift lever coming off the 
steering column had a curve in it that allowed me to rest my hand 
as i worked to change stations especially during particularly 
jumpy rides 
additionally the test model had cruise control but there was 
no indicator on the dashboard to show when it was engaged 
thoughtful touches on the explorer include the special rear 
cargo door handle to make it easier to open the back the standard 
fullsize spare tire is mounted to the frame outside the vehicle 
beneath the rear loading floor which allows for a wonderfully 
flat unhindered and nicely carpeted storage space the ventilation 
system was powerful and cooled and heated the interior quickly 
and the vinyl sunroof cover was a snap to release and reinstall 
the explorer won the four wheeler of the year award from four 
wheeler magazine and was motorweek magazines drivers choice for a 
multipurpose vehicle 
earlier this month ford recalled 2700 explorers to replace 
hinges on the sunroofs saying owners could misalign them when 
replacing the roof the company said that doing so could allow the 
sunroof to blow off when driving 
production of the new model started in midmarch and ford hopes 
eventually to make 200000 two and fourdoor explorers annually 
sales for the first two months were nearly 24000 up 37 percent 
from the 17799 bronco iis sold in the same period a year earlier 
ford said 
the company expects the vehicle to be most popular with married 
college graduates in their 30s and 40s with upscale jobs ford 
expects almost half the buyers to be women 
competitors include the chevrolet s10 4door blazer priced at 
16905 with sixcylinder engine and automatic transmission the 
jeep cherokee priced at 16405 for a model with automatic 
transmission and sixcylinder engine and the toyota 4runner with 
v6 engine and automatic transmission for 15500 
the test vehicle was a topoftheline eddie bauer version with 
a base price of 21315 a less luxurious fourdoor model with v6 
engine and automatic transmission carries a base price of 17698 
because the explorer is a new vehicle consumer reports magazine 
does not have an owner trouble report

according to one of his followers the senate 
majority leader is the poor guy who works late after most senators 
are back home at night in pajamas watching on television 
a republican senator adds that he couldnt imagine a worse job 
sen george j mitchell of maine ran hard for that job winning 
the authority to shepherd senators and senate business or try it 
has its moments the majority leader is a national spokesman for 
his party a man to reckon with on any federal government decision 
it also has headaches 
mitchell the democratic senator from maine usually is stoic 
calm and businesslike but some days the frustration shows his 
senate enforcement powers are limited an earlier generation of 
congressional leaders had rewards to grant and punishments to 
wield reformers have eliminated many of them and party discipline 
has faded as it has in the house 
but the house does its legislative business under procedural 
rules that limit debate regulate amendments and generally insure 
that the majority on an issue will get its way the senate doesnt 
have such a legislative traffic code and there are no limits to 
debate unless threefifths of the senators vote to restrict it 
the system protects not only dissenters but also absentees who 
often want actions delayed until they get back to vote as a 
result much of the senates work is done under intricate 
agreements worked out to protect all sides and enforceable only 
because nobody objected when they were adopted 
lately there have been more objections than agreements 
a major crime bill was swamped in a sea of amendments 337 of 
them when mitchell said he was going to drop the bill even though 
a majority wants it passed because republicans had twice blocked 
efforts to limit debate and force it to a vote 
three other measures were blocked too one by a threatened 
filibuster one by amendments and sparse attendance and one by the 
objections of absentees who insisted on delaying the vote 
on june 8 a friday mitchell said 27 of the 100 senators were 
absent which meant those who were left couldnt do any significant 
business because nobody wanted their measures brought to a vote 
with that many people missing 
were just reaching the point where it is very very difficult 
to move forward on any piece of legislation mitchell said that 
day 
like a teacher with an unruly class he said he might take away 
recess 
he said he may start scheduling morning votes on mondays and 
fridays a move that would cut down on long weekends he threatened 
to shorten the fourweek august recess and said congress may have 
to work longer into the fall even though it is an election year 
and candidatemembers want to quit a month before the nov 6 
elections 
that kind of recess discipline or the threat of it has been 
tried before by other majority leaders to enforce their 
schedules sen bob dole of kansas said he sympathized because 
when the republican minority he leads was in the majority he tried 
to dream up ways to speed senate business and nothing worked 
sen alan j dixon dill called the majority leader this 
poor guy who gets here before us in the morning and leaves after we 
are all back home at night in pajamas watching on television to see 
what time the poor devil gets to go home 
mitchell listed some of the major measures that havent yet come 
up for action civil rights campaign finance reform a farm bill 
defense appropriations housing legislation and the biggest of the 
lot a budget resolution still under negotiation with the white 
house 
theres talk that it may take a lameduck postelection session 
to deal with the budget sen bob packwood rore thinks it will 
be necessary in order to settle on a budget to end what would by 
then be sharp and automatic spending cuts sen warren b rudman 
rnh speculates that a lameduck session might also deal with 
senate pay and campaign reform 
even the deadlines and calendar pressures of a holidayseason 
lameduck session would not guarantee swift downtobusiness 
behavior delay becomes an even more formidable weapon against 
legislation when everybody wants to quit for christmas and another 
headache for the leader 
i cannot imagine a worse job than to try to organize this 
body said sen john c danforth rmo i think it would be 
absolutely terrible

if snappy quotes sold for a buck apiece 
norman j ornstein would be a wealthy man 
a political scientist at the american enterprise institute a 
rightofcenter think tank ornstein is hardly a household name 
but he happens to be one of the most widely quoted people in 
washington 
at the ring of a telephone he spouts expert opinions on just 
about any topic from perestroika to peanut subsidies from ethics 
to ethnic restaurants 
hes the king of quotes the sultan of sound bites the imam 
of instant analysis the titan of talking heads hes the darling 
of tv producers and the garrulous savior of quotehungry newspaper 
reporters battling a deadline 
if i have an opinion ill give it he says 
joann moriarty remembers her introduction to ornstein in 1986 
when she was a rookie washington reporter for states news service 
and needed some quotes for an electionyear story she was writing 
about rep james broyhill rnc 
the guy at the next desk said have you called norm ornstein 
yet i said norm who he said hes mr congressional 
comment so i phoned ornstein and he returned my call 
immediately 
she felt flattered then astonished 
i asked him about broyhill and it was like pressing a button 
he just spit it all out everything i wanted to know said ms 
moriarty who was grateful for ornsteins punchy oneliners but a 
bit embarrassed that shed never heard of him before 
i just didnt realize he was such a big cheese she said 
journalists praise ornstein for his insiders savvy his 
accessibility and his ability to cut quickly to the essence of a 
complex subject in lively easytounderstand language 
hes a master of the pithy quote says peggy robinson 
senior political producer for public tvs macneillehrer 
newshour where ornstein frequently appears as a guest 
commentator 
i try to restrain myself and not quote ornstein too often 
says helen dewar congressional correspondent for the washington 
post but when im analyzing a situation im frequently curious 
what he thinks and he will unfailingly say something i just have 
to quote its too good to pass up no one puts it so concisely or 
so well 
how did ornstein become washingtons most quotable man 
i was sitting in a laundromat a couple of blocks from near my 
apartment on capitol hill in the early 1970s twiddling my thumbs 
while my clothes were in the dryer he recalled 
hed just finished reading a book about former harlem 
congressman adam clayton powell and thought it would make for an 
interesting book review 
i had a yellow pad and a pen so i just dashed off a review in 
an hour and sent it to the post they printed it on the front page 
of the style section with a picture 
a short time later he talked to a feature writer about his 
favorite country inns his quotes popped up in a page one story in 
the wall street journal i was thunderstruck ornstein said 
and bitten by the media bug 
he started writing reviews and oped pieces for the post and the 
new york times which led to stints as a commentator and 
documentary editor for public television which led to appearances 
on network tv talk shows 
as his visibility grew reporters started calling him for quotes 
to lend an authoritative ring to their stories ornstein happily 
obliged 
i had a pretty good feel for what journalists were looking 
for and i found frankly that it served my own interests he 
said i could learn an awful lot by talking to reporters who were 
working on stories in ways that i didnt have the time to do 
myself there could be a pooling a sharing of information 
to keep abreast of things ornstein 41 reads voraciously at 
least five newspapers every day plus stacks of magazines and 
academic journals he goes to capitol hill three days a week to 
roam the corridors he spends about two hours a day talking to 
journalists 
he attends luncheons seminars receptions and speaking events 
to schmooze and pick things up he even quizzes fellow airline 
passengers and fathers on the sidelines of neighborhood soccer 
games 
spoofing ornsteins supposed omniscience the irreverent new 
york magazine spy peppered a special washington edition last month 
with no fewer than 17 opinions from ornstein on everything from 
taxi fares to sex scandals president bush ranked second with 14 
references 
one of spys editors called to say theyd gotten hundreds of 
letters ornstein said with a chuckle most of them asked who 
the hell is this guy norman ornstein

raising specialty flowers could mean the sweet 
scent of success for small farmers who study markets and learn the 
tricks of the trade 
it can be downright tasty too 
dried or fresh certain specialty flowers can stimulate not 
only the eyes but also the sense of taste or smell empowering new 
marketing enterprises for smallscale enterprisers says a new 
report by the agriculture department 
the overall business of growing flowers and other floriculture 
crops is nothing to sneeze at last years wholesale value was 
about 243 billion up 6 percent from 1988 
by comparison corn was the most valuable crop at more than 17 
billion but floriculture as a group exceeded the 1989 estimated 
value of many notable commodities including sorghum 128 
billion oats 5575 million durum wheat 319 million rice 
11 billion and sugar beets 239 billion 
specialty flowers represent a portion of the total floriculture 
industry rather like lambs or pigs being part of livestock 
production 
the possibilities of growing and selling specialty flowers are 
examined in a new onesheet report part of a series by the 
departments office for smallscale agriculture 
previous topics have included tree farming sheep goats 
mushrooms foliage plants herbs wildflowers specialty vegetables 
and exotic livestock such as ostriches llamas alpacas water 
buffalo and european fallow deer 
and now specialty flowers 
such flowers can be marketed fresh dried sugarcoated in 
bulk as singles or by the pound ounce or sometimes gram the 
report said this exciting market although subject to whims of 
designers chefs or fashion continues to grow to meet demands 
growers meet specific needs including rare cut flowers edible 
flowers for garnishes or salads potpourri mixes and medicinal 
plants 
but as in any specialty flowers must meet consumer expectations 
reflected in production packaging and presentation the report 
said smallscale entrepreneurs also should become acquainted with 
members of local chefs associations or state restaurant groups 
the report urged wouldbe specialty growers to read trade 
journals and other publications to learn more about techniques and 
demands 
stan and susan devoto of sebastopol calif learned at a local 
farmers market how edible flowers could be a marketing aid for 
produce they told the furrow magazine 
you need something different to get noticed susan said 
gourmet chefs and discerning grocery shoppers are seeing a wide 
range of old favorites these days including calendula 
chrysanthemum dianthus dandelion geranium hibiscus lily 
nasturtium pansy rose and blue violets 
others include certain herb flowers like mint sage basil and 
bergamot and even vegetable flowers such as pumpkin okra and 
squash the usda report said 
farmer david aydelotte of salisbury md said chefs using his 
fieldgrown mint flowers and herb flowers are always looking for 
new garnishes 
many chefs are looking for a social event a story that goes 
with the food he said 
another example cited by usda is the victorian technique of 
candying flowers used by jo and rob pendergraph of midlothian va 
and reported in the delmarva farmer newspaper 
in this technique each flower petal is painted with egg white 
and sprinkled with granulated sugar after the sugar has 
crystalized the flowers are stored in airtight containers 
the pendergraphs said the candied flowers sell for 45 per 100 
at a major new york city department store 
competition is even fiercer in the driedflower market the usda 
report said a number of references and guides were listed along 
with their costs and addresses for ordering copies 
the report was prepared by thomas s handwerker of the 
university of marylandeastern shore and george b holcomb of the 
departments office of public affairs

the columbia river drains a texassized 
corner of northwestern north america its historically pristine 
waters rushing to the pacific ocean 
seemingly spared the industrial pollution threatening other 
great rivers the columbia is the heart of a vast and fertile land 
majestic bald eagles nest along its lower reaches salmon fight 
their way upstream in an annual ritual of renewal 
but all may not be well on the river environmentalists armed 
with federal studies say a nearly imperceptible adversary 
threatens to drain the life out of the columbia 
the 1989 studies by the environmental protection agency show six 
pulp and paper mills on the columbia in oregon and washington dump 
dioxins and related toxic compounds into the river where they are 
accumulating in fish in unprecedented amounts 
an epa official concluded the pollution poses a significant 
threat to human health and the environment 
the epa sampled bottom fish in the columbia unlike migratory 
salmon bottom feeders such as carp and sturgeon spend their 
lives in the river 
dioxins the chemical that caused the evacuation of love canal 
cause cancer in laboratory animals and some scientists are 
questioning studies that so far have found no cancer link in 
humans the compounds also persist in soil for years 
dioxins and other chlorinated organic compounds are byproducts 
of bleaching wood pulp to make white paper while many industrial 
processes produce dioxins environmentalists say the pulp mills are 
the greatest offenders on the river 
based on epa guidelines the oregon department of environmental 
quality and the washington department of ecology are considering 
limits on discharges of the most toxic of the dioxins 2378tcdd 
of 0013 parts per quadrillion in water just downstream from the 
mills a concentration that low cannot be measured using current 
technology so the states would use a mathematical formula to 
calculate whether the mills are in compliance 
the limits on dioxin discharges are written into permits for the 
mills but final action is being delayed by appeals in oregon 
where new permits have been issued washingtons department of 
ecology is in the final stages of preparing new permits 
the regional pulp and paper industry says meeting the new 
standards would be too expensive 815 million over three years for 
all the mills in the region and it says its own study shows dioxin 
levels that are undetectable or well within us food and drug 
administration limits its conclusion river fish are safe to eat 
all this is enough to rile people like mary obrien staff 
scientist of the northwest coalition for alternatives to pesticides 
in eugene 
this is the most toxic compound known to humans she said 
and if we cant tell the industry no to dumping the most toxic 
compound known to humans into the river for some superfluous 
purpose like whiteness of paper what are we willing to regulate in 
the world 
obriens group along with columbia river united want dioxin 
discharges eliminated 
stop talking to me about how much dioxin is acceptable 
obrien said and start talking to me about how to get rid of it 
all 
publicly one of oregons top public health officials dr 
laurence foster has agreed there is no reason to advise most 
people to eat less fish 
but privately in a march 16 letter to llewellyn matthews 
executive director of the northwest pulp and paper association 
foster tore into the industrys study 
after several months of review he said the oregon health 
division found the study did not support the conclusion that 
columbia river fish are safe 
it would seem the good citizens responsibility to do 
everything possible to prevent future generations from being 
exposed to everincreasing body burdens of this toxic chemical 
said foster acting health officer and deputy administrator of the 
oregon health division 
i encourage you for the sake of future oregonians to do 
everything possible to stop all discharge of dioxin into the 
environment 
in an interview foster said he had no comment beyond the 
letter made public by john bonine of the western natural resources 
law clinic at the university of oregon foster added he did not 
mean to question the good intentions of the industry only the 
science upon which the conclusion that the fish are safe to eat was 
based 
the state eventually plans its own study of the fish 
industry spokesmen say they are reducing dioxin discharges but 
they argue it is unfair to set standards at undetectable levels 
were going to undertake every reasonable effort to reduce 
matthews said were shooting for 80 percent 
she said environmentalists blow the danger out of proportion 
dioxin is overrated as a carcinogen matthews said 
alternatives exist to the chlorine bleaching process that 
produces dioxins one mill the james river mill in camas has 
produced dioxinfree paper as an experiment 
however industry officials say consumers want the bright white 
paper produced by chlorine bleaching they are reluctant to make 
the expensive transition to alternatives as long as there are 
doubts about whether consumers will buy the new products 
but thats not good enough for obrien these animals just die 
out silently she said no one comes around and says hey im 
dying

tetsuya theodore fujita saw his only natural 
tornado near denver in 1982 it was like meeting my lover he 
says 
since then my passion really went up said fujita a 
professor of geophysical science who has been studying tornadoes 
for 42 years and is considered one of the worlds foremost 
authorities on the violent storms 
fujita 69 spends much of his time in his lab at the university 
of chicago creating tornadoes for research 
he creates tornadoes over a large fan which makes a swirling 
motion another fan above simulates a lowpressure system by adding 
an updraft to the mix with a bit of steam added to make the 
phenomenon visible he gets twisters 6 to 8 feet tall 
the miniature versions are as impossible to redirect or squelch 
as their fullsized cousins he says hes tried by crawling right 
up next to them and using rulers or books to change their direction 
fujita came to the united states from japan in 1953 partly 
because there are so many tornadoes in this country 
tornadoes are very rare in japan fujita said they have 
just about 10 to 15 a year but one occurred within about 15 miles 
of my hometown i was quite impressed with the localized severity 
of the wind 
when he saw his first he and a team of scientists were studying 
wind shear and its effect on aircraft 
its a beautiful thing fujita said of course i was 20 
miles away from that one 
if youre in it he added its a terrible thing 
forecasters still have trouble predicting tornadoes 
but fujita has helped define the conditions most likely to spawn 
them groups of thunderstorms are not as likely to spawn tornadoes 
as single large storms because multiple storms in the same area 
compete 
each one tries to rotate but they all cant theyre just 
like human beings the rich may become richer and the poor may get 
poorer 
fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually 
six or seven small twisters he called suction vortices rotating 
around the center of a larger tornado 
a suction vortex can pick up a car or a small house or 
something but when youre standing right next to it you can be 
completely safe 
he has studied tornadoes that have dropped houses into lakes 
made off with one car and left another right next to it untouched 
and moved whole flocks of cows and sheep which lived through the 
experience 
he also developed a scale for measuring the strength of 
tornadoes called the fujita scale it runs from zero a tornado 
that might break twigs on trees to five a twister that can rip 
houses from their foundations 
but fujita considers his work on other air movements called 
downbursts and microbursts some of his most significant 
downbursts are powerful drafts of air moving down from a 
thunderstorm cloud scientists long thought the drafts dissipated 
before reaching the ground 
microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts which are more 
dangerous because they give pilots less time to react fujita said 
the national transportation safety board has cited microbursts 
a term coined by fujita as the cause of 17 aircraft accidents in 
the past 15 years causing 577 fatalities 
among them was the 1985 crash of a delta l1011 at dallas that 
killed 137 people a downburst also was implicated in the collapse 
of a wall at a school in newburgh ny that killed nine children 
fujitas work helped persuade the federal aviation administation 
to begin installing a new radar system at 47 major airports 
beginning in the early 1990s 
the doppler radar system was credited with helping three 
jetliners at denvers airport avoid potentially catastrophic 
microbursts last year 
fujita retires from teaching this year but will continue his 
research at the university 
in texas one time five people were killed when they drove 
right into a tornado they just didnt know any better fujita 
said i want to make people safer

a geologist who built a doghouse with some 
dusty plywood believes he may have discovered the obvious to 
explain the mysterious prairie mounds that dot the landscape 
the mounds also known as mima or pimple mounds are scattered 
across washington oregon california wyoming colorado northern 
new mexico southeastern oklahoma eastern texas arkansas and 
western louisiana they long have baffled scientists 
andrew berg a geologist for the us bureau of mines believes 
the mounds were formed by earthquakes thousands of years ago some 
other scientists did not discount his theory but said more research 
is needed 
right after the st helens ashfall 10 years ago i was 
working in my backyard here in spokane on a kennel for my dog 
there was a plywood board on the ground it had a little dusting of 
st helens volcanic ash on it berg said 
he laid some 2by4s on the board to nail a frame 
i started hammering away and all of the sudden i looked at 
the board and here were these little bumps of ash 
its the same principle that clumps sawdust when vibrated by a 
table saw 
berg 64 wondered if the vibrations on a larger scale such as 
seismic activity might have created the hillocks 
so he tried again this time with a bread boardsized sheet of 
plywood and some loess a finegrained soil i tapped it with a 
hammer and sure enough vibrations caused little miniature 
mounds berg said 
the hammer creates shock waves some parts of the board vibrate 
hard and others are still as the waves intersect similar wave 
interference during earthquakes could have created mima mounds in 
areas where loose soil sits on a hard surface such as rock berg 
said 
the minimounds were not wiped out by subsequent blows of the 
hammer leading berg to believe the mounds are stable 
he said his theory could help explain why the mounds first 
written about 150 years ago form in such different climates 
at mima prairie south of olympia hundreds of mounds range from 
8 feet to 50 feet across and up to 6 feet high theyre not always 
easy to see except from the air 
some scientists have said they were built by gophers or formed 
by glacial action no one really knows 
theres probably almost as many ideas on the origin of these 
things as there are people who have looked at them said charles 
higgins a geology professor at the university of californiadavis 
higgins said he doesnt know if berg is correct but he admits 
the theory answers some geological questions im inclined to 
think that the mounds are more the result of some kind of field 
stress desiccation cracking or frost cracking he said 
i would like to have seismologists either verify it the 
theory or set it aside i hope its widely discussed and kicked 
around berg said 
albert lincoln washburn a retired geology professor at the 
university of washington said the idea needs research 
its intriguing but the basic evidence remains to be 
forthcoming washburn said i dont think its been proved that 
all these mounds in different parts of the country have the same 
origin by any means

one of the things that makes a healthy diet hard 
to stick to is the feeling that youre missing out 
try fruit 
fruit is of course tempting when local fruits are at their 
peak then they are the first and foremost of the fast food 
desserts say cookbook authors sheryl and mel london 
but yearround dressed up fruit can be elegant and wipe out 
any sense of deprivation 
herbs or flowers mixed with fruit seems a new combination in 
american cooking but in fact its an idea that dates back 
centuries and is now being revived as cooks search for more local 
healthful foods to replace the butter and cream and chocolate that 
have so often signaled dessert 
sorbets are fatfree easy to make and can be adapted to just 
about any fruit 
in warm weather fruit can be grilled the natural sugars in 
fruit carmelize over the coals so all thats needed is to skewer a 
selection of fruits and place them on the barbecue a yogurtbased 
fruit sauce makes it fancy 
we are both addicted to a healthful diet low in fat and 
relying mostly on fish and chicken for our protein needs the 
londons write in their new book fresh fruit desserts classic and 
contemporary prentice hall press 2495 
while theirs is not a diet book they kept health in mind we 
have attempted to address our concerns about cholesterol by relying 
more upon spices herbs citrus and liqueurs to provide flavor 
while being quite prudent in paring down the amounts of cream 
eggs butter and sour cream 
to that end they think about fruits as the featured 
players the flavor is brought out not disguised for 
outofseason or tropical fruits shipped from far away that might 
mean poaching baking or gratineeing 
in designing recipes mrs london said in a telephone interview 
we sort of did a countdown backward and eliminated 
wed look at a recipe and say six eggs lets try it with 
one and egg whites youd be surprised at how often it works 
london said 
a banana souffle for example calls for just a halfcup of milk 
and two egg yolks to serve four strawberry witches froth served 
in wine glasses needs just fruit egg whites and a halfcup of 
sugar along with flavorings to serve eight people

americans drink more than 24 gallons of 
coffee per man woman and child annually but according to the us 
department of agriculture whites and older people drink more than 
their share 
age and race are factors associated with consumption of 
coffee said sharon j mickle of the human nutrition service at 
the agriculture department 
a usda study was based on interviews in 2800 homes around the 
country from april 1987 to aes and 35 percent of blacks interviewed said 
they drank coffee 
during the threeday survey period 
i really was surprised by the difference ms mickle said 
ms mickle spoke recently at the fourth annual conference of the 
association for the study of food and society at drexel university 
the convention featured nutritionists and sociologists from the 
united states europe mexico and india 
ms mickle said in 1988 the amount of coffee consumed in the 
nation equaled 243 gallons per person 
paul rozin a psychology professor at the university of 
pennsylvania said people who prefer black coffee may do so for its 
stimulating effects he said his research indicates those who like 
black coffee often do not favor other coffee products such as 
coffee ice cream 
you cant predict from how much someone likes black coffee 
whether they will like coffee yogurt he said

worries about the quality of loans to finance 
takeovers and commercial real estate spread to the west coast as a 
leading rating agency downgraded the debt of two top california 
banks 
moodys investors service on wednesday lowered its ratings on 
the longterm debt of security pacific corp and wells fargo corp 
by one notch 
the action came just two days after the agency downgraded the 
debt of chase manhattan corp holding company for the nations 
second largest bank because of concerns about real estate lending 
also in recent weeks moodys and rival rating agency standard amp 
poors corp have lowered their ratings on citicorp the nations 
biggest bank citing real estate and takeover loans 
moodys latest action affected 32 billion in debt of wells 
fargo and its subsidiaries and about 74 billion at security 
pacific despite the downgrades the debt retains a solid 
investmentgrade rating 
the actions drew protests from the two companies whose main 
subsidiaries security pacific national bank and wells fargo bank 
are the second and thirdlargest banks in california and among the 
top ten in the nation 
moodys did not describe specific problem loans but said the 
california real estate market has only begun to soften 
wells fargo and security pacific have diversified real estate 
portfolios and apparently sound underwriting standards moodys 
said both companies may be forced to beef up reserves against 
losses because of the weakening california market though it said 
both companies also have substantial exposure to highly 
leveraged transactions such as corporate buyouts and 
recapitalizations moodys said the adjustments reflected growing 
concern that california may be about to suffer real estate woes 
common elsewhere in the country on tuesday for example san 
diegos homefed bank said its nonperforming assets rose by 81 
million in may due mainly to bad commercial real estate loans in 
california 
homefeds stock fell 825 a share to 25 on the new york stock 
exchange wednesday dragging down other california bank and thrift 
stocks wells fargo for example was off 237 at 8167 
security pacific lost 75 cents to close at 4037 
moodys announced its downgrades after the market closed 
the agency lowered its ratings on the two bank holding companys 
senior debt to singlea1 from doublea3 significantly however it 
did not change its ratings on the companies commercial paper 
banks tend to rely on commercial paper for shortterm funding 
and a downgrade there could have triggered an immediate rise in 
funding costs for the two banks 
wells fargo and security pacific officials protested the lower 
ratings 
we have maintained a wellbalanced loan portfolio consistent 
with the demands of the marketplace and with adequate and 
appropriate levels of reserves security pacific chief executive 
robert h smith said in a statement 
leslie altick wells fargo senior vice president for investor 
relations said the bank was not convinced california real estate 
is headed for new problems softness in the office building and 
hotel markets is welldocumented but wells fargo believes 
californias underlying economy is too strong for a major downturn 
to occur she said 
as for loans for corporate buyouts she noted that wells fargos 
portfolio while still about 4 billion had been steadily 
declining because of the drying up of takeover and buyout activity

in the biggest investment to date by any regional bell telephone 
company ameritech and bell atlantic are teaming up with two new 
zealand partners to buy new zealands stateowned phone company for 
24 billion 
the two bell companies announced the purchase agreement thursday 
morning in wellington new zealand and issued a news release late 
wednesday in the united states 
the telecom corporation of new zealand is the countrys 
principal supplier of domestic and international communications 
services it is being sold as part of the governments campaign of 
selling off stateowned enterprises 
steve ford a spokesman at ameritechs headquarters in chicago 
said the two baby bell companies and their new zealand partners won 
the phone company in a bidding contest against other new zealand 
and international companies 
he said it was the biggest single investment by any of the 
regional bell companies since they were created in the breakup of 
american telephone amp telegraph co six years ago 
this represents a significant step forward as we look to 
become a major global telecommunications company ford said the 
new zealand company has good growth prospects in its home market 
and serves as a telecommunications gateway to the pacific rim he 
said 
raymond w smith chairman and chief executive of bell atlantic 
said the purchase supports our strategy to be a leading 
international information and communications company 
under the deal ameritech and bell atlantic will buy all of the 
phone company from the new zealand government then reduce their 
combined stake to 499 percent with each company owning 2495 
percent 
the companies two new zealand partners fay richwhite and 
freightways will buy 5 percent stakes each from ameritech and 
bell atlantic 
the two american companies then will sell shares for the 
remaining 401 percent on the new zealand stock market and 
internationally the stock offering will be aimed at maximizing 
participation by new zealand investors the companies said 
ameritechs ford said the companies plan to complete the 
purchase within 90 days and begin the stock offering in the first 
quarter of 1991 
telecom of new zealand had net income of 148 million on 
revenues of 131 in the year ended march 31 
ameritech teamed up with bell atlantic because the two companies 
have a similar strategy and their combined financial strength was 
needed to make the purchase without affecting domestic operations 
ford said 
ameritech will finance its share of the purchase with its own 
cash and shortterm borrowings he said the purchase wont affect 
phone rates in the midwest he said ameritech owns bell companies 
providing phone service to 12 million customers in illinois 
indiana michigan ohio and wisconsin 
bell atlantic is based in philadelphia and provides telephone 
service in the midatlantic region

lower incentives and sagging consumer confidence 
combined to push earlyjune car and truck sales down 131 percent 
from a year ago analysts and automakers say 
the 10 major us automakers said wednesday they sold cars and 
trucks at an average daily rate of 30412 during the june 110 
period this year compared with a rate of 34994 during the same 
time last year 
car sales fell 155 percent and truck sales were off 88 percent 
in line with the recent pattern sales by the big three us 
automakers fell sharply while japanese companies continued to boost 
sales from their plants in this country 
the main reasons for the overall decline were slow demand and 
smaller incentive packages this year said economist tom webb of 
the national automobile dealers association in mclean va 
the reason they are cutting back on incentives is that they 
havent overstocked the dealers webb said of the automakers 
wards automotive reports said that at the end of may newcar 
inventories among the 10 major us automakers stood at 59 selling 
days considered good for late spring 
meantime the us commerce department reported wednesday that 
may retail sales fell 07 percent the third straight month of 
decline some analysts interpreted the drop as an indication of 
sagging consumer confidence 
sales of the domestic cars made by general motors corp ford 
motor co and chrysler corp dropped 192 percent in the latest 
period while sales of usmade cars with japanese company 
nameplates rose 348 percent 
the big three held 891 percent of the car market in late june 
and the japanese transplants held 109 percent 
through june 10 this year domestic car and truck sales were 
running 44 percent behind last years pace with car sales down 
56 percent and truck sales down 22 percent 
for the entire year big three car sales were down 108 percent 
and transplant car sales were up 42 percent 
chrysler showed the largest decline in earlyjune car and light 
truck sales with an 18 percent decline the companys vehicle sales 
so far this year are off 13 percent from last year 
gm said its combined earlyjune car and truck sales were 167 
percent behind last years pace so far this year gm has sold 48 
percent fewer vehicles than last year

a new york stock exchange report that found 
little fault with program trading and recommended the securities 
and exchange commission rule over stockindex futures did little to 
advance the political debate over the two issues 
supporters of the embattled commodity futures trading commission 
engaged in a jurisdictional battle with the sec over 
stockrelated futures said wedensday the report backed their 
arguments while some sec partisans said it doesnt go far enough to 
support theirs 
but politicians and others who have been dealing with proposals 
for broad market reforms since after the 1987 crash indicated the 
new study would have little or no effect on positions already taken 
among the recommendations of the stock exchanges 18member 
panel was the establishment of a single regulator for stocks and 
stockrelated futures legislation for such a change is being 
considered by congress 
publicly senate and house members were restrained in their 
comments about the report by the panel which was ordered to 
investigate market volatility following the stock market plunge 
last oct 13 
sen donald w riegle dmich chairman of the banking housing 
and urban affairs committee said the senate panel would review 
these recommendations carefully 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house 
subcommittee that oversees the sec called for passage of pending 
market reform legislation to bolster the secs enforcement powers 
congressional aides who spoke only on the condition of 
anonymity said the report would be interpreted differently by 
supporters of the sec or cftc to bolster their respective causes 
itll be used on both sides of the argument said one senate 
aide familiar with the issues i dont think its going to have 
any effect on the pending legislation 
recommendations by the panel headed by general motors corp 
chairman roger b smith included consolidating regulation of 
stocks and stockrelated futures under one federal agency to 
improve investor confidence 
program trading strategies involving simultaneous trading of 
huge amounts of stock and stockindex futures have been blamed for 
causing or worsening big price swings in the stock market 
such trading was criticized after the oct 13 1989 market drop 
when the dow jones industrial average fell 190 points and blamed 
for worsening the oct 19 1987 crash in which the dow fell 508 
points 
legislation to put stocks and index futures under one regulator 
is bitterly opposed by the cftc the chicago futures exchanges and 
members of house and senate agriculture committees that oversee the 
cftc 
i think this bill builds our case against switching 
jurisdiction said a senate agriculture committee aide the 
panel found no evidence that a single regulator would affect 
volatility 
however the aide noted there was no evidence that 
consolidating regulatory authority would prevent a future stock 
market crash 
that contradicts the belief that congress needs to act on 
switching authority to prevent one said the aide 
that point was echoed by a spokesman for the commodity futures 
trading commission 
a couple of the recommendations were not supported by the 
analysis said cftc spokesman david gary he said the report 
found no evidence that shifting regulatory authority for stock 
index futures from the cftc to the sec affects market volatility 
but recommended doing so to improve investor confidence whats 
the basis 
on the issue of program trading said gary i think we will be 
in the same corner as the panel 
the nyse panel found nothing inherently wrong with program 
trading indicating it was more of a public relations problem than 
a threat to market stability 
a market reform bill passed by the house contains a provision 
for curbing program trading during periods of extreme market 
volatility the senate version of the bill which has stalled in 
committee contains no program trading provision 
markey a strong opponent of program trading didnt address the 
program trading aspect of the report but he said the panels 
report makes a compelling case for cracking down on intermarket 
trading abuses like front running 
front running is the trading practice of taking advantage of 
advance knowledge of a large and potentially marketmoving customer 
order in one market by taking an offsetting position in another 
market

americans are worried about paying bills run up 
in the 80s and pessimistic about the 90s according to a poll 
done for financial planners 
the findings were not unexpected said robert a hewitt 
chairman of the atlantabased international association of 
financial planners the group commissioned the survey by the gallup 
organization 
i think those of us who deal with the public on a daily basis 
weve been pretty much aware of it hewitt said 
the poll being released today found 46 percent of the 
respondents expressed worry about their ability to meet all of 
their financial responsibilities and 52 percent said they were 
concerned about outliving their retirement savings 
baby boomers had more anxiety than most among respondents 
between the ages of 35 and 44 59 percent were worried about their 
ability to meet financial responsibilities and 62 percent were 
concerned about outliving their savings the survey said 
hewitt called that age bracket triple squeeze boomers 
because they are having to deal with the costs of raising children 
and taking care of their aging parents as well as tending to their 
own needs and desires 
all of a sudden they have this discretionary income and 
discover gosh im going to have to pay for college for little 
johnny hewitt said 
college costs have risen beyond the reach of most american 
families and severe inflation is likely to be a problem in this 
decade according to 80 percent of respondents 
as a result 61 percent said they were less inclined to take 
financial risks than during the 1980s the survey said 
conducted in april among 1058 households in a random sample and 
an additional 600 with incomes of at least 50000 the survey had 
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent 
along with the concerns about longterm security americans are 
starting to increase their savings rate hewitt said adding that 
he is a staunch advocate of saving more 
im not suggesting spending less im suggesting we go on a 
cash and carry basis a more prudent spending habit he said in 
an interview from new york 
maybe youre going out to eat three times a week hewitt 
said for example maybe you can go out two times a week or three 
times a week at a less expensive place 
were not going to kill the restaurant business by doing 
that

delawares bank commissioner says the state 
will cooperate with a federal agency that has suggested banks be 
prohibited or restricted from underwriting insurance despite a 
delaware law that allows it 
the federal deposit insurance corp has proposed regulations on 
the subject but they have never been implemented state bank 
commissioner keith h ellis said wednesday the writers of the 
delaware law had copies of the fdics proposals when the law was 
written 
ellis reviewed the state law monday with fdic officials 
we discussed the safeguards that were in the delaware 
legislation and the fact that those were put in the legislation 
with the proposed rules of the fdic before us ellis said 
ellis would not discuss the details of the meeting but said all 
parties expressed a spirit of cooperation 
we discussed what was in the bill and the types of things 
well be looking at as the bill begins to take effect ellis 
said adding he does not foresee any changes in the law no more 
meetings are scheduled 
the scope of regulatory authority in the state office and 
that of the fdic is i believe to be sufficient to address any 
concerns that we will discuss he said 
nonetheless fdic chairman william seidman plans to have his 
staff recommend that banks either be prohibited from underwriting 
insurance or the activity be limited to subsidiaries whose sources 
of capital have been separated from the bank spokeswoman caryl a 
austrian said 
the delaware law allows statechartered banks to sell and 
underwrite insurance through a subsidiary department or division 
the law allows any bank to put up to 25 percent of its capital 
into the insurance operation but the assets liabilities and 
records of the insurance subsidiary must be kept separate from the 
bank 
in a statement seidman said he was concerned about extending 
fdic protection to banks with insurance operations 
the delaware law opens up a whole host of issues about safety 
and soundness and the appropriateness of extending the federal 
safety net to banks that engage in new or nontraditional 
activities like insurance underwriting seidman said 
we started to consider these issues a few years ago 
specifically in regard to real estate development and insurance 
underwriting activities i think it is time given recent 
developments to revisit these issues seidman said 
citibank the nations largest bank and chase manhattan corp 
the nations secondlargest both have plans to open insurance 
operations in delaware 
citibank has received approval from ellis office but still 
must receive approval from the state insurance commissioner 
ellis said preliminary talks have begun with chase which must 
become a statechartered bank before it can engage in the insurance 
business 
meanwhile the federal reserve board has yet to act on a request 
from five insurance trade organizations to block citibank from 
selling insurance from its delaware offices

moodys investor services inc is reviewing its 
credit ratings for chrysler corp indicating concern about the 
companys finances an official said today 
fitch investors service inc another new york rating agency 
said chrysler was not under review telephone calls to standard amp 
poors corp officials were not immediately returned this morning 
news of moodys review comes as the nations no 3 automaker 
struggles with declining sales and market share and the loss of key 
executives 
there has been deterioration of their performance in the 
marketplace and competition is making inroads said harold h 
goldberg chairman of moodys corporate rating committee 
he said new minivans and sportutility vehicles other automakers 
are beginning to sell are pointed directly at chryslers popular 
dodge and plymouth minivans and jeeps much of chryslers profit 
stems from sales of those vehicles 
chrysler said wednesday it had sold 752935 north americanmade 
cars and trucks through june 10 down 13 percent from the same 
period last year the companys share of the us car market is 
114 percent down from 131 percent a year ago and its portion of 
the truck market dropped to 218 percent this year from 232 
percent last 
goldberg said he expected moodys would decide whether to change 
chryslers baa2 rating by the end of the month the baa2 rating 
reflects a medium level of investmentgrade securities 
chrysler issued a statement calling moodys review 
inappropriate and unwarranted 
chrysler believes that its firstquarter profitability was 
impressive given the massive reduction in dealer inventories and 
points out that the companys 15billion ongoing costcutting 
program contributed substantially to those results the companys 
statement said 
chrysler said it earned 71 million in the first quarter of this 
year down 80 percent from yearago profits in january the 
automakers earnings were dented severely by a big incentive 
program featuring 1000 rebates on dodge caravan and plymouth 
voyager minivans 
big incentive programs and temporary production cuts during 
january by chrysler no 1 general motors corp and no 2 ford 
motor co slashed a huge buildup of unsold new vehicles 
meantime a report in wednesdays wall street journal said 
chrysler is considering buying dollar car rental one of the few 
remaining rental car companies not owned in large share by an 
automaker 
officials from dollar and chrysler which already owns thrifty 
rentacar system inc and snappy rental inc declined to confirm 
or deny the report 
goldberg said such an acquisition could be good for chrysler 
since rental car companies provide stable markets for automakers 
any further participation in the rental business would be at a 
modest cost and we would view it relatively positively goldberg 
said 
goldberg also said moodys was concerned about the recent drain 
on top executives at chrysler 
during the past six weeks gerald greenwald quit as vice 
chairman to head a 454billion union bid to buy united airlines 
and michael hammes left as vice president for international 
operations to run black amp decker corps huge toolmaking 
operations chrysler motors chairman bennett bidwell said he will 
retire at the end of the year and treasurer frederick zuckerman has 
said he will leave this summer 
its a disappointment to see all of the defections mainly 
because they have this challenge on their plate to restore the 
degree of profitability and market share they had before 
goldberg said

wholesale prices rose a moderate 03 percent 
in may as a fourth consecutive drop in energy prices helped offset 
a rise in food costs the government said today 
energy costs fell 1 percent last month while food costs 
increased 06 percent according to the labor departments producer 
price index for finished goods one stop short of retail 
todays report was roughly in line with economists projections 
it was the fourth straight moderate report since a severe cold 
snap sent prices spiraling 19 percent in january a 15year record 
for the first five months of the year inflation at the 
wholesale level was running at a 40 percent annual rate down from 
48 percent for all of 1989 the government said 
private analysts viewed the report as good news on the inflation 
front especially after the huge price increases caused by the last 
winters freeze 
were back on trend after the wiggles of december and 
january said donald ratajczak director of economic forecasting 
at georgia state university 
the inflationary fears that picked up in the winter months 
clearly did not have a good foundation ratajczak said 
todays moderate inflation data might strengthen arguments that 
the federal reserve no longer needs to keep such a tight grip on 
interest rates to hold down inflation analysts said 
what were seeing is a reversal in an earlier inflationary 
trend which may indicate that the time has come for the fed to 
ease up on credit by reducing interest rates said ron schreibman 
of the national association of wholesalerdistributors 
he noted that over the past 12 months wholesale prices have 
risen a modest 31 percent 
this report shows that we are neither veering into recession 
or are we in a situation where inflation is accelerating rapidly 
schreibman said 
the labor department revised the data for the first two months 
of 1990 saying wholesale prices soared 19 percent in january 
rather than 18 percent february prices fell 01 percent rather 
than holding steady wholesale prices also fell slightly in march 
and april 
in may energy prices dropped 1 percent after having fallen by 
even larger amounts the previous three months gasoline prices were 
down 21 percent and fuel oil fell 62 percent natural gas 
increased 09 percent 
food overall was up 06 percent after having declined by that 
amount the previous two months 
the price of fruits dropped 84 percent vegetables fell 39 
percent and eggs were down 218 percent 
but that wasnt enough to offset increases in the costs of other 
foods such as the 77 percent hike in the cost of pasta 49 
percent increase in pork and 88 percent rise in the cost of fish 
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors prices rose a 
mild 02 percent the identical increase of a month before 
economists often consider this core number a better indicator 
of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy 
automobile prices rose 03 percent in may after falling the 
previous two months 
womens and childrens clothing costs were up while mens fell 
slightly 
the price of tobacco was up 3 percent while the cost of 
household flatware appliances and home electronic equipment fell 
the various changes put the index for all finished goods at 
1177 in may that means a hypothetical selection of goods that 
cost 100 in 1982 cost 11770 last month up from 11420 a year 
earlier 
price pressures in earlier stages of the production process were 
down in may intermediate goods and crude goods both fell 01 
percent an example of the three processing stages would be bread 
for finished goods flour for intermediate and wheat for crude 
consumer prices up at an annual rate of 68 percent for the 
first four months of 1990 have been rising at a steeper pace than 
wholesale costs may consumer numbers are due out friday 
producer prices reflect only the cost of goods while consumer 
prices are heavily influenced by the cost of services

the supreme court ruled today the government 
may impose severe fines against air polluters even when federal 
officials are slow to decide on proposals for cleaning up the 
atmosphere 
by a 90 vote the justices upheld the enviromental protection 
agencys power to seek fines of up to 25000 a day against a 
general motors plant in massachusetts 
the impact of the ruling for future cases may be limited the 
house and senate have passed separate bills revising the federal 
clean air act that establish new timetables to address the kind of 
problem at issue in the general motors case 
congress is expected to complete action on the legislation this 
year 
todays case involves pollution from car paint at a gm assembly 
plant in framingham mass and focuses on the joint federalstate 
system for cracking down on dirty air 
gm shut down the framingham plant last year in a costcutting 
move 
under the federal clean air act the epa sets national air 
quality standards the states are required to adopt plans to meet 
those standards and submit them to the federal agency 
the epa in 1980 approved a massachusetts plan for reducing 
pollution from paint at auto assembly factories 
the plan required car makers to comply fully with the federal 
rules by dec 31 1985 
but epa officials extended the deadline for any plant switching 
from lacquer paints to enamel which emits less pollutants 
gm initially planned to stay with lacquer at the framingham 
factory but in june 1985 announced it would convert to enamel by 
the summer of 1987 the company asked that it be exempt from the 
dec 31 1985 standards for 20 months 
massachusetts officials approved gms proposal and submitted a 
revised plan to the epa on dec 30 1985 
without waiting for federal approval gm began building a 200 
million plant in framingham to use the enamel system while 
continuing to operate its factory that uses lacquer paint 
epa officials went to federal court in august 1987 seeking fines 
of up to 25000 a day against gm for 20 months of airquality 
violations at the old framingham plant 
it was not until september 1988 that the epa rejected the 
stateapproved pollution control system at the new plant 
a federal judge barred the epa from imposing fines against gm 
for violations of the dec 31 1985 standards the judge said the 
federal agency itself violated the clean air act by taking more 
than four months to rule on the stateapproved plan submitted dec 
30 1985 
but the 1st us circuit court of appeals in 1988 said the epas 
failure to meet the fourmonth deadline does not disqualify it from 
fining companies that violate previously approved pollution control 
rules 
the appeals court ordered further lower court hearings to decide 
the size of the fines 
the supreme court today upheld the appeals court ruling 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said 
references to the fourmonth deadline in the law do not create a 
general requirement that the epa process all proposed revisions 
in cleanair plans within four months 
passing mention of the fourmonth period cannot be 
inflated into a requirement that the epa process each and every 
proposed revision within four months he said 
the us chamber of commerce siding with gm said a ruling 
favoring the government is an incentive to the epa to delay and 
treat businesses unfairly 
the case is general motors vs us 89369

hubert rulitschka knows 
exactly what hes going to do when he swaps his east german money 
for west german marks next month 
its going right into the bank i cant afford to go crazy 
with money after all i might lose my job after july 2 said 
rulitschka who sells baked goods on this border towns tiny market 
square 
east germany is less than three weeks from its official plunge 
into capitalist waters and theres much concern about how high and 
dangerous the resulting waves will be 
west germanys powerful mark will become east germanys legal 
tender and the two nations will merge as a single economic entity 
east germans will be able to exchange up to 4000 east marks at 
a 1to1 rate and the remainder at 2to1 under the economic merger 
agreement exchanging the first 4000 marks will give an east 
german the equivalent of nearly 2400 
economic merger will be a huge step toward german unification 
and dislocations are inevitable 
as many as 2 million people could lose their jobs as inefficient 
factories and businesses disappear but no one is certain how high 
unemployment will really climb 
there also is worry that handing marks to east germans could 
cause a nationwide buying spree and a rise in inflation on both 
sides of the border 
residents of this town of 16000 appear to have faith in western 
promises of eventual affluence 
their optimism is not surprising the east german economy is 
near collapse as the result of four decades of communist 
mismanagement 
but east germans also are worried that the possible aftershocks 
especially the loss of jobs could be severe 
heiligenstadts giant solidor factory which makes zippers 
buckles and other small items will likely emerge relatively 
unscathed from the merger because it already has a good position in 
the international market 
but even at solidor workers worry about job security 
this job is boring but i dont fancy the idea that i might 
lose it i have not been told whether ill have it after the 
ecomomic merger said a young woman working on an assembly line 
hartmut scherf solidors general director said up to 160 
people among the 2400strong work force may have to be let go 
immediately 
hope and trepidation are reflected in east germans plans for 
their newly acquired marks 
there are people like rulitschka who figure its best to build 
up a security net in case the transformation to capitalism gets 
rocky 
but there are others anxious to use their hard currency to 
improve their lifestyles 
rudolf kessel a heiligenstadt gynecologist has big plans for 
the marks he and his wife will receive his wife is also a 
physician and she wants to start a private practice at home 
well buy new equipment to be used at home it all comes from 
west germany and costs a lot of money said kessel 
a colleague of kessels said she is eager to get marks but also 
worried because her rent will go up as east german subsidies are 
scrapped 
im paying 100 marks about 30 right now she said i 
figure that will triple 
in muehlhausen an industrial city about 12 miles away a young 
woman said shes going to buy a secondhand mercedes 
weve been dreaming about the wests wealth for a long time 
said the woman im not going to miss this chance to get exactly 
what i want 
even though the official starting date for economic union is 
july 2 it has in fact already begun 
a man from the west german city of kassel has set up a usedcar 
lot in east germany just across the border east germans driving 
in and out of their homeland can get a good look at his cars 
the prices average 5000 marks or 2958 just about the right 
price for an east german who has just been handed a wad of marks 
for weeks west german traveling salesmen have been roaming east 
german roads making deals and scouting out places where they can 
set up their own outlets after the merger 
west german tourist agencies have set up offices in east german 
communities offering travel deals to exotic places like majorca 
and paris sites many east germans have only read about or seen on 
television 
much of the produce now sold on east german squares was grown in 
west germany 
workers from factory employees to chimney sweeps are 
undergoing retraining by west germans to help prepare them for new 
kinds of work in a quickly changing nation 
bernd beck the heiligenstadt mayor says he is worried because 
his city hall employees arent trained for the westernstyle 
bureaucracy that will quickly develop in communities across east 
germany retraining of city employees has already begun he said 
but hes convinced the fruits of economic union will far 
outweigh the discomforts 
people are for the most part optimistic because they know 
theyll have real money and that they can buy good products with 
it said beck 
daily life has already become better for us he said 
were able to buy video recorders and good television sets at 
lower prices then before 
we can only be winners

the philips nv electronics 
multinational on thursday warned that the replacement of its 
president and a major company overhaul would not prevent this 
years profit from falling far behind normal 
the unusual warning to investors that 1990 earnings would be 
very low marked a major move toward openness by the electronics 
giant 
philips faces a lawsuit by us stockholders who claim they were 
misled by the company which allegedly issued overly optimistic 
predictions over the first quarter of this year 
on may 14 philips chairman cor van der klugt resigned after 
accusations that he failed to disclose until the very last minute 
that philips would barely be breaking even over that period 
philips net profit from normal operations were a mere 6 million 
guilders the equivalent of about 32 million in that quarter 
down from 223 million guilders or 117 million in the first 
quarter of last year 
in a brief statement released thursday philips warned this 
years secondquarter profit will be appreciably lower than 
last years secondquarter figure of 197 million guilders or 104 
million 
net result for normal business operations for 1990 as a whole 
will be at a very low level said the statement blaming the 
setback on a major restructuring program 
philips income for all of 1989 totaled 792 million guilders 
417 million 
details on the overhaul will be disclosed on july 2 a day after 
van der klugts successor jan timmer takes over philips spokesman 
ben geerts said 
dutch newspapers have speculated that timmer who is credited 
with salvaging philips consumer electronics division through 
widespread staff reductions may sell off its computer division 
which has been blamed for the disappointing firstquarter results 
industry analysts attribute philips woes to poor managment and 
tougher competition from asian electronics companies

treasury secretary nicholas f brady told 
congress today that the administrations savings and loan bailout 
could exhaust its borrowing authority as soon as the 
octoberdecember quarter 
the resolution trust corp the 10monthold agency responsible 
for cleaning up the sampl mess could with an aggressive schedule 
of case resolutions run out of funds by the end of this calendar 
year or early next year brady told the house banking committee 
his latest testimony followed by three weeks a dramatic increase 
in the administrations estimate of the cost of the sampl problem 
brady had roughly doubled the estimate to between 89 billion and 
132 billion after earlier insisting that 50 billion provided by 
congress last year could cover most sampl losses 
any estimate of how much more money is needed from taxpayers is 
highly uncertain brady said but a representative range 
for fiscal year 1991 beginning oct 1 would be about 30 billion 
to slightly over 50 billion 
he did not specify how the administration believed the money 
should be raised saying only that the matter should be considered 
in budget negotiations between the white house and congressional 
leaders 
he strongly suggested that congress should provide an openended 
authorization for more rescue spending rather than a specific 
amount that may prove inadequate 
providing a specific amount means having to face the prospect 
of returning at relatively short intervals as markets change and 
with them the estimates he said 
brady said the bailout program could continue beyond the end of 
this year without new funds by slowing down the pace of its sampl 
rescue program and gambling that real estate markets and interest 
rates will improve but he rejected that 
we believe that there is too much speculation already our job 
is to be steady do the work and take no further gambles with the 
taxpayers money he said 
bradys assessment of when the money will run out is supported 
by the congressional budget office which told the committees 
chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas that the rtc will 
exhaust its 50 billion early in fiscal year 1991 
rtc chairman l william seidman in remarks to reporters 
wednesday indicated his agency has at least enough borrowing 
authority left to handle another 95 to 120 failures the rtc so far 
has seized 443 failed sampls resolving 148 by paying off 
depositors or by selling the institutions to new investors 
it plans an additional 45 resolutions by the end of june and 
seidman said it expects to handle 50 to 75 in the julyseptember 
quarter 
but the agency still is having difficulty keeping up with the 
failure rate thrift regulators have indicated at least another 299 
institutions still operating independently appear headed for 
failure 
despite the dramatic increase in the administrations new sampl 
cost estimate the congressional budget office is attacking it as 
too conservative 
brady had based his new cost estimate on assumptions that 925 
sampls would topple however cbo director robert d reischauer said 
that does not include an additional 792 institutions that are 
technically solvent but would fail if forced to list their assets 
at market value 
reischauer said his office expects many marginal institutions to 
fail leaving only about 1200 healthy sampls even if few marginal 
thrifts fail bradys cost estimate should be 150 billion 
reischauer said in a letter to gonzalez the administration is not 
factoring in the cost of likely delays in closing so many sampls he 
said 
in a separate development the rtc intensified its effort to 
sell repossessed sampl real estate offering to provide potential 
buyers with personalized computer lists of properties that may 
interest them 
effective today 35908 properties valued originally at 149 
billion will be open to offers more than half the properties 
19067 with a value of 102 billion are in texas the rest are 
scattered through 45 other states the district of columbia and 
puerto rico 
mostly the agency is offering residential parcels 29977 
properties but it is also listing 232 pieces of land and 5699 
commercial properties 
we have everything available from a 15000 pool hall in 
houston to uranium mines said lamar c kelly jr rtc director 
of asset and real estate management 
the new inventory is current through next march 31 in january 
the rtc released its first list of 30123 properties current

the former owner of the collapsed vernon savings amp 
loan today said he is innocent of charges that he spent thousands 
of dollars in thrift money on pleasure trips prostitutes and 
illegal contributions to politicians 
donald r dixon 50 was charged wednesday with conspiracy 
misapplication of funds making false statements and other offenses 
perhaps when my day in court comes if theyll listen theyll 
find out what really happened and the blame can be properly 
assessed and properly assigned dixon said 
dixon appeared before us magistrate john b tolle this morning 
and was freed on a personal recognizance bond 
he did not enter a plea at his court appearance but told 
reporters afterward that he intended to plead innocent 
for the moment the us government is making a scapegoat of 
me because theyre unaccountable for their role in the 500 billion 
or greater loss the american taxpayer has to pay he said 
his attorney william ravkind refused to let dixon answer a 
question about his personal finances 
the indictment alleges the political contributions were made 
for the purpose of currying favor and influence in anticipation 
of regulatory action by the texas savings and loan department and 
the federal home loan bank board 
prosecutors said the politicians didnt know the contributions 
were illegal and none was charged nor were any thrift regulators 
if convicted on all charges dixon faces 190 years in prison and 
a 95 million fine 
government attorneys said the thrift is a prime example of abuse 
in the sampl industry under dixon who moved the thrift to dallas 
from the town of vernon assets of the thrift grew tenfold until 
federal regulators shut it down 
five other vernon officials have pleaded guilty to crimes in the 
13 billion collapse of the sampl former president patrick g king 
and former chairman woody f lemons have been sentenced to prison 
for their part in the 1987 collapse 
these complicated whitecollar crime cases take time to 
develop but the justice department is committed to the 
investigation prosecution and incarceration of those who ripped 
off our financial institutions and have left the taxpayers of the 
united states holding the bag us attorney dick thornburgh said 
in a statement 
dixon was accused of encouraging employees to make about 7000 
in political contributions and then reimbursing them with expense 
money or phony bonuses to skirt restrictions on corporate campaign 
contributions 
among other things dixon was charged with conspiring with other 
vernon officials to give money to texas democrat jim wright the 
former house speaker who was pressing federal regulators to stop 
trying to close insolvent texas thrifts 
the indictment alleged dixon also billed vernon 10500 for 
prostitutes for himself and others at a 1985 vernon board of 
directors party at dixons solana beach calif beach house and 
on a yacht cruise in san diego harbor 
in 1985 dixon allegedly used vernon money for hunting trips 
with senior vernon officials to kansas and san diego l linton 
bowman iii then commissioner of the texas savings and loan 
department went along the indictment said 
lodging meals female companionship and other expenses cost 
4866 the indictment said 
dixon also was accused of using his airplane for an illegal 
activity transporting prostitutes from texas to california 
former vernon vice president patrick malone testified at kings 
1989 trial that contributions were solicited from king and other 
top thrift executives the money was for the 1986 gubernatorial 
primary campaign of former rep tom loeffler rtexas and the 
reelection bids of wright who resigned after a house ethics 
investigation unrelated to the vernon case former rep jack kemp 
rny now secretary of housing and urban development sen jake 
garn rutah and sen alan cranston dcalif 
dixon threw parties for other sampl operators aboard his yacht on 
the potomac river in washington to raise money for the democratic 
congressional campaign committee chaired by thenrep tony coelho 
dcalif the indictment said 
at coelhos request wright intervened with federal regulators 
to discuss vernon according to a report to the house ethics 
committee by richard j phelan an outside counsel hired to 
investigate wright 
phelan reported that wright telephoned edwin gray chairman of 
the federal home loan bank board and asked if vernon were going to 
be shut down 
wright told the ethics panel he did not know dixon but phelans 
investigation produced a picture of wright and dixon aboard the 
yacht the photograph bore the inscription my best personal 
regards jim wright 
wrights administrative assistant in fort worth did not 
immediately return phone calls seeking comment today 
dixon was the lead defendant in a 540 million federal fraud 
lawsuit brought after the vernon shutdown but had not faced 
criminal charges until wednesday 
the lawsuit alleged that dixon and other thrift officers grossly 
overstated vernons profits and net worth in order to pay 221 
million in illegal dividends to dondi financial corp a holding 
company headed by dixon 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp lawsuit said top 
officials began to loot vernon for their personal financial 
benefit and defraud its depositors creditors and the fslic

business inventories inched upward 01 percent 
in april while sales fell 11 percent the government said thursday 
in the second report this week showing increasing consumer caution 
it is disconcerting that the consumer sector is so weak 
said evelina tainer senior domestic economist with the first 
national bank of chicago the consumer sector is supposed to be 
the underpinning of economic growth and the weakness does not bode 
well for growth in the second quarter 
the commerce department said business sales totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 53304 billion down from 53599 billion in march when 
they rose 06 percent sales on the retail level were down 09 
percent in april 
in a report wednesday the department said retail sales in may 
fell 07 percent it was the first time they had declined for three 
consecutive months since the fall of 1981 during the last 
recession 
analysts have attributed consumer caution to a sluggish job 
market and weak wage gains 
retail sales represent about half of consumer spending which 
has been a driving force for the economy during much of the last 
eight years overall consumer spending accounts for about 
twothirds of the nations economic activity 
however ms tainer said inventories are keeping in line with 
sales and their slight increase in april does not lead to any 
recessionary outlook 
if inventories were to rise excessively it could mean cutbacks 
in production and a loss of jobs 
commerce said business inventories in april totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 79446 billion up from 79367 billion in march when 
they were unchanged from the previous month 
the april business activity produced a 149 ratio of inventories 
to sales up slightly from a 147 ratio a month earlier but down 
from the 153 ratio last november 
the ratio means it would take 149 months to exhaust inventories 
at the april pace it peaked at 170 in october 1982 during the 
last recession 
in addition to the drop in retail sales manufacturing sales 
were down 12 percent and wholesale sales were off 11 percent 
retailers had the biggest increase in inventories up 03 
percent followed by a 01 percent gain in the manufacturing 
sector wholesalers inventories on the other hand dropped 02 
percent

debtridden southland corp owner of some 6900 
7eleven convenience stores thursday announced a sweetened 
restructuring proposal for its bondholders and said it would miss 
an interest payment due friday on its public debt 
the revised restructuring a key condition of the troubled 
companys agreement to sell a controlling interest to its 
japanbased partners also would reduce the stake held by 
southlands founding thompson family 
southland has been struggling to continue making payments on the 
billions of dollars in debt it incurred in 1987 when the thompson 
family took the company private in 49 billion leveraged buyout 
in march it agreed to sell a controlling interest to its 
japanese partners itoyokado co ltd and 7eleven japan co ltd 
for 400 million and the assumption of debt 
under the revised proposal bondholders would receive debt 
securities with an aggregate principal amount of about 550 
million bearing cash interest at rates of 12 percent to 14 percent 
and maturing in six to seven years the original restructuring 
proposal offered bondholders 350 million for their debt 
preferred stockholders would get shares of a new issue of 
preferred stock or common stock of the same value bondholders and 
preferred shareholders also would end up with a total of 185 
percent of southlands common stock 
the thompson family would see its stake in southland reduced to 
65 percent 
we estimate that the terms of the revised exchange offers 
represent an increase in current value of approximately 200 
million over the original offers said clark matthews 
southlands chief financial officer our goal in significantly 
improving the proposal is to put southland on solid financial 
footing as quickly as possible 
the company said it would not make certain interest payments due 
friday on its public debt but would meet continuing obligations to 
its trade creditors 
7eleven japan the largest convenience store operator in japan 
operates 3940 licensed stores itoyokado which southland 
described as japans most profitable supermarket chain owns 503 
percent of 7eleven japan southland has had a 17year affiliation 
with the japanese concerns 
heightened competition in the convenience store business plus 
disappointing sales and earnings growth have made it tough for 
southland to keep making payments on its huge debt much of which 
is in highinterest junk bonds 
matthews said the debt and stock restructuring was necessary to 
give southland the leeway to make capital expenditures necessary to 
remain competitive 
southland reported a firstquarter loss of 694 million

by way of introduction 75yearold thomas f 
fallon sr lifts his knit yellowshirt to display a scar that cuts 
an arc from near the spine around the rib cage to the center of the 
chest 
the mark of surgery in 1981 along with smaller scars from tubes 
inserted into his body for a month are among the more visible 
reminders of the penalty for nearly 50 years of working with 
cancercausing asbestos 
fallons wife josephine says he used to be a big irishman 
now he struggles to lift himself from a chair breathes heavily and 
tires easily whether on the short walk to the corner store to buy 
the daily news or while painting the kitchen doorframe 
asbestos encased the boilers that fallon built and repaired 
throughout his career it tumbled in chunks from ceiling pipes at 
the brooklyn navy yard in the 1950s workers often cut blankets 
from rolls of asbestos to protect themselves from heat 
we used to lay on it we used to handle it with our bare 
hands fallon says pulling out pictures of ship engine boiler 
rooms technical diagrams faded medical bills and legal 
correspondence 
we never thought it was poison in those days he says 
people were dying they never knew they had it 
fallon has mesothelioma a tumor in the lining of lungs caused 
by inhalation of asbestos particles doctors cut out part of one 
lung lining and subjected him to chemotherapy though they only 
gave him three years to live hes survived 10 
fallon is among tens of thousands of victims of meso which 
along with lung cancer and other lesser ailments are remnants of 
either scientific ignorance or willful negligence by us asbestos 
manufacturers and users 
he also is one of 571 plaintiffs suing manville corps asbestos 
trust fund and other companies that supplied asbestos to the 
brooklyn shipyard where battleships such as the us missouri and 
us iowa were built during world war ii if a settlement fails a 
mass trial is set for the fall 
while lawyers haggle over the price for asbestosrelated 
injuries fallon says he simply wants fair compensation for the 
pain he feels on humid days and the travelfilled retirement he was 
denied 
fallon says he never had fair warning from 1932 when he 
learned to be a boilermaker until retiring in 1980 no one told 
him asbestos could cause diseases that now kill about 10000 people 
annually and disable thousands of others 
like many who handled asbestos in shipyards on construction 
sites in chemical plants and elsewhere fallon believes the makers 
of the insulation and building material and the government 
concealed its hazardous effects 
i hope to get a good settlement because the last 10 years have 
been wasted fallon says i cant go no place i cant do 
nothing we planned to travel we cant go too far as far as 
staten island and back 
the way i feel know i want my life back he says i feel 
lost 
fallon and his 78yearold wife live in bay ridge a 
workingclass neighborhood in the shadows of the verrazanonarrows 
bridge that links brooklyn and staten island where one of their 
two daughters lives 
theirs was a mixed marriage hes irish she italian hes from 
brooklyn shes from the bronx fallon says for a while he swept up 
a bar in the morning repaired boilers during the day and did 
freelance typing with his wife at home at night 
they grew up truly believing in the american dream says 
fallons daughter jo ellen falconello they were betrayed pure 
and simple 
fallon says he never made more than 17000 a year but loved 
his work the fallons still rent a onebedroom apartment in a 
twofamily house where they have lived 20 years for 400 a month 
family pictures adorn the end tables the arm chairs have plastic 
seat covers 
the couple lives on social security payments of 1350 a month 
and despite his illness and her hip surgery and rapid heartbeat 
medical bills havent been devastating the fallons saved about 
20000 in their halfcentury together and use the interest for 
luxuries like gifts for the grandchildren 
fallon in 1986 rejected settlement offers totaling 2500 from 
two companies jury awards in some cases have exceeded 1 million 
but fallon just wants enough to compensate for the suffering and 
maybe help his family 
i expected him to get older but not the way it happened it 
just cut him down his daughter says in a way were very 
lucky we still have my father here the quality of his life isnt 
what it should be but he isnt dead

the government may fine air polluters even 
when federal officials are slow to decide on proposals for cleaning 
up the atmosphere the supreme court ruled thursday 
the justices voted 90 to uphold a lower court ruling supporting 
the enviromental protection agencys power to seek fines of up to 
25000 a day against a nowclosed general motors corp plant in 
massachusetts 
in a separate decision thursday the court barred manufacturers 
from giving discounts to wholesalers and not to retailers when the 
discounts are unrelated to any savings for the supplier or to the 
wholesalers costs the decision came in a case involving a 135 
million antitrust award texaco inc was ordered to pay 
the future impact of the pollution ruling may be limited the 
house and senate have passed bills revising the federal clean air 
act that set new timetables to address the kind of problem at issue 
in the gm case 
congress is expected to complete action on the legislation this 
year 
the case involved pollution from car paint at a gm assembly 
plant in framingham mass 
under the clean air act the epa sets national air quality 
standards the states are required to adopt plans to meet those 
standards and submit them to the federal agency 
the epa in 1980 approved a massachusetts plan for reducing 
pollution from paint at auto assembly factories 
the plan required car makers to comply fully with the federal 
rules by dec 31 1985 but the epa extended the deadline for 
plants switching from lacquer paints to enamel which emits less 
pollutants 
gm in june 1985 said it would convert to enamel by the summer of 
1987 and sought a 20month exemption from the dec 31 1985 
standards 
massachusetts officials approved gms proposal and submitted a 
revised plan to the epa on dec 30 1985 
without waiting for federal approval gm began building a 200 
million plant in framingham to use the enamel system while 
continuing to operate its factory that uses lacquer paint 
epa officials went to federal court in august 1987 seeking fines 
of up to 25000 a day against gm for 20 months of airquality 
violations at the old framingham plant 
in september 1988 the epa finally rejected the stateapproved 
pollution control system at the new plant 
a federal judge barred the epa from imposing fines against gm 
for violations of the dec 31 1985 standards the judge said the 
epa violated the clean air act by taking more than four months to 
rule on the stateapproved plan submitted dec 30 1985 
but the 1st us circuit court of appeals in 1988 said the epas 
failure to meet the fourmonth deadline did not disqualify it from 
fining companies that violate previously approved pollution control 
rules 
the appeals court ordered further lower court hearings to decide 
the size of the fines 
the supreme court upheld the appeals court ruling 
gm closed the framingham plant last year in a costcutting move 
in the texaco case the court unanimously upheld a 135 million 
antitrust award texaco inc was ordered to pay to 12 service 
stations in the spokane wash area 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said there was 
no evidence that texacos discounts constituted a reasonable 
reimbursement for the value to texaco of the wholesalers 
marketing functions 
business groups that supported texacos appeal had said a defeat 
for the company could undermine the most common distributional 
arrangement in american business the dual channel system in which 
a manufacturer or supplier sells to wholesalers at discounted 
prices lower than those it charges direct purchasing retailers 
but the court said texacos discounts amounted to illegal price 
discrimination barred by a federal antitrust law the 
robinsonpatman act 
a federal jury ordered texaco to pay 449900 a sum that was 
tripled by the judge to 135 million under the act 
the 12 service station dealers that sued said from 1972 to 1981 
they were placed at an unfair competitive disadvantage because 
texaco supplied gasoline to two spokanearea wholesalers john 
dompier oil co and gull oil co at discounts ranging from 25 
cents to 575 cents per gallon less than texaco charged the 
retailers 
dompier sold the gasoline to other retailers under the texaco 
trademark while gull marketed it under private brand names 
the 12 service stations said they suffered because at least part 
of the discounts were passed on to consumers by competing retailers 
who bought from the dompier and gull 
texaco argued that the discounts were legitimate because they 
were available to all wholesalers who purchased from the oil comany 
giant 
stevens noted there was evidence the services offered by the 
dompier and gull were insubstantial and did not justify the 
discount

the prospect of automated offhours trading at 
the new york stock exchange has some wall streeters echoing the 
sentiments of bluecollar workers displaced by machinery on the 
assembly line 
stock brokers and tradingfloor specialists said thursday they 
were confident their clients would be better served by trading 
shares through the traditional nyse methods they were skeptical 
that the plan would work using computers rather than people on the 
trading floor to execute trades 
some also wondered whether there is enough business in the 
middle of the night to warrant additional hours for the nyse 
if the restaurant is open all night does that make you any 
hungrier one broker asked 
on the floor of the exchange and during cigarette breaks on a 
wall street sidewalk some exchange workers said they were 
confident customers get better service through socalled 
specialists who bring buyer and seller together 
seeking to emphasize advantages of the current system the 
traders said specialists occassionally reach compromises between 
buyers and sellers that bring the seller a higher price than 
originally sought 
show me a machine that can do that said one broker and 
former specialist who spoke on condition of anonymity 
im doubtful it would work but its a foot in the door for 
computerized trading said a specialist who also asked that his 
name not be used i have the feeling its a trojan horse he 
said adding that an automated system likely would be introduced 
during daytime hours if it is accepted at night 
the plan to expand trading hours was first reported in the new 
york times and later confirmed through sources a nyse spokesman 
would not confirm the report but said the exchange has been 
talking about moving to offhours trading for two years 
sources who were familiar with the plan said the offhours 
trading would eventually lead to three trading sessions through the 
night each stock would be traded once at each session with all 
trades handled at a single price 
the big board hopes afterhours trading would bring back 
business lost to the tokyo and london exchanges

debtridden southland corp owner of 7000 
7eleven convenience stores on thursday sweetened a deal to pay 
off its bondholders in a proposal that slashes the amount of 
control the founding thompson family will have 
the company also said thursday it would not pay 69 million in 
interest due on two bond issues friday a move that an analyst said 
opens up the possibility of an involuntary bankruptcy petition 
being filed against southland 
the bondholder proposal which southland called the second phase 
in its attempt to climb out from under 18 billion in debt cuts 
the amount of control that the thompson family and other existing 
shareholders will have from 15 percent of the shares in an earlier 
proposal to 65 percent 
the company is offering bondholders 550 million to exchange 
176 billion in outstanding securities in addition bondholders 
and preferred shareholders would share 185 percent of the 
companys common stock 
the new offer for the bonds is about 200 million higher than an 
earlier plan 
the first phase of the restructuring announced in march called 
for southlands japanese partners itoyokado co ltd and 
seveneleven japan co ltd to pay 400 million cash for 75 
percent of the company but the japanese investors agreed to hold 
off consummating that deal until august 15 pending the new 
restructuring scheme 
assuming an agreement can be reached over the next couple of 
days the hope is that a specific proposal would be filed with the 
sec securities and exchange commission by about the middle of 
next week said john gordon president of deltec securities corp 
of new york and head of a bondholders committee that worked out the 
agreement with southland management and others 
gordon said he was enthusiastic about the negotiations and 
said it provided an opportunity for southland to really get back 
on its feet 
suffering disappointing sales and earnings growth southland has 
been strained by debt associated with its 49 billion leveraged 
buyout in 1987 which gave dallas thompson family control of the 
chain 
the company lost 694 million in the first quarter of this 
year and sold its citgo subsidiary in january to raise 6615 
million in cash 
i thought that their initial offer was totally unacceptable 
and in fact i would be hardpressed to think of an offer that could 
have been more unacceptable than the one they made gordon said 
but he said he was impressed with the negotiations this week 
that led to thursdays offer 
at least one other bondholder was not as enthusiastic 
its incredible the size of the pill that theyre asking 
bondholders to swallow said jay h lustig head of the high 
yield department for drake capital securities inc of santa monica 
calif 
theyre asking bondholders to forgive 12 billion in debt in 
exchange for 18 percent of the company they have absolutely zero 
shot of getting 100 percent acceptance he said 
the missed interest payment friday also raises the possibility 
that southland could be forced into involuntary bankruptcy if a 
payment or agreement is not worked out in 30 days lustig said but 
gordon said he was optimistic all parties would work out an 
agreement that would sidestep such a move

gold prices fell sharply thursday while the 
dollar finished mostly higher in domestic dealings after putting in 
a mixed performance overseas 
gold bullion lost about 5 a troy ounce following heavy selling 
overseas unidentified middle east investors were believed 
responsible sending gold to a fouryear low of 341 a troy ounce 
before the metal recovered about half its losses in foreign trading 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery settled at 34680 a troy ounce down 520 from late 
wednesday republic national bank in new york quoted a late bid for 
gold at 34585 an ounce off 515 an ounce 
all the action took place overnight said steven pepper a 
vice president at republic gold held to a very narrow range in 
domestic trading he said but the market remained confused and 
demoralized by the metals recent volatility 
traders had thought gold could hold at the 350anounce 
level pepper said 
earlier in london gold fell to a late bid price of 34525 an 
troy ounce from 35015 late wednesday in zurich the metal fell 
to a closing bid of 34550 from 35050 and in hong kong gold 
dropped 436 an ounce to close at 35080 
currency trading was moderate in europe but interest in the 
dollar was rekindled when activity shifted to the united states 
traders attributed the dollars advance to optimism ahead of 
fridays release of merchandise trade figures for april 
market players are expecting a very good number said bob 
morrissey senior trader at the bank of bostons new york office 
the market consensus is that the commerce department will report a 
trade deficit of about 72 billion which would represent a 
significant decline from marchs widerthanexpected 845 billion 
deficit 
but morrissey said rumors began circulating in the market that 
the figure could be as good as 5 billion in that case he 
predicted the dollar would break out of its current trading range 
a lower dollar helps the deficit by making us goods more 
competitive on foreign markets thereby increasing exports a low 
deficit would indicate that us goods are competitive and there 
is room for the dollar to go higher morrissey said 
also to be released on friday are reports on the consumer price 
index and industrial production and capacity both for may 
dealers said thursdays goverment report showing us wholesale 
prices rose a moderate 03 percent in may did not provide any 
surprises

a fourth consecutive monthly drop in energy 
prices helped offset higher food costs in may and hold overall 
wholesale prices to a moderate 03 percent increase the government 
said thursday 
analysts viewed the soft increase in the labor departments 
producer price index for finished goods as encouraging news on the 
inflation front especially given last winters huge price gains 
caused by a severe cold snap that freeze sent wholesale prices 
spiraling 19 percent in january to a 15year record 
were back on trend after the wiggles of december and 
january said donald ratajczak director of economic forecasting 
at georgia state university in atlanta 
the inflationary fears that picked up in the winter months 
clearly did not have a good foundation ratajczak said 
the report should help dampen inflation worries for the federal 
reserve which has been under pressure to ease its 
inflationfighting campaign and lower interest rates to boost the 
economy analysts said still most analysts expected no immediate 
shift in the central banks policy 
the question is how long does the fed feel it can keep the 
economy subdued they may say lets keep our nose to the 
grindstone on inflation and really see a payoff said robert 
dederick chief economist at the northern trust co of chicago 
on wall street investors took the inflation report as a 
disappointing sign that the fed would not move anytime soon to 
relax interest rates by midday the dow jones average of 30 
industrials had dropped 1262 though by days end it was down just 
148 to 292822 
many economists were awaiting the governments data on consumer 
prices for may due out friday for a better picture of the 
nations inflation situation 
consumer prices up at an annual rate of 68 percent for the 
first four months of 1990 have been rising at a steeper pace than 
wholesale costs producer prices reflect only the cost of goods 
while consumer prices are heavily influenced by the cost of 
services 
for the first five months of the year overall inflation at the 
wholesale level was running at a 40 percent annual rate down from 
48 percent for all of 1989 the government said 
over the past 12 months wholesale prices have risen a modest 
31 percent 
this report shows that we are neither veering into recession 
or are we in a situation where inflation is accelerating rapidly 
said ron schreibman of the national association of 
wholesalerdistributors 
in may energy prices dropped 1 percent after having fallen by 
even larger amounts the previous three months gasoline prices were 
down 21 percent and fuel oil fell 62 percent natural gas 
increased 09 percent 
food costs overall were up 06 percent after having declined by 
that amount the previous two months 
the price of fruit dropped 84 percent vegetables fell 39 
percent and eggs were down 218 percent 
but that wasnt enough to offset increases in the price of other 
foods such as the 77 percent hike in the cost of pasta 49 
percent increase in pork and 88 percent rise in the cost of fish 
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors prices rose a 
mild 02 percent the identical increase of a month before 
economists often consider this core number a better indicator 
of underlying inflationary pressures on the economy 
automobile prices rose 03 percent in may after falling the 
previous two months 
womens and childrens clothing costs were up while the price of 
mens clothing fell slightly 
the price of tobacco was up 3 percent while the cost of 
household flatware appliances and home electronic equipment fell 
the various changes put the index for all finished goods at 
1177 in may that means a hypothetical selection of goods that 
cost 100 in 1982 cost 11770 last month up from 11420 a year 
earlier 
price pressures in earlier stages of the production process were 
down in may intermediate goods and crude goods both fell 01 
percent an example of the three processing stages is bread as 
finished goods flour as the intermediate stage and wheat at the 
crude level 
the labor department revised the data for the first two months 
of 1990 saying wholesale prices rose 19 percent in january rather 
than the previously reported 18 percent february prices fell 01 
percent rather than holding steady wholesale prices also fell 
slightly in march and april

hour an event that happens four times a year on wall street

boeing co whose commercial airplane orders 
helped it report an 87 percent jump in its firstquarter profit 
will lose money this year on its military business the companys 
chairman said 
on the heels of a 1989 deficit of 559 million for its military 
business the outlook is dim 
i wont speculate on which of our military programs will 
ultimately be canceled or scaled back but a number of them are 
clearly vulnerable frank shrontz boeings chairman and chief 
executive officer told an investment conference tuesday 
nonetheless boeing remains committed to the defense and space 
business shrontz said the seattlebased company hopes to be able 
to continue to pull in about 5 billion in defense sales annually 
on the commercial side shrontz projected that boeings share of 
600 billion worth of world airplane sales over the next 15 years 
will keep the companys production lines busy 
boeing has a commercialorder backlog approaching 100 billion 
boeing earned 302 million or 131 a share on sales of 64

domestic advertising spending is expected to 
rise 75 percent to 140 billion in 1991 following this years 
disappointing results which will be hampered by weak local ad 
budgets a prominent forecaster said thursday 
robert j coen who heads the forecasting unit at the 
advertising agency mccannerickson reduced his earlier projections 
for this year to a 53 percent gain or a total of 1304 billion 
from the 62 percent gain he estimated in december 
in a semiannual report on ad spending coen said the economic 
indicators have not been very good since the fall of 1989 and they 
are the cause of most of the slowdown in ad spending 
he blamed sluggish retail spending and poor retailer profits for 
depressing the local advertising market this year local ad 
revenues are expected to increase just 47 percent this year to 
5754 billion instead of the 62 percent gain he forecast six 
months ago 
local advertising is concentrated heavily in newspapers and 
local television stations both of which had poor ad sales in the 
first quarter of the year 
in newspapers total ad revenue was off 13 percent in the first 
quarter a 27 percent gain in retail advertising was unable to 
offset a 64 percent decline in classified ad spending 
at local television stations ad spending by local car dealers 
slumped 21 percent in the first quarter while bank and department 
store ad expenditures fell by 14 percent and 13 percent 
respectively 
coen noted in the report however that the advertising budgets 
of many major brands have risen significantly on a national level 
this year he predicts a 63 percent gain in national ad spending 
to 7385 billion this year in line the projections he issued in 
december 
syndicated television ad revenues were up a sharp 31 percent 
during the first four months of the year while national ads on 
cable television stations were up 17 percent in the period 
the three major television networks had an average 11 percent 
gain in national ad spending through april when compared with the 
yearago period during the first quarter spending on advertising 
food products on network tv jumped 18 percent toiletries ads rose 
15 percent and drugs and personal care products were up 14 percent 
fewer ads for cigarettes and cars kept magazine advertising 
revenue up only 1 percent revenue from national ads in newspapers 
was up 54 percent in the first quarter 
for the remainder of the year coen predicted national 
marketing budgets will continue outpacing local advertising 
budgets but in a sluggish economy it will be a tough ad sales 
year for many media his report said 
if coens 75 percent growth estimate for 1991 is accurate it 
would mark the largest gain since 1988 when domestic ad spending 
was up 77 percent over the previous year 
while doubledigit gains in ad spending have been reported 
overseas as recently as 1988 domestic ad spending has not improved 
by doubledigit margins since 1984 when a 158 percent increase 
was reported still coens projection marks a roughly 38 billion 
increase in ad spending since 1986 the first year domestic ad 
spending rose above the 100 billion mark 
the outlook for advertising growth overseas this year is 
expected to rise 5 percent over 1989 levels to 1338 billion when 
taking into account a stronger dollar 
total worldwide ad expenditures are expected to reach 2642 
billion this year up 51 percent from last year though worldwide 
ad growth averaged just 5 percent last year off from three years 
of doubledigit growth coen predicted worldwide spending will 
begin to pick up steam in 1991 fueled by the expansion in free 
market economies and growing competition in consumer markets

a new round of saudi arabian selling pressed gold futures prices 
below 350 an ounce thursday for the first time in nearly four 
years and triggered a sympathetic selloff in the silver market 
where prices plunged to 12year lows 
steep losses also were posted in futures prices for many other 
commodities including soybeans hogs pork bellies coffee sugar 
and cocoa nearterm crude oil futures likewise fell but other 
energy futures as a whole were mixed 
in the second straight day of heavy selling pressure on new 
yorks commodity exchange gold futurs settled 520 to 610 lower 
with the contract for delivery in june at 34680 a troy ounce the 
lowest daily finish for a comex gold contract since july 14 1986 
silver futures ended 145 cents to 171 cents lower with june at 
477 a troy ounce the lowest close since dec 27 1977 
for the fourth time in the past three months the gold markets 
plunge was precipitated by large sales of gold bullion in london by 
saudi interests analysts said 
the 40anounce drop in gold prices that began with the first 
bout of saudi selling on march 26 has quashed investor interest in 
precious metals said william oneill of merrill lynch futures 
gold is a market that greatly deals in psychology oneill 
said the market psychology is so negative right now that it 
would take something of a very significant nature to change the 
scenario 
oneill said the possibility of further heavy bullion sales by 
the saudis or by goldproducing countries such as south africa and 
the soviet union which have also been large sellers lately make a 
drop to 325 an ounce a notunlikely prospect 
theres no reason to assume its over added analyst bette 
raptopoulos of prudentialbache securities inc 
in other commodities soybean futures fell sharply on the 
chicago board of trade mimicking the previous days action in the 
corn market amid forecasts for a month of ideal growing conditions 
in the midwest grain futures also closed lower across the board 
bearish chart signals also figured in the decline as did 
wednesdays steep drop in corn futures prices said anne frick 
senior oil seed analyst for prudentialbache securities inc 
i think beans are very cognizant of movement in corn she 
said 
wheat futures settled 1 cents to 2 cents lower with july at 
332 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with july at 
287 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 5 cents lower with july at 
141 a bushel soybeans were 13 cents to 15 cents lower with 
july at 591 a bushel 
nearterm hog and porkbelly futures plummeted their respective 
daily limits of 15 cents and 2 cents a pound on the chicago 
mercantile exchange pressured by sluggish demand for pork products 
and weak technical signals 
the selling interest spilled over into the adjacent cattle pits 
where prices finished moderately lower 
live cattle futures settled 10 cent to 50 cent lower with june 
at 7667 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 25 cent 
lower with august at 8472 cents a pound live hogs were 80 cent 
to 15 cents lower with june at 6267 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 13 cents to 2 cents lower with july at 6845 cents a 
pound 
prices also tumbled on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange on a combination of technical sell signals signs of 
greaterthanexpected supplies and selling to raise money for 
margin calls on other markets analysts said 
coffee futures plunged 335 cents to 47 cents with july 
settling at 8710 cents a pound sugar finished 50 cent to 67 
cent lower with july at 1225 cents a pound cocoa was 27 to 31

standard amp poors ratings group on thursday 
downgraded its credit ranking for ford motor co and chrysler 
corp signaling sagging faith in the auto industrys finances 
another major wall street credit rating company moodys 
investor services inc said it would decide by the end of the 
month whether it would change chryslers rating 
the ratings reflect how wall street views the credit worthiness 
of companies and their subsidiaries lower ratings generally mean 
companies must pay higher interest to borrow in the credit markets 
sampp dropped ford one notch to doubleaminus from 
doublea considered a high level of investment grade 
securities chrysler fell to sampps lowest investmentgrade level of 
triplebminus from tripleb 
sampp vice president scott sprinzen and moodys credit rating 
chairman harold goldberg stated separately that chryslers main 
profitmakers its minivans and jeeps were coming under direct 
attack by competitors 
the company chrysler will require substantial spending in 
the next several years to position themselves in a broader array of 
products and to be a more effective competitor goldberg said 
thursday 
sampp also said ford is boosting new product spending which will 
delay debt reduction in connection with its recent acquisitions of 
the associates corp consumer finance concern and jaguar plc the 
british luxury automaker the two acquisitions cost ford nearly 6 
billion 
ford reported firstquarter earnings of 5062 million down 70 
percent from a year ago 
ford spokesman tom foote said the company was disappointed with 
the sampp decision saying the companys balance sheet is strong 
and we expect our investments to lead to further strengthening of 
our financial situation 
chrysler spokesman tom houston said sampps action was unwarranted 
moreover chrysler also notes that just recently the market 
readily accepted the landmark offering of 11 billion 30year 
auburn hills trust certificates thereby expressing high confidence 
in the company over a very long term houston said 
in april chrysler announced that it would sell its 
yettobecompleted technical center in auburn hills north of 
detroit through 30year certificates and then lease it back the 
deal was expected to raise nearly 800 million 
chrysler shares fell 25 cents to 1562 ford was unchanged at 
4637 and general motors corp was down 37 cents at 4962 in 
thursday trading on the new york stock exchange 
sampp said gm also was coming under competitive pressure but the 
giant automaker was better suited than ford and chrysler to 
withstand it and a reassessment of its credit quality was not 
warranted sprinzen said 
on wednesday chrysler called moodys review announcement 
inappropriate and unwarranted 
chrysler believes that its firstquarter profitability was 
impressive given the massive reduction in dealer inventories and 
points out that the companys 15billion ongoing costcutting 
program contributed substantially to those results chrysler 
stated wednesday 
chrysler reported 71 million in profit during the first 
quarter down 80 percent from a year ago but better than what many 
analysts had expected the earnings came despite huge incentive 
costs in january when the company offered a 1000 rebate on its 
popular minivans 
the big three offered larger incentive packages and temporarily 
shut down factories in january to shrink newcar inventories the 
strategy worked and since the first of the year the companies have 
been trimming incentives 
new minivans and sportutility vehicles that other automakers 
are beginning to sell are pointed directly at chryslers popular 
minivans and jeeps 
chrysler said wednesday it had sold 752935 north americanmade 
cars and trucks through june 10 this year down 13 percent from 
last year the companys share of the us car market was 114 
percent down from 131 percent a year ago and its portion of the 
truck market dropped to 218 percent this year from 232 percent 
last year 
moodys also is concerned about the recent drain of top 
executives from chrysler goldberg said 
in the past six weeks gerald greenwald quit as vice chairman to 
head a 454billion union bid to buy united airlines and michael 
hammes left as vice president for international operations to run 
black amp decker corps huge toolmaking operations chrysler motors 
chairman bennett bidwell said he will retire by 1991 and treasurer 
frederick zuckerman has said he will leave this summer

a georgia dairy on thursday introduced a 
cholesterolfree milk product that uses vegetable fat in place of 
animal fat 
officials at mathis dairy touted the new drink as safe for the 
millions of people who cant drink milk because of medically 
restricted diets 
the drink which is not technically milk because it contains no 
milkfat is targeted at a limited market and will cost about 30 
cents more per halfgallon than regular milk dairy officials said 
it is the latest bid by the dairy industry to make its products 
more appealing to healthconscious consumers 
were excited as to what this could mean to the dairy industry 
as a whole said jack mathis dairy vice president 
the product to go on sale around atlanta monday will be 
introduced elsewhere depending on its success mathis said he 
expected other dairies some of which already have lowcholesterol 
milks on the market to develop similar products 
mathis said the new product called mathissunup is a joint 
venture with sun up farms inc a smaller atlanta dairy that 
developed the drink it has been served to 8000 people in taste 
tests over the last six months with overwhelmingly positive 
results he said 
joe dibruno of sun up farms said the technology for making a 
cholesterolfree milk has existed for years but he said his is the 
first one that avoids the watery taste common to skim milks which 
contain a tiny amount of fat and cholesterol 
though mathissunup is believed to be the first 
cholesterolfree milk to hit the market researchers in peoria 
ill reported last year they had developed a concentrated milk 
that is low in fat and free of cholesterol and also uses vegetable 
oils 
dibruno said the new product is made in a manner similar to 
standard lowfat milks whole milk which contains 35 percent 
milkfat is funneled through a clarifier which removes the fat 
but instead of the normal practice of putting back measured amounts 
of milkfat a soybeanbased vegetable fat is mixed in 
the resulting drink which contains 2 percent vegetable fat has 
a texture and taste similar to regular 2 percent lowfat milk it 
has 120 calories per serving same as 2 percent lowfat milk and 
has a similar vitamin content dibruno said 
americans consume about 62 billion gallons of milk a year 
although sales of whole milk have declined sharply since 1971 
according to the agriculture department

the bush administration worried about a lack 
of progress in trade talks with japan insisted thursday that the 
japanese honor commitments to open markets to american and other 
foreign goods 
us negotiators have grown concerned over what they perceive as 
japanese footdragging in the talks aimed at reducing the united 
states 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
critics have said japans intransigence is directly linked to a 
decision by the bush administration to remove japan from under a 
tough section of trade law known as super 301 which carries the 
threat of economic sanctions 
recent negotiations in hawaii produced little progress in 
writing the text of a final report on negotiations aimed at 
altering the economies of both countries as a way of attacking the 
underlying reasons for the huge trade imbalance 
japan and the united states signed an interim agreement on the 
talks known as the structural impediments initiative in april and 
face a deadline of early july for producing a final report 
however in several key areas the japanese are refusing to make 
commitments sought by us negotiators 
as we go from the interim report to the final report we want 
to keep the pressure on to make sure that all the commitments make 
it through into that final report white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater told reporters 
fitzwater downplayed reports that administration officials 
believed the japanese side was stonewalling now that the threat of 
economic sanctions under super 301 was no longer present 
but commerce secretary robert mosbacher refused to dismiss the 
possibility that japan was using a stonewalling technique in the 
current negotiations 
i hope for all our sakes they are just testing us to see if we 
have lost any of our resolve mosbacher said when asked about the 
talks during a congressional hearing they did take some very 
good first steps but they have got a lot farther to go as we do 
two other senior administration officials briefing reporters on 
condition that their names not be used expressed clear 
disappointment thursday with the lack of progress 
it would be highly regrettable that if at this stage this 
process lost momentum and reversed itself one official said he 
said he believed there had been a reduced level of involvement by 
senior japanese officials in the process 
the usjapan trade talks were stalemated earlier this year 
before a hastily arranged summit meeting between japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu and president bush got the negotiations back 
on track 
secretary of state james a baker iii is scheduled to meet 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama in san francisco on friday 
and the administration is hoping those discussions will break the 
current stalemate 
japanese officials have insisted that they have gone as far as 
they can go with the commitments made in the april report while 
the us is characterizing the april report as only a way 
station with much more concrete language needed to carry out the 
vague promises 
the next round of talks on structural barriers is scheduled for 
june 2526 in tokyo with the final report due before the economic 
summit meeting in houston on july 9 
if not cleared up beforehand a trade fight between the united 
states and japan would cast a pall over the annual economic summit 
of the worlds seven richest industrial countries 
in the april report japan promised to open its retailing 
system boost spending on public works projects strengthen 
antitrust legislation and loosen restrictions on foreign 
investment all in an effort to expand opportunities for foreign 
companies to do business in japan 
the united states pledged to cut the federal budget deficit and 
take measures to increase savings and investment all proposals 
economists agree are needed to reduce americans appetite for 
foreign goods 
the new japanese negotiating stance has not gone unnoticed in 
congress where lawmakers were upset by the administrations 
refusal to rename japan to a super 301 hit list as a way of 
keeping pressure on the japanese to open their markets 
sen max baucus dmont warned the administration this week 
that congress may have no choice but to respond with 
retaliatory legislation of its own if japan is not more forthcoming

the united auto workers and the nations big 
three automakers will begin contract negotiations in the third week 
of july for about 500000 workers the union said wednesday 
company spokesmen who declined to be identified said tentative 
dates for the beginning of talks were july 18 at general motors 
corp july 19 at ford motor co and july 20 at chrysler corp 
a uaw spokesman who also refused to be identified confirmed 
those dates 
contracts between the union and each of the big three expire 
sept 14 the first time in 11 years the three contracts have had 
common expiration dates 
in canada talks between the three companies and the canadian 
auto workers union are expected to get under way the following 
week those agreements also expire sept 14 
the uaw has set job security as its top priority in the 
negotiations other issues include wages pension improvements 
health care and more responsive management 
the opening of talks is largely ceremonial with dozens of 
people packed into the main negotiating room at each of the us 
automakers headquarters uaw president owen bieber and chief 
negotiators for the companies shake hands across a huge table 
much of the bargaining takes place in subcommittees that focus 
on specific areas of the contracts economic matters usually are 
among the last negotiated 
an hourly worker on an assembly line now makes about 1575 an 
hour 
traditionally as the deadline draws near the uaw selects a 
target company on which to focus efforts and suspends talks at 
the other two terms of an agreement at the target company called 
a pattern contract then are modified slightly and brought to the 
other two 
this year chrysler labor vice president anthony st john has 
hinted that the financially struggling company may break from the 
pattern

accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the annual growth rate in m2 so far this year is 41 percent 
which is within the feds target range of 3 percent to 7 percent 
the annual growth rate in m3 was 15 percent which is below the 
feds target range of 25 percent to 65 percent the fed has not 
set a target for m1 growth since early 1987 
for the latest 13 weeks m2 averaged 32681 billion a 39

as president as he did on the campaign trail when he sought the 
presidency in 1988 said senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine 
there simply are not the votes available to us to frustrate 
passage said an opponent sen thad cochran rmiss we 
concede the senates will is to pass this bill 
business groups opposed the bill and their lobbyists said some 
senators who opposed it wanted to avoid a recorded vote and were 
acting in hopes that bush would veto it and that the house would 
sustain that veto before the senate had to vote 
if it turns out that way senators would not have to go on the 
record on the issue a vote in either house to sustain a veto kills 
the bill the constitution requires votes on overriding vetoes to 
be by roll call 
the bill requires business and government employers to provide 
workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or leave for 
the care of a new child or an ill child parent or spouse 
it exempts businesses with fewer than 50 workers and workers 
who are the highestpaid 10 percent within a company 
employers would have to continue health insurance benefits for 
those on leave and restore returning employees to their previous 
jobs or equivalent positions 
thanks to the leaders both the majority and minority leaders 
a decision was made not to contest the matter and to pass the 
bill said its sponsor sen christopher dodd dconn ive 
learned long ago you dont argue about a victory when you get one 
im also also convinced that had it come to a recorded vote we 
would have prevailed 
dodd argued in brief debate a day earlier that the jobprotected 
leave was a minimum guarantee any worker should receive 
the bottom line is this american parents ought to be able to 
have jobs and their families as well dodd said parents ought 
to be able to deal with a rare family crisis without losing those 
jobs 
sen orrin hatch rutah opposed the bill saying he favored 
leave for workers but opposed a federal requirement that employers 
offer it 
i dont want to see anybody fired because they have a baby or 
an adoption or a serious illness in the family hatch said 
i think we could come up with a way to give business incentives 
to do this but i dont think we should force them 
business association representatives met with white house chief 
of staff john sununu may 7 and said he promised them bush would 
veto the bill 
in the house opponents argued in long debate that the bill 
would be costly a bad precedent and burdensome for businesses 
ultimately hurting american competitiveness supporters said nearly 
all industrialized nations already provide such minimum job 
security to workers however and many have provisions for full or 
partial pay 
the bills sponsors said it would cost virtually nothing for 
employers while opponents charged it would carry additional costs 
for training temporary employees and overtime 
the bill would cover federal employees with even more generous 
leave provisions it would cover house employees but not employees 
of the senate

the nyse is open from 930 am to 4 pm eastern time stocks 
of us and foreign companies comprise the 1700 listed on the 
exchange 
trades are entered either manually or electronically on the 
exchange floor specialists on the floor make markets for 
individual stocks by matching buyers with sellers and generate 
action in less heavily traded stocks 
brokers who take orders at banks of yellow telephones on the 
floor often trade with other brokers at a stocks post in those 
cases specialists serve as traffic cops making sure the trade is 
properly recorded 
if there is no buyer or seller the specialist records the order 
and awaits a corresponding transaction or the specialist will 
step in and complete the trade in order to keep the market active

in the first stage the nyse would hold two 15 to 45minute 
sessions after the market closes in an attempt to recapture some 
trading currently lost to the london stock exchange that activity 
mainly involves program trading and other techniques typically not 
used by small investors 
one session would allow traders to trade stocks at the days 
closing prices and the other would let them disclose their own 
trades both practices could help program traders complete 
transactions such trades now often are completed in london or via 
independent electronic trading services

sometime in 1991 the nyse would begin holding auctions of each 
listed stock at 8 pm midnight and 5 am eastern time the 
stocks would trade once at each auction with trades combined at 
one agreedupon price for each issue traded 
brokers could enter electronic orders for stocks at their 
offices in the evening in new york as the trading day begins in 
tokyo they would be able to see what other orders had been placed 
and alter their own 
at 8 pm the exchange would pair off as many orders as 
possible in one huge trade that could involve millions of shares 
and hundreds of buyers and sellers the process would be repeated 
at midnight and 5 am when the london market opens
