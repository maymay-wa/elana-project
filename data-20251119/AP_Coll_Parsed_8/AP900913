secretary of state james a baker iii 
voiced concern thursday about the call from irans spiritual leader 
for a holy war against the us troops deployed to saudi 
arabia 
baker here for talks friday with syrian president hafez assad 
on the campaign against iraq said wednesdays comments by 
ayatollah ali khamenei the iranian spiritual leader were 
obviously of deep concern 
we are not indifferent to threats against our forces the 
secretary said 
baker noted that arab forces were also part of the persian gulf 
operation intended to guard against further iraqi aggression 
syria which is on iraqs northern border has sent 3000 troops to 
saudi arabia and 1000 to the united aab emirates 
as for continued iranian adherence to the un economic embargo 
against iraq baker told reporters we are watching it closely 
and believe it is holding 
during his talks in moscow baker told soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze the united states may ask the united nations to 
broaden the embargo against iraq including possibly a cutoff of 
air shipments according to reports in the washington post and the 
new york times baker also mentioned the possibility of seeking 
un sanctions against nations that break the embargo 
in washington meanwhile state department spokesman richard 
boucher said khameneis position appears to be based on a 
misunderstanding of what we mean 
the united states sent troops to saudi arabia at the 
governments invitation to deter iraqi president saddam hussein 
from attacking the oilrich kingdom he said 
and we will leave saudi arabia when that mission is 
accomplished or whenever we might be asked to leave by the saudi 
government boucher added 
officials in washington who have analyzed khameneis speech are 
said to feel the iranian cleric was expressing the fears of his 
country and those of others in the area that the united states will 
use its foothold in saudi arabia to stay forever 
this is our way of allaying those concerns said one 
washington official who requested anonymity 
on wednesday khamenei said that confronting the greedy 
interventionist schemes of the united states to encroach on the 
persian gulf is considered jihad holy war and anyone who is 
killed on the path is a martyr 
the bush administration had solicited both syria and iran to 
assist in the iraqi campaign because of the two nations 
longstanding hostility to saddams government 
while iran has repaired relations with iraq with which it 
fought an eightyear war that ended just two years ago the tehran 
government has endorsed the un boycott 
baker is the first us secretary of state to visit syria since 
george p shultz came here in 1988 to sound out assad on the 
prospects for arabisraeli negotiations 
syrias human rights record has been sharply criticized by the 
state department which has kept assads government on a list of 
seven countries accused of sponsoring terrorism 
a terrorist group with strong ties to syria the popular front 
for the liberation of palestine general command is suspected in 
the december 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie 
scotland the disaster took 280 lives 
baker in announcing monday in brussels that he would visit 
damascus said the united states continues to have certain 
differences with syria and we expect to discuss these differences 
as well as our mutual interest in continuing to see saddam hussein 
isolated 
he said his facetoface meeting with assad was important so 
that we might be able to cooperate to achieve what happens to be 
a mutual goal

dead dolphins are washing up on spains 
eastern mediterranean coast in unusually high numbers causing 
marine biologists and ecologists to suspect a viral epidemic is 
killing them 
many scientists and environmental activists believe the deaths 
are the inevitable outcome of largescale dumping of toxic 
pollutants in the mediterranean by petrochemical plants 
esteve grau a university of barcelona biologist said 
preliminary results of autopsies on three of the dead mammals 
showed extremely high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs 
were working on the hypothesis that the dolphins ate 
pcbcontaminated fish and that this severely weakened their immune 
systems making them susceptible to a stillunidentified virus 
grau said in a telephone interview 
pcbs are liquid resinous or crystalline organic compounds used 
in industrial processes as lubricants heattransfer fluids or to 
give strength or flexibility to wood metal or concrete 
we believe the scientists hypothesis to be correct said 
xavier pastor head of the greenpeace environmental groups office 
in palma capital of the spanish island of majorca in the 
mediterranean 
he said the toxicity of pcbs and their resistance to 
decomposition make them especially dangerous to mammals 
the epidemic appears similar to others that killed up to 800 
seals in the north sea off the netherlands in 1988 and in another 
case under study in california pastor said 
he said some of the dead dolphins had been found on beaches near 
palma in the balearic archipelago 150 miles south of barcelona 
grau and other scientists from the barcelona zoo the marineland 
aquatic park and the university of valencia have conducted 10 
autopsies on dolphins they are trying to determine why only 
striped dolphin and not fish have been killed he said 
dr joaquim piza of marineland said doubts remained about 
whether pcbs caused the dolphins to die 
if that were the case its most likely dolphins of other 
species would have been affected he said in a telephone 
interview 
the autopsies have not produced conclusive evidence that the 
pcbs are the cause the only thing we have been able to determine 
so far with certainty is that the dolphins suffered a weakening of 
their immune systems 
piza said there was some speculation the dolphins had contracted 
a herpestype virus that attacked their immune systems 
between 12 and 20 infirm or aged striped dolphins are found 
washed up every summer on spains eastern beaches and on majorca 
grau said but there have been more than 100 this year he said the 
striped dolphin is not an endangered species and is abundant in the 
mediterranean 
scientists fear the presence of pcbs eventually may reduce the 
number of dolphins by affecting reproduction in addition to killing 
the weaker ones grau said 
we estimate that only 1 percent of affected dolphins have 
washed up he said which means the total number that have 
succumbed to the viral epidemic could be as high as 10000 
pastor noted that industrial and chemical companies continue 
dumping tons of toxic waste including pcbs into the mediterranean 
from plants along spains mediterranean coast from barcelona to 
algeciras adjacent to gibraltar 
weve called on spains autonomous regional governments and 
the central government in madrid to set up a plan to gradually but 
definitively end all industrial toxic waste dumping into the 
mediterranean by the end of 1991 he said 
weve tried to work with industrial companies directly but 
they have refused to acknowledge how much they dump into the 
mediterranean saying it might reveal industrial secrets to 
competitors 
he said greenpeace had found it difficult to develop estimates 
of the amount of pcbs companies in spain dump into the 
mediterranean

scientists today reported identifying a target 
of an immune system attack that precedes diabetes a discovery that 
could help in predicting and someday even preventing the disease 
the target is an enzyme in the insulinproducing cells of the 
pancreas researchers said in the british journal nature 
this really is exciting stuff i think clearly it will be 
one of the major papers in diabetes in the last several years 
said kenneth farber director of research at the juvenile diabetes 
foundation international 
his organization helped fund the research 
the study dealt with insulindependent diabetes the most severe 
form which affects about 1 million americans they must take daily 
insulin injections to survive 
symptoms appear after the bodys diseasefighting immune system 
has destroyed most of the insulinproducing beta cells of the 
pancreas 
scientists do not know what triggers that onslaught but they 
have found that the immune system begins attacking several specific 
targets long before the disease is diagnosed 
the new study identifies one of those targets as an enzyme 
called glutamic acid decarboxylase the substance is also found in 
brain cells where it helps make a chemical messenger brain cells 
use to communicate researcher steinunn baekkeskov said 
the discovery should aid research into the substance by leading 
to much more abundant supplies of it either from brain tissue or 
from genetic engineering she said 
further research on the enzyme may lead to therapies that 
prevent diabetes by stopping the immune system attack without 
suppressing the immune system generally she said 
but that depends on whether the attack on the enzyme plays any 
role in causing the disease which is not yet known said 
baekkeskov of the hormone research institute of the medical school 
at the university of california at san francisco 
she did the work with colleagues at the institute and scientists 
at the yale university school of medicine and in denmark 
other future research can follow up indications that a blood 
test based on the enzyme can help identify people on the way to 
developing diabetes she said 
the test looks for antibodies that are aimed at the enzyme the 
antibodies appear in 80 percent of newly diagnosed diabetics and 
they have been detected up to several years before symptoms of the 
disease appear researchers said 
antibodies to other targets appear before diagnosis too dr 
george eisenbarth of the joslin diabetes center in boston said 
combining the enzyme antibody test with other antibody tests may 
improve the ability to predict insulindependent diabetes 
currently there is no proven way to prevent the disease in 
people who show diabetesrelated antibodies but eisenbarth said 
early prediction is useful in finding people to participate in 
studies of therapies to prevent the disease 
the american diabetes association recently endorsed blood tests 
for close relatives of insulindependent diabetics to help find 
participants for such studies

the 265th quartermaster detachment of the south 
carolina national guard is one of the reserve units called up for 
duty in saudi arabia national writer fred bayles is with the 14 
guardsmen as they prepare for deployment overseas 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
heads up 265th youre shipping out 
tomorrow stand down 265th youre not going anywhere for a week 
hang in there 265th youll be gone by the weekend 
to the military novice such conflicting statements could be a 
source of confusion frustration even anger but for veterans of 
the 265th quartermaster detachment there is a simple philosophy to 
handle this world of uncertainty 
ill believe it when i see it said sgt earnest deloach 
his sentiment drew a murmur of thats the truth from the rest 
of the 14member national guard unit from south carolina awaiting 
deployment to the mideast 
while information about the 265ths departure date may change 
from hour to hour there are signs that it will be sooner than 
later 
the unit has been placed on available loading date status which 
means it could be shipped out at any time 
the men are ready they wear their desert uniforms and canteens 
everywhere the forest green camouflage on their four pickup trucks 
has been painted over a flat sand color 
nearly everyone has had his hair trimmed to military stubble 
many of the haircuts were courtesy of sgt hullie cohen a brick 
mason who has cut his familys hair since he was a boy 
but for all the omens that departure is imminent there are 
signs that the 265th still faces an uncertain wait 
on wednesday the men finished packing four trucks with items for 
overseas ranging from toilet paper and cots to radios and spare 
radiators they took the 45mile drive to the hunter army air field 
to have their loads prepared for airlift 
but a major at the field told them to take it back 
i have no orders on what airframe will be taking you he 
said i have no indication when you might be going it might be 
another week 
so the convoy made the 45mile return trip to the barracks 
when they got back there was a call from a colonel youre 
leaving tomorrow afternoon the unit commander sgt ronnie 
jackson was told 
when the information was passed down through the sergeants to 
the enlisted men the reaction was a sort of angry yawn and an 
unprintable phrase often heard around here to express disbelief 
they tell you one thing and they tell you another and you 
dont know which to believe said spc curtis young 
ill believe it when i see it echoed a chorus of the men 
the problem in all this uncertainty is its impact on morale the 
unit has finished an arduous schedule of chemical warfare training 
to lessons on saudi etiquette there is little else to do but sit 
around and brood or go over lessons for the 20th time 
were all revved up and ready to go said sgt john 
williams the second in command if we have to wait another week 
it will kill us 
jackson the unit commander has tried to maintain a balance 
with the men he kept them working through the afternoon repacking 
the trucks packing their own gear and going down for their last 
set of shots 
but he canceled an evening physical training session giving the 
men time to spend with family members who made the threehour drive 
from the units home of allendale sc 
im backing off jackson said with all this uncertainty 
youve got to know when to leave them alone 
among the visiting families were cohens wife and daughter the 
cohens werent coming until the weekend but plans changed late in 
the day 
did that mean cohen thought deployment was tomorrow 
no he said but i couldnt take the chance

mr jims hellish busy 
warned a jordanian volunteer at this crowded desert camp jim 
nuttall awake and unfed since who knows when was up to his neck 
in remonstrating refugees 
nuttall a gentle but streetwise guy from detroit is the 
roving troubleshooter for save the children of westport conn hes 
found plenty of trouble on the desolate desperate iraqi border 
only one nuttall said with a laugh when asked his biggest 
problem in building from scratch a transit camp for thousands of 
penniless asians unable to get home from iraqioccupied kuwait 
after two weeks of laboring every day from dawn to 
aftermidnight interrupted every few minutes with some minor 
crisis to defuse nuttall had shifted to yet another gear 
now it comes down to the hard work he said were almost 
building a city out here sanitation food systems communication 
control mosques water supplies its a 12ring circus 
nuttall 37 started out with a degree in sculpture from wayne 
state university in detroit his father garth l nuttall runs a 
machine shop in the city 
nuttall worked in morocco for the peace corps in 1980 then went 
into the disaster business 
two weeks ago nuttall was the first outsider to wade into 
shaalan i where 40000 stranded refugees were working themselves 
into a frenzy of despair violence did not seem far off 
one man roughed him up a desperate mob carried off an indian 
volunteer until nuttall managed to rescue him 
unscathed he coordinated the jordanian army and relief workers 
working with officials he organized the refugees into national 
groups and separated them 
it wasnt so bad nuttall shrugged with a selfdeprecating 
chuckle my last job was doing the same thing on the afghanistan 
border in pakistan and they were all armed 
by tuesday he had brought some order to shaalan iii a hastily 
planned settlement designed to ease crowding at shaalan i and the 
smaller calmer shaalan ii he had even attempted a bengali night 
a curry cookout to raise spirits of bangladeshis spending their 
second week among scorpions and snakes with no word on when their 
impoverished government might fly them home 
what a disaster he said have you ever tried to cook rice 
for 5000 people 
the stoves didnt work delaying dinner until after dark the 
electricity was not in so the party was by candlelight trucks 
suddenly arrived with more people spewing thick dust everywhere 
a kindly jordanian farmer drove up with a load of gift 
vegetables but his truck broke down the party fizzled while hosts 
played mechanic 
but the worst part was the buses headed west from shaalan i 
from all evidence they were evacuating people who had arrived at 
the camp later than those in nuttalls camp 
they went nuts he said they gathered together and were 
saying things like this is a prison camp i told them the buses 
were carrying filipinos but these are frustrated people 
all the next day nuttall fended off flak while trying to solve 
the problem he got military guards posted on the twolane road 
outside to make sure no one violated the firstin firstout rule 
with a masters in culture management from the school of 
international training at brattleboro vermont and what he calls 
his social workers voice he calmed tensions 
but mohammed sana ullah got to him with firmness bordering on 
threat the retired air force sergeant demanded some action 
nuttall tried a trusty tack 
listen i want to help you go home so that i can go home he 
said please help me to help you 
ullah then broke into sobs and nuttalls own frayed nerves 
nearly went moisture formed in his eyes as he sought to sooth 
ullah then another crisis intervened and he was off again 
the next morning nuttall woke up seeing ullahs eyes in his 
mind and hurried to amman to press bangladeshi consular authorities 
to speed up evacuations 
nuttall has set a furious pace from his first day here after 
three days on the border having eaten almost nothing and badly 
dehydrated he refused to tap the refugees meager stocks friends 
brought him a midnight meal which he let sit for an hour while he 
reeled off sound bites by longdistance phone to american networks 
to dramatize the refugees plight 
ten days later a visitor to shaalan iii asked nuttall how he 
was able to remain in such good spirits 
no problem he replied i had a shower this morning

for karima bennoune an algerian student at the 
university of michigan the frustrations and fears of being an arab 
on an american campus came to a head during a recent law school 
class 
a student stood up she recalled and said there is 
nothing in the middle east worth anything except oil and that we 
should go in there and do whatever we want which to me is a pretty 
amazing statement from a firstyear law student at the university 
of michigan 
that typifies a lot of the attitude on campus she said 
theyve forgotten that there are men women and children being 
affected by the blockade when i see arab people waiting in lines 
for bread or medicine i see people who look like my cousins but 
others just see the face of the madman saddam hussein 
through the eyes of bennoune and many of the estimated 30000 
other arabamerican and arab national students us campuses this 
fall are places of uncertainty and anxiety safe havens for now 
at least from the persian gulf crisis affecting their homelands 
yet vulnerable to bigotry 
i was here in 1979 i remember what it was like for iranian 
students during the hostage crisis said haneen a 28yearold 
lebanese student attending columbia university who asked that her 
last name be withheld for fear of reprisals to family living in 
kuwait 
and you didnt have to be an arab student to be mistaken for 
one 
so far this young school year students attending american 
universities from jordan lebanon saudi arabia syria kuwait 
egypt and the united arab emirates have not faced serious bigotry 
or hostility according to marvin wingfield outreach director of 
the washingtonbased arabamerican antidiscrimination committee 
which tracks such incidents 
on the contrary everybodys been concerned about me and 
everybodys been treating me well said rafeef zahran a 
psychology student and the only saudi attending emmanuel college a 
small catholic all womens school in boston 
but interviews with arab students elsewhere reveal that many 
like bennoune see signs that campus life could grow increasingly 
uncomfortable as the persian gulf crisis wears on especially if 
it escalates into war 
at the michigan campus for example bennoune says shes seen a 
number of students wearing ghostbustertype tshirts with the word 
iraq encircled and slashed 
nearly all complained that americans are generally unsympathetic 
to the suffering of arabs and have wrongly painted the persian gulf 
conflict as simply good versus evil 
saddam hussein himself had little support from the arab students 
interviewed 
i couldnt name an arab student who supports saddam hussein 
but theres a lot of sympathy for the iraqi people and theres a 
lot of feeling about the americans charging in militarily said 
bennoune 
other students expressed equal contempt for the saudi and 
kuwaiti regimes which they accuse of intolerance toward other 
arabs 
i dont consider saddam hussein to be the savior of the arabs 
but the kuwaitis have brought this on themselves says wael 
massarweh a 28yearold jordanian engineering student at texas aampm 
university 
massarweh and his family lived and worked in kuwait until last 
year and he said arabs from other lands often suffered 
discrimination 
if you think south africa is bad in terms of discrimination 
thats the worst for palestinians lebanese or others who work 
there there is no respect for human rights if you are in a car 
accident and one party is kuwaiti and the other is an arab from 
elsewhere the kuwaiti is always right he said 
as a student as a moslem as an arab i dont approve of 
saddam hussein pointing guns at other arabs said osman ghandour 
a secondyear graduate engineering student at columbia who grew up 
in lebanons wartorn bekaa valley 
i was educated in the united states we think very highly of 
democracy and freedom its disappointing that the us should make 
more of an effort for kuwait but not for the palestinians 
an added frustration among some is a desire to speak out on 
campus but a fear of the consequences 
we cant afford to lie low said haneen who said she and 
fellow arab students hope to bring guest speakers to columbia this 
fall

as the persian gulf crisis wears on israeli 
leaders are sending ambiguous messages to jordan they say publicly 
that they want king hussein to remain in power but insist 
privately that his days as a ruler are numbered 
some analysts say the mixed messages are a sign of confusion in 
the israeli government while others say israel is delivering a 
warning to the king not to go too far in supporting iraq 
still others warn that the tough talk may be intended to create 
an aggressive political mood in israel laying the groundwork for 
an israeli invasion of neighboring jordan should the opportunity 
arise 
private conversations in certain influential israeli circles 
betray eagerness for an israeli invasion of jordan liberal 
israeli journalist uri avnery wrote in a recent commentary in the 
new york times 
there is toughguy talk of lowering the threshold for an 
israeli military action the tone is make our day wrote 
avnery a former member of parliament 
an israeliheld jordan would appeal to extreme hardliners who 
dream of a greater israel on both banks of the jordan river 
avnery said it would also fit in with the plans of those who want 
to expel palestinains from the west bank and need a place to 
resettle them he added 
avi pazner a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
called avnerys scenario as utter nonsense 
what would we do with jordan pazner asked 
he added that shamir is interested in the kings survival 
because he believes we need a stable peaceful jordan alongside us 
the king is best equipped to deliver this 
pazner also said there was nothing ambiguous about israels 
stance toward jordan he noted that since iraq precipitated the 
crisis by seizing kuwait last month israel has said it would only 
use military force if attacked by iraq or if iraqi troops entered 
jordan 
but shamir himself has suggested that the israeli threshold for 
moving into jordan may be lower than the officially stated policy 
asked recently to comment on jordans expressions of sympathy 
for iraq shamir said it is contrary to israels interests 
threatens israels security and does not help the kings survival 
he quickly tempered the warning adding the king of jordan 
knows well that israel has no aggressive intentions toward it 
jordan 
but king hussein apparently believes otherwise having heard for 
yement that jordan is palestine 
this theory holds that jordan with its 50 percent palestinian 
population is the true palestinian homeland this idea has israel 
keeping the occupied west bank and gaza strip which were captured 
from jordan and egypt in 1967 and which palestinians want as their 
wouldbe state 
influential members of shamirs rightwing government have 
frequently used the phrase jordan is palestine chief among 
them is housing minister ariel sharon who once suggested israel 
contact the plo to help it take over jordan 
last week the independent israeli newspaper haaretz wrote that 
it was such talk seen as a threat by jordan that pushed king 
hussein into the arms of iraq 
the kings dependence on iraq also has led israeli analysts to 
question lately whether he is really valuable to israel 
shamir is not sure whether its better to have a palestinian 
state in jordan or whether to have king hussein said yossi 
melman a journalist who wrote a book on the secret ties between 
two countries despite their official state of war 
melman said king husseins value to the israelis as a moderate 
leader is diminishing rapidly though they apparently still prefer 
him to palestinians or moslem fundamentalists 
but a source knowledgeable about government policies speaking 
on condition of anonymity said most israeli leaders have concluded 
that king hussein is no longer of use to them 
his usefulness suffered its worst blow when he renounced claims 
to the west bank in 1988 losing his role as possible mediator 
between israel and the palestinians 
on sunday the jerusalem posts military reporter quoted a 
very senior source as predicting the king would be toppled 
i am not saying that jordan will disappear as a state the 
source told the post but jordan as a kingdom as a country ruled 
by a king will disappear

the tiny band of voters who shaped the 1990 
primary election season sent a clear message beware of jumping to 
any conclusions about the mood of the electorate this year 
consider these bits of conventional wisdom widely circulated in 
1990 
public concern about a squishy economy and anger over the 
savings and loan scandal have created an antiincumbent mood 
throw the rascals out will be the battle cry of voters 
the 1989 supreme court decision giving states latitude to 
restrict access to abortion changed the impact of that issue 
decisively in favor of candidates who support abortion rights 
but the only rascal thrown out in a primary was rep donald 
buz lukens an ohio republican who had been convicted of having 
sex with a minor 
others seemed threatened most recently gov rudy perpich of 
minnesota and rep roy dyson of maryland but both democrats turned 
back primary challenges on tuesday and a month ago republican 
gov mike hayden of kansas won a primary he was widely expected to 
lose 
the perpich and dyson victories also defied the conventional 
assumptions on abortion both incumbents were in the antiabortion 
camp and defeated challengers who were prochoice 
patricia ireland executive vice president of the national 
organization for women contended that perpichs victory was not a 
clear test of abortion sentiment because the governors running 
mate was a prochoice woman and he was considered very supportive 
of women on other issues 
it was not a clear upordown vote although of course if we 
had won it we would have been much happier she said 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown when asked about an 
antiincumbent trend said i havent seen any 
theres some sign of that but not a prairie fire said 
charles black the leading spokesman for the republican party 
both party officials claimed they were pleased with the 
candidates who have emerged from the primaries after tuesdays 
elections in 10 states and the district of columbia only a handful 
of states have yet to hold their primaries 
i wish the general election was tomorrow said brown 
were happy with the nominees that weve got said black he 
also said he was delighted that the democrats had renominated 
perpich whom the republicans consider one of the most vulnerable 
incumbents 
in several other states democratic primary voters tossed aside 
the assumptions of party leaders and arguably strengthened the 
partys ticket 
most prominent among those was california where the party 
establishment was strongly behind state attorney general john van 
de kamp for the gubernatorial nomination but van de kamp also was 
widely viewed as a certain underdog in a contest against republican 
sen pete wilson 
party leaders gave former san francisco mayor dianne feinstein 
little chance to sidetrack van de kamps drive for the nomination 
but she won the primary going away and is in a deadheat race with 
wilson 
in kansas democratic leaders assumed former gov john carlin 
was their strongest challenger to hayden but the voters clearly 
saw carlin as part of the states economic problems and gave the 
democratic statehouse nomination to state treasurer joan finney 
florida democratic primary voters overwhelmingly backed former 
sen lawton chiles over the early establishment choice rep bill 
nelson for governor 
harvey gantt is running a close race against republican sen 
jesse helms of north carolina gantt the black former mayor of 
charlotte had been given little chance last spring of beating 
prosecutor mike easley in a runoff 
the latest round of primaries was particularly tough on 
assumptions about the impact of abortion 
not only did perpich and dyson successfully defy the 
conventional wisdom but the issue failed to make a perceptible 
dent in the victory margins in new hampshire of rep bob smith and 
sen gordon humphrey 
try as he might lawyer tom christo failed to make abortion an 
issue in the republican senate primary in which he and smith 
competed for the nomination to succeed humphrey 
humphrey surrendering his us senate seat and seeking a seat 
in the new hampshire senate overcame a primary challenge from a 
state legislator who had strong backing from the national abortion 
rights action league 
theres no one wed rather beat than gordon humphrey said 
narals peg dobbie despite narals best efforts the senator 
captured 58 percent of the primary vote 
but prochoice advocates also had races they could cite to 
support their view of the impact of the abortion issue three 
maryland state senators who led a filibuster against abortion 
rights legislation were defeated by prochoice primary challengers 
what we learned from the primary season is that abortion is 
not necessarily a silver bullet in every race said naral 
executive director kate michelman it can be powerful but 
its not going to make every candidate a winner

americans accustomed to watching presidents 
and members of congress on television will get their first 
televised look at federal judges at work next year 
the us judicial conference which sets policy for the federal 
courts approved on wednesday a carefully controlled and limited 
plan to permit tv cameras to record and broadcast civil trials in a 
handful of federal courtrooms 
the threeyear experiment will begin in july limited to two 
federal appeals courts and six trial courts judges who volunteer 
their courtrooms for the plan will have almost total control over 
what the public sees 
rep robert w kastenmeier dwis who has been urging approval 
of the experiment hailed the judicial conference action as a step 
toward promoting public understanding of the court system 
the time for federal courts to permit tv news coverage in 
courtrooms has come said kastenmeier chairman of the house 
judiciary subcommittee on courts technology that permits us 
access to world events also compels us to use that access to make 
our own government available to our citizens 
kastenmeier said televised congressional proceedings which 
began in the house in 1979 and in 1986 in the senate have been 
beneficial to the public 
cspan the cable network that telecasts public affairs 
programs also welcomed the experiment and predicted it will 
enhance respect for americas system of justice 
the judicial conference headed by chief justice william h 
rehnquist approved the idea overwhelmingly by voice vote said 
spokesman david sellers 
sellers indicated that rehnquist spoke in favor of the 
experiment 
the conference with 27 federal judges as its members 
traditionally meets in private 
sellers said only a few judges spoke against the experiment and 
that the pervasive view is this is inevitable 
fortyfive states have approved the use of television cameras 
and supporters say there have been no adverse results 
wednesdays action does not mean that federal criminal trials 
will be televised the judicial conference left intact a rule 
banning cameras in criminal cases 
nor will supreme court proceedings be televised anytime soon 
the judicial conference has no control over the high court and 
most justices are believed opposed to permitting cameras there 
some justices reportedly were turned against the idea after 
watching supreme court nominee robert bork get roughed up verbally 
at televised confirmation hearings before the senate judiciary 
committee in 1987 bork subsequently was rejected by the senate 
for years thenchief justice warren e burger played a leading 
role in keeping cameras out of federal courtrooms 
cameras and radio sound equipment have been banned in federal 
courts since 1937 
those who oppose lifting the ban say television will lead to 
grandstanding by judges and lawyers and could distort public 
understanding because only snippets will be aired on tv news 
programs 
sellers said three or four judges raised those objections at the 
judicial conference meeting 
he said the new experiment will be monitored by the federal 
judicial center a think tank for the federal courts it will issue 
a report on its findings in september 1993 or march 1994 
the judicial conference approved a recommendation by a study 
committee that voted 41 in favor of the idea for federal courts 
last month the committee is headed by us district judge robert 
f peckham of san francisco 
one item judges will insist on is that those who operate tv 
cameras will be dressed in business attire no jumpsuits said 
sellers

until steve martin and jay leno 
arrive to entertain the troops the best and only show in town 
is strictly for amateurs 
wednesday was opening night for a rocking risque 90minute show 
put on by americans and other westerners men and women who live 
in saudi arabia and wanted to show their appreciation to the us 
troops sent to protect them 
and despite their amateur status they got rave reviews 
you dont know how good i feel said gil vargas of the 82nd 
airborne division who was stamping his feet to the closing number 
a rap version of bruce springsteens born in the usa 
the performers repeatedly brought nearly 400 members of the 82nd 
airborne to their feet with a variety show of singing dancing 
comedy rock music and flagwaving 
for the paratroops who have been living in the saudi desert for 
a month the show broke the tedium 
it was great stress relief said 19year army veteran master 
sgt ervin shelley of greenville nc my only regret is that 
some of the guys out there wont get to see the show this means a 
lot to the guys 
the americans britons and other westerners who staged the show 
reside and work near several camps housing us troops they hope 
to put on the show three times a week for the next few weeks 
a burlesquelike dance routine opened the show and got the 
soldiers hooting and hollering 
an act billed as a barbershop quartet actually had 15 members 
but the men and a few women paratroopers didnt seem to mind 
joining in on some of the songs 
the troops who get a few newspapers in the desert but have 
little contact with the outside world were bent over laughing at a 
series of jokes told by a standup comic about the gulf crisis 
none of them repeatable 
my name is bob but im beyond hope was the comics opening 
line 
its not known yet whether the 87yearold bob hope whos made 
a practice of bringing laughter to us troops since world war ii 
will make the trip to saudi arabia for one of his famed christmas 
shows 
but that wild and crazy guy steve martin is scheduled to 
arrive next month accompanied by his wife actress victoria 
tennant and leno has been lined up for two thanksgiving shows 
sponsored by the uso 
the united service organizations moralebuilding has gotten off 
to a slow start because priority has been given to the massive task 
of moving the troops and their equipment to the region 
so until professional comic relief gets here the amateurs are 
getting top billing and their audience wasnt complaining 
at one point the wouldbe comedian led the troops in a song 
with the following chorus 
sitting on my ass in the sand catching a tan tan tan 
sitting on my ass in the sand hating saddam 
that had the troops howling and many were still laughing and 
talking about the show as they walked out 
everybody wants to go home said vargas a native of puerto 
rico but if were going to have to stay here this will certainly 
help keep morale up

israeli agents had detailed information about 
plans to bomb a us marine barracks in lebanon in 1983 but gave 
the cia only a vague warning about the attack in which 241 
americans were killed a new book claims 
the allegation is one of many by victor ostrovsky a canadian 
graphic artist who says he served for four years as an operative of 
the fabled israeli spy agency the mossad 
a new york court at the israeli governments request on 
wednesday issued a temporary order barring the publisher st 
martins press from distributing the book the suit said 
information in the work could endanger the lives of israeli agents 
the 300page book by way of deception the making and 
unmaking of a mossad officer was written in collaboration with 
canadian journalist claire hoy it purports to name many mossad 
agents and supervisors as it describes in detail ostrovskys 
threeyear training and many of the operations he heard about or in 
which he was involved 
in the summer of 1983 ostrovsky writes a mossad informant told 
his contact in beirut that a large mercedes truck was being 
outfitted by shiite moslem radicals with compartments that could 
hold bombs 
the book says the informant reported that the hidden spaces in 
the truck were large and mossad deduced the target had to be big 
now the mossad knew that for size there were only a few logical 
targets one of which must be the us compound ostrovsky writes 
the question was whether or not to warn the americans to be on 
particular alert for a truck matching the description he says 
the mossad decided to give its cia allies only vague notice 
that they had reason to believe someone might be planning an 
operation against them 
mossad chief nahum admoni is quoted as having told his agents 
no were not there to protect americans theyre a big 
country 
cia spokesman mark mansfield said his agency would have no 
comment 
on oct 23 1983 a suicide driver rammed a mercedes truck into 
the marine compound killing 241 us soldiers who were part of a 
multinational peacekeeping force another truck drove into the 
french compound killing 58 troops 
in canada the 40yearold ostrovsky told the associated press 
that israeli agents were hounding him and smearing his name 
he said two of his former commanders turned up at his home in 
suburban ottawa a week ago first trying to buy his silence and 
then threatening him 
they said that its better for me that i dont write it they 
told me to stop it he said he added that he asked for police 
protection but was refused 
ostrovsky said he decided to write the book because he was 
disillusioned with the mossad and its tactics 
among other stories in the book is one that describes how 
israeli agents used money and sex to lure an iraqi agent to supply 
information that helped israel blow up iraqs nuclear reactor in 
1981 
ostrovsky also describes what he calls a highly secret unit that 
collects information within the united states about the arab world 
the unit is called al hebrew for above and employs 24 to 
27 people most of them within the united states the book says 
ostrovsky writes that the units bugging of the home of kuwaits 
ambassador to the united nations led to the 1979 resignation of 
andrew young as us ambassador to the world organization 
he says mossad agents overheard young meeting at the home of the 
kuwaiti with a representative of the palestine liberation 
organization in violation of a carter administration ban on such 
meetings because of the plos terrorist activities 
young initially denied the meeting then said it was a chance 
encounter but ostrovsky says young was forced to quit when the 
israelis leaked details of his talk with the plo official

the new york philharmonic opened its season 
getting in ahead of carnegie hall and the metropolitan opera this 
year with music director zubin mehta conducting his 1000th 
public concert with the philharmonic 
only leonard bernstein has conducted the new york philharmonic 
as often 
cellist mstislav rostropovich was the guest artist in his 
honor a dinner dance held after the avery fisher hall concert in 
a tent in lincoln centers damrosch park was called a russian 
rhapsody russian food was served 
the concert wednesday night began with mozarts symphony no 
36 called the linz beautifully played its beginning was 
serious taken at a deliberate pace throughout the texture of the 
music was light and clear one could hear one group of instruments 
through another group the long lines of the second movements 
themes were expressively shaped 
rostropovich was soloist in blochs schelomo hebrew rhapsody 
for cello and orchestra his cello tones were rich and deep as 
the voice of king solomon who inspired the music the orchestra 
was by turns gloomy impressionistic and triumphant as the 
triumphant section began when rostropovich wasnt playing the 
conductor in him seemed to take over and he seemed to speak to the 
orchestra and make a fist to conduct with vigor 
the cellist who left russia in 1974 is in his 14th season as 
music director of the national symphony in washington dc he last 
performed with the philharmonic as part of his 60th birthday 
celebration in february 1987 in shostakovichs concerto no 1 
with the composers son maxim shostakovich conducting 
though rostropovich surely has played the bloch often he seemed 
slightly uncomfortable during it he seemed entirely comfortable 
playing tchaikovskys variations on a rococo theme for cello and 
orchestra this is graceful music visually mehta swung in for a 
big attack but the music was delicately exquisite rostropovichs 
cello sound was a glistening shimmer later fast and light at the 
end he clasped his hands in victory toward the orchestra 
it was interesting to hear him play two such different styles 
the final piece was more tchaikovsky francesca da rimini 
symphonic fantasia the music tells the story of an adulterous 
couple now tossed forever on the winds in dantes inferno it has 
broad sweeping themes long melodic lines short tunes answering 
each other mysterious touches and a storm as big as hurricane hugo 
with this concert mehta begins his 13th and last season with 
the new york philharmonic he remains with the israel philharmonic 
where he was named music director for life in 1977 he also will 
guest conduct

another planeload of american women and 
children headed home from kuwait as the state department accused 
iraqi authorities of intensifying efforts to hunt down american men 
in their country 
us officials said at least 286 women and children and more 
than 40 nonamericans accompanying them left kuwait wednesday on a 
uschartered flight heading for london by way of baghdad 
the americans were flying to raleighdurham airport in north 
carolina their expected arrival this afternoon would bring to more 
than 900 the total number of americans who have been evacuated from 
kuwait and iraq 
but state department spokesman richard boucher said wednesday 
that life is becoming more difficult for the american men already 
in custody or being sought by iraqi troops 
he said the 80 or so americans who have been rounded up by the 
iraqis are being moved continually 
in kuwait there has been increased harassment of us 
citizens and more systematic housetohouse searches for american 
men are now being conducted the spokesman said 
iraqi officials have acknowledged that some american men have 
been taken to potential bombing sites to dissuade the united states 
from taking military action against iraq 
president bush has said the us military presence in the 
persian gulf region is defensive but reaffirmed in his speech to 
congress tuesday night that he will not allow the presence of 
hostages in iraqi hands to influence his policies 
about 920 americans have left iraq and kuwait in recent days and 
an additional flight is scheduled for friday some of those 
returning have described terrorfilled weeks spent in hiding from 
iraqi soldiers after the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
about 1400 americans remain in kuwait while there are about 200 
in iraq according to official estimates all of the estimated 80 
american detainees are believed to be in iraq 
thirteen of the detainees received a visit this week from a us 
consular officer in baghdad at the monsourmelia hotel three women 
and two children were released and are expected to leave aboard an 
evacuation flight 
boucher said the other eight have been moved from the hotel to 
an undisclosed location 
late last week the state department estimated there were nearly 
90 americans detained by the iraqis the new estimate of 
approximately 80 partly reflects the women and children who had 
been held at the baghdad hotel but who have since been released 
the new figures indicate that the iraqis are having a difficult 
time tracking down additional americans despite what the state 
department describes as an intensified iraqi effort to locate them 
boucher said miles hoffman an american who was shot last week 
while trying to evade capture was seen tuesday by the head of the 
us embassy in iraq joseph wilson 
hoffman described as a financial analyst from columbus ga 
subsequently was taken to an undisclosed location us officials 
here and in baghdad have demanded hoffman be allowed to leave the 
country the spokesman said 
hoffman 33 has a shattered bone in his left forearm boucher

as a trade school owner tommy wayne downs 
went as far as accompanying a prospective student to a pawn shop to 
get money for a tuition down payment the jailed man told a senate 
panel 
in testimony before a senate governmental affairs subcommittee 
downs said wednesday that he saw unscrupulous trade schools use a 
variety of tactics approved and even encouraged by the schools 
owners and local management to lure poor students to often 
inadequate training programs 
in the proprietary school business what you sell is basically 
one thing you sell dreams and so 99 percent of my sales were made 
in the poor black areas of nashville said downs at various 
times a recruiter financial aid officer and owner of trade schools 
in tennessee and pennsylvania 
he is now serving a prison sentence for fraudulent acts 
committed in connection with the federally guaranteed student loan 
program 
the senates permanent subcommittee on investigations was 
scheduled to continue today its twoday hearing on trade school 
practices 
downs said also that he made down payments for prospective 
students and was reimbursed from financial aid proceeds 
he criticized loan guarantors noting the financially troubled 
higher education assistance foundation was a school ownerss 
dream and a source of almost instant money 
in addition downs charged that the private agencies charged 
with licensing and overseeing activities at trade and vocational 
schools seldom make onsite inspections and are so lax in 
monitoring that many institutions change owners several times 
without notifying appropriate officials 
while previous subcommittee hearings questioned trade school 
recruitment practices the latest sessions focus on flaws in 
regulating the institutions 
the subcommittee chairman sen sam nunn dga released a 
general accounting office report that concluded the system by 
which proprietary schools gain entry and retain access to federal 
guaranteed student loans is seriously flawed and needs to be 
fixed 
trade school students account for only 22 percent of guaranteed 
student loan recipients but more than 44 percent of the defaults 
since 1985 student loan default costs have almost doubled to reach 
the present 2 billion a year 
until comprehensive remedial actions are undertaken we are 
likely to continue to face the twin problems of hundreds of 
millions of dollars in losses and thousands of students from 
already disadvantaged backgrounds being set back farther in their 
quest to become successful contributing members of society said 
the gao report 
the report said there are about 100 major national accrediting 
agencies recognized by education secretary lauro cavazos however 
only seven accredit the majority of proprietary schools 
to get around the review system gao staff counsel kim wherry 
said trade schools are marketed bought and sold in a system 
very similar to the multiple listing service used in the real 
estate business 
each state may have as many as 50 licensing bodies regulating 
trade and vocational schools each agency issues licenses based on 
its own standards without any recognized uniform minimal standards 
to avoid accreditation problems the report said owners buy an 
accredited school and develop a connection with an unaccredited 
school or owners open a branch campus of the accredited school 
that automatically becomes accredited 
the education department said in a statement that many of 
these problems have been addressed and progress has been made

the united states retook the top position in 
world trade last year but international monetary fund figures 
showed west germany close behind 
and the oct 3 unification of west germany and east germany will 
create an even stronger trade rival for america that could assume 
the no 1 post 
the fund calculated the volume of trade in tons of goods shipped 
rather than their dollar value because officials said dollar 
figures sometimes give a distorted picture of trade because of 
currency fluctuations 
on the basis of volume us exports rose 105 percent last 
year more than in any other major industrial country the imf 
reported the increase gave the united states 135 percent of all 
world trade except in oil which is considered separately that was 
still below the 15 percent level of the 1970s 
west germany was close behind with 13 percent according to the 
funds report for 1990 made public wednesday 
by contrast the share of japanese exports in world trade 
declined from a peak of 115 percent in 1986 to 10 percent in 
1989 the report said 
the united states and other countries have been urging the 
japanese to concentrate on building internal living standards 
since world war ii the japanese have concentrated heavily on 
exports selling much more to the united states than they have 
purchased 
there was broad support for the view that strong emphasis 
should be placed on the bold pursuit of structural policies 
particularly those that would help improve living standards 
improve access to japanese markets and reduce rigidities and 
distortions in the economy and in the financial system the 
report said 
the imfs board of executive directors which represents the 151 
governments that own the fund also had advice for the united 
states the board said americans should 
resist pressures to protect us industry from imports and 
continue to lead efforts for freer world trade 
save more both individually and through the government so 
that exports can grow and capital can pile up for more investment 
in the future 
have the federal reserve system continue to focus on 
controlling inflation since there may still be some pressures that 
push up prices 
make cutting federal spending a priority though some 
countries representatives believed an effort should be made to 
increase federal revenue by closing more tax loopholes

guns drugs and criminals from communist china 
are fueling a crime wave in hong kong and many fear that as chinas 
takeover of 1997 approaches things could get worse 
the society seems to be unraveling said charles chan a 
social worker who battles hong kongs growing gang problem 
before we always used to have a solution but now there isnt 
one 
on tuesday growing rivalry among hong kongs organized crime 
syndicates the triads left six people dead when three armed men 
tossed homemade gasoline bombs into a crowded mahjong game parlor 
setting it ablaze 
police said triads were fighting for protection money from the 
rich view social club and dining hall 
the growing lawlessness is running both ways over the border 
chinese criminals who flee back home have been untouchable for lack 
of an extradition agreement and the hong kong mafia is expanding 
in nearby chinese boomtowns 
only recently has the long arm of the law been catching up 
in the last three weeks four gangs of men at least two from 
mainland china snatched 2 million worth of jewelry and gold 
two of the robberies occurred in hong kongs swanky central 
district famed for the star ferry terminal and soaring glass 
skyscrapers 
in one theft crooks robbed two jewelry stores of 500000 in 
gold and shot their way through the high class area taking a 
16yearold girl hostage and killing a passerby 
armed robberies numbered 245 in first eight months of this year 
compared with 260 during all of last year 
still the colony remains extraordinarily safe for a metropolis 
of 57 million people women walk home alone at night and streets 
are wellpatrolled by police 
but hong kongs crime wave is cresting as its people become 
increasingly skittish about 1997 when communist china resumes 
control of the territory 
china has promised to maintain hong kongs freewheeling economic 
and social system for 50 years after the takeover but in 
interviews law enforcement officials social workers and educators 
painted a grim picture of their hopes for the future 
a marked increase in the use of soft drugs such as 
marijuana and an amphetamine called mandrax which are easily 
smuggled from china is affecting the young 
the influence of the triads is growing possibly fueled by a 
sense of helplessness among hong kongs poorer youth about the 
colonys future 
last year for the first time ever people age 20 or under 
accounted for more than 40 percent of the arrests for all violent 
crimes 
triads have entered the schools in a big way said corina 
yeung a social worker in a rough and tumble housing project near 
hong kongs airport violence aggression and weapons have become 
normal fare for school kids 
china white a potent form of heroin is also increasingly 
being moved overland through china to the colony from southeast 
asias golden triangle where it is produced according to david 
hodson chief of operations of the police departments narcotics 
bureau 
the specter of 1997 troubles the police department reputedly 
one of the worlds finest high turnover and a protracted pay 
dispute caused in part by chinas apparent unwillingness to back 
the department as the law enforcement agency of hong kong after 
1997 is hurting the force officers say 
changes in china add to the havoc 
beijings decade of economic reform have produced serious social 
dislocations and corruption especially in hong kongs neighbor 
guangdong province the engine of chinas modernization drive 
hong kongs triads have moved into guangdong and joined local 
criminals pushing drugs prostitution gambling smuggling and 
other social vices law enforcement officials say chinas police 
appear incapable of dealing with the crime boom and in some cases 
might contribute to it 
in may for example two hong kong undercover policemen were 
abducted by chinese security officials who sneaked into hong kong 
waters to smuggle three luxury cars to the mainland the policemen 
were released only after chinas official xinhua news agency 
accused the hong kong government of fabricating the incident the 
chinese officers were apparently not punished 
theres no way we can stop smuggling of guns and drugs said 
one senior inspector in the customs and excise department as he 
watched a chinese speedboat apparently carrying smuggled goods 
outrace his customs launch it seems like out of every four 
chinese officials at least one is corrupt 
connections between hong kongs triads and chinese gangs have 
grown to the point where triads are bringing illegal chinese 
immigrants into the territory to commit crimes the crooks then 
sneak back across the territorys porous border after breaking the 
law police say 
since china does not have an extradition agreement with hong 
kong this method is safe as long as beijing declines to help the 
colony fight crime 
but that help may have begun 
chinese authorities in canton last week arrested two men wanted 
in connection with one of the four recent heists hong kongs 
governor sir david wilson said china is committed to stemming the 
growing gunsmuggling trade 
and china recently outlawed the use of cigarette boats the 
centerpiece of smuggling 
the cooperation is just starting said one senior inspector 
lets hope for hong kongs sake it continues

when eve huttons father was beaten 
nearly to death a butte county sheriffs deputy told her to hire a 
private investigator 
the county he said sadly was simply too poor to investigate 
for hutton and the 185000 others in this colorful rugged 
northern california county buttes slide toward bankruptcy has 
meant fewer firefighters fewer patrol officers longer delays at 
county offices closed libraries and a deepening perception that 
their county is finally going under 
there was only one deputy sheriff to patrol 30000 people and 
he told me there was not enough manpower to investigate this crime 
as it should be investigated said hutton whose father a real 
estate broker remains hospitalized from an attack by eight men 
while he inspected property 
thats what its come down to they dont even have enough 
people to investigate attempted murder 
local authorities unable to come up with 15 million needed to 
balance their 155 million budget say they will decide within two 
weeks whether butte will be the first county in the nation to 
declare bankruptcy 
the tax base in mostly agricultural butte is buckling under a 
big welfare caseload 60 percent above the per capita state 
average and a large retirement community in june voters 
rejected several tax increases 
the lack of revenue has meant the elimination of 23 jobs at the 
sheriffs department and the parttime operation of libraries with 
volunteers because of a fouryear freeze on county salaries 15 
workers in buttes welfare department qualify for benefits 
themselves 
nobody is really sure what this bankruptcy will do said 
james souci he said the county offered him and his neighbors 
equipment to form a volunteer firefighting unit if they would agree 
to maintain it they said they just didnt have the money he 
said 
if the county actually filed for bankruptcy a federal judge in 
sacramento would most likely protect butte from its creditors 
appoint a fiscal trustee and set up a priority list of who gets 
paid what 
but since a county has never filed for bankruptcy before 
there are a whole lot of gray zones here we really dont know 
exactly what would happen said spokeswoman christina cutshaw of 
the state county supervisors association 
despite its relatively small size butte county has been 
accustomed over the years to the glare of state and national 
attention the 1938 movie classic the adventures of robin hood 
was filmed in chico and a year later the twelve oaks barbecue in 
gone with the wind was filmed at a butte estate 
the media focus has not been so benign in the past decade 
in one case two white hunters were convicted of murdering a 
black man after they couldnt find a deer in another a 
selfstyled nazi was convicted of killing one of his followers and 
the oroville city council considered and ultimately rejected an 
ordinance requiring people to keep a gun at home 
playboy once ranked california state university at chico as the 
nations no 1 party school earlier this year hundreds of 
beerdrinking students went on a weekend rampage there 
buttes fiscal problems stem from costly welfare and health care 
programs county authorities say and the states failure to kick 
in money almost 90 percent of our budget is committed to 
mandatory programs said supervisor jane dolan 
authorities also say more poor people are coming in from the 
cities swelling the welfare rolls 
butte ranks last among the states 58 counties in the amount 
spent per capita on local government the maintenance budget has 
been reduced to a level that provides money to resurface the 
average county road once every 28 years 
gov george deukmejian suggests the county has failed to manage 
its money properly assembly speaker willie brown noted that butte 
recently voted down tax increases to finance among other things 
firefighting improvements 
deukmejian has offered to cover about half the shortfall some 
8 million if butte makes up the rest by such measures as cutting 
workers and benefits and freezing pay on tuesday butte rejected 
the cuts and asked for more money

bountiful corn and wheat harvests are 
restoring some muscle to the nations granary agriculture 
department analysts say 
although that will help dampen some of the food price runup 
expected next year because of the persian gulf crisis and higher 
energy costs the bumper yields will mean lower commodity prices 
for farmers 
the departments agricultural statistics board said wednesday 
that corn production is expected to rise to a fouryear high of 
812 billion bushels up 8 percent from last years crop and 3 
percent more than forecast a month ago 
last years corn harvest was 753 billion bushels and the 
department in its initial forecast on aug 9 put this falls 
harvest at 785 billion bushels 
abovenormal temperatures the last of august accelerated 
development of the corn crop but it still lagged behind normal 
in most of the major producing states said the agricultural 
statistics board 
by sept 2 only about 7 percent of the corn acreage was mature 
19 percentage points behind normal although harvest had begun as 
far north as kentucky 
globally the boost in us corn prospects helped improve the 
world outlook for coarse grains despite some decline in foreign 
production corn yields in france and the southern countries of 
eastern europe have been hurt by continued hot dry weather 
the september estimate of 812 billion bushels would be the 
largest corn output since 823 billion bushels were harvested in 
1986 
based on early september surveys corn yields were estimated at 
a record 1217 bushels per acre harvested compared with 1162 last 
year and 1177 indicated last month the old record was 1194 
bushels in 1987 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat poultry and 
dairy products 
consumer food prices which rose an average of 58 percent in 
1989 the sharpest yeartoyear increase since 1981 are expected 
to climb an additional 5 percent to 7 percent this year 
the huge corn harvest along with bumper wheat yields will help 
cushion against sharp food price increases in 1991 
production of soybeans a source of highprotein meal and 
vegetable oil was estimated at 183 billion bushels down 5 
percent from last years harvest of 193 billion bushels and 
virtually unchanged from the august estimate 
cotton production was indicated at 147 million bales up 21 
percent from last years output of 122 million bales but down 1 
percent from the august forecast 
the september report showed total 1990 wheat production at 276 
billion bushels up 35 percent from the 1989 harvest and up 2 
percent from last months projection average yields at 394 
bushels per acre equal the record high of 1983 
usdas allcrops production index was reported at 112 percent of 
its 1977 average used for comparison that is the highest reading 
since the index averaged 116 percent in 1985 
last year although crop production rebounded sharply from the 
91 percent of the 1988 drought total output still averaged only 
106 percent the record was 117 percent in 1981 and 1982 
in a related report on supply and demand for major commodities 
analysts said total corn use in the 199091 marketing year that 
began sept 1 is expected to be about 8075 billion bushels 
including domestic and export requirements 
with demand slightly exceeding 1990 corn production that will 
mean a small increase in us corn stockpiles to about 1375 
billion bushels left over by sept 1 1991 
a month ago with a smaller harvest expected analysts expected 
the corn stockpile to decline in the coming year 
despite the modest upturn the stockpile is a sharp turnaround 
from last seasons decline when it plummeted from 426 billion 
bushels on sept 1 1988 to 193 billion bushels on hand last sept 
1 
the report said us corn prices may average in the range of 
210 to 250 per bushel in the 199091 marketing year down 25 
cents from the august projection corn prices at the farm averaged 
about 238 per bushel last season 
with largerthanexpected wheat production the stockpile at the 
end of the 199091 marketing year next june is expected to be 946 
million bushels 100 million bushels more than forecast in august 
and almost double the 535 million bushels carried over this june 1 
as a result of the larger wheat supply prices at the farm are 
expected to decline to an average of 255 to 285 per bushel this 
marketing year from 372 in 198990 
soybean prices at the farm were forecast at 550 to 7 per 
bushel in 199091 compared with 570 the past marketing year 
that was unchanged from the august forecast 
other 1990 crop estimates based on sept 1 indications compared 
with 1989 output included 
sorghum 5724 million bushels and an average yield of 618 
bushels per acre compared with 6179 million and 554 in 1989 
rice 159 million hundredweight and a yield of 5641 pounds per 
acre compared with 1545 million and 5749 
peanuts 356 billion pounds and a yield of 2043 pounds per 
acre compared with 399 billion and 2426 
tobacco 155 billion pounds and a yield of 2127 pounds per 
acre compared with 137 billion and 2016 
sugar beets 273 million tons and a yield of 199 tons per 
acre compared with 251 million and 194 
sugar cane 247 million tons and a yield of 349 tons per 
acre compared with 294 million and 345

former national security adviser john m 
poindexter tried unsuccessfully to have the appeal of his 
irancontra convictions heard by the same judges who set aside 
guilty verdicts against oliver l north 
but the threejudge panel that heard norths case this week 
refused to assign itself poindexters appeal the case will be 
heard by another panel of the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia 
poindexter a retired navy rear admiral was found guilty april 
7 of five counts of lying to congress about covert military 
assistance to the nicaraguan contra rebels and the sale of us 
arms to iran 
he was sentenced to six months in prison on june 11 but is free 
pending appeal 
norths three felony convictions were set aside july 20 on a 21 
vote by the appeals court panel the former national security 
council aide had been fined 150000 and ordered to perform 1200 
hours of community service 
the panel over the vigorous dissent of chief judge patricia 
wald held that testimony north gave congress under a limited grant 
of immunity from prosecution may have seeped into his trial 
it ordered a witness by witness review of the testimony in 
norths trial to determine if it was influenced by what north told 
congress during televised hearings on the irancontra affair 
poindexter also testified before congress under the same 
immunity grant which prohibits prosecutors from using what he told 
lawmakers as evidence against him 
on aug 12 defense lawyers asked the appeals court to assign 
poindexters case to the panel in the north case which included 
circuit judges laurence silberman and david sentelle along with 
wald 
poindexters appeal should be heard by the same panel the 
lawyers argued because it raises the identical issue based upon 
identical facts 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh opposed what he called 
poindexters undisguised attempt to select the judges who decided 
adversely to the government in us v north 
in a brief order issued tuesday the panel denied poindexters 
request saying it had been filed after the july 23 deadline for 
procedural motions in the case 
silberman and sentelle who voted to set aside norths 
convictions were appointed by president reagan wald a member of 
the courts liberal wing was appointed by president carter 
on sept 6 the panel ordered norths lawyers to file a brief by 
sept 26 explaining why it shouldnt rehear the case 
walsh sought rehearing of the north case he argued that 
dismissal of the conviction resulted from a plain misreading of 
the record and disputed the panels finding that inadequate 
safeguards were taken to screen out references to norths 
congressional testimony

a bill heading toward senate floor action 
would require the national endowment for the arts to recoup federal 
funds from grant recipients convicted of violating obscenity laws 
the measure approved wednesday on a 151 vote by the senate 
labor and human resources committee also would extend the 
embattled neas life for five years with 175 million in spending 
authority in the first fiscal year starting oct 1 
arts supporters predicted that the bills broad support by 
committee liberals and conservatives including sens edward m 
kennedy dmass and orrin hatch rutah would boost its chances 
of approval by the full senate 
amid a bitter political controversy over the neas past support 
for works that conservative critics have denounced as obscene and 
sacrilegious the senate panel voted to have the courts rather 
than the federal arts agency decide which works are obscene 
under the bill nea grant recipients convicted on criminal 
charges of violating obscenity or child pornography laws would have 
to return their federal grant money to the arts endowment within 90 
days they would be barred from receiving new nea grants for at 
least three years 
hatch said the bill would solve the problem of protecting 
taxpayer funds and artists freedom of expression at the same 
time kennedy hailed the committees rejection of harsher 
antiobscenity curbs on the endowment 
on a 142 vote the committee defeated a proposal by sen dan 
coats rind that would have imposed strict guidelines on nea 
panels that select grant applications for approval 
coats amendment would have forbidden support for works that 
violate the supreme courts obscenity standards or child 
pornography laws and make religious attacks kennedy said it 
represented unconstitutional prior restraint on artists 
the neas statutory authority expires sept 30 along with a 
congressional ban enacted last fall at the urging of sen jesse 
helms rnc that prohibits the endowment from subsidizing works 
that may be considered obscene 
house legislation to extend the neas life is bogged down in 
wrangling over proposals for new antiobscenity limitations on the 
kinds of art eligible for endowment support and for shifting the 
bulk of federal grant money to the control of state arts agencies 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash has refused to hint when 
he might bring the nea bill to the house floor for debate 
there is speculation that congress might duck the politically 
explosive obscenity issue by giving the nea a simple oneyear 
extension and postponing a floor fight until after the november 
elections

house democrats are shrugging off a warning 
from president bush that he wont sign an anticrime bill if it 
reaches his desk without stronger death penalty provisions and 
other features to aid police 
its just unfortunate that once again we have seen a crime 
bill disintegrate into partisan posturing rep william j 
hughes dnj said wednesday as the measure moved toward house 
floor action 
hughes a chief sponsor said criticism of the measure by bush 
and attorney general dick thornburgh was a sign that it was the 
political season and theres going to be a certain amount of 
posturing 
bush suggested earlier that the bill could do more harm than 
good i simply will not accept anything that rolls back the clock 
on americas ability to fight crime and punish wrongdoers he 
said 
house debate could begin as early as friday on the measure 
which differs sharply from a version already approved by the senate 
the house bill calls for the death penalty for 10 categories of 
crimes ranging from assassination of the president to treason 
capital punishment could be imposed for more than 30 specific 
crimes under the senate version 
the administration says the house version does not include 
enough offenses it also says capital punishment would effectively 
be ended in america by a provision that would allow appeals based 
on racial statistics 
convicts would have no more than one year after the failure of 
their direct appeals to file habeas corpus appeals claiming their 
constitutional rights were violated 
sponsors say the time limit is designed to end delays of 12 
years or more in carrying out death sentences 
the administration favors a similar plan but says the house 
version would actually open the door to more delays administration 
officials also criticize the bill for not allowing warrantless 
searches if police act in good faith 
in addition the bill contains a smorgasbord of provisions 
ranging from scholarships for police officers to a ban on 
sportsbased state lotteries missing however is anything that 
would curb semiautomatic assault weapons 
gun control advocates have been hoping to attach such 
restrictions when the bill reaches the floor if they are not 
allowed to at least try the house is expected to take up the 
assault gun issue as a separate measure as soon as it finishes with 
the anticrime package 
bush on wednesday did not use the word veto but said legislation 
similar to what the house is considering would not get his 
signature 
the bottom line is really this i will not sign a crime bill 
that handcuffs the police bush told a rose garden gathering of 
prosecutors visiting washington to lobby against the house bill 
he said for the past two weeks america has been gripped by 
chilling headlines that tell of kids going back to school in 
bulletproof coats 
he recalled how a visiting utah man a kid really sports 
lover was killed while defending his mother from a new york 
subway gang said to be after pocket money so they could go 
dancing 
the american people really are fed up bush said and 
i urge the congress to heed the voices of our people our police 
and our prosecutors and send me a crime bill that will help take 
back the streets

fortyseven members of congress many of them 
locked in tough reelection battles are proposing to make gasoline 
price gouging a crime punishable with jail time and a 500000 fine 
coauthored by sen joseph lieberman dconn the proposal would 
enable the president to stop oil companies from using military 
emergencies to gouge consumers at the gas pump the measure was 
unveiled wednesday at a capitol hill news conference those 
supporting it include sen paul simon dill and sen claiborne 
pell dri 
the measure would grant the attorney general authority to 
investigate cases of alleged price gouging in addition the 
federal government would have the power to seize any illegally 
obtained profits from oil companies 
the american petroleum institute said the proposal was a thinly 
disguised effort to revive the price controls of the 1970s that led 
to long lines at gas stations 
one candidate involved in a hotly contested reelection fight 
sen tom harkin diowa promised to amend the bill and make its 
provisions retroactive to the current mideast crisis 
our oil reserves are the highest theyve been in nine years 
said simon who faces a tough reelection fight against rep lynn

like the schoolteacher she once was 
audrey stubbart at 95 still pounces on errors and drills others 
on grammar 
she works as a newsroom proofreader a job fast disappearing 
from journalism as editors rely more and more on computers 
this is such a fascinating job that i dont see how anyone 
gets old enough to want to quit said the former homesteader who 
once taught in a oneroom schoolhouse 
for nearly 29 years mrs stubbart has been the fulltime 
proofreader at the independence examiner 
we want every story to be read by two editors said the 
16500circulation papers managing editor sheila davis audrey 
is the second catch she doesnt usually edit for content but she 
does catch things 
when she does she frowns slightly and gets up from her 
computerequipped desk in the office fray 
we need to take the apostrophe s out of this headline she 
told a young employee recently 
im just a cranky faultfinding old maid she then said 
sitting back down and turning the frown into a smile i hate to 
see a mistake get in 
davis said mrs stubbart isnt cranky at all even when she 
hears blue newsroom language 
shes a very prim and proper lady and newsrooms are not 
always prim and proper davis said shes gotten an earful 
occasionally but shes never gotten upset about it 
adjusting to her environment is nothing new for mrs stubbart 
in 1916 she and her husband john took two children to the wyoming 
frontier and drove in four stakes claiming 320 acres previously 
occupied by buffalo and coyotes 
i cannot recall anything but happiness that we were going to 
have a home of our own she said 
three more children came along mrs stubbart taught in a 
oneroom schoolhouse and their cattle and sheep farm expanded to 
2100 acres her close family life and love of books helped pass 
insufferably cold winters 
the stubbarts sold the farm in 1944 and moved to independence to 
be closer to relatives mrs stubbart a widow for 25 years worked 
nearly two decades as a proofreader at a publishing house before 
reaching mandatory retirement age 
most companies printing or anything else would say you 
cant do a full days work at your age and they would not let me 
prove i could she said 
but the examiner seeking a temporary replacement at the 
proofreaders desk let mrs stubbart sit in 
they said well use her three months and then get someone 
else mrs stubbart recalled but ive been here almost 29 
years and theyve never even tried to hire anybody else 
she enjoys teaching young reporters so far as i know they 
all accept it very graciously she said i dont try to 
criticize i just try to correct 
davis said mrs stubbart pushes for grammatical constructions 
more formal than the conversational style modern journalists use 
she will argue her point and argue very strenuously davis 
said sometimes i say yeah audrey youre right but im going 
to let the reporter get away with it 
in recent years shes written a weekly column in the examiner 
i dont feel old and thats why i believe they let me stay 
she said it is a caring community they are such precious 
people this is my past present and future

the el rattles and rumbles over frankford 
avenue and dingy bars like kennys saloon the happy tap and the 
beefhouse tavern 
from their dim interiors may emerge clues to a string of eight 
similar fatal stabbings over the past five years that has 
detectives working overtime and residents doing their own armchair 
or barstool sleuthing 
coincidence copycat serial killer 
they say he only kills women who go to bars but you dont 
want to rely on the consistency of a psychopath said jillian 
bailey 23 as she read the newspaper one morning this week on her 
front porch on arrott street 
two doors up the street unmarked police cars were parked on the 
sidewalk outside a fourstory brick apartment building where the 
latest victim lived detectives carried plastic bags of items from 
the apartment of michelle martin 30 whose body was found saturday 
in her apartment 
like the seven other victims the woman known by some as crazy 
michelle was a white barfly who was stabbed numerous times and 
found partially clothed all eight slayings were in the citys 
frankford section 
weve had sleepless nights homicide lt james ferguson said 
as he came out of an alley holding a flashlight were working 
around the clock any leads any clues were following up 
the night before police commissioner willie l williams had 
announced were not looking at it as a serial killer 
bailey retorted what is it a fad 
if its not one guy then this is the sickest neighborhood in 
the country she said 
police have a good reason not to attribute all eight deaths to a 
serial killer they arrested a local fishstore worker leonard 
christopher 38 in the april slaying of 46yearold carol dowd 
christopher has been in jail since so obviously he didnt kill 
martin 
they got this guy at the fish store and everyone said hes 
such a nice guy said mary trainer 74 who has lived in the area 
for more than 40 years and in the same apartment building as martin 
for two years 
so now this and everyone is saying maybe they got the wrong 
guy or maybe theres more than one 
police released a sketch of the person last seen with martin a 
grayhaired beerbellied bespectacled man of about 60 
six of the victims were between 46 and 74 years old the others 
were 29 and 30 but looked older williams said the commissioner 
said information was being compiled so the fbi can come up with a 
psychological profile of the killer or killers 
are people scared yeah said the barmaid at the jolly post 
tavern where one victim theresa sciortino last was seen alive in 
january 1989 
its like watching a tv show said the barmaid who wouldnt 
give her name you wonder what this guy is thinking i dont know 
maybe he had a thing about his mother and he looks for women like 
her 
dee a 30something woman sipped a beer in the jolly post 
and speculated the women all seem to have emotional problems 
but its still scary she said maybe he thinks hes putting 
them out of their misery 
philadelphias frankford neighborhood is a mix of white and 
black with some asians and hispanics welltended houses beside 
rundown apartment buildings 
the neighborhood becomes more residential leafy and pleasant 
west of frankford avenue the avenue is loud busy and lined with 
hoagie shops and stores many with the words discount thrift and 
bargain in their names 
its spotty two blocks this way toward the avenue i 
wouldnt go after dark bailey said this way toward the 
boulevard its fine 
if this were a more affluent neighborhood they would have 
found the person by now she said there seems to be a thing of 
blame the victim here shes a crazy barfly thats why she was 
murdered

abortionrights activists acknowledge it 
wont be easy overturning the legislatures speedy passage of a 
vetoproof bill requiring girls under 18 to get a parents consent 
for an abortion 
wednesdays action was the second major victory for 
antiabortion forces in michigan in as many years in 1988 voters 
overwhelmingly approved a ban on statefunded abortions for the 
poor 
the final vote barely had been counted before abortionrights 
leaders were talking about trying to repeal the measure or blunt 
its impact 
the fund for the feminist majority planned to announce today an 
emergency campaign against it liberal democratic activist zolton 
ferency already has a legal challenge pending in state court 
howard simon executive director of the american civil liberties 
union of michigan said his group also may sue weve got to use 
all available legal challenges to protect civil rights including 
reproductive rights he said 
simon said the measure has serious predictable social 
consequences among them more teenage suicides and pregnancies 
more delayed abortions more teenage mothers on welfare and more 
low birthweight babies 
the measure requires unmarried girls 17 and younger to have 
permission from a parent or a judge to get an abortion it will 
become law around april 1 90 days after the legislative session 
ends in december 
the legislature approved an identical bill earlier this year 
but democratic gov james blanchard vetoed it right to life of 
michigan then gathered about 330000 signatures to put it back 
before the legislature which took less than five hours to approve 
it wednesday the senate approved it 289 and the house 6140 
because the bill began with a petition drive blanchard under 
the state constitution cant veto it 
barbara listing president of right to life of michigan said 
the bill would encourage sexually active teenagers to use birth 
control girls who do get pregnant will be able to get guidance 
from their families in deciding what to do she said 
one of the measures strongest senate backers republican fred 
dillingham said the parental rights in this doesnt prevent 
abortion parental rights simply allow parents to guide their 
children through a very traumatic time 
states that enforce parental consent or notification laws are 
alabama arkansas indiana louisiana massachusetts minnesota 
missouri north dakota ohio rhode island south carolina utah 
west virginia and wyoming 
parental consent bills are pending in several other states

perus new president says washington can keep 
the millions in military aid its offering to step up the war on 
cocaine trafficking he wants cash to get farmers to stop growing 
coca and for highway construction so alternate crops can make it to 
market 
because the aid package is destined only for the fight against 
drug trafficking we are not going to sign this agreement 
president alberto fujimori said wednesday night 
his statement appeared to torpedo any hope his 6weekold 
government will accept the 359 million in military aid washington 
is offering this year to fight the cocaine trade 
peru could use the money the country is reeling from the 
effects of tough austerity measures aimed at curbing 3000 percent 
annual inflation 
the government is also battling a 10yearold insurgency by 
maoistinspired rebels who have allied themselves with cocaine 
traffickers in return for money and arms 
fujimori has warned on several occasions that he would not sign 
the military aid agreement with the united states unless it 
included economic aid to wean farmers away from growing coca from 
which cocaine is produced 
he has also said peru needs help in developing alternative crops 
and in building a paved highway from regions where coca is now king 
so the produce can reach coastal markets 
the rejected us aid package was to finance the construction of 
a training base near the cocarich upper huallaga valley it also 
included 20 million to build a training camp and provide weapons 
and equipment for peruvian soldiers 
the upper huallaga is the worlds main supplier of coca leaf 
the raw material for cocaine more than 1000 shining path 
guerrillas are estimated to operate in the valley a jungle region 
250 miles northeast of lima 
many peruvian politicians had expressed fear that the aid 
package could lead to direct us participation in a guerrilla war 
that has claimed nearly 20000 lives 
the us drug enforcement administration already operates an 
antidrug base in the huallaga valley with peruvian police the 
shining path attacked the base in april and engaged us pilots in 
a shootout no casualties were reported 
on wednesday us ambassador anthony quaynton did sign two 
agreements for 400000 with the interior minister gen adolfo 
alvarado 
the agreements will provide vehicles and motorcycles for the 
police to help combat drug trafficking and they appear to represent 
the continuation of us antidrug aid to the police 
however washington has as yet been unable to get the army 
involved in the drug war and through it assume an increased role 
in the guerrilla war 
the larger aid package would have involved the army which is 
more worried about defeating the shining path than with controlling 
perus annual 1 billion cocaine trade 
the military was interested in the aid to fight guerrillas but 
did not wish to tie it to the antidrug fight it questioned the 
wording of the proposed agreement which directly linked any aid to 
controlling the cocaine trade 
washingtons aid package was originally presented to fujimoris 
predecessor alan garcia who insisted it be accompanied by 
economic aid 
the bush administration had planned the aid package for the 1990 
fiscal year which concludes at the end of september ambassador 
quaynton said in an interview with newsmagazine caretas this week 
that if peru does not sign the agreement the aid would go to 
other countries 
fujimori who was sworn in on july 28 inherited a moribund 
economy and a massive government deficit generated by the 
freespending government of garcia 
he has called off plans to travel to the united states at the 
end of september for talks with un secretary general javier perez 
de cuellar according to the state news agency andina 
fujimori said his presence is important at this time while 
the economic stabilization program is in full flow 
andina had previously quoted quaynton as hinting that fujimori 
might also meet with president bush

the chemical weapons suits the us 
troops brought from home are so heavy and unbearable in the 
sweltering desert that the marines have replaced them with a 
lighterweight britishmade model 
the original suits will be put in storage until the troops 
return home a spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
a spokesman said he did not know the overall cost of buying the 
new suits and stateoftheart gas masks 
the gear which cannot be bought in retail stores was developed 
by british aerospace at the request of britains ministry of 
defense 
each suit cost about 210 and each mask about 140 about 40000 
marines have been sent to saudi arabia since iraq invaded 
neighboring kuwait on aug 2 
philip congdon a chemical weapons consultant to british 
aerospace said the suits are known to be the best in the world 
the american suits have foam backing which makes them 
particularly warm for the desert 
the britishmade camouflage coveralls are made of modacrylic a 
synthetic fiber that allows chemicals to be dispersed and forces 
them to glide over the fabric 
this is 100 percent protection against anything uncle saddam 
may throw at us congdon said referring to iraqi president 
saddam hussein 
the gas masks are more advanced than the american variety 
because they have a straw inside that can be rotated to fit the 
mouth a water bottle is attached to the outside 
however even the lighter and more maneuverable britishmade 
chemical weapons suit is brutal in the heat congdon said 
the secret to using a chemical suit is acclimatization he said 
first the person wearing it must drink 2 pints of water an hour 
congdon suggests working up to a routine of wearing the suit for 
three to four hours a day 
army spokesman barry napp said the army had no plans to outfit 
its soldiers with the new suits

ouster and said he will fight a charge of lying to a panel

testimony were not released 
lemaire was fired in 1989 about two weeks after he killed an 
unarmed man he was ordered reinstated in july by an administrative 
law judge who ruled his firing unjustified he did not rejoin the

the warsaw pact was on the verge of 
invading in 1980 to crush solidarity but reconsidered after gen 
wojciech jaruzelski convinced its leaders that some polish troops 
would resist a retired czechoslovak general says 
gen stanislav prochazka was quoted wednesday as saying that 
jaruzelski who was defense minister at the time and imposed 
martial law a year later as polands communist leader had averted 
widespread bloodshed 
i know how gen jaruzelski is criticized in poland for 
implementing martial law but it is a fact that then in 1980 he 
prevented a massacre prochazka was quoted as saying in an 
article in the weekly newspaper polityka headlined we were 
already in the tanks 
prochazka is a military adviser to czechoslovakias new 
noncommunist government involved in efforts to democratize the 
army although he did not participate in the 1980 preparations 
prochazka said he obtained his information from reports now 
accessible to him 
prochazka had retired after opposing the 1968 warsaw pact 
invasion of czechoslovakia that suppressed the prague spring reform 
movement 
in august 1980 a nationwide strike wave forced polands 
communist authorities to allow workers the right to form 
solidarity the first independent labor federation in the soviet 
bloc 
the strikes toppled thencommunist leader edward gierek and 
aroused fears among the kremlin leaders headed by leonid brezhnev 
prochazka said the sovietled warsaw pact military alliance 
prepared its invasion plans in earnest in november 1980 
soldiers were told that poland needs international help 
because solidarity seriously threatens socialism he said the 
soldiers were prepared mentally and physically for possible 
fighting they were told that they could expect military resistance 
from the polish army 
troops were moved into attack positions in early december but 
the invasion plans were suddenly called off on dec 5 after a 
meeting of warsaw pact leaders in moscow he told polityka 
prochazka credited jaruzelski with averting a tragic battle 
by convincing other pact leaders that an invasion would mean a high 
price in bloodshed because at least part of the army would likely 
resist 
the date of full military readiness was set for dec 6 
prochazka said 
we were supposed to surround polish military units in their 
barracks completely disabling them from doing anything and 
allowing polish authorities to intern solidarity activists he 
said 
prochazka said everyone was convinced that the intervention 
was inevitable but on dec 5 at 8 pm the troops were ordered 
to lower readiness 
the next day the troops began to withdraw from the border and 
by dec 10 they were back in their barracks he said 
the power struggle between polands communist authorities and 
solidarity continued through 1981 amid recurring soviet threats 
on dec 13 1981 jaruzelski who had been named prime minister 
and communist party leader led the military crackdown that 
suppressed solidarity 
jaruzelski defended his action as a lesser evil implying 
that if the polish army had not acted decisively the result would 
have been a sovietled invasion with much bloodshed 
although banned solidarity survived underground throughout the 
1980s and regained its legal status in april 1989 under a 
powersharing agreement with communist authorities 
solidarity won an overwhelming victory in partially free 
elections in june 1989 and went on to establish the east blocs 
first noncommunist government 
jaruzelski was elected president by parliament in july 1989 but 
has been under pressure to resign

nasa restored a highspeed radio link 
with magellan that will allow a crucial test of the spacecraft on 
saturday and released more pictures of jagged lava flows and giant 
volcanic craters on venus 
engineers wednesday pointed magellans main antenna toward 
earth putting the highspeed communications on line for the first 
time in four weeks and using the link to send home the contents of 
the spacecrafts tape recorder 
they they began analyzing the information for clues to why they 
lost radio contact with the spacecraft for 14 hours starting aug 
16 and for 17 hours starting aug 21 
restoring the highspeed radio link was a key step toward 
letting magellan begin its 744 million mission to make highly 
detailed maps and pictures of venus using radar to penetrate the 
planets thick clouds 
engineers at nasas jet propulsion laboratory had been using a 
secondary magellan antenna to maintain contact with earth 
engineers figured that because the secondary antenna sends out a 
broader beam than the main antenna they would be less likely to 
lose contact with the spacecraft if there were another glitch 
because of the communication problems magellan was to start its 
mapping mission late this month about a month behind schedule 
but if all goes well during a radar test on saturday nasa might 
simply pronounce the mapping under way then said experiment 
representative steve wall the craft is 155 million miles from earth 
the three pictures released wednesday were taken during an aug 
16 radar test just hours before contact with the craft was first 
lost 
one picture shows at least two irregularly shaped craters 
called calderas similar to those atop hawaiis mauna loa and 
kilauea volcanoes the largest is 5 miles long and 22 miles wide 
the calderas were apparently created when lava flowed from vents 
and caused the volcanoes summits to collapse said steve saunders 
the magellan projects chief scientist 
another picture shows a basalt lava flow 11 miles wide and at 
least 15 miles long it has lobed edges is extremely rough and 
probably flowed in a thick pasty manner before it solidified 
saunders said 
a third new picture shows a valley about sixtenths of a mile 
wide that formed when a block of land dropped down between two 
faults as the area was being stretched apart saunders said 
similar faultbounded valleys are found in california east 
africa and germany 
magellan went into orbit around venus last month after traveling 
a looping 948millionmile path since its launch from the shuttle 
atlantis in may 1989

the us agriculture department would be in 
charge of inspecting fish under legislation passed by the senate 
currently less than 12 percent of american seafood undergoes 
some kind of inspection and these programs are designed more for 
grading product than for ensuring safety agriculture committee 
chairman patrick leahy dvt said wednesday shortly before the 
measure was passed 
the leahy bill cosponsored by senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine and sen thad cochran rmiss was opposed by 
senators who believed inspection responsibilities belonged with the 
food and drug administration and the commerce department 
sens ted stevens and frank murkowski both ralaska argued 
that the agriculture department favored the red meat industry and 
could hurt the seafood business 
the usda is the home of the competitors said stevens the 
fishing industry is alaskas largest industry and produces a large 
share of the seafood consumed in the united states 
he also argued that the chemistry involved in checking for 
contamination in fish already is part of fdas expertise and 
differs from the red meat industry which is inspected visually 
leahy said his plan for fish doesnt use visual inspection 
instead the fish safety act is based on the highly praised 
usda national residue program in which usda samples hundreds of 
thousands of meat products testing them for 200 or so harmful 
chemical compounds and other substances he said 
stevens sens edward kennedy dmass and ernest hollings 
dsc offered a substitute bill that would have expanded fda and 
commerce department fish inspection but were voted down 5939 
the bush administration favors the stevenskennedyhollings plan 
and the office of management and budget says it will recommend a 
veto if the agriculture bill passes the house 
in the house three bills have been approved by three committees 
one measure sponsored by rep kika de la garza dtexas 
chairman of the house agriculture committee is similar to the 
leahymitchell bill 
another bill filed by rep john dingell dmich chairman of 
the energy and commerce committee and rep henry waxman dcalif 
has strong provisions for contaminant limits enforcement and 
employee protections it puts the entire program under the fda 
a third bill backed by rep walter jones dnc chairman of 
the merchant marine and fisheries committee splits authority for 
inspection between the commerce department and the fda and phases 
the program in over time

ingredients within limits narrower than allowed for most drugs 
one drug made by two companies showed minor deviations from the 
acceptable limits but posed no health hazard the fda said 
these results should be reassuring to consumers who use 
generic drugs since the drugs that were examined are the kind that 
critics of generics are most likely to claim could cause 
problems dr louis sullivan the health and human services 
secretary said in the fda announcement 
the testing was the final phase of the fdas program to inspect 
the generic drug industry 
the program began last year after federal investigators found 
evidence that some employees in the agencys generic drug division 
had accepted bribes from drug company executives and that some 
companies had cheated on safety tests required for fda approval 
dozens of drugs were removed from the market as a result of the 
investigation and several fda employees and drug company 
executives were convicted on criminal charges 
the 24 narrow therapeutic range drugs are prescribed for 
contraception epilepsy infections high blood pressure and 
asthma much of the concern over the safety of generic drugs 
involved such medications 
the agency tested samples from 429 batches made by 73 companies 
all passed the tests except five batches of aminophylline a 
form of theophylline used to treat asthma these were generic 
versions made by two companies and were found to contain too much 
or too little of a stabilizing ingredient that prevents the drug 
compound from deteriorating 
the fda tested four other companies versions of the drug and 
found they met quality and purity specifications 
the problems that were found do not pose a health danger but 
the five lots were recalled by the two manufacturers westward 
pharmaceuticals of eatontown nj and duramed pharmaceuticals of 
cincinnati the fda said 
duramed also recalled all other lots of aminophylline as a 
precaution the agency said

a roman catholic bishops organization says it 
had asked the bush administration to make sure the trade embargo 
against iraq does not cover essential food and medicine for 
civilians 
the moral justification for our intervention requires that we 
maintain the distinction between the iraqi regime and ordinary and 
vulnerable iraqi citizens said a letter to secretary of state 
james a baker iii from the chairman of the us catholic bishopss 
committee on international policy 
we urge that in the implementation of the embargo and other 
sanctions against iraq the utmost care and sensitivity be exercised 
so that innocent civilians are not deprived of those essentials for 
the maintenance of life ie food and medicines wrote the 
committee chairman archbishop roger m mahony of los angeles 
a united nations sanctions committee could not agree on what 
kind of food aid to allow into iraq and occupied kuwait most of 
the delegates want to allow shipments only to foreigners and 
children while cuba and yemen called for a broader resolution 
allowing in food to all civilians 
bush has said the united states favors humanitarian food and 
medical shipments but has not spelled out what that should mean

american airlines is going to court in an 
effort to reverse a government decision allowing united airlines 
landing priorities at the nations busiest airport 
a scheduling battle between two of the largest us carriers 
intensified wednesday when the federal aviation administration 
announced earlier in the day approval of new scheduling proposed by 
united at chicagos ohare international airport and blamed 
american for causing delays 
faa officials said that some evening flights into chicagos 
ohare international airport will be subject to substantial delays 
over the next two weeks until the new agreement takes effect oct 
1 
they blamed american saying the airline in a new schedule 
pulled out of an operating agreement and increased arrivals at 
chicago during early evening hours 
the approved plan allows united to move some of its flights 
ahead of american flights 
the american suit filed in the us court of appeals in 
washington seeks to overturn the faa decision affecting united 
flights saying it represents unlawful agency favoritism and gives 
united an unfair competitive advantage the faa was given until 
monday to respond to the complaint 
faa officials said the situation was caused when american 
airlines pulled out of an operating agreement announcing it would 
increase arrivals between 7 pm and 830 pm substantially 
exceeding airport capacity 
delays at ohare a major crossroads for flights around the 
country often cause delays at other airports as well 
but the faa said the agreement with united would reduce arrival 
peaks and associated delays at ohare after oct 1 
until then the public can continue to expect substantial 
delays at ohare the faa said

the author of a book about israels spy agency 
whose publication israel is trying to block in the united states 
and canada says agents have threatened his life and are waging a 
smear campaign against him 
judges in new york and toronto have issued temporary restraining 
orders preventing publication of by way of deception a 
devastating insiders portrait of the mossad 
lawyers for the israeli government argue the book could imperil 
mossad agents by blowing their cover 
the book was written by victor ostrovsky a graphic artist who 
says he is a former mossad agent in collaboration with canadian 
journalist claire hoy 
ostrovsky 40 who holds both israeli and canadian citizenship 
said in an interview wednesday that he has accepted that i will 
have to be on the move more or less for the rest of my life 
once this dies down there will always be somebody out there 
to say now lets settle this account 
ostrovsky said two of his former commanders turned up at his 
home in suburban ottawa at night a week ago 
they said that its better for me that i dont write it they 
told me to stop it he said 
he said they first offered to buy him out saying they would pay 
his expenses those of his collaborator and even anticipated 
profits 
they said money was no object they said it was for my own 
good and the good of my family said ostrovsky who has a wife 
and two daughters 
in new york st martins press said justice michael dontzin of 
the new york state supreme court signed an order wednesday in his 
home after he heard oral argument by lawyers but without any 
testimony of witnesses or formal legal papers 
in toronto stoddart publishing co ltd was similarly blocked 
by an ontario court 
this is coming from the israeli prime ministers office 
said stoddart spokesman angel guerra the injunction was passed 
in canada and the judge did not read the book there is no copy of 
the book to read 
the canadian restraining order is until monday when a court 
hearing is scheduled 
ostrovsky says he decided to write the book because he was 
disillusioned with the mossad and its tactics 
he says the gag order from the courts prevents him from 
discussing the contents of the book or his mossad activities but 
he said if this book is all lies let it come out then sue me 
ostrovsky who was born in edmonton alberta and raised in 
israel by his grandparents said the mossad agents who visited his 
home told him others also would be after him such as the palestine 
liberation organization which would suspect he had information of 
interest to them 
he said right after the departure of the agents he packed a bag 
and headed for toronto the royal canadian mounted police the 
canadian federal police force refuse to give him protection 
guerra the spokesman for stoddart said the publishers thought 
the israelis would deny deny deny say he is a liar that the 
material never took place 
he said the court papers filed by lawyers for israel assert the 
book contains information that could have dire consequences to 
people and to other nations they are telling us it is true

the state of florida water 
managers and sugar industry executives have agreed on a 120 
million plan backed by environmentalists to clean up the everglades 
and lake okeechobee 
whether the plan agreed to on tuesday will be enough to get 
the us government to drop a pollution lawsuit against the state 
and the south florida water management district remained an open 
question 
the water districts governing board was to hold a final vote on 
the plan today 
it involves buying up 70000 acres of privately owned farmland 
and converting it into marshes and reservoirs that would naturally 
filter polluted farm wastewater before it reached the everglades 
the state would throw in an additional 3800 acres of stateowned 
farmland to be converted as well 
the state the water district and sugar growers would each put 
up 40 million 
the industrys share would be raised over 10 years by a tax of 
10 an acre on growers in the everglades the tax needs the 
approval of the everglades agricultural area which is dominated by 
big growers 
water managers have been developing the cleanup plan for the 
past year under the gun of a federal lawsuit accusing district and 
state officials of letting agricultural drainage primarily from 
sugar cane fields damage the arthur r marshall loxahatchee 
national wildlife refuge and everglades national park the lawsuit 
is scheduled for trial next year 
justice department spokeswoman amy casner in washington said 
wednesday that officials hadnt seen the plan and had no immediate 
comment on whether it meets federal requirements to drop the 
lawsuit 
the plan would quadruple the everglades cleanup area that was 
previously under consideration the idea of the expanded cleansing 
marsh won widespread support after charles lee florida audubon 
society vice president broached it in august 
water flowing south from farm fields would be cleaned by running 
it through the marshes where plants would absorb excess phosphorus 
blamed for upsetting the everglades ecosystem

arco alaska inc and its parent 
atlantic richfield co have agreed to pay alaska about 285 
million to settle their part in a lawsuit accusing oil companies of 
cheating the state of 902 million in royalties 
gov steve cowper said wednesday the state is continuing its 
case against the nine or 10 other defendants the case is set for 
trial in about a year 
the agreement is part of what became known as the amerada hess 
case after the first company on an alphabetical list of 
defendants the amerada hess company paid alaska 310000 last year 
to settle its part in the suit 
alaska officials contend the state was shorted 902 million in 
royalties for oil from the prudhoe bay and kuparuk river fields 
between 1977 and 1986 
the state said the oil companies often undervalued their north 
slope crude production thereby paying the state less than it 
should have received 
the reason the case was settled was that it was clear to arco 
that the states case was in good shape the governor said we 
do have ongoing negotiations with other companies 
the agreement also provides a method for calculating future oil 
royalties on most of the companys current north slope leases arco 
said

chinese authorities have executed more than 500 
people this year in the most severe crackdown on crime since 1983 
amnesty international said in a report released today 
the londonbased human rights group said some people were put to 
death within two weeks of their arrest 
amnesty said 1100 people are known to have been sentenced to 
death in the last 12 months but it said the actual figure of those 
put to death is undoubtedly much higher 
the organization says its records indicated that about 30 pople 
involved in prodemocracy agitation have been executed since 
january in june 1989 authorities crushed a prodemocracy movement 
that attracked hundreds of thousands of people to central beijing 
for demonstrations 
chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said today she 
could not confirm or deny amnestys figures on executions 
on the question of human rights there are always differing 
interpretations ms li said some organizations like amnesty 
international have always tried to interfere in chinas internal 
affairs on the human rights account those slanders and attacks 
against china are totally groundless 
amnesty which opposes the death penalty appealed earlier this 
month to chinese prime minister li peng to suspend the executions 
the amnesty report says almost all those sentenced to death this 
year have been tried under emergency procedures that give them 
little opportunity to prepare their defense 
trials are often a mere formality with the verdict decided 
beforehand and little chance for appeal or pardon the report 
says 
amnesty says the number of executions was the greatest since 
5000 or more people were killed in 1983 during a major anticrime 
campaign 
the courts have been ordered to severely crack down on such 
crimes as drug trafficking embezzlement gang robberies and theft 
the fourth such sweeping attack on crime in the last eight 
years the report said 
despite the increase in death sentences the level of crime 
has not dropped in the last decade the report says 
around the first anniversary in june of the governments 
crackdown the prodemocracy movement authorities tightened 
security the official press carried numerous reports of arrests of 
vagrants and petty criminals and executions of robbers murderers 
and rapists as well as an arsonist who set fire to an army jeep 
during last years protests 
on june 34 1989 army troops backed by tanks shot their way 
into beijing and crushed the studentled prodemocracy movement 
killihng hundreds of unarmed civilians

getup in the past two weeks and hopes to have 2500 on the us 
market by oct 1 the mask will not be offered elsewhere 
we have to act while the market is still hot said saudreau

government troops broke the tamil 
rebels threemonth siege of a strategic northern fort in a 
surprise attack today that left 100 rebels and 12 soldiers dead 
according to a military statement 
under cover of fire from gunboats and helicopter gunships 360 
soldiers paddled across a lagoon in rubber dinghies before dawn and 
fought their way into jaffna fort said defense secretary gen 
cyril ranatunga 
ten soldiers were also wounded in the battle for the fort where 
more than 200 police and soldiers had been trapped military 
officials said on condition of anonymity 
an air force plane providing air cover crashed into the lagoon 
after the siege was broken military officials said blaming engine 
problems they said the pilot of the singleengine italianmade 
marchetti plane was thought to have died in the crash 
there was no immediate word from the tamil tiger rebels or any 
independent report from jaffna where communications have been 
severed since summer while the sinhalesecontrolled government 
battled guerrillas from the tamil minority 
the 17th century fort had been besieged since june 11 when the 
tamil guerrillas broke a ceasefire and renewed their separatist 
war against the government 
the assaulting battle group has now successfully relieved the 
fort and is consolidating and clearing adjacent areas the 
military statement said 
officials said the army was destroying rebel bunkers around the 
fort 
the breaking of the siege is an important psychological victory 
for the government forces but its value is likely to be more 
symbolic than practical 
the rest of jaffna town is tiger territory and so is most of 
the surrounding jaffna peninsula jaffna is 185 miles northeast of 
colombo 
nevertheless the massive fort a classic of military 
architecture with a moat drawbridge watch towers and 20foot 
walls symbolizes sinhalese power in the tamildominated peninsula 
during the siege helicopters dropped food to the men trapped 
inside drinking water was provided in the form of ice blocks 
which quickly melted in the tropical heat at least twice 
helicopter pilots braved rebel flak to land at the fort and pick up 
seriously wounded policemen and soldiers 
having taken the fort the governments next task is to take the 
town of jaffna which has been a tiger stronghold since the 
insurrection started in 1983 
the government opened talks last year to try to negotiate a 
peaceful settlement with the tigers who say they need a separate 
homeland to protect the tamil minority from discrimination by the 
sinhalese majority 
the government says more than 3000 people have been killed in 
the last three months bringing the death toll of the 7yearold 
insurrection to at least 14000 
the northeast is the home of most of sri lankas tamils who 
form 18 percent of the islands population of 16 million sinhalese 
make up 75 percent of the people

former hurricane isidore weakened to just above the 
threshold for a tropical storm and its top sustained winds of 75 
mph this morning remained a threat only to shipping in the 
midatlantic forecasters said 
isidore first became a hurricane last thursday then dropped 
back to tropical storm status over the weekend before returning to 
hurricane strength earlier this week 
isidore is kinda like an old stray dog you just cant get rid 
off its been out there for eight or nine days now and just wont 
go away said max mayfield a specialist at the national 
hurricane center in suburban coral gables 
but i think in about three days time itll take off to the 
northeast and head into the far northern atlantic where the 
system should become an extratropical storm mayfield said 
but its still going to be around for three to five more 
days he said 
at 6 am edt isidore was centered near 348 north latitude and 
508 west longitude or about 1100 miles west southwest of the 
azores the system was drifting north and was expected to keep that 
course with no pickup in forward speed likely for the next 24 hours 
isidores hurricaneforce winds extended 35 miles from the 
center and tropical stormforce winds extended up to 175 miles 
the tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its top winds reach 
74 mph while a tropical depression reaches tropical storm strength 
when its winds reach 39 mph

the number of soviet jewish emigres could 
exceed 1 million over the next two years and israeli officials are 
struggling for money to handle the possible influx a newspaper 
reported today 
about 400000 soviet immigrants are expected in 1991 and between 
400000 and 650000 in 1992 the davar daily newspaper said 
quoting testimony before a ministerial committee on immigrant 
absorption 
the figures were based on the estimated 12 million soviet jews 
who have applied for exit permits the paper said 
some officials believe a reported rise in antisemitism in the 
soviet union will contribute to the immigrant increase 
about 88000 soviet jews have come to israel so far this year 
and the number could reach 150000 by december acccording to the 
quasigovernmental jewish agency which handles immigration 
but estimates by prime minister yitzhak shamir and other 
officials forecast about 1 million soviet jews will arrive over the 
next 10 years 
jewish agency spokesman gad benari said he expects the pace of 
immigration to increase but declined to give specific figures 
another jewish agency official yehuda weinraub said 
applications for exit permits were not a measure for the rate of 
immigration 
its a very long process from then on before they come here 
weinraub said 
davar noted in its reports that figures might fluctuate citing 
the amount of antisemitic activity in the soviet union and how 
successfully the current immigrants adjust to life in israel 
michael kleiner head of parliaments immigrant absorption 
committee said government officials are trying to downplay the 
pace of immigration because they are overwhelmed 
its wishful thinking that the soviets are going to arrive 
slowly over the years said kleiner of shamirs rigthwing likud 
bloc someone who is in a panic over antisemitism doesnt plan 
to leave in five years he wants to leave now 
the jewish agency says israel needs 20 billion to absorb 1 
million immigrants while kleiner put the figure at 30 billion 
the problem is that we dont have the resources there is no 
logical way how israel can raise 30 billion over the next two or 
three years he said 
israel has budgeted 23 billion over the next three years for 
immigrant absorption 
the jewish agency has funneled 740 million in help from abroad 
and the international israel bonds campaign pledged to raise 1 
billion this year 
israel televison reported wednesday night that of the 100000 
soviet jews who arrived since last year only 8000 have found 
jobs the report did not say how many immigrants were in the job 
market or how many were children or elderly 
benari noted that many of the adult newcomers are still 
enrolled in hebrew classes and are not yet looking for work he 
said that of the 13000 who arrived last year more than 50 percent 
found work

gilleys the defunct honkytonk made 
famous by the movie urban cowboy is on its way to becoming a 
pile of rubble now that a lawsuit is out of the way 
the settlement of a lawsuit between country and western singer 
mickey gilley and sherwood cryer his former partner will allow 
gilley to demolish the remains of the club in this houston suburb 
that became a symbol of cowboy culture 
the club badly damaged in an arson fire this year had been 
open since the early 1970s 
the threeyear legal battle ended wednesday with a settlement 
leaving nearly all former mutual holdings to gilley 
cryer also agreed to drop a pending appeal of gilleys 17 
million civil court victory in 1988 and gilley will drop a 1989 
lawsuit accusing cryer of trying to avoid paying the judgment by 
shifting assets to friends and relatives 
its all done cryers attorney jake johnson said today 
all of the assets have essentially depreciated down to virtually 
nothing because of the taxes and liens depreciation buyer cleanup 
and all of that you can divide nothing by two and youve got 
onehalf of nothing 
its just very tragic johnson said its like a divorce 
a long and bitter divorce 
david sacks an attorney for gilley said gilley will start 
taking bids on the property where the club stood and that the 
demolition will rid the suburb of an eyesore 
under the settlement gilley will immediately obtain gilleys 
club rodeo arena and several other clubs and convenience stores in 
texas and tennessee 
nearly all the properties including gilleys club have 
significant tax liens sacks said making it difficult to value the 
settlement it was unclear whether the sale of the holdings will 
meet the tax obligations plus court costs he said 
cryer and gilley must each pay half of 200000 in fees owed

west germany and the soviet union today initialed 
a landmark 20year friendship treaty designed to bind the two 
nations closer together after german unity 
it is also intended as the cornerstone for massive german help 
for the battered soviet economy 
the actual signing of the accord is expected soon between soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and west german chancellor helmut 
kohl 
on wednesday the two germanys and the four world war ii victors 
including the soviet union signed a separate historic treaty 
that clears the way for a reshaping of the eastwest balance of 
power by removing the final obstacles to german unity 
just as the day before soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and his west german counterpart hansdietrich 
genscher took pen in hand today for another historic moment 
initialing the new treaty 
the document intends to bury any germansoviet suspicions of 
each other now that a mighty westernallied germany is about to 
spring up in the center of europe the soviets lost 20 million 
people during world war ii and bitter memories of nazi aggression 
linger 
after the war moscows cold war influence over communist east 
germany was the source of frequent tension between bonn and moscow 
with germany set to unite on oct 3 bonn and moscow want to lay 
a solid foundation for relations that have been steadily improving 
over the past two years 
in the newly initialed treaty the two sides reaffirm pledges 
not to use force against one another and restate earlier vows to 
honor all european nations borders 
the document contrasts sharply with the nonagression pact the 
soviets signed with nazi germany in 1939 carving up poland and the 
baltics less than a month later germany invaded poland to begin 
world war ii 
the treaty initialed today says the soviets and germans will 
solve their differences only through peaceful means 
should one of the two sides be attacked by some other 
nation the other side will make available no military help 
to the attacker and will introduce measures to settle the 
conflict through the use of the united nations and other structures 
of collective security the document states 
the treaty says the two nations will significantly expand 
their bilateral cooperation especially in the economic 
industrial and economictechnological areas 
bonn and moscow are working on three sister treaties to the one 
initialed thursday 
one of those documents will set out the details of expanded 
economic cooperation another deals with technological assistance 
and the third with covering the costs for 370000 red army troops 
that will be withdrawn from east germany over the next four years 
no figures have been released from the first two sister 
documents 
the west germans announced earlier this week they will be 
providing the soviets 76 billion to help retrain homecoming red 
army troops leaving east germany and build them new housing 
west germany today also announced an additional 19 billion 
interestfree loan to the soviets to help fund the troop withdrawal 
amid the goodwill gestures between the nations the soviet news 
agency tass has complained about the allegeddenial of a visa for 
its new west german bureau chief 
the west german foreign ministry said it could neither confirm 
nor deny the report that sergei sosnovsky was barred from the 
country 
tass said the denial of a visa to a soviet journalist 
representing a world news agency can only leave observers 
perplexed

former president reagan was warmly 
welcomed to the west german capital today a day after a triumphant 
visit to the remnants of the berlin wall 
an honor guard greeted reagan 79 and his wife nancy as they 
arrived in a convoy of black limousines at president richard von 
weizsaeckers spacious official residence overlooking the rhine 
river 
sunshine for you von weizsaeckers wife marianne told 
reagan before the group disappeared inside for lunch 
in bonn reagan will also meet with chancellor helmut kohl as 
part of a 10day private visit to savor the european political 
changes of the last year 
this trip promised to be far more successful than the west 
german visits reagan made as president 
his may 1985 attendance at an international economic summit in 
bonn was overshadowed by a controversy that erupted when he and 
kohl visited a german war cemetery in bitburg where nazi ss 
officers are buried 
during another visit to bonn in 1982 at the height of the 
crisis over stationing us nuclear missiles in western europe 
about 200000 west germans massed to tell reagan to go home 
in a speech in berlin on wednesday reagan said west germanys 
agreement in the early 1980s to accept nucleartipped cruise 
missile bases was a major turning point in pressing moscow to 
accept a new european order 
like thousands before him reagan pounded on the berlin wall 
three years ago he stood at the ugly concrete barrier and 
challenged soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to tear it down 
germans applauded and shouted we love you ronnie and 
bravo ronnie as the reagans walked through the brandenburg 
gate at the former border between east and west berlin 
berlin which has been designated the german capital after the 
two germanys are merged oct 3 was reagans first stop on the trip 
that will also take him to poland the soviet union and italy

about 200 soldiers and police began 
today to scour 10 square miles of dense woodlands where police say 
a suspect in the slayings of five college students reportedly went 
on night reconnaissance missions 
the search began about 830 am and was expected to last two 
days as investigators combed the land around the apartment of 
edward lewis humphrey one of eight people police say are suspects 
in the stabbing deaths last month 
the terrain included swampy wooded areas and a creek where 
prison inmates last week cleared away weeds and brush 
this is just another step in the investigation said 
gainesville police spokeswoman sadie darnell were certainly not 
going to leave anything unchecked 
alachua county sheriffs office spokesman lt spencer mann said 
authorities were conducting an article search with metal 
detectors but refused to be more specific 
the search party includes 80 people from the naval training 
center in orlando 20 florida national guardsmen from lake city 
and officers from numerous state and local police agencies two 
helicopters and about 10 dog teams were participating ms darnell 
said 
investigators said they hoped whatever is found would either 
confirm or rule out humphrey an 18yearold university of florida 
freshman as a suspect 
neighbors have told investigators humphrey enjoyed dressing up 
in military clothes strapping on a knife and slipping into the 
woods around his apartment at night for imaginary reconnaissance 
maneuvers 
humphrey remains jailed on charges of beating up his grandmother 
meanwhile the us justice department approved a 941639 
emergency grant to help pay for the investigation into the 
slayings the money will come from a special emergency federal law 
enforcement assistance fund 
us attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement 
wednesday that the entire nation is appalled by these slayings 
it is imperative that the perpetrator or perpetrators of such 
heinous crimes be swiftly apprehended and held accountable 
earlier this week police said the hunt for the killer had cost 
state and local law enforcement agencies nearly 750000

front yard was apparently the deliberate target of gang members 
police said 
jonathon fabian was listed in critical but stable condition with 
a stomach wound today at martin luther king jrdrew medical center 
police said gang members apparently were responsible for the 
shooting and to boy did not appear to be the victim of cross fire 
or a stray bullet no motive for an intentional shooting was 
determined 
just when you think you know the limits of the insanity 
something like this happens said police spokesman fred nixon 
i have never heard of a deliberate gang shooting where the victim 
was of such a young age 
jonathon was playing in a pushcar tuesday evening in his 
parents front yard with his father standing nearby when two shots 
were fired police said 
witnesses told sheriffs investigators that they saw three 
teenage boys running away one carried a gun the witnesses said 
i dont know if it was fun target practice or what said 
sheriffs detective craig ditsch 
the toddlers 26yearold mother yvonne fabian said her family 
moved into their lynwood home only three weeks ago she said she 
only recently started allowing jonathon and his baby sister to play 
in the front yard 
in contrast with the police version teenagers on the street 
said the boy might have been the accidental victim of an escalating 
war between rival gangs

a federal appeals court has ruled that the city 
did not violate the bill of rights when it refused to allow a park 
avenue church to tear down its community house and build a 
commercial skyscraper 
the ruling wednesday by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
upheld the landmark status bestowed on st bartholomews churchs 
community house by the city landmarks preservation commission 
st bartholomews senior warden fletcher hodges said the 
ruling would make it difficult for the church and its ministries 
to hold together into the 21st century he said they would 
appeal to the supreme court within 90 days 
the church argued it needed the money from rents it would have 
made at the skyscraper to repair and maintain the 73yearold 
church described as a notable example of a venetian adaptation of 
the byzantine style 
attorney gerald d fischer representing some parishioners and 
civic groups opposed to the skyscraper said he was delighted with 
the ruling 
the church has spent 3 million of the parishs money on an 
effort to develop their property he said hopefully this is 
the end and they will cease on this folly 
the head of the landmarks commission laurie beckelman called 
the ruling a total affirmation of our powers 
the judges wrote that it is obvious that the landmarks law has 
drastically restricted the churchs ability to raise revenues to 
carry out its various charitable and ministerial programs 
nevertheless they said the supreme court has held that 
neutral regulations that diminish the income of a religious 
organization do not violate the first amendment guarantee of free 
exercise of religion 
the church also claimed that the landmark law violated the fifth 
and fourteenth amendments because it severely restricted its 
ability to use the property without just compensation 
but the appeals court disagreed citing a 1978 supreme court 
ruling that prevented penn central from building a highrise atop 
grand central terminal 
the high court said then that the landmark designation did not 
constitute an unconstitutional taking because it did not 
interfere with the historical use of the property and that use 
continued to be economically viable 
the church can continue its existing charitable and religious 
activities in its current facilities the judges wrote in denying 
st bartholomews appeal 
st bartholomews organized in 1835 sought an exemption to the 
1967 landmark designation of its community house in december 1983 
asking permission to build a 59story tower 
the landmarks commission denied the request and a second one the 
following year in which the church proposed a scaleddown 47story 
building 
the church filed a third application seeking a hardship 
exception which was denied in 1986 following exhaustive public 
hearings 
a review of church finances in the early 1980s indicated that 
st bartholomews endowment of 9 million would not maintain the 
buildings and finance church programs said hodges

the white house today declined to criticize 
us ambassador april glaspie for failing to anticipate that saddam 
hussein would invade kuwait saying the whole world was misled 
in her dealings with the iraqi leader prior to the aug 2 
invasion ms glaspie was just reflecting thenus policy of 
seeking to nurture relations with baghdad presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said 
fitzwater said the fact that the us ambassador to iraq is now 
desk bound at the state department does not reflect any lack of 
faith in her abilities 
we believe ambassador glaspie is an outstanding 
professional fitzwater said 
however he did not dispute reports that saddam had made 
menacing comments to ms glaspie a week before the invasion 
suggesting that the united states should not oppose iraqi aims in 
the middle east 
the washington post reported in todays editions that an 
iraqisupplied transcript of the july 25 meeting suggested that ms 
glaspie reassured saddam that the united states had no official 
position on iraqs border dispute with kuwait 
state department spokesman richard boucher on wednesday refused 
to comment on the remarks in the transcript 
we wont comment on the content or the authenticity of the 
purported transcript fitzwater said today 
ms glaspie was as surprised by iraqs invasion of kuwait as 
were other us officials fitzwater said 
in fact she flew to london a day before the invasion on her way 
to washington once here she was told not to return to baghdad 
the us embassy in baghdad now is headed by joseph c wilson iii 
a career diplomat 
ms glaspie has been working as a senior iraqi desk officer in 
washington 
the fact is that saddam hussein has lied to everyone in the 
world including egyptian president hosni mubarak and jordans 
king hussein fitzwater said the whole world was misled in that 
sense 
fitzwater said ms glaspie was part of a us task force keeping 
a close eye on the situation and that she maintains daily 
contacts with her colleagues in the embassy in baghdad 
the spokesman said iraq probably wanted the impression out 
there that it had been reassured by the united states in advance 
of the invasion that washington would not intervene in its conflict 
with kuwait 
but i think its pretty ludicrous to suggest that any time 
any place we would find it comfortable to have them invade kuwait 
the basic implication is that somehow the us would be willing to 
look the other way or would have condoned this kind of action that 
is ludicrous and stupid

president bushs effort to send a videotaped 
message to the iraqi people hit a snag today when the iraqi 
ambassador refused to accept a copy of the message during a visit 
to the state department 
but the envoy suggested that once a better procedure was 
found for delivery of the tape it will be shown to the iraqi 
people in its entirety during prime time 
we welcome the tape ambassador mohamed almashat told 
reporters at the state department after a meeting with deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
almashat said that after he rejected the tape eagleburger told 
him the message would be delivered either by the us embassy in 
baghdad to iraqi authorities or sent by satellite 
the state department had no immediate comment on almashats 
account of the conversation 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
we are disappointed that he declined to take personal 
possession of the tape for transmittal to baghdad 
fitzwater in a written statement said the state department 
would transmit the tape to the us embassy in baghdad within the 
next day or two for delivery to the iraqi government 
the administration plans to release the message worldwide unless 
iraq shows the tape on state television within five days 
almashat said he gave mr eagleburger assurances that we 
welcome it the tape we are going to broadcast it in prime time 
the iraqi official also raised the possibility that his 
government might broadcast it via satellite for the whole world 
fitzwater said wednesday that bush in the eightminute tape 
uses president saddam husseins own words to discredit him one 
example was a november 1988 speech in which saddam says that one 
arab country does not have the right to invade another

at a time when skyrocketing land prices are 
affecting even cemeteries a temple in tokyo is offering free grave 
plots to people who convert to the buddhist sect of tendai 
the saikoji temple said thursday it is offering 250 plots worth 
8700 each to tokyo residents on condition they convert to 
tendai the japanese counterpart of the chinese tiantai sect 
the grave sites are in a former parking lot inside the temple 
compound 
i understand the offer is aimed at helping people in need 
because of the acute shortage of graves and cemeteries in big 
cities like tokyo said terataka kyodo the wife of the temples 
head priest 
most cemeteries in japan are on the grounds of temples or are 
maintained by private companies or municipal governments many in 
big cities are nearly full each plot is generally used by an 
entire family 
people who want their own graves must first pay a lump sum for 
perpetual rent often amounting to tens of thousands of dollars to 
the owners of the cemeteries in addition regular payments for 
maintenance must be made even after death

ethnic albanian deputies of the 
outlawed kosovo parliament declared secession from serbia and 
proclaimed their province the seventh yugoslav republic the state 
news agency tanjug said today 
meanwhile radio belgrade said police raided an ethnic albanian 
village looking for arms and foreign currency and two albanians 
were killed in a gunbattle two policemen were wounded one 
seriously in the shootout it said 
the proclamation of independence and adoption of a constiution 
for kosovo was made sept 7 at a secret and illegal session of 
the former kosovo legislature attended by 111 delegates tanjug 
said 
the declaration distributed to yugoslav journalists in kosovos 
provincial capital of pristina has no legal validity but may 
provoke more serbian anger and police repression against ethnic 
albanians in kosovo sources said 
authorities in serbia yugoslavias largest republic dissolved 
the kosovo assembly july 5 three days after its ethnic albanian 
deputies voted for a document proclaiming the provinces secession 
from serbia 
in their sept 7 meeting lawmakers also adopted an unspecified 
constitution of the republic of kosovo tanjug said 
serbian authorities claim that ethnic albanians are seeking 
independence from serbia as a first step toward joining neighboring 
albania 
yugoslav republics are viturally independent states which 
according to the current constitution can declare their 
independence from yugoslavia 
the tanjug report which could not be independently confirmed 
said the declaration extended the term of the dissolved kosovo 
parliament and the provincial government until free elections are 
held in the region 
the dismantled kosovo legislature was dominated by ethnic 
albanians who make up 90 percent of the provinces 19 million 
people 
the dissolution virtually abolished the autonomy kosovo 
administratively a part of serbia had enjoyed under yugoslavias 
1974 constitution 
the province considered by serbs the ancient heartland of their 
culture has been the scene of intercommunal strife since serbias 
communist government introduced strict limits on the regions 
selfgovernment in march 1989 
at least 60 albanian protesters have died in sporadic clashes 
with the serbianrun security forces and thousands more have been 
sacked from their jobs or jailed according to international human 
rights groups 
radio belgrade said the shootout this morning lasted for more 
than five hours after police surrounded the village of podujevo 18 
miles north of pristina 
armed resistance was given during the raid on part of a number 
of persons who used different weapons both from the building being 
checked as well as from nearby groves and hamlets tanjug said 
in a report 
a large quantity of arms of different caliber and purposes 
communications and unspecified military equipment were discovered 
the reports said 
tanjug quoted serbian officials as saying 25 people were 
detained

a towering soviet soldier smashes a swastika 
with a giant sword marx stares at passing traffic cars roll down 
ho chi minh lenin tugs on his lapel 
germany is less than three weeks away from becoming a single 
bastion of western capitalism but much of the new nation will be 
filled with totems to the old east germany 
while leaders argue over how to pay for unification and east 
germans worry about their jobs many towns are wondering what to do 
with all those old statues streets squares and schools dedicated 
to the stalwarts of socialism 
it is a problem far more complex than merely changing street 
signs and carting away scowling icons of stone and bronze 
in southern east germany karl marx city wasted little time 
reclaiming its historical name chemnitz 
but it is taking much longer to decide what to do with karl 
himself a huge glowering bust that dwarfs tourists who stare at 
his gargantuan noggin in the heart of town 
no community has taken a greater interest in this issue than 
east berlin the showcase of the former communist government and 
the historic heart of what will be the capital of a united nation 
an estimated 800 postwar monuments dot the cityscape some of 
them the centerpieces of squares in leninplatz the soviet 
revolutionary is affixed to a jagged panel scowling in flowing 
overcoat one hand on his lapel and the other clenched at his side 
in marxengels platz engels stands erect while marx sits at his 
side his huge lap a favorite place for tourists to nestle for 
photo opportunities 
a committee of artists and historians convened last week to 
begin an monumentbymonument appraisal of what to do with the 
memorials a similiar committee has been charged with examining 
street names 
some germans want to remove all remnants of the regime imposed 
by the soviets after world war ii others say they should to some 
extent be preserved 
monuments even if they are horrible or an attack against good 
taste are part of the postwar history here said klaus hetzel a 
spokesman for the east berlin government you can find other 
solutions for them 
the east berlin committee members believe many statues will be 
retained but altered perhaps by adding plaques that put them in 
historical perspective 
others may have new gardens or green spaces around them to 
soften them 
still others may be carted away to a single location becoming 
part of a museum that will in a sense be a graveyard of communist 
artifacts 
what we do not want to do is merely get rid of everything 
said richard dahlheim deputy chairman of the citys cultural 
affairs department too many historical remnants are lost to the 
emotions of the moment 
few monuments trigger more emotions than the giant soviet 
memorial in east berlins charming treptow park many people are 
stunned by the militaristic scope of this tribute to soviet 
soldiers who died while conquering germany from the east 
to see it a visitor follows a path lined with birch trees 
leading to a pedestal of stairs two red granite walls shaped like 
drooping flags form a gateway two giant soviet soldiers kneel in 
front of each wall 
on the other side is a lawn that stretches for more than 550 
yards the burial place for 5000 soviet soldiers on each side are 
eight stone sacrcophagi depicting feats of heroism 
at the end of the lawn is a mausoleum on which a 38foothigh 
soldier stands broadshouldered and handsome the soldier smashes 
a swastika with a sword and clutches a child creating an idealized 
image of a soviet avenger slaying the nazi oppressors and saving 
the innocent 
many germans want it shipped back to the soviets 
marx is okay but get rid of that thing said werner 
tischer 72 a native berliner 
west berlin also has monuments to its world war ii occupiers 
including a soviet memorial and a street named after karl marx 
hetzel said it will be up to a future united berlin government what 
should remain or be modified 
an estimated 100 to 200 streets are being studied by the east 
berlin streets committee ranging from streets named after salvador 
allende the former marxist leader of chile to konstantin 
ziolkowski a father of soviet flight technology 
they already have decided to change the name of otto grotewohl 
street named after the first east german prime minister who was a 
hardline stalinist 
one broad avenue americans are always startled to see is named 
after ho chi minh the communist leader who drove the americans out 
of vietnam 
there is even a wall street its namesake nearby however has 
been reduced to rubble

the bush administration unveiled a revised 
program today to ease the shortfall in oil but energy secretary 
james watkins said worldwide shortages could linger at near 1 
million barrels a day through the winter 
watkins said he believed the shortfall can be managed 
through conservation efforts and additional domestic production 
he left open the possibility of drawing oil from the strategic 
petroleum reserve in the coming months if conservation and 
increased production efforts fall short of expectations but he 
reiterated it was too soon to use the reserve which holds nearly 
600 million barrels 
thats a cherished reserve that has a finite life and we 
dont want to use it too early watkins told the senate energy 
and natural resource committee he said he was comfortable that 
the department would be ready to take oil from the reserve in short 
notice if needed 
the department outlined a revised combined program of energy 
conservation and oil production measures that officials said was 
aimed at cutting the oil supply shortfall in the united states by 
about 11 million barrels a day 
the new program including a radio advertising campaign urging 
conservation came amid increasing criticism that the 
administrations efforts to ease the countrys reliance on foreign 
oil have been more rhetoric than substance 
the president should give more than a speech he should give 
us a program sen paul simon dill said wednesday in response 
to bushs call for increased energy conservation in light of the 
persian gulf crisis 
watkins rejected such criticsm saying the administrations 
efforts to increase production and get americans to conserve oil 
are substantive we do not think they are trivial 
much of the departments program announced today mirrored the 
response plan announced shortly after the mideast crisis developed 
including calls on motorists to conserve fuel by properly inflating 
tires and various measures to expand production from existing 
domestic oil fields 
but watkins said as much as 165000 barrels of day also could be 
saved by fuel switching and urged that regulatory and other 
barriers be eased to promote switching he said there are 37 
natural gas pipeline proposals awaiting federal or state approval 
the plan also included tax incentives for oil and gas 
production expanded production from alaska and opening the arctic 
national wildlife refuge for oil exploration all proposals 
announced previously 
watkins said current crude oil stocks were well above levels at 
the same time last year but he said there was a 36 million barrel 
worldwide production shortfall in september and that the shortfall 
was expected to be gradually reduced to about 1 million by next 
january and slightly lower in the succeeding months 
the united nations economic embargo imposed on iraq slashed 
available production from iraq and occupied kuwait by 4 million 
barrels a day 
addressing a joint session of congress on the middle east crisis 
tuesday night bush asked lawmakers to enact measures to increase 
domestic oil and gas production and said conservation is 
essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible 
but environmentalists and some members of congress say the 
administration has been slow in developing an energy plan and is 
giving only scant emphasis to energy conservation while 
emphasizing expanded drilling possibly in environmentally 
sensitive areas 
never once did he mention renewable energy sen tom harkin 
diowa said of bushs speech 
but since returning from their august recess members of 
congress also have been short on specific proposals the exception 
has been house and senate legislation calling for dramatic 
increases in automobile fuel economy 
legislation sponsored by sen richard bryan dnev would 
require automakers to improve the average fuel economy of new cars 
to 40 miles per gallon by 2001 
on wednesday bryan and other sponsors said the measure would 
cut the demand for petroleum by 28 million barrels a day by the 
turn of the century but the white house has opposed the measure 
and a recently circulated policy memo suggested that the president 
likely would veto it

a us company for the first time is 
manufacturing assaultstyle ak47 rifles that were banned from 
import but the company owner says he wants his gunmaking business 
to be shortlived 
e robert jensen president of lathrops shooters supply inc of 
tucson ariz said hes making the weapons only to recoup the 
losses from what the government did to me when it banned imports 
just as his shipments of already paidfor rifles came into port 
i chose to see if i couldnt find a way to get out of the 
program in 60 to 90 days he said i want out of that market 
jensen had gotten permits from the bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms to import the guns before he bought them but customs 
wouldnt let him take the weapons instead he had to break them 
down and leave behind the receiver which is the trigger and firing 
mechanism 
jensen hired a company to produce new receivers and assemble the 
rifles he says his version of the ak47 is better than the 
imports it was made to higher specifications than anything the 
chinese ever made 
last summers ban on imports didnt cover domestic production of 
assaultstyle weapons that had been barred from import said jack 
killorin spokesman for the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
but killorin called jensens action an example of why congress 
should pass president bushs proposal to ban such manufactures the 
legislation is pending before congress 
the bureau permanently barred imports of 43 models of 
foreignmanufactured assaultstyle rifles in july 1989 saying the 
weapons didnt meet the sporting uses requirement for imported 
firearms 
the weapons were equipped with militarytype accoutrements such 
as folding or collapsible stocks pistol grips threaded barrels 
for silencers flash suppressors bayonet lugs and large capacity 
ammunition magazines 
the ban was prompted by the public outcry after the jan 17 
1989 slayings of five children in a stockton calif schoolyard 
by a drifter wielding an ak47 
this most recent action illustrates the industrys 
creativity when theres a loophole to be exploited and a dollar to 
be made said josh sugarmann director of the firearms policy 
project who first noticed the ak47s were being made by jensens 
company 
killorin and jensen said they knew of no other us company that 
was manufacturing assaultstyle firearms banned from import 
i dont think anyone else is crazy enough to get involved in 
this said jensen who said he has been in the firearms 
distribution and retail business since 1955 
theres no money in the firearms manufacturing market he 
said if i can come out even its going to be a victory 
jensen has sued the government in federal court over the import 
ban although the government has won similar legal battles 
we dont have any problem with the fact that batf arbitrarily 
and capriciously decided they werent going to issue any more 
permits jensen said but i had issued permits on the basis of 
which i purchased the firearms they were legal saleable private 
property 
he would not specify how many guns were involved narrowing it 
only to the midfour figures nor would he say how many ak47s 
hes manufacturing with the salvaged parts 
the original price of the new guns to dealers was 498 each for 
nine or fewer 449 each for 10 or more but jensen said he dropped 
both prices about 50 to move the guns more quickly 
thats still a premium price he said

floridas supreme court ruled today 
that dying people have a right to refuse forced feeding and that 
guardians can make the decision for people who are incompetent to 
act on their own 
further the justices ruled dying people and their guardians 
dont need a courts approval before they stop forced feeding 
the foundation of the decision which comes in the case of an 
elderly woman who died last summer is the right to privacy as 
guaranteed by the florida constitution 
the right of privacy would be an empty right were it not to 
extend to competent and incompetent persons alike justice 
rosemary barkett wrote in todays majority opinion 
estelle browning spent the last 2 years of her life hooked up 
to a feeding tube despite a living will she had left saying 
that she didnt want to be kept alive under such conditions she 
was not comatose but was not able to either swallow or communicate 
and was considered incompetent 
floridas high court heard oral arguments in the case in january 
in june the us supreme court said a missouri couple could not 
order the removal of food and water keeping their 32yearold 
comatose daughter alive the daughter nancy cruzan had not left a 
living will although her parents said they were certain she would 
prefer to die rather than live in a coma 
the us supreme court did say that competent people have a 
right to refuse medical treatment 
the florida court which cited that case went on to say that it 
has found previously that incompetent people have the same right 
through guardians acting on statements made before becoming 
incompetent to refuse medical treatment as competent people 
the browning case extended that ruling to people in florida who 
are not totally comatose but who cannot make their own decisions 
the decision to terminate artificial lifesustaining measures 
is being made over and over in nursing homes hospitals and 
private homes in this nation barkett wrote 
it is being made painfully by loving family members concerned 
guardians or surrogates in conjunction with the advice of ethical 
and caring physicians or other health care providers it is being 
made when the only alternative to a natural death is to 
artificially maintain a bare existence 
the opinion was fully endorsed by five of the seven justices 
one of whom wrote an additional oneparagraph opinion justice ben 
overton partially agreed with the rest of the court

the world are coming out of retirement to man the helms and engine 
rooms of military supply ships bound for the middle east 
i want to go out as a champ im a damn good sailor i can cut 
the mustard said donald covert a reactivated retiree who 
admitted only to being over 65 
oh yeah they can cut the mustard agreed wade ko 
hughes a national maritime union agent in houston theyre 
ablebodied men theyre tough seamen 
jessica smith a spokeswoman for the camp springs mdbased 
seafarers international union said union officials last month 
issued a manpower alert to physically fit retirees and other 
inactive members 
weve taken a number of steps to meet the increased crewing 
requirements because of the conflict in the middle east she said 
in addition to asking the guys on the commercial fleet to stay 
on there weve also asked our inactive members and pensioners to 
get ready to ship out 
the seafarers one of several maritime unions for unlicensed 
crew members on oceangoing vessels and inland waterways told 
members their country needed their skills 
in the august issue of the seafarers log the union reported 
privately operated ships under contract to the military sealift 
command and vessels in the ready reserve force were deployed to 
take part in operation desert shield 
as demand for supply ships and other support vessels continued 
seafarers president michael sacco ordered the manpower alert 
and the response has been overwhelming 
clarence holloway a 35year sea veteran served on cargo ships 
in world war ii korea and vietnam why should i stay here the 
houston man asked its just as dangerous here you can get shot 
here 
my country needs me said charles a mills 69 with 52 
years sea experience there arent enough trained seamen to man 
all the ships hauling military cargo into the persian gulf 
the unions have given retirees dispensations to continue 
receiving pension checks in addition to their salaries for 
shipboard work for up to six months 
we have had several from our pensioners and older members 
volunteer to help us with this crisis hughes said these are 
guys with key ratings specialisttype ratings that just arent 
available anywhere else 
hughes said because many of the retirees have served on vessels 
since world war ii they are more familiar with the reactivated 
navy vessels and older ships 
theyre taking jobs that we cannot fill with our current 
personnel because our current personnel either dont have those 
specialty ratings or are already at sea hughes said 
there are more jobs now he said theyve taken a lot of 
ships out of mothballs now and there are more jobs on older 
vessels 
ms smith said the union has sent out the call to deckhands 
storage workers and engine room workers in the past month she 
said the union suspended onboard working limits for certain seamen 
classifications combed lists of retirees and kept union halls open 
on nights and weekends to register more workers

about 30 already have been sent to sea 
theyre seamen who maintain the ships maintain the engine 
rooms keep up the appearance of the ship and serve food hughes 
said their age ranges from 55 to whatever age as long as they

the house today postponed action on the 283 
billion defense bill as lawmakers awaited a possible agreement by 
white house and congressional negotiators on a plan to trim 50 
billion from the federal deficit 
with the likelihood that a final figure for military spending 
could emerge from the talks the house put aside work on the 
defense budget for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 until next 
week 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters the 
postponement was designed to give our negotiators a little 
opportunity 
meanwhile the house is sending a pointed message to us allies 
slow to provide military and financial help for the persian gulf 
deployment the united states will no longer foot the entire bill 
for defending the world 
angered by japans delay in giving 1 billion to a campaign that 
could cost up to 15 billion in the next year the house on 
wednesday adopted a measure requiring the asian nation to pay all 
the costs of stationing us forces on its soil or begin losing 
the troops 
the white house which already has threatened a veto of the bill 
because it would cut troop levels and terminate the b2 stealth 
bomber criticized the provision on japan we dont believe 
thats an apppropriate way to conduct foreign policy said press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
but he noted that the vote does express the sentiment of the 
congress i think japan is aware of the general feeling in the 
congress toward some of their activities 
the amendment was one of three burdensharing proposals added to 
the 283 billion defense budget for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 
1 by lawmakers who spent several hours of debate lashing out at 
americas friends 
the house had planned to resume action on the bill today with 
the following issues on the agenda 
amendments to increase or decrease the level of spending on the 
strategic defense initiative in fiscal 1991 president bush had 
called for a budget of 47 billion for the program commonly known 
as star wars the senate trimmed about 1 billion from the 1991 
request the house slashed nearly 2 billion 
in debate on tuesday the ranking republican on the house armed 
services panel rep bill dickinson of alabama raised the 
possibility of a bush veto if lawmakers decimate the program 
but rep barbara boxer dcalif sponsor of an amendment to end 
star wars said it was time to stop spending billions of dollars 
on a fairy tale 
debate over the b2 stealth bomber the costliest weapon in 
history at some 860 million a plane proponents of the 
radarevading aircraft plan to discuss the bombers merits but no 
vote on the issue is planned 
if approved the house bill calls for halting production of the 
plane at the 15 bombers under construction 
amendments to assist communities businesses and workers left 
without a job due to cutbacks in defense spending that force the 
closing or scaling back of military contractors 
prompted by the rising cost of operation desert shield and 
little in the way of assistance from japan west germany and other 
us allies lawmakers vented their frustrations on tuesday in 
overwhelming votes on burdensharing 
by a vote of 37053 the house adopted the amendment requiring 
japan to pay all the costs associated with the 50000 us troops 
stationed there for each year japan does not cover the costs 
5000 troops would be taken out of the country 
the united states spends 45 billion annually for us forces 
in japan japan contributes 29 billion 
this is a real wakeup call for the new world order said 
rep david bonior dmich sponsor of the amendment targeting 
japan 
neither the chairman of the house armed services committee rep 
les aspin dwis nor dickinson voted for the measure but aspin 
summed up the motivations of his colleagues 
it is not the right thing to do substantively but its 
irresistible politically he said 
the house also agreed to require the defense department to come 
up with a plan by 1994 to dual base all military units 
permanently stationing all american troops in the united states and 
ordering shortterm rotation overseas 
it also agreed to prohibit use of any defense department money 
for building a new air base at crotone italy for the 401st 
tactical air wing of f16 jet fighters forced to move from 
torrejon spain 
an amendment to eliminate the two provisions failed 249174 
the house however rejected an amendment that would impose a 
permanent ceiling of 30000 on the number of us troops in south 
korea with that goal to be achieved by fiscal 1993

west germany and the soviet union initialed a 
landmark treaty thursday intended to eliminate longstanding 
distrust between the soviets and germans as the powerful new german 
nation emerges 
the document is also intended as the cornerstone for german help 
for the battered soviet economy already west germany has pledged 
to give the soviets 76 billion to help cover the withdrawal of 
soviet troops from east germany another 19 billion will be 
contributed in the form of a lowinterest loan from bonn 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and his west 
german counterpart hansdietrich genscher initialed the 
friendship treaty a day earlier both were among the six 
signatories of the historic agreement clearing the way for german 
unification 
the actual signing of the friendship accord is expected sometime 
soon between soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and west german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
the soviets suffered massive losses during world war ii after 
the war moscows cold war influence over communist east germany 
was the source of frequent tensions between bonn and moscow 
the treaty states that it is of primary importance to finally 
be done with the past and to use understanding and reconciliation 
to achieve an important contribution toward the overcoming of 
europes division through understanding and reconciliation 
with germany set to reunite oct 3 bonn and moscow want to lay 
a solid foundation for relations that have been steadily improving 
over the past two years 
now we can with justification say that the postwar period is 
over genscher elatedly said after the ceremony 
as the two nations were planning closer relations the soviet 
news agency tass reported that bonn had denied a visa for tass new 
bureau chief in west germany the west german foreign ministry said 
it could neither confirm nor deny the report that sergei sosnovsky 
was being barred from the country 
tass said that as relations between the countries improve the 
denial of a visa to a soviet journalist representing a world news 
agency can only leave observers perplexed 
the journalist has been denied a possibility of providing 
objective information which is expected by tass subscribers in the 
soviet union and abroad the staterun news agency said 
the friendship treaty is the most comprehensive bilateral accord 
between the soviets and west germany since a 1970 treaty in which 
they renounced the use of force against each other 
in the new document the two sides reaffirmed pledges not to use 
force against one another and to honor without reservation the 
territorial integrity of all european states in their current 
borders 
should one of the two sides be attacked by some other 
nation the other side will make available no military help 
to the attacker and will introduce measures to settle the 
conflict through the use of the united nations and other structures 
of collective security the document states 
foreign ministers from the united germany and the soviet union 
will meet at least twice a year according to the treaty 
the document further says that the nations will significantly 
expand their bilateral cooperation especially in the economic 
industrial and economictechnological areas

a millionaire rancher is locking 
horns with the state over a plan to establish an exotic game ranch 
on his 18000acre spread 
john dorrance iii an heir to the campbell soup fortune thumbed 
his nose at the state game and fish department two weeks ago when 
he brought a dozen mixed breed deer to his ranch bordering devils 
tower in northeastern wyoming 
dorrance says hes just trying to make an oldfashioned profit 
he wants to breed the rare animals and sell their lean meat to 
fancy restaurants their hides to clothiers and their horns to 
asians who say they make great aphrodisiacs 
im a threat to the game and fish lets face it im 
something they despise ive got money and ive got private 
property said dorrance 
state wildlife officials say thats nonsense they contend the 
animals threeway crossbreeds of red deer sika deer and elk 
could escape spread disease and inbreed with wyomings majestic 
purebred wildlife the deer were bred in missouri 
the best guarantee that these animals wont spread disease to 
native wildlife is to get them out of the state said agency 
spokesman larry kruckenberg the bottom line is simple we dont 
want the animals here or the threats they pose 
the controversy has resulted in dueling lawsuits environmental 
outrage and a splash of wyoming wit 
while the wildlife agency and environmentalists hardly find 
humor in the dispute wyoming residents are already lampooning the 
great grandson of condensed soup 
whats john dorrances ultimate vision cream of sika soup 
chortles one jokester 
a local newspaper cartoon suggested that even bambi will need a 
lawyer if dorrances plans to create a full scale game ranch with 
wild boar ibex and mouflon sheep were realized 
but dorrance maintains he has done nothing illegal because his 
dozen hybrid deer are less than 50 percent of any one strain of 
species and are therefore not considered wildlife under wyoming 
law 
dorrance calls the deer nontraditional livestock and are 
not under the jurisdiction of the game and fish department 
in bringing these animals into the state i am simply 
exercising my right to pursue free enterprise and to do with my 
land as i see fit said the 45yearold dorrance who has been a 
rancher for 16 years in the hilly terrain made famous in the movie 
close encounters of the third kind 
the animals are legal free of disease and parasites and 
doublefenced they arent going to hurt anyone 
the wildlife agency disagrees and on wednesday held a telephone 
conference that resulted in an emergency rule that redefines 
exotic wildlife a definition that is at the heart of the 
dispute between dorrance and the department 
the rule change came too late to cover the 12 animals dorrance 
has already brought in from missouri but any others he planned to 
bring in would fall under the new rule 
the department also maintains the new rule wasnt needed to 
outlaw dorrances hybrids arguing that since red deer and elk are 
essentially the same species the animals do fall under their 
control even under the old rules 
the rancher says he will continue to fight for his private 
property rights no matter how much it costs 
when i moved here i thought wyoming is what america was 
now i think wyoming wants to be what russia was a bureaucratic 
nightmare where everything is controlled by a central government

king husseins ceaseless travels in search 
of gulf peace have raised scant hope jordanian officials admitted 
thursday but hussein plans to step up efforts to find a 
breakthrough 
the king has no other choice but to keep trying one senior 
government official said the alternative is war a prospect too 
horrifying for us to contemplate 
hussein returned sept 4 from a nineday trip to britain west 
germany italy spain and five north african countries the next 
day he called on iraqi leader saddam hussein in baghdad 
he met late wednesday with yasser arafat chairman of the 
palestinian liberation organization whose own initiatives link 
kuwait to the israelioccupied territories 
the king has said he has no specific peace plan instead he is 
throwing out ideas although he expressed some optimism to 
reporters in london he has made no comment since returning to 
amman 
he did not find the flexibility he had hoped for in europe 
said one official who like the others interviewed spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
in every european capital governments insisted that nothing 
less than a total iraqi withdrawal from kuwait would be acceptable 
king husseins approach is to find ground on which saddam and 
his adversaries can edge their way back from the brink 
he feels he has the confidence of saddam and can help in this 
situation one aide said if anyone thinks the iraqis will 
budge if you dont have their confidence hes mistaken 
jordan has condemned iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the 
royal family insists that it is respecting the un trade embargo 
that followed 
but said one official echoing the view of others we just 
feel that we know the iraqis well and we have a different idea 
about how to convince them to change their minds we will not stop 
trying 
in the jordanian view saddam can be persuaded to pull out of 
kuwait if the conditions allow him to emerge with some aura of 
victory among his arab followers 
iraq has said it would only talk about kuwait in the context of 
un resolutions demanding that israel withdraw from palestinian 
territories in the west bank and gaza strip 
hes already brought the palestinian issue onto the central 
stage where no one can ignore it one official noted and he 
has established his zone of influence as a geoeconomic power 
if saddam can win access to the gulf through a small part of 
what was kuwaiti territory the official said reflecting jordans 
analysis he might reverse his annexation of kuwait and withdraw 
iraq has only a short strip of coastline in the northern gulf 
and has long demanded control of the kuwaiti islands of bubiyan and 
warbah which dominate iraqs maritime outlets 
as the united states continues its military buildup and rallies 
international support for an unconditional iraqi withdrawal there 
is little chance for any such compromise the jordanians 
acknowledge 
but as saddam enhances his prestige among arabs by standing firm 
against a superior foreign force and as time hangs heavily on us 
troops in the stifling heat of the saudi arabian desert they 
expect the picture to change 
meantime king hussein is positioning his little kingdom to 
serve as moderator 
jordan habitually seeks middle ground in the middle east crises 
that swirl around it but the gulf confrontation has squeezed it 
from both sides 
western leaders charge that jordan is too close to iraq 
providing aid and comfort to an international outlaw saddam wants 
firmer support from his old friend 
whatever king hussein might feel the jordanians sympathy for 
saddams position is evident and no leader can ignore public 
opinion one senior aide said

a federal grand jury investigating allegations of 
misconduct at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant has subpoenaed 
a us department of energy watchdog committee 
merritt langston a spokesman for the advisory committee on 
nuclear facility safety said today that the subpoena was delivered 
to chairman john ahearne earlier this week 
it orders him to turn over all documents pertaining to the 
committees work at rocky flats or send a representative to 
testify or both the subpoena calls for the documents to be 
delivered monday and presented to the grand jury wednesday 
rocky flats 16 miles northwest of denver is the nations only 
manufacturer of plutonium detonating devices for nuclear warheads 
plutonium processing at the plant has been suspended since the 
beginning of this year because of safety and environmental concerns 
the ahearne committee formed two years ago to look into the 
problems recommended in june that plutonium production not resume 
before october at the earliest if national security needs 
warranted it 
the denver grand jury investigation began aug 1 1989 two 
months after agents of the fbi the environmental protection agency 
and the department of energy raided the plant looking for 
violations of regulations the grand jury has issued non in rubber dinghies 
before dawn and 
fought their way into jaffna fort said defense secretary gen 
cyril ranatunga 
ten soldiers were also wounded in the battle for the fort where 
more than 200 policemen and soldiers had been trapped military 
officials said on condition of anonymity 
an air force plane providing air cover crashed into the lagoon 
after the siege was broken military officials said the pilot of 
the singleengine italianmade marchetti plane was thought to have 
died officials blamed the crash on engine failure 
there was no immediate word from the tamil tiger rebels or any 
independent report from jaffna where communications have been 
severed for three months the 17th century fort had been besieged 
since june 11 when the tamil guerrillas broke a ceasefire and 
renewed their separatist war against the sinhalesedominated 
government 
the assaulting battle group has now successfully relieved the 
fort and is consolidating and clearing adjacent areas the 
military statement said 
officials said most of the 200 policemen and soldiers remained 
in the fort while an undisclosed number were evacuated for medical 
reasons 
they said troops were destroying rebel bunkers around the fort 
the breaking of the siege would be an important psychological 
victory for the government forces but its value would likely be 
more symbolic than practical 
the rest of jaffna town is tiger territory and so is most of 
the surrounding jaffna peninsula jaffna is 185 miles northeast of 
colombo 
nevertheless the massive fort a classic of military 
architecture with a moat drawbridge watch towers and 20foot 
walls symbolizes sinhalese power in the tamildominated peninsula 
during the siege helicopters dropped food to the men trapped 
inside drinking water was provided in the form of ice blocks 
which quickly melted in the tropical heat at least twice 
helicopter pilots braved rebel flak to land at the fort and pick up 
seriously wounded policemen and soldiers 
having taken the fort the governments next task is to take the 
town of jaffna which has been a tiger stronghold since the 
insurrection started in 1983 
the government opened talks last year to try to negotiate a 
peaceful settlement with the tigers who say they need a separate 
homeland to protect the tamil minority from discrimination by the 
sinhalese majority 
the government says more than 3000 people have been killed in 
the last three months bringing the death toll of the 7yearold 
insurrection to at least 14000 
the northeast is the home of most of sri lankas tamils who 
form 18 percent of the islands population of 16 million sinhalese 
make up 75 percent of the people

the author of a new book claims the jewish prophet 
moses was known to ancient egyptians as ikhnaton the ruler and 
religious reformer 
i am convinced that i have identified moses as ikhnaton the 
prophet poet and king in the 14th century bc who shut the 
temples of the ancient gods sent the priests home and declared 
there was only one god said ahmed osman 
his book moses pharaoh of egypt was published in britain 
on thursday by grafton books the us rights are under negotiation 
osmans first book in 1987 stranger in the valley of kings 
theorized that the mummy of a royal official named yuya was joseph 
the biblical figure with the coat of many colors who led the tribe 
of israel into egypt 
osman 55 an egyptian who has pursued research in egyptology 
and the bible in london for 25 years is regarded by academics as a 
controversial but respected outsider 
younes ahmed elbatrik cultural counselor at the egyptian 
embassy held a reception thursday night to launch osmans book 
its a very interesting subject and a very controversial book and 
i will be interested to hear what the experts say about it he 
said 
in identifying moses with ikhnaton osman builds on sigmund 
freuds last book moses and monotheism in which the father of 
psychoanalysis commented on the similarity of the teachings of the 
two ancients 
sydney leperer a senior history lecturer at jews college 
university of london said of osmans ikhnatonmoses theory 
there is a faint possibility that it is true although i have my 
doubts 
naim dangoor editor of the scribe a journal on babylonian 
jewry said he had read and reviewed both of osmans books osman 
knows a great deal about the period and his theories invite 
further investigation dangoor said 
osman said in an interview that scholars had always had 
difficulty establishing links between any of the important figures 
in the old testament and egyptian history 
i believe that moses had an israelite mother and an egyptian 
father he said 
he was the son of pharaoh amenhotep iii and queen tiye 
daughter of joseph the patriarch tiyes first son had mysteriously 
disappeared so when moses was born tiye sent him by water for 
safekeeping to her israelite relatives i think that was the origin 
of the story that moses was found in the bulrushes on the nile 
after 17 years as pharaoh ikhnaton was deposed and succeeded by 
the boy prince tutankhamen 
i believe ikhnaton survived and went into exile in sinai with 
a few followers osman said when the oppressor pharaoh 
horemheb died ikhnaton saw his chance to regain his throne as 
there was no heir he challenged horemhebs general ramses for 
the throne but ramses attacked him and forced him to flee the 
flight was the exodus in 1333 bc 
ikhnaton and his followers attempted to enter canaan the 
promised land but were slaughtered by ramses successor seti i 
this fight is recorded in the temple of karnak in luxor the 
author said 
jewish narratives are silent on any blood connection between 
moses and egypt because of memories of the oppression osman 
believes however the talmud the jewish law indicates that 
moses became a king and was forced to abdicate he added 
eric uphill an egyptologist at londons university college 
said he helped and supported osmans research because he regarded 
osman as a serious student with extensive knowledge 
osmans manuscript was based on the right sources for egyptian 
history uphill said but he would not comment on the conclusions 
without further study 
the problem with moses is that the historical truth about him 
is very unclear and lends itself to many theories some of them 
haywire leperer said 
dangoor said moses death is a mystery that is not resolved in 
the exodus accounts osmans explanation that he was killed by 
seti i is very plausible dangoor said

the white house denied thursday that the us 
ambassador to iraq gave president saddam hussein any reason to 
think president bush would look the other way if iraq invaded 
kuwait 
its pretty ludicrous to suggest that any time any place we 
would find it comfortable to have them invade kuwait the basic 
implication is that somehow the us would be willing to look the 
other way or would have condoned this kind of action said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
that is ludicrous and stupid he said 
but fitzwater acknowledged that the administration before the 
aug 2 invasion was trying to develop better ties with iraq 
fitzwaters comments came in response to reporters questions 
about an iraqi transcript of a conversation between us ambassador 
april glaspie and saddam a week before the invasion 
us officials have not denied the authenticity of the 
transcript in which glaspie reassured saddam that the united 
states had no official position on arabarab conflicts like your 
border disagreement with kuwait according to a version published 
by the washington post 
she reflected united states policy fitzwater said 
at that time we were trying to nurture relations with iraq 
he said when asked if glaspie indicated the united states would not 
intervene in iraqs border dispute with kuwait 
on july 31 just three days before the invasion assistant 
secretary of state john h kelly gave the same answer in testimony 
on capitol hill as he argued against imposing trade sanctions on 
iraq 
we have historically avoided taking any position on border 
disputes or internal opec deliberations kelly said 
another official explained us thinking on the iraqkuwait 
conflict before the invasion 
neighbors have had disputes over boundaries and borders for 
years its not for us to intervene but its a big 
difference when a country actually invades another said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
fitzwater said glaspie a career diplomat has been stationed at 
a state department desk working on the iraq matter in washington 
since the invasion he said that doesnt reflect any 
dissatisfaction with her performance 
we believe ambassador glaspie is an outstanding 
professional fitzwater said she has represented her country 
well and correctly 
she was in london en route to washington when the invasion 
occurred in washington she was told not to return to baghdad 
where joseph c wilson iii heads the embassy in her absence 
glaspie has met with bush two or three times on the matter and 
is active in state department deliberations on strategy fitzwater 
said adding that she consults daily with her colleagues in baghdad 
we believe its most useful that she remain here to help with 
our analysis and also that we not send a signal that its business 
as usual with iraq fitzwater said 
he did not dispute the report that saddam had made menacing 
comments to glaspie in their july 25 meeting in baghdad suggesting 
that the united states should not oppose iraqi aims in the middle 
east 
the fact is that saddam hussein has lied to everyone in the 
world including egyptian president hosni mubarak and jordans 
king hussein fitzwater said the whole world was misled in that 
sense

farmers in two towns attacked riot police with 
eggs beer bottles and clubs thursday wounding at least eight 
officers during mass protests against lowpriced meat imports 
police in nevers responded with tear gas as some of an estimated 
10000 marchers tried to tear down a fence around a government 
building 
in chateaureaux also in central france police sprayed tear gas 
and jets of water to disperse more than 1200 farmers who set fire 
to bales of hay and hurled eggs tomatoes firecrackers and stones 
at the officers 
during recent months french farmers have hijacked numerous 
livestock trucks and butchered or burned alive hundreds of animals 
in a campaign against lowpriced lamb and beef imports from 
britain east germany and elsewhere 
at a news conference coinciding with thursdays clashes 
agriculture minister henri nallet said the government would 
announce a substantial emergency aid plan for farmers within 
the next few days he declined to discuss the size of the aid 
package and appealed for an end to the violence 
farmers came from throughout central france to nevers the home 
of finance minister pierre beregovoy 
at one point during an hourlong confrontation a group of 
farmers attacked a police unit with clubs injuring one officer who 
was taken away in an ambulance in all eight policemen reportedly 
were injured several by bottles hurled at them 
before dispersing farmers set fire to tires near the city hall 
and tore down several traffic signs 
an estimated 1000 policemen were deployed along the march 
route many residents heeded authorities advice to close shops 
along the route and at about 4 pm police blocked off the 
entrances to the downtown area to keep out motorists 
the march was organized to demand increased government support 
for farmers whose earnings have dropped because of a drought as 
well as the influx of imports 
in strasbourg the european parliament on thursday urged the 
european community to take emergency measures to control the recent 
fall in farm prices 
prices of meat vegetables and dairy products have dropped as a 
result of east german produce coming onto the market faster than 
anticipated 
most the attacks by french farmers have been targeted at 
shipments from britain on wednesday leaders of french and british 
farmers unions agreed to urge the ec to adopt emergency measures 
to prevent further escalation of the dispute 
they urged tighter restrictions on beef imports from eastern 
europe larger purchases of surplus meat and speedier payments of 
subsidies for sheep farmers

former president reagan was warmly 
welcomed by west german leaders thursday in a city where large 
crowds once protested his visits 
in this historic hour when german unity is becoming reality it 
is right that you a great friend of our country are here 
chancellor helmut kohl told reagan who is on a 10day trip with 
scheduled stops in poland the soviet union and italy 
reagan thanked kohl for a 6000pound slab of the berlin wall 
that is now displayed in the presidential library in simi valley 
calif 
kohl said reagan help encourage the democratic reforms that led 
to reunification of east and west germany set for oct 3 
some of the largest european protests against reagans 
presidency were staged in bonn 
reagans may 1985 attendance at an international economic summit 
was overshadowed by a controversy when he and kohl visited a war 
cemetery in bitburg where nazi officers are buried 
in 1982 at the height of the dispute over stationing us 
nuclear missiles in western europe about 200000 west germans 
massed in bonn to protest a visit by reagan 
but on thursday an honor guard greeted reagan 79 and his 
wife nancy as they arrived in a convoy of black limousines at 
president richard von weizsaeckers official residence overlooking 
the rhine river 
sunshine for you von weizsaeckers wife marianne told 
reagan 
the reagans traveled to bonn following a visit to berlin where 
the former president chipped at the remnants of the berlin wall 
with a hammer and chisel

a canadian forces aurora plane 
spotted debris today floating in the north atlantic near where a 
peruvian boeing 727 carrying 16 people is believed have ditched two 
days earlier 
transport canada spokesman dick pepper said the aurora crew 
sighted the debris 240 miles southeast of cape race 
a coast guard ship was dispatched to the scene to recover the 
debris pepper said 
earlier pepper said the rain and fog off newfoundlands south 
coast was hampering the search for the airliner 
the jet owned by faucett airlines of peru and carrying peruvian 
airline crew members and their relatives disappeared tuesday 
afternoon about 200 miles offshore after the pilot radioed that he 
was short of fuel 
the plane was headed for a refueling stop in gander 
newfoundland en route to miami from the mediterranean island of 
malta 
if it ditched successfully there was only a slim chance the 
plane would be afloat after two days pepper said but if the plane 
was equipped with life rafts as the 727 often is the crew could 
have escaped he said

iraq warned the united states today of 
possible terrorist attacks against american targets in retaliation 
for what it called crimes and insults against the arab and 
islamic nations 
the warning came in a memorandum handed to the us charge 
daffaires in baghdad the official iraqi news agency reported 
the agency monitored in nicosia said the iraqi memorandum was 
in response to a message given to the iraqi foreign ministry in 
baghdad on wednesday the report said the message was from the us 
government and was delivered by the us charge daffaires 
the us message claimed that certain terrorist groups which 
have bases in iraq and are supported by iraq are preparing for 
attacks against targets of the united states and its friends ina 
said 
according to the news agency the us message warned in the 
event of an attack of that sort president saddam hussein should 
know that the united states will hold him personally responsible 
the iraqi government categorically denies the american 
claims todays iraqi message said according to the news agency 
it added the american government and president bush should 
expect that the crimes the united states of america is committing 
against the arab nation and the insult it is directing to the 
islamic shrines by occupying holy lands will undoubtedly produce a 
natural reaction from thearab and islamic masses it was 
delivered by nizar hamdoun undersecretary of the foreign ministry 
the news agency said 
the united states has massed troops in saudi arabia along that 
countrys borders with iraq and kuwait in response to baghdads 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the iraqi agency quoted the memorandum as saying the 
allegations indicated that the united states is looking for a 
pretext for an aggression against iraq 
iraq reserves its legitimate right to selfdefense to 
reciprocate and to retaliate firmly against these parties if it 
becomes target of an aggression ina quoted the memorandum as 
saying 
fears of terrorist attacks have been fueled by saddams calls 
for jihad or islamic holy war against the usled multinational 
forces that have assembled in saudi arabia 
iran joined wednesday in calling for jihad to force the 
americans out of saudi arabia which houses islams holiest shrines 
at mecca and medina 
saddam has garnered support among arabs by portraying the us 
intervention in the gulf as an invasion rather than a move to 
protect saudi arabia 
his attempt to link an iraqi pullout from kuwait to israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied territories has brought him support 
among palestinians 
the popular front for the liberation of palestine once strongly 
opposed to saddams wing of the arab bath socialist party recently 
moved its headquarters from syria iraqs archrival to baghdad 
the group headed by george habash gained fame in the early 
1970s after a series of plane hijackings to dramatize the 
palestinian cause 
another palestinian leader mohammed abbas architect of the 
hijack of the achille lauro cruise liner in 1985 also has 
headquarters in iraq

attacks against targets of the united states and its friends the

claims 
but it sai the american government and president bush should 
expect that the crimes the united states of america is committing 
against the arab nation and the insult it is directing to the 
islamic shrines by occupying holy lands will undoubtedly produce a

its support of terrorists but damascus is an ally in the desert

which after an eightyear war is showing signs it could help saddam 
poke holes in a unordered trade embargo enforced by dozens of 
us and other warships

report that iran had agreed to send food and other supplies to iraq 
in exchange for oil saddam earlier this week offered free oil for 
third world nations

up for use as human shields to deter a feared us attack are being 
moved continually all are believed held in iraq 
about 1400 americans remain in kuwait while there are about 200 
in iraq according to official estimates

deep among the more than than 400 women and children who comprised 
the latest planeload of westerners allowed to leave baghdad by iraq 
authorities 
all had reached the iraq capital from kuwait 
one british woman who arrived in london on the iraqi airways 747

him he was then pushed back into the car and they drove him round 
again and did the same threatening to kill him again they were 
terrorizing him just for the sheer hell of it

kuwaitis the iraqis are shooting people and burning their houses 
down for writing slanderous graffiti against them mrs ahmed

resistance fighters were occasionally firing on civilians 
this has been happening for the past three or four days he 
said the iraqi government asked everyone to go to work the 
kuwaiti resistance asked everyone not to go to work but schools 
opened and the iraqis asked all teachers to go to work the other 
day the kuwaiti resistance shot a teacher and his wife for going to 
work

months the us commander in saudi arabia was quoted today as 
saying 
thats about a month later than earlier reported

washington a company stuck with four multimilliondollar 
furnaces that the bush administration first approved and then 
disapproved for shipment to iraq filed a 62 million suit thursday 
against saddam husseins government 
the federal court suit by consarc corp claims that saddams 
invasion of kuwait and iraqi deception over how the 
hightemperature furnaces would be used resulted in losses for the 
industrial furnace builder and its sister company in scotland 
consarc of rancocas nj cited us assertions that the 
equipment could help give iraq the ability to make nuclear weapons 
two of the furnaces were to be shipped from the united states and 
two others from scotland 
president bush told congress on tuesday that his administration 
had stopped shipment of the furnaces even before the international 
embargo imposed after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
iraq says the furnaces were to be used to produce badly needed 
artificial limbs for casualties in its long war with iran 
bush told congress the furnaces had the potential to 
contribute to iraqs nuclear capability 
the commerce department however had given permission for their 
shipment and the first furnace was stopped at a philadelphia dock 
july 20 after concerns were raised by members of congress and the 
defense department 
commerce had approved the shipment even though consarc had 
informed government officials as early as february 1989 when the 
contract was being drawn up that the furnaces could be used to 
melt materials for use in nuclear weapons according to documents 
obtained by the associated press last month 
the company could still seek legal redress against the us 
government for its actions in approving and then blocking the 
shipment but consarc has indicated it has no such plans 
the suit asks for 7 million in losses and up to 55 million in 
punitive damages against iraq the original 11 million contract to 
purchase the furnaces was accompanied by a statement from iraq that 
they would be used for work in material science technology and 
not for any nuclear application 
but consarc said it was advised on july 20 by the us 
government that iraq had made misleading representations about the 
intended use of the furnaces and that they were actually to be used 
for the production of nuclear and other military weapons 
earlier this month iraqs ambassador to washington mohamed 
sadiq almashat issued a statement denying that any military use 
was planned for the furnaces 
iraq needs these furnaces to purify melt and cast metals to 
be used in producing artificial limbs for the thousands of 
unfortunate people who lost limbs during the eightyear war with 
iran and finds it most inhumane to prevent or delay the 
acquisition of equipment that will be used for their benefit the 
ambassador said 
the suit filed in us district court accuses the iraqi 
ministry of industry and minerals of fraudulently inducing consarc 
to build and ship the furnaces without disclosing that they were 
destined for a militaryindustrial complex outside baghdad 
the treasury department authorized the lawsuit which is a first 
step required before consarc can seek to receive payment from iraqi 
funds deposited in the united states and great britain

red lobsters once adorned maine license 
plates now theres talk of stamping them out with a bear paw 
print 
the university of maine alumni association wants to persuade the 
legislature to approve an idea to reward university supporters with 
vanity license plates bearing some likeness of the school mascot 
as a schmaltzy alumni director id like to see a black bear 
or bear paw print said h maxwell burry executive director of 
the association 
the suggestion comes months after the legislature approved a 
bill allowing motorists to obliterate the red lobster now on maine 
tags so long as the numbers and letters stay intact 
some people think the likeness of the lobster crawling across 
maine plates since 1987 gives the wrong impression that maine is a 
place for the rich 
the schools alumni would be able to get the vanity plates by 
paying an extra fee which would go back to the alumni association 
the university trustees will consider the bear paw proposal monday

the united states hopes to begin 
rotating troops in saudi arabia to give them a break from the 
desert heat and allow them a chance to see their families 
americas top military officer said today 
gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said after a whirlwind tour of several american base camps morale 
was remarkably high despite the harsh conditions 
but at each stop he faced at least one question on the expected 
length of the us deployment in the desert and at a news 
conference after his visits powell was unable to provide an 
answer 
i want to get you home as fast as possible but bear with me 
he told members of the 24th infantry division mechanized i 
cant give you an exact date but dont think i ever forget 
that you have loved ones back home 
at the news conference powell said the us deployment was 
behind schedule because of trouble with ships and the militarys 
limited airlift capacity 
but overall he said the deployment of well well over 
100000 american troops and thir equipment had gone well 
asked about pay cuts faced by many of the troops powell said he 
empathized with the troops and their families but had to be sure 
any resolution treated soldiers deployed in other dangerous 
locations of the world equally 
the loss of the basic allowance for subsistence has been cited 
by many troops as a potential morale problem joining the heat 
boredom and separation from families on what appears to be a 
growing list 
but powell said that during his eighthour tour of us camps he 
found the troops adjusting rather well 
he said he could not say how long the us deployment would 
last but said he told troops well try to get you home as soon 
as possible and we will start rotations as soon as possible 
he did not say when that might be 
powell was spending the night in nearby bahrain and planned to 
visit a navy ship on friday

congress took its first step toward longterm 
forest protection legislation thursday as a house subcommittee 
approved a bill opposed by both environmentalists and the timber 
industry 
on a 1913 vote the house interior subcommittee on national 
parks and public lands approved a bill by chairman rep bruce 
vento dminn 
industry leaders oppose the proposed ancient forest act of 1990 
because it would establish a forest preserve where logging would be 
banned at least temporarily across 63 million acres of the pacific 
northwest 
environmentalists are critical of the proposal because it would 
set minimum timber harvest levels that they argue are too high to 
protect the future of the oldgrowth forest ecosystems 
ventos bill includes logging prohibitions across about 3 
million acres of northwest forests that a panel of government 
scientists said in april are critical to the survival of the 
threatened northern spotted owl 
the measure moves to the full house interior committee

the internal revenue service disclosed 
thursday that its failure to sign 31 documents could cost 226 
million in lost taxes 
the agency confirmed a report by a private group the coalition 
of irs whistleblowers that the errors had been made but the irs 
rejected the coalitions estimate that the mistakes involved 1 
million tax returns and 13 billion or more in revenue 
in fact said irs spokesman frank keith the foulup involved 
10700 tax returns and additional tax assessments totaling 46 
million since the problem was discovered he said the irs has 
issued new assessments for 234 million in 7600 of those cases 
keith said the threeyear statute of limitations has expired in 
the other 3100 cases involving a maximum of 226 million much 
of which already has been paid by taxpayers any of that money paid 
during the last two years will be refunded without further action 
by the taxpayer keith said adding that the agency has no 
authority to rebate payments made more than two years ago 
keith said the problem involves irs form 23c a summary document 
or cover letter that form must be signed before additional taxes 
can be assessed against the tax returns to which it is attached 
one form can cover hundreds of thousands of returns and other tax 
documents 
the irs discovered recently that 31 of those forms had not been 
signed over the last five years 
paul desfosses president of the private group affiliated with 
the church of scientology told a news conference wednesday this 
incredible mistake makes the shredding and toiletbowl flushing of 
tax returns in past years look trivial in comparison 
the coalition composed principally of former irs employees 
obtained 25 pages of internal irs documents dated april 12 1990 
that explained to field offices how the snafu should be handled 
since the assessments were not properly made all subsequent 
actions taken in reliance on a properly assessed liability were 
invalid one document reads 
the same document cautions that if the validity of our 
assessments is suspect we will be faced with constant challenges 
to our collections actions we must ensure that taxpayer 
contacts are handled timely consistently and professionally to 
minimize any loss of confidence by the public 
keith said that during the fiveyear period when 31 forms 23c 
were not signed the irs properly processed 20000 of them and 
assessed additional taxes in 250 million cases 
however we expect taxpayers to follow the law and we have to 
do the same thing keith added fair play requires that we make 
refunds in these cases where the law allows 
in estimating that the mistake could cost the government 13 
billion or more the coalition relied on a sample form 23c that 
covered one weeks work at the irs service center in ogden utah 
that form summarized 256054 returns and other tax documents and 
authorized additional assessments totaling 26 billion 
the coalition knew that five of the 31 unsigned forms were 
weekly compilations 26 were daily reports and concluded that if 
the weekly report from ogden was typical the five forms could 
cover assessments of 13 billion or more the irs statement 
indicates the ogden report actually was far larger than the 
average

in a quiet hollow of the berkshires where 
the clear waters of the north river chatter over smooth brown 
stones one of the last covered bridges in massachusetts is about 
to make a move 
this weekend three teams of oxen will haul the arthur a smith 
bridge off its moorings and onto the riverbank for repairs 
townsfolk want to restore the rickety structure to the days when 
wagonloads of lumber rumbled over its sturdy planks and courting 
couples stole kisses in its dark recesses 
we lose so much of our heritage says arnold graton who is 
overseeing the move and restoration weve got to keep striving 
to hold on to what there is left 
to fix up their tattered bridge residents of this tiny farming 
community in the foothills of the berkshires have held raffles 
sold tshirts and sought donations in their quest to restore the 
last survivor of the 18 covered bridges that once dotted colrains 
landscape

has been closed since 1982 
so far 30000 has been raised and supporters believe they can 
get the remaining 70000 in the one to two years estimated for 
repair 
in preparation for sundays move workers have lifted the 
99foot bridge up on blocks of timber and slipped smooth round logs 
underneath ready to roll the timbers eaten away by moisture are 
bound together with stout cables 
you sometimes wonder what keeps the old bridge together 
because its pretty tender said graton whose family has 
specialized in the art of moving and restoring covered bridges for 
35 years 
to keep things authentic graton will bring in three teams of 
oxen for the big move 
the oldtimers would have used oxen and that creates an event 
that todays people would never see we like to create a use for 
the old tradition he said plus the oxen are quiet and calm 
they move real slow and we cant pinch our fingers or anything 
like that 
wednesday workers shoveled loads of dirt out of the way and 
straightened out the long ramps down which the bridge will roll 
all was quiet except for the rustle of wind in the corn and the 
highpitched hum of insects except for the utility poles striding 
across the landscape it was easy to imagine the days when the 
covered bridge represented the latest in technology 
the trusses covered for protection from the elements allowed 
builders to make longer bridges and were a revolution for their 
times said david wright president of the bostonbased society for 
the preservation of covered bridges 
at one time thousands of bridges spanned rivers across the 
country but only about 850 are left he said in massachusetts 
only four of the old bridges still stand in their original sites 
in recent years the antique structures have inspired several 
savethebridge efforts and wright said the enthusiasm isnt hard 
to understand 
theyre very beautiful things they are very precious remnants 
of another way of looking at things he said

the senate judiciary committee today opened 
confirmation hearings on supreme court nominee david souter and he 
told the panel it was inappropriate to comment on the 1973 
ruling that legalized abortion 
in his opening moments as witness for his own nomination souter 
told the panel that the constitution provided an unwritten right to 
privacy the basis for the supreme courts abortion ruling of 17 
years ago 
souter began his trip through the confirmation gauntlet after 
sen joseph biden ddel the committee chairman appealed to him 
for a glimpse into your heart on issues such as privacy and 
equal rights 
the supreme court has been deeply divided in recent years with 
54 rulings on many contentious issues such as abortion and civil 
rights conservatives were hoping that if confirmed souter would 
help anchor the court firmly on the right 
speaking in a clipped new england accent souter made an opening 
pledge that if he were confirmed he would work to preserve the 
constitution and the rights it bestows for the generations that 
will follow us after we are gone from here 
sitting at a table covered by orange felt souter said he had 
learned two lessons as a judge that rulings affect individuals 
and that we had better use every power of our minds and our 
hearts and our beings to get those rulings right 
the morning session of the committee was consumed by speeches by 
the senators on the panel souter sat quietly listening to them 
biden said lawmakers had a duty to discover his views on a 
range of issues that might come before the court he did not single 
out abortion 
sen alan simpson of wyoming in sentiments echoed by other 
republicans said we are certainly not here to find out how you 
will rule on various issues before the court 
when it came time for questions biden assured souter that he 
was free to refuse to answer any he deemed improper 
with that the delaware democrat bore in on the issue of 
privacy questioning him about a case involving a married couples 
right to use birth control 
souter quickly agreed that the constitution provides an 
unenumerated right to privacy and biden said he was pleased 
to hear that 
but souter repeatedly refused to be drawn into any comment on 
the right to abortion an issue which he noted had been on 
everyones minds and lips since the moment of my nomination 
it would be inappropriate to comment on the roe vs wade 
ruling he said 
the hearings are expected to continue for at least two days 
the session was interrupted briefly when a dozen people 
claiming to represent the gay rights group act up loudly protested 
the nomination capitol police arrested the six men and six women 
and said each had been charged with disrupting a congressional 
hearing and demonstrating within a capitol building 
souter is a former new hampshire attorney general who was 
confirmed to federal appeals court earlier this year he remains 
something of a legal enigma to the many conservative and liberal 
groups who have scoured his record since his nomination on july 23 
to succeed retiring justice william brennan 
the american bar association has given souter its top rating for 
qualifications some groups including the national organization 
for women have come out against souter while others have reserved 
judgment there has been no outcry from liberals similar to the one 
that preceded the rejection of robert borks nomination during the 
reagan administration however and no predictions that the 
democraticcontrolled senate will defeat the nomination 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said he was concerned there was 
little in his record that demonstrates real solicitude for the 
rights of those who are weakest and most powerless in our 
society 
the burden of proof rests with those who support a 
nomination he said calling on souter to make his positions 
clear 
sen strom thurmond rsc said the questioning should not 
include direct questioning about sensitive issues that may come 
before the court 
democrat howard metzenbaum of ohio said the white house had 
sought to reassure the gop right wing that souter was their kind of 
nominee does john sununu know something which we dont he 
said referring to bushs chief of staff 
we are not asking for any commitments as to how you would rule 
on any specific case biden said as he gaveled the televised 
hearings into session nor are we trying to pry into your 
personal views on publicly debated issues 
biden said that while he was not seeking commitments from 
souter he was determined to learn more about his views 
we want to know what principles you would apply what 
philosophies you would employ as you exercise the awesome power 
you will hold if you are confirmed as a justice of the us supreme 
court 
biden said this is a moment in history when the courts 
longterm direction is at stake 
at this fateful moment in our history we have a right to know 
and a duty to discover precisely what you judge david hackett 
souter think about the great constitutional questions of our 
time 
these he said include the right to privacy equal rights for 
women and all races and first amendment protections of speech and 
religion 
the 50yearold federal appeals judges approach to the law is 
undoubtedly conservative but theres not enough in the record to 
say for example how he would vote on the 1973 abortion rights 
ruling now being challenged by the bush administration 
in addition many of the judges friends are political moderates 
or liberals 
since being chosen by bush on july 23 to replace brennan souter 
paid courtesy calls on committee members but he sidestepped issues 
with either them or the news media saying he would wait for his 
confirmation hearings 
souter is a tough fairminded intellectually brilliant 
judge president bush said following a meeting with souter 
wednesday

the house on thursday postponed action on the 
283 billion defense bill as congressional and white house 
negotiators held out the possibility of an agreement on trimming 
the federal deficit 
lawmakers remained optimistic about resolving sometime soon the 
drawnout dispute over how to pare 50 billion from the budget for 
the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
a key component of any agreement would be the total for military 
spending in fiscal 1991 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters the 
postponement was designed to give our negotiators a little 
opportunity work on the defense bill will resume monday 
afternoon 
the postponement was an acknowledgment of the logistical 
problems the house has avoided for the last two days 
action on the bill has involved general debate during the day 
and votes in the late afternoon a move designed to prevent 
interruptions of budget negotiators meetings at andrews air force 
base 20 minutes from the capitol 
on thursday however much of the general debate on the 
legislation had been completed and votes were scheduled throughout 
the day on such thorny issues as the strategic defense initiative 
meanwhile the white house which already has threatened a veto 
of the bill because it would cut troop strength and end the b2 
stealth bomber program criticized a measure the house approved 
wednesday on us troops in japan 
we dont believe thats an appropriate way to conduct foreign 
policy said presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
frustrated by japans delay in giving 1 billion to the us 
pesian gulf operation which could cost up to 15 billion in the 
next year the house agreed wednesday to require tokyo to pay all 
the costs of stationing us forces on its soil or begin losing 
the troops 
the amendment was one of three burdensharing proposals added to 
the bill by lawmakers who have lashed out at americas friends and 
their contributions to the campaign against iraq some members of 
congress complain that us allies should pay for a greater share 
of the persian gulf operation 
fitzwater noted that the vote does express the sentiment of 
the congress i think japan is aware of the general feeling in the 
congress toward some of their activities

irans reported foodforoil deal with 
its old adversary iraq could allow tehran to boost its oil exports 
and earn nearly 2 billion more a year at current prices oil 
experts said thursday 
that would be a bonus for cashstrapped iran which has already 
gained politically from the gulf crisis and reportedly made 
economic gains as well 
a wellinformed source in tehran said tuesday that iran had 
agreed to allow humanitarian shipments of food and medicine 
into neighboring iraq despite un sanctions imposed following 
iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 2 
he said that in return iraq agreed to give iran 200000 barrels 
of refined iraqi oil a day for free and pay an undisclosed amount 
of money 
the source said the deal was struck during a visit sunday by 
iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz 
he said iraq offered to pay in oil for essentials tehran allowed 
across the border he said iran refused to accept full payment in 
oil but agreed to take up to 200000 barrels a day of refined 
products 
aziz the first senior iraqi official to visit iran in 15 years 
was accompanied by oil minister isam abdulrahim chalabi 
the tehran times a daily newspaper close to iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjanis government denied that iran would take iraqi 
oil 
it quoted an unidentified informed source in tehran as 
saying the government had not decided whether to allow shipments 
into iraq 
us state department officials said they believe tehran will 
abide by the sanctions as it has said it would 
the tehran times quoted its source as saying that if iran 
decided to allow shipments into iraq it is only out of 
humanitarian considerations as we believe innocent iraqi people 
are not rsponsible for their governments move 
pierre terzian editor of the parisbased newsletter 
petrostrategies said in a telephone interview that iran probably 
could supply enough food to the right people and places to keep the 
iraqi economy going for awhile 
irans oil refineries damaged during the 198088 war with iraq 
are producing about 600000 barrels of fuel and other products a 
day 
domestic demand is about 750000 barrels so the iranians have 
been importing 150000 barrels a day paid for in scarce foreign 
currency 
by bringing in refined oil from iraq oil experts say tehran 
would be able to halt costly imports of refined products and sell 
an equivalent amount of its own crude on top of its current 
exports 
peter bogin associate director for oil markets at cambridge 
energy research associates in paris said that at 25 a barrel 
200000 barrels of oil could bring in 5 million dollars a day for 
iran 
iran is currently pumping about 31 million barrels of oil a 
day its maximum capacity 
bogin said the reported iranian move was probably more a 
gesture to iraq than an effort to capitalize on baghdads plight 
iran must be considering its geographical position next to 
iraq he said 
desmond harney an expert on iran with the londonbased middle 
east consultants said that irans move also was probably motivated 
by domestic politics 
the iranian hierarchy is split between socalled pragmatists 
who want to normalize ties with the west and attract investment and 
technology and antiwestern radicals who insist on continued 
hostility toward the west

the bush administration voiced strong 
objections thursday to legislation that would authorize a 60 
million payment to the seneca nation and allow a new york community 
to continue leasing the indian land 
the bill introduced by rep amo houghton rny calls for a 
federal payment of 35 million and a new york state payment of 25 
million as compensation for inequities under the former agreement 
which in some cases resulted in rents as low as 1 a year 
but walter r mills deputy to the assistant secretary of indian 
affairs in the department of the interior told the interior and 
insular affairs committee that the administration opposes an 
agreement reached by the city of salamanca and the indian nation to 
replace a 99year lease that expires feb 19 1991 
the united states is being asked to commit 35 million as 
compensation to the seneca nation for a lease arrangement approved 
100 years ago by an act of congress mills said it is not 
clear that the federal government is liable under the terms of the 
lease agreement 
in 1890 congress approved the 99year leases on seneca land in 
western new york at extremely low rents with no provision for 
raising the payments 
no amount of money could compensate us for what we have 
lost said dennis lay president of the seneca nation 
nevertheless the 60 million we are to receive under the 
settlement will enable the nation to make great progress in vital 
social and economic areas

in some years past delegates to the annual 
soldiers of fortune convention have had to search the globe to find 
wars worth fighting and enemies worth killing 
there is no such dilemma this year 
for the mercenary set the persian gulf crisis is the stuff that 
dreams are made of there has been dreaming aplenty this week at 
the convention sponsored by soldier of fortune magazine the 
boulder colobased publiciation that appeals to veterans 
mercenaries and those with a richly violent fantasy life 
iraqi president saddam hussein was the central figure at this 
years convention albeit in absentia delegates were generally in 
agreement that hussein must be taken out whether it be by the 
military his own commanders or a black bag operation 
hes gotta be taken out one way or the other said retired 
army lt col robert brown editor and publisher of soldier of 
fortune 
most likely someone in his group will assassinate him 
predicted ray cline a professor at georgetown university and a 
former deputy director of the central intelligence agency 
assassination is a way of life in that regime hes an assassin 
himself 
i think his next step will be unleashing a wave of 
antiamerican terrorism predicted cline who was with the cia 
during the cuban missile crisis we have to treat him like a 
deranged murderer 
brown a special forces leader in vietnam refers to the iraqi 
leader as saddam insane calling him a wily foxy zealot he 
says he knows of americans who have been approached about taking 
out saddam in a black bag or covert assassination attempt 
any such attempt is unlikely by a freelance assassin brown 
believes 
if hussein is going to be taken out it wont be by private 
effort he said wednesday as registration for the convention 
began americans dont blend into the culture of the middle east 
if its going to be done it will be done by a governmentsponsored 
effort taking him out is the only viable option 
he said any attempt would likely come from elite us forces 
working with the kuwaiti resistance in an advisory capacity 
john coleman of boulder said he believes the united states could 
carry out a hit on saddam 
our government and allied governments have remarkable assets 
available to them coleman said we are capable of doing a hit 
absolutely 
tim dawdy of troutdale ore called saddam another twobit 
tinhorn who will take care of himself in time 
if the us thinks he is a liability if he is going to be 
eliminated i think we should have someone walk up and shoot him 
 
brown said the us had taken the stance that it would not 
initiate a conflict with iraq 
im not sure were going to have that luxury he said

here is the opening statement by supreme court 
nominee david souter before the senate judiciary committee on 
thursday 
ok mr chairman sen thurmond and other members of the 
committee as you know i did not ask to make a formal and 
preprepared statement but i would like to accept your invitation 
to say a few words before our dialogue together does begin 
and i would like to start maybe in a very obvious way simply by 
saying thanks for some things to begin with to thank every 
member of this committee who in the the waning and the very 
hectic days that you went through prior to the summer recess 
nonetheless found some time to see me when i came by to meet you 
in most cases for the first time and i was grateful for the 
reception and the courtesy that everyone of you gave to me 
equally obviously i would like simply to say here what ive 
already said privately this morning or at least quietly this 
morning in thanking both sen humphrey and sen rudman for their 
generosity to me in their introduction and their sponsorship of me 
before you 
and i will have to continue as i have been trying to do for the 
past seven or eight weeks now to say some adequate thanks to the 
president of the united states for the confidence that he showed in 
me in making that nomination i have not succeeded in doing that 
adequately yet but i will keep trying 
in fact i came to the notice of probably most of you on this 
committee when i stood next to the president and tried again with 
great difficulty that afternoon in late july to express some 
sense of the honor that i felt despite the despite the surprise 
and even shock of the event to me 
its equally its equally incumbent on me to try to express 
some sense of the honor that i feel today in appearing before you 
as you represent the senate of the united states in discharging 
your own responsibility to review the presidents nomination i 
could only i could only adopt what sen metzenbaum said earlier 
this morning about the the grandeur of this process of which we 
are a part 
i mentioned to you the great surprise that i had on july 23 in 
finding myself where i was i certainly found very quickly that i 
had no reason to be surprised at the interest which the united 
states and the actually a good deal of the world suddenly took in 
me as an individual 
and despite the reams of paper and i suppose the forests that 
have fallen to produce that paper in the time between july 23 i 
would like to take a minute before we begin our our dialogue 
together to say something to you about how i feel about the 
beginnings that i have come from and about the experiences that i 
have had that bear on the kind of judge that i am and the kind of 
judge that i can be expected to be 
i think you know that i spent most of my my boyhood in a small 
town in new hampshire weare nh it was a it was a town large 
in geography small in population the physical space the open 
space between people however was not matched by the by the 
inner space between them because as everybody knows who has lived 
in a small town there is there is a closeness of people in a 
small town which is unattainable anywhere else 
there was in that town no section or place or neighborhood that 
was determined by anybodys occupation or by anybodys bank 
balance 
everybody knew everybody elses business or at least thought 
they did and we were in a very true sense intimately aware of 
other lives we were aware of lives that were easy and we were 
aware of lives that were very hard 
another thing that we were aware of in that place was the 
responsibility of people to govern themselves it was a 
responsibility that they owed to themselves and it was a 
responsibility that they owed and owe to their neighbors i first 
learned about that or i first learned the practicalities of that 
when i used to go over to the town hall in weare nh on town 
meeting day and i would sit on the benches in the back of the town 
hall after school and thats where i began my lessons in practical 
government 
as i think you know i went to high school in concord nh 
which is a bigger place and i went on from there to college and to 
study law in cambridge mass and oxford england which are 
bigger places still and after i had finished law school i came 
back to new hampshire and i began the practice of law and i think 
probably its fair to say i resumed the study of practical 
government

supreme court nominee david h souter firmly 
refused to discuss his views on abortion thursday as the senate 
judiciary committee opened confirmation hearings democrats 
promised to continue pressing him on that and other controversial 
issues 
souter told senators it would be inappropriate for him to 
discuss such a hotly contested constitutional matter as abortion 
though he said he accepted the constitutional right of privacy on 
which the supreme court based its abortionlegalizing 1973 
decision roe vs wade 
the new hampshire judge nominated by president bush to be the 
courts 105th justice spoke slowly and somberly in the crowded 
senate hearing room of the position he called the greatest 
responsibility that any judge in our republic can undertake 
the court has been deeply divided in recent years with 54 
rulings on such contentious issues such as abortion and civil 
rights and conservatives are hoping that souter will help anchor 
the court firmly on the right 
if the senate of the united states believes it is right to 
confirm my nomination then i will accept those responsibilities as 
obligations to all of the people of the united states whose lives 
will be affected by my stewardship of the constitution souter 
said 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel then began the long 
process in which souter would confront questions from all 14 
committee members 
biden engaged souter in a dialogue about the right of privacy 
which although not specifically mentioned in the constitution has 
been recognized by the supreme court since a 1965 decision called 
griswold vs connecticut 
at one point souter talked about a need for the supreme court 
to follow its own precedents stating that past decisions should 
be overturned only after careful consideration 
the first question is whether the prior decision was wrong 
he said and if the court does determine its previous ruling was 
incorrect he added it should measure the degree and kind of 
reliance placed upon the ruling and the cost of overruling 
it 
souter began his testimony after sitting quietly for two hours 
while senators made opening statements 
he proved an attentive and respectful witness though hardly 
devoid of humor 
when one senator worried about his questioning time expiring 
cut souters response to a question short the nominee quipped 
youre going to turn me into a laconic yankee if you keep doing 
that 
sen edward m kennedy dmass questioned the nominee closely 
about positions he took while new hampshires attorney general and 
before that as an assistant in the attorney generals office 
kennedy focused on cases in which the state defended a literacy 
test for prospective voters and resisted federal regulations 
seeking information about hiring in state government 
in both instances souter emphasized he was acting as an 
advocate and representing a client he said both positions 
were tenable at the time in the 1970s 
earlier souter said he would view his supreme court service as 
a responsibility to make the promises of the constitution a 
reality for our time and to preserve that constitution for the 
generations that will follow us 
drawing battle lines quickly democrats advised him to open 
for us the window into your mind while republicans told him to 
keep his own counsel in facing sensitive questions 
the burden of proof is on you biden told him we have a 
right to know and a duty to discover precisely what you think 
about the great constitutional issues of our time 
he urged souter open for us the window into your mind and 
give us a little bit of a glimpse into your heart 
biden and the committees two other leading liberals kennedy 
and howard metzenbaum dohio asked souter to discuss candidly his 
views of key issues on which the supreme court is closely divided 
but sen strom thurmond of south carolina the committees 
ranking republican said his colleagues had no right to question 
a nominee about how he or she would decide a particular case it is 
inappropriate 
sen alan simpson rwyo added overly explicit questions 
are not only unwise but i believe impermissible 
reminding souter that federal judges are ethically bound not to 
publicly discuss matters that are or may be before any court 
simpson gave the judge some western advice sit deep in the 
saddle 
kennedy said little in souters record as a state judge and 
attorney general in new hampshire demonstrates real solicitude 
for the rights of those who are weakest and most powerless in our 
society 
it is the responsibility of this committee to find out whether 
judge souter is committed to these rights and other basic values 
enshrined in the constitution kennedy said that is why these 
hearings are so important 
but sen orrin hatch rutah urged the nominee to stand your 
ground when you sincerely believe you are being asked for answers 
you clearly cannot properly provide 
the hearings opening session was interrupted briefly when 12 
people six men and six women stood and shouted in protest he 
will kill women shouted one 
the demonstrators who said they were members of a gay rights 
group were hustled from the cavernous hearing room by police they 
were arrested and charged with disrupting a congressional hearing 
welcome to washington judge biden told souter after the 
outburst 
souter 50 was nominated by president bush on july 23 three 
days after justice william j brennan retired from the nations 
highest court 
although he wrote more than 200 opinions in his seven years on 
the new hampshire supreme court souter has had few if any 
occasions to write about such divisive issues as abortion civil 
rights and churchstate relations 
souter who spent more than a week last month paying courtesy 
calls to the senators who will decide his nominations fate was 
formally introduced to the committee by republican new hampshire 
sens gordon humphrey and warren rudman 
both defended his ascetic lifestyle 
the elegant pundits here inside the beltway think david souter 
may not be quite up to the big time because he drives a clunky old 
car because he believes in conserving energy by not mowing his 
lawn until it begins to block his view when he looks out his 
window humphrey said as souter smiled 
i believe youll find david souter to be as smart as anyone in 
this city

shaalan i became an ugly memory 
thursday a ghost town of tattered dustcoated tents abandoned by 
tens of thousands of asian refugees 
caravans of crowded buses their roofs piled high with the last 
possessions of shattered lives evacuated the remaining residents 
of jordans most crowded and squalid refugee camp 
we dont know where we are going some say we are going 
directly to the airport others say we are going to a new camp 
right now we dont care said mk aboobacker a young indian 
electrician who came to jordan when he could no longer find work in 
occupied kuwait 
shaalan i had become a symbol of hopelessness for the hordes who 
fled kuwait after it was invaded by iraq on aug 2 it was the 
first of three camps built along the iraqi border and once housed 
as many as 50000 people 
attention red cross show us humanity save us from this 
deadly desert read one sign that indian refugees attached to a 
light pole at shaalan i 
at the begining we barely managed to provide enough drinking 
water for everyone said laurent schopfer an official with the 
international committee of the red cross at shaalan i it was 
like a riot when the water trucks arrived 
jordanian officials said 13000 refugees left the country 
thursday and that 13000 more arrived 
salameh hammad general secretary of jordans interior ministry 
said about 40000 refugees remained in jordan and more than 360000 
others were in iraq waiting to cross into the country 
he said 589000 foreigners mostly egyptians had crossed jordan 
on their way home since the gulf crisis began un officials 
estimate there could still be 2 million foreigners in kuwait and 
iraq 
hammad said his country has spent 30 million on the crisis and 
appealed to the world for more aid 
some of shaalan is last residents were taken to ammans airport 
for flights home caravans of buses took the others 120 miles west 
across the ancient lava fields of jordans eastern desert to azraq 
i a new camp with running water and hundreds of large tents set in 
neat rows on a rocky plain 
red cross official roland sidler said the camp 50 miles west of 
amman can house 15000 refugees but is being expanded to hold 
25000 
azraq ii another new but smaller camp was being set up 1 
miles west 
when we dont have room at azraq i and ii we will transfer 
people to shaalan ii and mercy camp said hammad referring to 
two smaller betterequipped border camps 
at azraq i thursday a handful of halfdressed indians showered 
or washed their clothes under faucets while about 50 evacuees from 
shaalan i argued heatedly with jordanian officials who had taken 
their passports 
they told us we were going straight to the airport but we came 
here instead and then they took our passports said surrya 
raddimalla 37 
iqbal singh 50 told reporters conditions were better that 
there was water and food but he also showed his air india 
returntrip ticket to bombay and demanded to know why he must live 
in any camp 
i have a jordanian visa in my passport why must i suffer why 
wont they let me in singh asked 
back at shaalan i schopfer marveled at the speed with which he 
said governments and relief organizations were moving to repatriate 
the refugees officials once feared massive starvation would 
overtake relief efforts 
it only took about four days to move everyone out of this 
camp he said as he talked he strolled past piles of rotting 
garbage in the litterstrewn camp swatted at swarms of flies and 
peered inside the filthy abandoned tents 
it is really the first time we have seen how these people had 
to live he said nodding toward the bedding tins of food and 
cooking utensils left behind 
maybe they will take a bulldozer to it and bury this ugly 
memory he said

chancellor helmut kohl said thursday 
that west germany will lend a helping hand to the united states 
in the gulf showdown but he did not say whether that included 
money 
in brussels belgium an official of the european economic 
community said the foreign ministers of the 12 member nations will 
consider a proposal on monday to provide 195 billion in aid to 
jordan turkey and egypt the official spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the ec foreign ministers agreed in principle to aid for jordan 
turkey and egypt last week but no amount was disclosed the 
countries have lost trade because of the un embargo against iraq 
and kuwait 
in washington congress has been scathingly critical of japan 
and west germany for allegedly failing to shoulder their load in 
the usled military buildup following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
on aug 2 
kohl said he will discuss ways his country could assist in the 
middle east when he meets saturday with secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
germany would like to extend a helping hand to our friends in 
the united states in this very critical situation in the middle 
east he said 
he made the comments in a welcoming address for visiting former 
president reagan 
when jim baker pays us a visit on saturday i am going to 
discuss with him what we can do to help let me remind all of 
us that what the united states is doing there is of benefit to 
us kohl said 
the west german leader said he did not want his country to be 
perceived as one that benefits from its powerful exports but was 
not willing to help out in times of crisis 
this is not my policy kohl said 
earlier foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told a news 
conference that baker would be very satisfied with his trip to 
bonn 
we will lay out what we want to do and in part what we are 
already doing genscher said 
but he declined to specify how west germany would show its 
solidarity with the international effort to reverse the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait 
west germany so far has sent five minesweepers and two supply 
ships to the eastern mediterranean to support the us fleet bonn 
also has provided humanitarian aid for the tens of thousands of 
refugees stranded in jordan 
the west german government says its constitution prevents it 
from sending troops outside the nato area kohl has said he would 
seek changes to allow german forces to take part in un 
activities

i went to work for a law firm in concord nh and i practiced 
there for several years i then became as i think you know an 
assistant attorney general in the criminal division of that office 
i was then lucky to be deputy attorney general to warren rudman and 
i succeeded him as attorney general in 1976 
the experience of government though did not wait until the day 
came that i entered public as opposed to private law practice 
because although in those years of private practice i served the 
private clients of the firm i also did something in those days 
which was very common then perhaps it is less common today i know 
it is but it was an accepted part of private practice in those 
days and that was to take on a fair share of representation of 
clients who did not have the money to pay 
i remember very well that the first day that i ever spent by 
myself in a courtroom i spent in a courtroom representing a woman 
whose personal life had become such a shambles that she had lost 
the custody of her children and she was trying to get them back 
she was not the last of such clients i represented clients with 
domestic relations problems who lived sometimes it seemed to me 
in appalling circumstances 
i can remember representing a client who was trying to pull a 
life together after being evicted because she couldnt pay the 
rent and although cases like that were not the those were not 
the cases upon which the firm paid the rent those were not 
remarkable cases for lawyers in private practice in those days 
before governmentally funded legal services and they were the 
cases that we took at that time because taking them was the only 
way to make good on the supposedly open door of our courts to the 
people who needed to get inside and to get what courts had to offer 
through the justice system and i think it is fair to say that even 
i am glad it is fair to say that even today with so much 
governmentally funded legal service there are lawyers in private 
practice in our profession who are doing the same thing 
as you know i did go on to public legal service and in the 
course of doing that i met not only legislators and the 
administrators that one finds in a government but i began to 
become familiar with the criminal justice system in my state and in 
our nation i met victims and sometimes i met the survivors of 
victims i met defendants and i met that train of witnesses from 
the clergy to con artists who pass through our system and find 
themselves either willingly or unwillingly part of a search for 
truth and part of a search for those results that we try to sum up 
with the words of justice 
as you also know after those years i became a trial judge and 
my experience with the working of government in the judicial system 
broadened there because i was a trial judge of general 
jurisdiction and i saw every sort and condition of the people of 
my state that a trial court of general jurisdiction is exposed to 
i saw litigants in international commercial litigation for 
millions and i saw children who were the unwitting victims of 
domestic disputes and custody fights which somehow seemed to 
somehow seemed to defy any reasonable solution however hard we 
worked at it i saw once again the denizens of the criminal 
justice system and i saw domestic litigants i saw appellants from 
the juvenile justice system who were appealing their findings of 
delinquency 
and in fact i had maybe the one of the great experiences of 
my entire life in seeing week in and week out the members of the 
trial juries of our states who are rightly called the consciences 
of our communities and i worked with them and i learned from 
them and i will never forget my days with them 
and when those days on the trial court were over there were two 
experiences that i took away with me or two lessons that i had 
learned and the lessons remain with me today 
the first lesson simple as it is is that whatever court we are 
in whatever we are doing whether we are on a trial court or an 
appellate court at the end of our task some human being is going 
to be affected some human life is going to be changed in some way 
by what we do whether we do it as trial judges or whether we do it 
as appellate judges as far removed from the trial arena as it is 
possible to be 
the second lesson that i learned in that time is that if indeed 
we are going to be trial judges whose rulings will affect the lives 
of other people and who are going to change their lives by what we 
do we had better use every power of our minds and our hearts and 
our beings to get those rulings right 
and i am conscious of those two lessons as i have been for all 
of the years that i was on an appellate court i am conscious of 
them as i sit here today suddenly finding myself the nominee of 
the president of the united states to undertake the greatest 
responsibility that any judge in our republic can undertake the 
responsibility to join with eight other people to make the promises 
of the constitution a reality for our time and to preserve that 
constitution for the generations that will follow us after we are 
gone from here 
and i am mindful of those two lessons when i tell you this that 
if you believe and the senate of the united states believes that 
it is right to confirm my nomination then i will accept those 
responsibilities as obligations to all of the people in the united 
states whose lives will be affected by my stewardship of the 
constitution 
thank you mr chairman

the pentagon will close well over 100 
military facilities overseas over the next few years defense 
secretary dick cheney said thursday 
cheney gave no specifics about the type of facilities he was 
referring to but he said the bulk of the cutbacks would be in 
western europe 
the secretary made the remark at a questionandanswer session 
following a speech before the air force association and the 
comstock club in sacramento calif 
queried why the administration had begun cutting back on 
domestic bases instead of sites in korea the philippines or japan 
cheney replied 
within the next couple of weeks i will announce well over 100 
facilities overseas where us forces are now deployed that will 
in fact be closed over the next couple of years 
the secretary said that most of those would involve sites in 
western europe 
the closings will be in line with expected reductions in us 
forces in europe given prospects for an agreement with the soviet 
union on reducing conventional forces cheney said 
so the idea that were only closing bases at home simply isnt 
a valid one because there will be significant ones closures 
overseas the secretary said 
a pentagon spokesman glenn flood said in washington that 
cheney was using the word facilities rather than bases that 
could mean that cheney would propose closing several facilities 
within a particular base such as a school hospital or other type 
of unit the spokesman said 
in january cheney recommended closing or scaling back 72 
domestic bases and 14 overseas facilities 
the pentagon doesnt need congressional approval to close 
overseas facilities 
cheney defended domestic base closings as a necessary part of 
the longterm reduction in defense spending 
it is not a pleasant task to be the one who has to preside 
over that cheney said but the secretary said that there is no 
question such cuts are coming given the nations budget woes 
the only way i know to cut the defense budget is to seriously 
go about the business of trying to downsize the force to cut force 
structure to cut procurement and to cut the infrastructure the 
base structure that goes with it cheney said 
if i do what many in congress want me to do which is to 
protect and preserve all the bases keep all the jobs open on all 
the assembly lines and all the defense jobs in america the thing 
that ends up getting cut is our forces such as the units we just 
sent to saudi arabia he said

police spokesman 
israeli howitzer batteries in the security zone also shelled the 
hezbollahcontrolled villages of ein altineh and maidoun near

sovietdesigned katyusha rockets

executions this week in oklahoma and illinois 
may be signaling an era of more frequent use of the death penalty 
in more states legal experts say 
with 124 other illinois death row inmates and at least two 
murderers in new jersey and california nearing the end of their 
appeals capital punishment appears likely to become more common in 
nonsouthern states 
we are stepping up to another plateau said henry 
schwarzschild director of the american civil liberties unions 
capital punishment project 
were now seeing the reality that the death penalty is no 
longer a regional southern phenomenon but a national one 
the south remains the heartland of the death penalty according 
to figures from the naacp legal defense fund all but 16 of 139 
executions since the us supreme court cleared the way for 
resumption of the death penalty in 1976 took place in southern 
states 
thirtysix states have death penalty laws under which about 200 
people are sentenced annually 
texas has had 37 executions florida 23 louisiana 19 georgia 
14 virginia nine alabama eight mississippi four north carolina 
and south carolina three each arkansas two and oklahoma one 
outside the south nevada has executed five people since 1976 
utah has executed three indiana has executed two and missouri has 
executed five four of them this year 
on wednesday illinois became the northernmost state to carry 
out the death penalty when it executed murderer charles walker by 
injection the first to die at the hands of that state in 28 years 
illinois became the 16th state to put someone to death since the 
1976 high court ruling on monday oklahoma executed murderer 
charles t coleman by injection 
in wyoming convicted murderer mark hopkinson faces death by 
injection on sept 25 his latest appeal was rejected by the us 
supreme court 
perhaps the most closelywatched case at the moment is in 
california where murderer robert alton harris came a step closer 
to the gas chamber when his sentence was upheld last month by a 
federal appeals court no execution date has been set 
and on tuesday new jerseys supreme court heard arguments in 
the case of multiple murderer richard biegenwald the court 
overturned his death sentence in 1987 on a technicality but a new 
jury broke new ground in the state by sentencing biegenwald to 
death again triggering an automatic appeal 
nineteen murderers have been executed this year compared with 
16 in all of 1989 but still less than the post 1976peak of 25 in 
1987 
twentyone of the 139 executed since 1976 went voluntarily 
including walker in illinois 
but even for those fighting execution many now believe that the 
decadelong conservative drift in politics and court decisions 
increases the likelihood of more frequent executions in more 
states 
politicians including california democratic gubernatorial 
candidate dianne feinstein have recently been scoring points with 
voters by stressing their prodeath penalty stance 
death penalty opponents who had held executioners at bay since 
1976 have largely been rebuffed by the courts said schwarzschild 
there are almost 2400 on death row he said many have 
been there for a long time though the legal remedies are very time 
consuming they are not inexhaustible some are now reaching the 
end of those remedies and those legal remedies are being 
progressively foreshortened 
the average time elapsed between sentencing and execution was 77 
months between 1977 and 1988 for those who have actually been 
executed according to latest figures available from the federal 
bureau of justice statistics 
some expect the average stay on death row to become shorter in 
the years ahead 
the us supreme court two years ago took a crucial step in 
breaking the appeals logjam in mccleskie vs kempp the justices 
rejected arguments that the death penalty should be overturned 
because it was geared largely to punish killers of white victims 
according to naacp legal defense fund figures 120 or 851 
percent of the victims of those executed since 1976 were white 
the mccleskie case said schwarzschild was the last great 
challenge to the general pattern and process by which the death 
penalty was imposed now we have hand to hand legal combat but 
nothing that affects a great many people on death row 
but karima wicks research director of naacp legal defenses 
capital punishment project said the rush to the death chamber 
might yet be slowed if congress passes the socalled racial justice 
act an amendment to the omnibus crime bill now pending before the 
house of representatives 
the act aimed at overturning the mccleskie ruling would make 
it unlawful to impose a death sentence because of the race of 
either the victim or criminal a defendant could appeal a sentence 
by using evidence that showed a pattern of discriminatory 
sentencing

the bush administration concerned the oil 
crisis might be used to thwart clean air legislation said thursday 
the tougher pollution controls required by the bill could save as 
much as 1 million barrels of oil a day 
the report on the expected fuel savings most of which would 
come toward the end of the decade was made public as some members 
of congress began questioning the wisdom of new and expensive 
pollution controls at a time of increasing energy costs 
house and senate negotiators were continuing to try to resolve 
differences in separate clean air bills but a meeting was abruptly 
canceled thursday participants had hoped to give final approval to 
a compromise reached last week on industrial controls to reduce 
urban smog 
the legislation expected to cost the energy industry as much as 
25 billion a year by the end of the decade when all its 
requirements go into effect requires pollution controls on 
electric power plants factories and automobiles it also requires 
the sale of cleaner gasoline blends in areas with serious smog 
problems 
the study released thursday by the environmental protection 
agency concluded that as much as 500000 barrels of oil a day may 
be saved because tougher acid rain controls will prompt utilities 
to switch from oil to natural gas 
another 500000 barrels a day will be saved from requirement for 
automobiles to burn cleaner fuels and from the increased use of 
alternative fuel vehicles the epa said 
the total of 800000 to 1 million barrels a day exceeds the 
total oil imports from kuwait and iraq epa administrator william 
reilly told reporters 
i think the energy implications make it more urgently 
necessary than ever for congress to pass the bill he said in a 
later telephone interview 
bush administration officials have acknowledged some concern in 
recent weeks that progress on the clean air legislation might be 
jeopardized amid the uproar over rising oil prices the prospects 
of an economic recession and the potential of oil shortages 
only days after the middle east crisis erupted last month 
industry lobbyists began to question whether the time was right to 
impose added financial costs to industry in the form of tougher 
pollution controls 
some critics have argued that a number of provisions in the bill 
would increase oil consumption for example the use of scrubbers 
by utilities to reduce sulfur dioxide requires more energy as does 
the refining of certain cleaner gasoline blends they said 
but the epa study said all that would be offset by more 
significant energy gains 
the study said that 300000 to 500000 barrels of oil could be 
saved by utilities that will be persuaded to switch from using 
sulfurcontaining oil to using natural gas because of the bills 
acid rain control provisions 
a requirement to use cleaner fuels and gasoline blends in cities 
with serious smog problems and the increased use of alternative 
fuel vehicles also would lead to the savings of another 500000 
barrels of oil daily the study said 
the legislation requires that gasoline blends which likely 
would be 15 percent or more of ethanol or methanol would be 
required in at least nine cities 
some of the cleaner fuel requirements would apply to as many as 
40 cities

for showing up at his supreme court confirmation hearings with a 5 
oclock shadow and a ragged look 
he has a very heavy beard hes meticulous about shaving but 
that he cant help helen souter said he looks exhausted 
after all hes been through 
the high court nominee lived with his mother in their 
weatherbeaten farmhouse until she moved into a retirement residence 
in nearby concord several years ago until souter went to 
washington to prepare for the hearings he continued to live in 
weare and visit her every sunday 
mrs souter 82 recalled watching all of robert borks 
confirmation hearings live and expected similar coverage of her son 
on cable news network which isnt broadcasting all of the 
hearings 
i was just watching it and they turned it off she said 
im very much disappointed 
but mrs souter is luckier than many of souters hometown fans 
without cable in the town of 4500 people only those with 
satellite dishes can watch cnn or cspan 
at john stark regional high school teacher tom sutton said he 
plans to show tapes of some of the hearings in his personallaw 
class he said souter gives hometown flesh to the abstractions of 
justice 
heres the highest court in the land and weve got someone 
who is maybe going to be there he said its creating a lot of 
local interest in the man but its creating interest in the 
position as well 
one of suttons students senior joel nazer said souters rise 
from weare to washington has inspired him 
im from henniker and not a lot really comes out of henniker 
or weare nazer said you see a rare incident like this and you 
really stop and think 
when souter was growing up he spent his summers swimming and 
fishing with janet brown she said she is still close to her friend 
and watches his confirmation hearings with pride 
we went to an elementary school where there were 11 or 12 
children in class in a town where fathers worked and mothers were 
home she said swimming canning getting wood hes a real 
country person hes the basics hes what we were all brought up 
to believe in hell be as strong as our constitution 
brown said that during the opening of the hearings the respect 
with which the senators treated souter impressed her 
its america at work america can sleep better knowing someone 
with his integrity has the opportunity to be there she said 
each of weares selectmen has written to the members of the 
judiciary committee urging them to confirm souters nomination i 
dont think he can do wrong in any way as far as the people in the 
town are concerned selectman bill herman said

french president francois 
mitterrand on thursday called for a european community that would 
eventually include the newly democratic countries of eastern 
europe 
mitterrand spoke to deputies of the czechoslovak parliament 
this countrys first freely elected legislature in four decades on 
the first day of his twoday official visit to czechoslovakia 
let us create a new european geography of culture and history 
let us get used to the idea of cooperation as soon as 
possible he told deputies in a 45minute nationally televised 
speech 
calling czechoslovakia the spiritual crossroads of europe 
mitterrand presented his vision of european integration based on 
western democracies gradually absorbing the emerging independent 
countries of eastern europe 
we could reach a continental agreement that could be a 
beginning of a permanent dialogue he said 
he said his idea was close to that of czechoslovak president 
vaclav havel who wants european integration to be built around the 
35nation conference on security and cooperation in europe 
prague could become the center for such talks and i am going 
to campaign for this idea mitterrand said indirectly supporting 
pragues bid to become the headquarters of the 35nation body 
in other remarks the french president cautioned that the 
process of reforming czechoslovakias stagnant economy requires 
patience 
however he praised the peaceful revolution of 1989 as the 
greatest popular revolt since the french revolution in 1789 
earlier in the day havel drew parallels between the german 
invasion of czechoslovakia 52 years ago and any appeasement of iraq 
after its invasion of kuwait 
havels comments at an official lunch for mitterrand played 
heavily on comparisons of the persian gulf crisis and the munich 
pact concluded sept 30 1938 the pact secured french and british 
acquiescence for germanys invasion of czechoslovakia 
the shameful aggression against kuwait and the ensuing crisis 
in the persian gulf today make the old lesson from munich topical 
again havel said the policy of appeasement cannot be 
successful in the long run on the contrary it is malignant 
czechoslovakia has joined in the unordered embargo on iraq 
despite estimates it could lose up to 1 billion in trade 
also thursday foreign minister jiri dienstbier and his french 
counterpart roland dumas signed agreements on cultural and 
student exchanges and the setting up of cultural centers in both 
countries 
finance ministers vaclav klaus and jeanmarie rausch of france 
ratified a treaty on protection of french investments in 
czechoslovakia and repatriation of profit

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan added 
his voice thursday to those warning of threats to the insurance 
fund that protects bank deposits but he cautioned congress against 
acting so hastily that it makes the problem worse 
members of congress appeared inclined to ignore greenspans 
goslow advice because of alarm over two reports this week that 
indicated the reserves of the federal deposit insurance corp could 
be wiped out by a further downturn in the economy or by one large 
bank failure 
house banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas 
said he was introducing legislation that would remove the caps on 
the premium amount the fdic can charge banks for the deposit 
insurance 
the legislation cosponsored by rep chalmers wylie of ohio 
the ranking republican on the committee was similar to a measure 
proposed wednesday by senate banking committee chairman donald 
riegle dmich 
riegle said the matter was of such urgency that it had to be 
addressed before congress adjourns next month 
the bush administration added its support to a move to give the 
fdic more flexibility in setting premiums with treasury secretary 
nicholas brady saying the agency should be given all the tools it 
needs 
the fdic charges banks 12 cents a year for every 100 the agency 
insures 
the fdic board voted last month to boost that amount to 195 
cents the maximum allowed under current law that increase will 
cost the banking industry an estimated 1 billion next year 
general accounting office and congressional budget office 
reports that raised the specter of a savingsandloantype debacle 
unless something is done to shore up the bank fund focused 
attention on the problem 
the depletion of a separate fund that insured deposits at sampls 
forced a bailout expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of 
dollars over 30 years 
lawmakers eager to avoid a repeat of the fiasco said congress 
had to act without delay to rescue the fdic which has 132 
billion in reserves 
the revelation that with a few downward twitters of the 
economy the once mighty federal deposit insurance fund could go 
broke shows the seriousness of the situation said rep charles 
schumer dny 
in testimony before the house banking committee greenspan noted 
that fdic reserves were at their lowest level in history at a time 
when there were all too many problems still facing the banking 
system from sagging loan portfolios especially in the real estate 
area 
it thus seems clear that the insurance fund likely will remain 
under stress for some time to come greenspan said moreover 
pressures would intensify if real estate market conditions were to 
weaken further or a recession were to develop in the general 
economy 
the congressional budget office reported wednesday that even 
without a recession some 600 to 700 commercial banks likely will 
fail over the next 3 years draining 20 billion from the fdic 
fund 
but greenspan cautioned that while reform is needed so is 
caution 
he spoke against proposals to reduce the insurance limit from 
100000 per account and said it would be difficult but not 
impossible to administer a law that limited the number of insured 
accounts each individual could own 
he also said lawmakers shouldnt boost premiums too much because 
that could make the banking industry uncompetitive and increase the 
number of bank failures exactly the opposite effect intended 
while saying he didnt oppose an increase in the insurance 
premiums greenspan said such legislation should be adopted along 
with proposals to restructure the banking system to give banks more 
powers such as the ability to underwrite the sale of securities 
greenspan has long championed efforts to repeal the 
depressionera glasssteagall act which separated commercial and 
investment banking activities saying the restrictions made it 
difficult for banks to compete in a rapidly changing financial 
world 
greenspans appearance marked his first congressional testimony 
since the persian gulf crisis boosted oil prices and added to fears 
of an impending recession in the united states 
however his only comment on possible fed monetary responses 
came when he said that a credible multiyear deal between the 
administration and congress to cut the budget deficit would lead to 
lower interest rates 
repeating earlier comments greenspan said financial markets 
would respond favorably in the belief that reduced federal 
government borrowing would allow longterm interest rates to 
decline he said the central bank would do its part by helping to 
push shortterm interest rates lower

the federal aviation administration said 
thursday it wont make any further comments about the only airport 
device that can detect plastic explosives 
faa administrator james b busey said critics of the device have 
had an adverse effect on the campaign to combat aviation terrorism 
i felt they were damaging the deterrent capability of this 
device he said the details of its performance are now 
classified and arent going to be discussed any more 
four of the sophisticated thermal neutron analysis or tna 
machines are being used to inspect baggage at international 
airports here and in europe and two others are ready for 
installation 
the performance of the tna technology has long been the subject 
of debate with critics pointing to what they say is a high rate of 
false alarms critics also note that the device failed to detect a 
bomb as small as the one said to have destroyed pan am flight 103 
over lockerbie scotland in 1988 
the presidential commission created to investigate the pan am 
bombing called for a halt to the faas plans to buy 150 tna devices 
and install them at highrisk airports around the world 
the commission said the government had made too heavy an 
investment in tna devices at the expense of other developing 
technology that might prove more effective 
busey said the public discussion of the amount of explosives the 
machine can detect and its false alarm rate have had a decidedly 
negative impact 
i disagree with them busey said of commission members who 
reported their concern about the tna technology to president bush 
in may 
it is the only technology that can detect plastic 
explosives he said it does work 
busey also said the faa knows how to put it into a system 
where we can work with and around its known capabilities and 
limitations 
and in order to protect the enhancements we are 
classifying it so that it wont become common knowledge and 
therefore limit its capabilities in a deterrent system he said 
tna machines are used at kennedy international airport in new 
york dulles international airport outside washington in miami and 
at gatwick airport south of london 
negotiations are under way to install a tna detection device at 
frankfurt west germany busey said a decision will be made by the 
end of the year on where the sixth tna detector should be 
installed

a day after the postal service offered to 
deliver mail free from american military personnel in the middle 
east the pentagon said no 
military post offices collect the mail and then turn it over to 
postal officials for delivery in this country 
postmaster general anthony m frank had said wednesday that his 
agency was prepared to accept and deliver mail without stamps 
from personnel serving in operation desert shield 
but on thursday the defense department said letters without 
stamps cannot be accepted until congress and president bush approve 
the action the plan has passed the senate and is pending in the 
house 
the house had appeared poised to approve the plan overwhelmingly 
until rep thomas ridge rpa offered an amendment stipulating 
that money to pay for the free mail would come from appropriations 
for free franked mail by members of congress 
ridges proposal was rejected on a voice vote he then demanded 
a roll call vote and because the house had already agreed to hold 
no more recorded votes this week the members postponed action 
until next week 
pentagon spokesman glen flood said current law does not 
authorize free mail for deployed forces in situations short of 
hostilities we hope the full congress takes action soon but as of 
right now free mail is not authorized we hope that changes 
advised of the pentagon decision the postal service said that 
its announcement of free mail from troops in saudi arabia was 
made in the spirit and intent of proposed legislation 
the postal service stands ready to accept and deliver service 
men and womens free mail when received the agency said

the florida supreme court ruled 
thursday that relatives or guardians can order the removal of 
feeding tubes that keep braindamaged people alive even if the 
patients havent signed living wills 
the justices added that the guardians dont need a courts 
approval in each individual case however the patient must have 
expressed at least verbally a preference for dying rather than 
being kept alive with feeding tubes 
advocates of the right to die hailed the ruling which does 
not apply outside florida opponents did not immediately respond 
saying they needed more time to review it 
roman catholics and antiabortion groups have been among those 
fighting laws that allow forced feeding to be withdrawn 
the foundation of the righttodie decision which came in the 
case of an 89yearold woman who died last summer is the right to 
privacy in floridas state constitution 
this case resolves a question of an individuals 
constitutional right of selfdetermination justice rosemary 
barkett wrote in the majority opinion 
the woman at the center of the case estelle browning spent the 
last 2 years of her life hooked up to feeding tubes that she had 
earlier in a living will specifically said she didnt want 
she suffered permanent brain damage in a stroke and was left in 
a persistent vegetative state unable to swallow or communicate 
she was not comatose doris herbert mrs brownings second cousin 
and only living relative was named her guardian 
herbert sought permission to remove the tubes in 1988 the state 
fought the request and a trial court denied it but a state appeals 
court said the states consititution allowed it and the issue was 
reviewed by the supreme court 
we hold that because mrs browning was unable to exercise her 
constitutional right of privacy by reason of her medical condition 
her guardian was authorized to exercise it for her barkett 
wrote 
herberts attorney george felos said he was highly pleased 
by the ruling 
he said he had expected the justices to rule that guardians 
could order the removal of feeding tubes however he said he had 
worried that the court would establish a judicial review process 
that would have in essence defeated the right 
barkett wrote that the court was loath to impose a cumbersome 
legal proceeding at such a delicate time in those many cases where 
the patient neither needs nor desires additional protection 
c marie king the assistant state attorney who presented the 
states case to the court did not return a phone call thursday 
the high court heard arguments in the case in january six 
months later the us supreme court said a missouri couple could 
not order the removal of food and water that was keeping their 
32yearold comatose daughter alive 
the daughter nancy cruzan had not left a living will although 
her parents said they were certain she would prefer to die rather 
than live in a coma in its split decision the nations high court 
did say that competent people have a right to refuse medical 
treatment 
the florida court which cited that case went on to say that it 
has found previously that incompetent people have the same right 
through guardians acting on statements made before becoming 
incompetent to refuse medical treatment as competent people 
the browning case extended that ruling to people in florida who 
are not totally comatose but still cannot make their own decisions 
patricia dore a law professor at florida state university who 
drafted the florida privacy clause said it was significant that 
the justices ruled there was no legal distinction between food and 
water supplied through invasive tubes and other medical treatments 
such as respirators 
attorneys and advocates said other state courts could be 
influenced by the case 
i think many many state courts look to florida for guidance 
on issues that affect the elderly felos said 
robert miller who represented the national society for the 
right to die in a friendofthecourt brief said the ruling was a 
real contribution in this area 
its a really strong decision supporting the right of an adult 
to control their own medical decisions miller said 
rosemary gallagher a spokeswoman for the florida catholic 
conference said she hadnt seen the courts ruling and couldnt 
comment on it the catholic conference had submitted a 
friendofthecourt brief that opposed the removal of forced 
feeding

the united states and the soviet union are giving 
up on setting limits on their troops in europe in a treaty theyre 
negotiating to reduce tanks and other nonnuclear weapons a senior 
us official said thursday night 
but that still leaves a dispute over limits on airplanes the 
official said after secretary of state james a baker iii met for 
two hours with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and then for 
more than an hour with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
we didnt make any headway on that the official told 
reporters as he flew to damascus syria for talks friday with 
president hafez assad 
the outlook for completing the treaty by the end of the year a 
goal set by president bush and gorbachev remains unclear 
the two sides have set completion of the treaty as a 
precondition for holding a 35nation summit conference on reducing 
tensions in europe 
baker and shevardnadze concluded that proposed limits on us 
and soviet troops had become obsolete the soviets have agreed with 
west germany to withdraw the 350000 soldiers they have in east 
germany over four years as part of german unification 
also soviet troops are being pulled out of eastern europe 
while us forces in western europe also are being scaled back 
the senior us official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said shevardnadze had taken the troops issue off the table when 
they met in siberia last month and that baker agrees the proposed 
ceilings were overtaken by events 
the ceilings would have permitted the soviets and americans up 
to 195000 soldiers in central europe with another 30000 us 
troops elsewhere on the continent 
the official said he could not rule out the soviets bringing up 
the issue again as a way of making sure the united states cuts 
back but he said that probably would not happen until a second 
round of bargaining is held after the treaty is finished 
the aircraft dispute meanwhile is a serious roadblock 
it involves an effort by the united states and its nato partners 
to limit soviet airplanes that moscow insists are defensive the 
soviets soon will send negotiators to washington to try to break 
the deadlock the official said 
bakers threeday visit here produced no serious progress on 
another prospective arms control treaty a ussoviet agreement 
to cut their longrange nuclear missiles bombers and submarines by 
30 percent to 50 percent 
bush hopes to sign the treaty at a summit in moscow in december 
gorbachev told reporters at the kremlin that a lot of things 
have to be done before there is another summit meeting 
later us officials confirmed none of the remaining issues in 
the way of a start treaty had been settled 
those issues include 
the kinds of restrictions to be placed on the 154 heavy 
groundbased ss18 intercontinental missiles the soviets will 
retain under the treaty 
whether the soviet backfire bomber is to be classified as a 
strategic weapons as the united states demands that would mean 
counting backfires against numerical weapons limits established in 
the treaty 
the restrictions to be placed on us and soviet transfers of 
weapons barred under the treaty to allies from the united states 
to britain for instance

german jewish organizations on thursday 
condemned west germanys decision to temporarily halt further 
soviet jewish immigration 
the west german government on wednesday told its diplomats in 
the soviet union to stop processing applications until a fixed 
quota is established bonn said its consulate in kiev had received 
immigration requests from 10000 soviet jews 
fortyfive years after the nazi holocaust germany has become an 
increasingly attractive destination for soviet jews who are 
dealing with persecution as the soviet state is eroded and various 
nationalist movements some of them antisemitic gain strength 
west german jewish community leader heinz galinski said germany 
must be willing to accept soviet jews but that regulations are 
needed to avoid chaos caused by huge numbers 
galinski head of the central council of jews in germany said 
he estimates 800 soviet jewish immigrants have reached east germany 
the last nine months about 400 soviet jews have settled in west 
germany the last two years the bonn government said 
guenther krause a top east german negotiator was talking with 
officials in bonn in hopes of avoiding a temporary ban like the one 
that west germany made the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported 
in munich 
east berlins jewish cultural union sharply criticized bonns 
action saying it is out of step with the german responsibility 
toward the jewish people 
jewish leaders in east and west already are upset about the 
wording of the preamble of the unification treaty between the two 
german states 
the leaders are seeking a clear statement of the germans 
responsibility for the holocaust that claimed the lives of an 
estimated 6 million jews a draft of the preamble contained only 
general wording about peace and democracy 
while seeking fixed numbers for soviet jewish immigrants west 
germany continues to accept thousands of asylumseekers from 
eastern europe and third world countries 
the refugees are strapping west germanys social services still 
reeling from the influx of 500000 east germans the last nine

broken and the pilot bailed out but was missing the military 
statement said 
the reports indicated the soldiers had outwitted the tamil 
tigers by paddling across the lagoon during the aerial bombardment 
instead of trying to break across a heavily mined causeway that 
leads to the rear of the starshaped dutch colonial fort 
the fort is a classic of military architecture with a moat 
drawbridge watch towers and 20foot walls 
crushing the guerrilla siege was an important psychological 
victory for the government forces but its value was more symbolic 
than strategic 
the fort and nearby jaffna town is tiger territory and so is 
most of the surrounding peninsula the longtime power base of the 
7yearold tamil revolt against the sinhalese majority that 
controls sri lankas government 
nevertheless the massive government fort symbolizes sinhalese 
power in the peninsula 
the government opened talks last year to try to negotiate a 
peaceful settlement with the tigers who say they need a separate 
homeland to protect the tamil minority from discrimination by the 
sinhalese 
the talks and a 13monthold ceasefire broke down when the 
tigers launched a series of raids on june 11 on police stations and 
army camps in northern and eastern sri lanka 
hundreds of unarmed policemen were massacred after surrendering 
to the rebels and the government declared it was time for allout 
war to crush the tigers 
the guerrillas laid siege to the fort on june 13 the government 
launched its offensive on aug 22 but its forces became locked in 
battle nearby with guerrillas 
meantime helicopters swooped over the fort to drop food to the 
men trapped inside drinking water was provided in the form of ice 
blocks which quickly melted in the tropical heat 
at least twice helicopter pilots braved rebel fire to land at 
the fort and pick up seriously wounded troops 
having liberated the fort the governments next goal likely is 
to take the town of jaffna 
the government says more than 3000 people have been killed the 
last three months bringing the death toll to 14000 since the 
revolt began in 1983 
the northeast is home for most of sri lankas tamils who form 
18 percent of the islands population of 16 million sinhalese make 
up 75 percent of the people

the bush administration will ask congress for 
an additional 18 billion to cover costs of the military 
deployment in the persian gulf through the end of the month 
administration and congressional sources said thursday 
the emergency request to be formally submitted to congress on 
friday also includes an expected request to forgive 7 billion in 
past military debt owed the united states by egypt the sources 
said 
and it includes a proposal to transfer another 900 million from 
unused accounts within the pentagon to make up the rest of the 27 
billion additional costs imposed by operation desert shield the 
sources said 
the 1990 fiscal year ends sept 30 the white house hopes that 
paying some of the bills from the deployment in the current year 
will ease pressure at least slightly as the administration and 
congress draft a defense department budget for 1991 according to 
the sources who spoke on condition that they not be identified 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger in visits to key 
members of the house and senate on wednesday argued that the debt 
forgiveness for egypt is necessary to reward an ally that has taken 
a leadership role in rallying the arab world against saddam 
husseins invasion of kuwait 
in the private meetings eagleburger has made the case that aid 
to egypt bolsters a moderate arab state and helps to stem the 
rising tide of moslem fundamentalism in the middle east egypt has 
been the linchpin of us efforts to mount a broad international 
response to the invasion eagleburger argued 
but while many lawmakers agree egypt is worthy of a reward they 
wince at the size of the debt writeoff and worry that other us 
aid recipients will line up for similar largesse at a time when the 
budget can ill afford it 
sen patrick leahy dvt said he has asked the administration 
for a better idea of how much the debt forgiveness will cost the 
united states in lost repayments each year 
egypt should be helped said leahy chairman of the senate 
appropriations foreign aid subcommittee they do have their necks 
out about as far as you can get but theres going to be a need to 
help a lot of people and he would like to handle it all at once 
instead of piecemeal and with a full picture of the costs 
involved leahy said 
the administration official acknowledged the difficulty 
alluding to the perennial unpopularity in congress of foreign aid 
theres a lot of head scratching over how we are going to pull 
this off 30 days before an election

struggling through its final days east 
germanys first free government faced new charges thursday that it 
still contains the most hated remnants of the old regime 
a prominent activist who headed a committee assigned to dissolve 
the communist secret police said 69 current lawmakers and four 
ministers had worked with the secret police 
during a 14hour parliament session lawmakers bickered over the 
allegations and the governments announcement the previous day that 
it had purged 56 suspected secret police agents from government 
posts this week 
but they voted against demanding that prime minister lothar de 
maiziere oust interior minister petermichael diestel who has been 
under fire for months for allowing secret police agents on his 
payroll 
meanwhile 22 activists who helped bring down the communist 
regime by leading protests last fall continued to occupy the 
headquarters of the secret police 
the activists who have been occupying the headquarters since 
sept 4 and went on a hunger strike wednesday are demanding public 
access to the secret records kept on 6 million people 
west berlin mayor walter momper visited the activists thursday 
and said he supports their cause 
the furor over the dark past was heightened by comments made by 
werner fischer a prominent activist who led a committee assigned 
to oversee the dissolution of the communist secret police unit 
in an interview with the east german news agency adn fischer 
said there were four ministers in the government who were unoffical 
members of the stasi 
he named environment minister karlhermann steinberg as an 
example steinberg denied the accusation 
matthias gehler spokesman for the prime minister criticized 
fischer for naming steinberg but said de maiziere wanted to speak 
with steinberg 
fischer was also quoted as saying 68 members of the 400member 
parliament worked with the stasi 
in addition he was quoted as saying diestel fought attempts by 
fischers committee to investigate the number of stasi agents 
working in the interior ministry which is responsible for law 
enforcement 
the stasi used threats intimidation surveillance beatings and 
purportedly murder to keep in check 16 million people during 
communist rule of the country 
former agents have said a system of favors and contacts still 
exists in the goverment 
nearly 200000 people were either official or unofficial members 
of the network and tens of thousands more worked as informants 
parliament convened thursday to discuss aspects of a treaty that 
lays many of the conditions for unifying with west germany on oct 
3 much of the debate was spent on the growing obsession with the 
secret police 
fischer headed a citizens committee made up of activists 
appointed by the caretaker government which took over after 
hardline leader erich honecker was ousted from power last autumn 
the committee had completed organizing stasi files and materials 
when it was replaced by a new committee formed after de maiziere 
was elected in march 
the second committee last week handed the government a list of 
5000 names of undercover stasi agents who worked in government 
ministries 
on wednesday the government said 56 people who were on that 
list were either fired or put on leaves of absence most of them 
worked in diestels department

researchers at the university of pennsylvania 
medical center say theyve cured diabetes in rats by transplanting 
clumps of cells from the pancreas to the thymus gland 
richard kahn chief scientist and medical officer for the 
american diabetes association said the study was important but 
added we should be clear that we have not found a cure for 
diabetes 
nearly 1 million americans a number that grows by 10000 to 
15000 a year suffer from type one diabetes in which there are no 
insulinproducing cells called islets in the pancreas a far 
greater number suffer from type two diabetes in which the body 
produces some but not enough insulin 
the missing insulin must be replaced by daily injections 
the researchers said the thymus implants restored the blood 
sugar in the rats to normal levels and permanently cured the 
diabetes with only a single dose of an antirejection drug 
a team led by dr clyde barker was the first to cure diabetes in 
animals by islet transplantation 17 years ago but the islets were 
rejected within a few days without continuing heavy doses of 
antirejection drugs 
the latest findings were detailed in fridays edition of science 
magazine barker chief of surgery at the penn medical center 
coauthored the report 
this is the first indication that we can engraft foreign 
islets and restore normal glucose to diabetic individuals without 
subjecting them to chronic longlife immunosuppression with side 
effects said ali naji professor of surgery at penn 
the thymus didnt reject the implants of pancreatic islets and 
didnt require repeated injection to lower the rats immune 
response a finding that surprised the researchers 
kahn said the study helps in the understanding of the bodys 
immune system but he doubts whether it holds hope for human 
diabetics 
the reason it is slim is that your thymus gland all but 
disappears before the age of 2 so that its very difficult to find 
any trace of the thymus gland kahn said we dont know how it 
functions after that period so its questionable if this is of 
clinical significance 
in april researchers at washington university said a similar 
transplant of insulinproducing cells into the liver of a woman 
with diabetes enabled her to go without daily insulin injections 
for more than two weeks but the womans body then began to reject 
the transplant 
andrew posselt an mdphd student at penn who conducted the 
experiment said the thymus is wellsuited for the transplantation 
of islets 
the gland near the thyroid gland at the base of the neck 
doesnt permit white blood cells to enter the organ easily which 
makes it a protective site from the immune system 
also the cells in the thymus can differentiate between 
substances in its own body and foreign substances posselt said 
so if islets are transplanted into the thymus we think that 
the cells can be tricked into thinking that the foreign tissue is 
actually part of its own body and the immune system wont be able 
to respond to it posselt said 
posselt said the blood sugar levels in the rats remained normal 
for more than 200 days and some are still working normally after 
about 17 months

the defense department estimates that the cost 
of the us invasion of panama last december was about 1636 
million says a congressional report released thursday 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress found that the incremental cost for operation just cause 
was about 155 million for the army 57 million for the air force 
and 29 million for the navy 
the incremental expense represents the cost over and about the 
price for normal operations 
the invasion that began in the early morning hours dec 20 1989 
and lasted until jan 31 involved 27000 us troops including 
13000 who were stationed in panama 
the objective of operation just cause was to remove panamanian 
leader manuel noriega who had been indicted in the united states 
on drug charges 
the gao based its report on estimates from the military services 
and did not independently verify the numbers 
among the costs associated with operation just cause were 
expenses incurred prior to the invasion including practice 
missions and the price of evacuating military dependents 
other expenses included replacing aircraft and vehicles lost 
during the operation the price of ammunition and allowances paid 
to military personnel including imminent danger pay and family 
separation pay 
the release of the costs associated with the panama invasion 
comes as the bush administration is estimating that the us 
military buildup to deter iraqi aggression could cost as much as 
15 billion in the next fiscal year

the top american military commander 
extolled troops in the saudi desert thursday to bear with me as 
evidence mounted the deployment of us forces in the persian gulf 
region will be a prolonged one 
gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
told army infantrymen during a pep talk at their desert camp that 
they had the support of president bush and the american public for 
their mission 
dont think i ever forget that you have loved ones back 
home powell added 
but at each of a halfdozen stops at army air force and marine 
camps the fourstar general clad in desert camouflage was 
pressed by servicemen about the likely length of their stay 
i want to get you home as fast as possible but bear with me 
powell said i cant give you an exact date 
at a news conference powell said rotations of troops will start 
as soon as possible a welcome message for the troops but 
another sign that military planners foresee a lengthy deployment 
even if iraq pulled out starting tomorrow id be here 
probably six months minimum one general who met with powell 
said asking that he not be named 
powell who later flew to bahrain refused to say how long the 
bush administration would tolerate iraqs occupation of kuwait now 
in its sixth week 
gen norman h schwarzkopf the us commander in saudi arabia 
said his forces were strong enough to stop an iraqi attack now but 
the infusion of more armored units the next two months will provide 
a 100 percent chance of winning any battle 
give me a couple of months and ill be able to stand up and 
say there is absolutely no question whatsoever of the 
outcome schwarzkopf said 
if iraqi president saddam hussein were to order an attack now 
i feel confident we could handle the problem and he would suffer 
extraordinary losses but i still do not have the ground forces of 
choice that i need to fight a mobile war in the desert he said 
a senior us officer who spoke on condition he not be named 
said no end to the us military presence is in sight he all but 
ruled out a unilateral us military action to force iraqi forces 
from kuwait 
its the classic mexican standoff said the official i 
wouldnt want to launch an offensive against kuwait with 
150000200000 troops on the ground and i dont think saddam 
hussein is going to leave 
powell said the mission of the american troops remained a 
defensive one and that the us forces would leave when asked to by 
the saudi government 
we have no desire to have any permanent presence he said 
the us deployment to the region including sailors and 
marines now is about 145000 men and women 
powell said the us deployment was behind schedule because of 
delayed transport ships and a limited airlift capacity 
youre bound to have glitches he said but most vital heavy 
gear was here or nearing saudi ports he said 
schwarzkopf interviewed at the headquarters of us forces 
said the flow of equipment for american forces into saudi arabia 
was eight days behind schedule because of logistical problems 
including two brokendown navy ships 
pentagon spokesman bob hall said the fast sealift ship antares 
was transferring its goods to another fast ship at spains port of 
rota another ship has engine problems in the atlantic and may need 
to be towed hall said 
powell played down suggestions there would be command problems 
directing a multinational forces in combat saying if hostilities 
erupted a command structure could be put in place 
powell planned to visit a navy ship friday

fortythree marilyn monroe lookalikes 
fanned out through a downtown plaza thursday in a stunt stemming 
from the sex symbols roots as an artichoke queen 
the show was designed to convince the public that artichokes 
not diamonds are a girls best friend 
why 43 
because 43 years ago marilyn monroe was the first official 
california artichoke queen said patty boman of the california 
artichoke advisory board 
artichoke growers believe that during marilyns reign more 
people than ever before were inspired to eat artichokes she 
said 
it was no coincidence boman noted that the twoday castroville 
artichoke festival starts saturday castroville 40 miles south of 
san francisco is dubbed the artichoke capital of the world 
the women were costumed to resemble monroe in her role in the 
movie the seven year itch all were topped by blonde wigs and 
wore white satin dresses 
the platoon of photographers that showed up at justin herman 
plaza on the waterfront snapped away as one of the marilyns also 
known as dianna dawn attempted to duplicate the famous scene in 
the movie in which a gust of air raises the stars dress to display 
her legs 
dawn and her colleagues circulated through the lunch time crowd 
to distribute artichoke leaves as songs by monroe flowed from a 
loud speaker the tunes included a fine romance i want to be 
loved by you and diamonds are a girls best friend 
the 43 lined up behind tuxedoclad castroville artichoke grower 
dale huss who told the crowd that artichokes not diamonds are 
a girls best friend 
tell us about you reign as queen in 1947 huss asked dawn 
who does a fairly good impression of monroe 
i always eat artichokes when it rains she answered 
the problem with artichokes said boman is not enough people 
know how good they are or even that the vegetable exists 
we measure in terms of cartons she said last year we 
sold 42 million cartons most of that was on the west coast a 
shocking proportion of bay area residents have never tried 
artichokes 
artichoke leaves are usually peeled off and dipped in a sauce 
then the choke is removed and the heart is scooped out and 
consumed some eateries offer the hearts deepfried 
the samples passed out by the lookalikes went fast 
monroe is still big business according to roger richman who 
represents the estate of the actress who committed suicide in 1962 
he said 89 companies in the united states are licensed to use 
the name and likeness of the star of such movies as some like it 
hot and gentlemen prefer blondes 
the stint as artichoke queen must have helped her career 
richman noted that she made her first film a year later it was 
a bit part in something called scuddahoo scuddahay

the senate will be asked to renew the 55 mile 
sper hour national speed limit as an alternative to required 
increases in newcar gasoline mileage a michigan senator told his 
colleagues thursday 
if we want to cut down on the amount of gasoline being used 
we can put the 55 mph speed limit back in and well burn a lot 
less gas and well save energy right now today said sen donald 
riegle dmich in preliminary debate on a fuelefficiency measure 
the provision is strenously opposed by the auto industry 
headquartered in riegles home state and hailed by 
conservationists as one of the most important steps possible to 
reduce demand for oil 
riegle and sen carl levin also dmich urged their colleagues 
to postpone action on the fuel economy bill until next year when 
it could be considered as part of a comprehensive energy program 
but proponents said there was no reason to delay a new standard 
that would reduce us deendence on foreign oil and reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions one cause of the global warming predicted by 
many scientists 
it does not take a crystal ball to realize that if we dont 
start conserving now some future president may have to consider 
sending our young men and woman back to the deserts of the middle 
east said sen richard bryan dnev the bills chief sponsor 
the bill would require automakers to boost the average mileage 
of new car fleets by 20 percent by 1995 and about 40 percent by the 
year 2001 or about 40 miles per gallon in the current government 
test 
both a 55mph speed limit and the fuel economy requriement now 
275 mpg were required by congress as fuelsaving measures in the 
wake of the 1973 oil embargo by 1986 the speed limit was widely 
ignored and congress relaxed it giving states then option of a 
65mph limit on rural interstate highways most have done so 
although senators discussed the pros and cons of the bill 
thursday the question actually at hand was whether to bring it up 
for consideration 
a vote is expected friday on a motion to officially open debate 
it is regarded as a key test of the degree of support for the bill 
if the motion passes opponents have signaled they would mount a 
filibuster and offer a string of amendments in a bid to derail the 
measure 
levin told the senate he could support some increase in fuel 
efficiency standards as part of an overall conservation package 
but he said the bryan bill was not a reasonable and balanced 
approach

israels cabinet on thursday adopted an 
economic plan that includes tax increases to help pay for the 
settlement of the 1 million soviet immigrants expected by the end 
of the decade 
the plan also is meant to turn israels socialiststyle economy 
into a more capitalist one 
finance minister yitzhak modai presented it during a marathon 
10hour cabinet meeting 
parliament must approve the plan which is expected to meet 
stiff opposition from leftwing parties 
israel radio said the government expected it to raise at least 
500 million over the next year but a proposal to impose a 16 
percent tax on fruits and vegetables and on tourism was not 
approved a special ministerial committee was appointed to discuss 
that measure 
the cabinet did approve modais proposal to impose a 20 percent 
tax on lottery winnings and on earnings from pension and saving 
plans a 16 percent tax on cigarettes and a 14 percent tax on beer 
it also approved a proposal to ease restrictions on capital markets 
to encourage outside and domestic investment 
what we are trying to do is remove taxes or burdens which are 
stopping growth and transfer them to things which do not affect 
growth modai said at a news conference 
one measure likely to meet stiff resistance in parliament is a 
proposal to lower the minimum wage for some workers as an incentive 
to employers to create more jobs 
under the plan employers would not have to pay immigrants the 
minimum wage about 475 dollars a month for their first half year 
of employment 
ora namir a legislator for the leftofcenter labor party that 
runs the histadrut labor union vowed she and her party would 
launch a tremendous struggle against that proposal 
former finance minister shimon peres said the plan would not 
help the immigration problems 
i dont see a plan for the absorption of 250000 immigrants 
nor a plan for stabilizing the economy peres leader of the 
opposition labor party said on israel television the government

searchers recovered debris 
thursday in the area where a missing jetliner was believed to have 
ditched in the north atlantic with 16 people aboard 
the boeing 727 disappeared tuesday off newfoundland 
transport canada spokesman dick pepper said a canadian forces 
search plane spotted the debris and a coast guard ship dispatched 
to the area retrieved five plasticfoam cylinders about 240 miles 
southeast of cape race 
pepper said he did not know what their use was he described 
them as five hardpacked styrofoam cylinders 14 inches in 
length 4 inches in diameter with brass screws in one end 
the site is in the middle of a major ocean shipping lane so the 
debris could have come from passing ships and not the missing jet 
he said 
the jet owned by faucett airlines of peru and carrying peruvian 
airline crew members and their relatives disappeared tuesday 
afternoon after the pilot radioed that he was short of fuel 
the plane was headed for a refueling stop in gander 
newfoundland en route to miami from the mediterranean island of 
malta 
pepper said the rain and fog off newfoundlands southern coast 
was hampering the search for the plane 
if it ditched successfully there was only a slim chance the 
plane would be afloat after two days he said but if the plane was 
equipped with life rafts the crew could have escaped he said 
maj walt chipchase spokesman for the canadian forces said the 
plane carried one 22person liferaft

a 4yearold girl was being prepared to become 
the first patient to receive gene therapy in a study that 
scientists say could revolutionize he treatment of disease 
officials said thursday 
researchers at the national institutes of health said they 
expected to be ready to begin the generestoration treatment friday 
on the child who was born with a defective immune system unable to 
fight infections and diseases 
scientists said they do not expect to see results from the 
treatment during the first few months but if successful it would 
put researchers on a new frontier in medicine that could lead to 
similar treatments for cancer hemophilia sickle cell anemia aids 
and other diseases 
we feel that this is potentially a major new therapy option 
that should have significant clinical effects in the next 
century said dr w french anderson a researcher at the 
national heart lung and blood institute at nih 
its very exciting said r michael blaese an immunology 
expert at the national cancer institute 
because of the potential of the therapy and the importance of 
the testing anderson said researchers are beginning slowly and 
cautiously with their first patient 
the child who was not identified has a rare genetic disease 
called ada deficiency a defective gene which means her immune 
system does not function adequately because the enzyme it produces 
is defective this leaves her vulnerable to infections and diseases 
most people can fight off 
only about 10 children a year are born with the disease without 
treatment they die within the first two years of life 
the best current treatment is a bone marrow transplant with a 
donor whose tissue type matches the childs such as from a brother 
or sister experts say most children do not have a matched donor 
for the children without a match their options are a partially 
matched bone marrow transplant which fails half the time or 
enzyme replacement therapy with a drug called pegada weekly 
injections of the new drug decreases the severity of infections for 
some patients but it does not fully restore their immune systems 
researchers have already begun the initial work necessary for 
the first patients treatment weeks ago they took white cells 
from some of her blood and began growing them in tissue culture 
then they inserted a normal ada gene into these cells with a 
genetically engineered virus the virus has been disabled and is no 
longer infectious but serves as a vehicle to get the normal gene 
into the cells where it produces the required enzyme 
once a sufficient number of adacorrected cells have been grown 
they are infused into the patient intravenously 
in the case of this first patient scientists expect to give her 
about 1 billion cells about a small thimbleful mixed in a 
saline solution in the first infusion 
the treatments will be given once a month for about two years 
the experiment first proposed by nih in april 1987 was 
recommended for approval by an advisory committee july 31 and was 
approved by nih last week the food and drug administration gave 
its goahead thursday afternoon said fda spokesman jeff nesbit

criticized for qualities that are admired in men 
the characteristics that they criticize you for that you are 
strongminded that you make firm and tough decisions are also 
characteristics which if you were a man they would praise you 
for she said in an interview published thursday in the october 
issue of womans journal 
i think they have not yet fully come to terms with that 
mrs thatcher continued if you do anything good then you 
have got an ulterior motive and so you are naturally like any 
female of the species defending yourself and defending everything 
in which you believe 
there is one advantage of being a woman in politics she said 
if we have a big international conference they will always 
know the president of the united states they will always know the

an appeals court thursday overturned a judges 
unprecedented order that halted distribution of a new book about 
the israeli intelligence agency mossad 
the israeli government which won the temporary restraining 
order wednesday failed to prove that its agents lives were 
endangered said a statement by a fourjudge panel of the state 
appellate division 
the panel also said that with 17000 books already shipped to 
stores any grant of injunctive relief in this case would be 
ineffective 
we think its a victory for a free press and we are going to 
sell the book again said roy gainsburg president of the books 
publisher st martins press its the only decision were 
grateful to the appellate court for acting quickly 
he said israel might appeal to the state court of appeals but 
added we are starting to tell the bookstores that they can sell 
the books 
orders have increased dramatically which is what always 
happens when you try to stop a book he added 
reacting to the latest decision the israeli embassy in 
washington accused author victor ostrovsky of placing personal 
profit above agents lives 
the book violates ostrovskys pledge of allegiance towards his 
country it said in a statement 
a hearing in state court scheduled for friday on israels 
request for a permanent stay was canceled 
the original ruling by justice michael dontzin had been roundly 
criticized by first amendment experts 
richard winfield of rogers amp wells called it without precedent 
and egregious it was an aberration said floyd abrams of 
cahill gordon amp reindell prior restraint is basically a 
nono said richard green of green amp hillman 
they said it apparently marked the first time a foreign nation 
sought to stop publication in the united states and predicted the 
ruling would not stand for long 
following a midnight hearing in his apartment dontzin on 
wednesday temporarily barred st martins from distributing by 
way of deception the making and unmaking of a mossad officer by 
ostrovsky who says he served in the spy agency for four years in 
the 1980s 
the book contends israel had detailed information about 
preparations for the bombing that killed 241 marines in lebanon in 
1983 but only gave the united states a vague warning to damage 
usarab relations 
in an interview wednesday ostrovsky said agents have threatened 
his life he said two of his former commanders turned up at his 
home in suburban ottawa at night a week ago 
they said that its better for me that i dont write it they 
told me to stop it he said i will have to be on the move more 
or less for the rest of my life 
dontzin issued the ruling at the request of the israeli 
government which claims the book could imperil mossad agents by 
blowing their cover it also implies that mossad agents agree in 
writing to keep details of their work secret after leaving the 
service 
lawyers for the publisher immediately appealed the decision the 
books distribution also has been restrained by a judge in toronto 
under terms set out in a series of us supreme court decisions 
a litigant seeking to stop publication must shoulder a huge 
evidential burden perhaps show that life could be lost and 
assure a court that its order could in fact stop dissemination of 
the objectionable material 
in this case the book is already out and around town said 
abrams under these conditions this ruling is literally 
unthinkable it is not a close case 
st martins had shipped out about 17000 books before dontzins 
ruling which included instructions that the publishing house 
contact its customers and tell them not to sell the book 
thomas mccormick chairman of the house said st martins made 
telephone calls or sent telegrams to about 400 locations many of 
the books had been sent to wholesalers who in turn had to make 
hundreds of additional calls to stores 
mccormick said st martins merely asked its customers not to 
sell the books we have no authority to order them to do 
anything he said we simply complied with the judges order 
it certainly has been reported to us that books have been 
sold and we had mailed out about 35 review copies to begin with 
he added 
jonathan lerner a new york lawyer representing the israeli 
government was asked if the distribution had doomed his case 
i cant say to what extent you can put the genie back in the 
bottle because i dont know to what extent its already out he 
said 
like the other lawyers lerner said he knew of no precedent for 
a foreign government seeking to bar publication of material in this 
country 
even if publication could have been stopped the argument that 
israeli lives were jeopardized does not justify prior restraint 
abrams said the usual answer is that theres been enough time to 
withdraw agents or take other steps 
the israeli action also raised the issue of an american courts 
obligation to a foreign government 
although the supreme court has not upheld a request for prior 
judicial restraint for more than 50 years the court once 
speculated that the government might be entitled to prior restraint 
in a case involving reports of troop movements during wartime 
if under such circumstances a court could stop publication to 
save american lives must it do the same for israeli ones 
winfield chairman of the state bar associations committee on 
media law noted that the high court had rejected the governments 
strong national security argument when it allowed newspapers to 
publish the pentagon papers on the vietnam war two decades ago 
its doubtful that an american court is obligated to give the 
same weight to the security interests of a foreign government that 
it gives to its own

a jet carrying 263 former hostages from 
kuwait most of them women and children arrived thursday to a 
greeting of flags balloons and a knot of anxious relatives 
the predominant image was of women with babies in their arms as 
the passengers slowly stepped down the exit ramp at raleighdurham 
international airport soldiers formed a human cordon to the 
terminal and occasionally lifted a straggling child to help a 
mother 
lorri zeidan from riverside calif said she was in kuwait city 
with her husband and yearold son kamel when iraq invaded aug 2 
her husband khalid is palestinian and remained in kuwait 
i didnt have to hide she said i didnt feel like a 
hostage everything thats american they blew up 
but she added you feel like you live in a prison its 
awful 
a crying woman who didnt give her name said its great to be 
here i want to say hi to all my friends i left behind in kuwait 
and i hope they make it 
the mood inside the airport terminal was almost somber the 
quiet broken by scattered applause when more hostages entered the 
building each arriving adult received a yellow carnation and each 
child got a toy 
the plane carried 147 children under age 12 and of those 37 
under age 2 according to graham wilson spokesman for the north 
carolina department of crime control and public safety 
iraq is allowing western women and children to leave iraq and 
kuwait but is keeping most western men behind to serve as 
deterrents to an attack by the united states and its allies 
authorities said the passenger list included one woman 8 months 
pregnant and five unaccompanied children also aboard the plane 
were five cats two of which belonged to diplomats wilson said 
a vacant terminal was turned into a makeshift refugee center 
with an old gift shop used as a registration center and the main 
waiting room converted into a dining area with long tables covered 
with dark green tablecloths a restaurant was set up as a 
shortterm daycare center 
welcoming banners were hung in some areas red white and blue 
ribbons and balloons dangled elsewhere 
the airports baggage claim and transportation areas were turned 
into reception centers for people trying to get airline tickets to 
their homes or hotel reservations nearby 
relatives at the airport waited for their loved ones to go 
through customs before they could greet them 
patricia smith of jacksonville said she was waiting for her 
sister leona and six children to get off the plane 
as far as i know shes doing all right ms smith said 
shes just glad to get back and im glad shes coming back shes 
upset because her husband is still back there and he hasnt been 
able to leave yet

new taxes proposed by republicans at the 
budget summit would cost low and moderateincome americans 41 
billion next year while slashing taxes by 11 billion for those 
better off according to documents obtained thursday by the 
associated press 
a democratic offer would lower by 4 billion the taxes paid by 
people with incomes below 20000 while boosting them by 268 
billion for everyone else the papers show 
in the republican plan the biggest break 74 billion would 
go to people with incomes of more than 200000 
the estimated distribution of both tax proposals was calculated 
by congress nonpartisan joint tax committee the documents were 
made available on condition that the identities of the sources be 
withheld 
the gop plan included cutting the capital gains tax rate 
limiting the deductability of state and local income taxes a tax 
on petroleum fuels and higher alcohol taxes it also contained a 
proposal to increase excise taxes extend the soontoexpire 3 
percent tax on telephone calls and change in the child care tax 
credit 
the democratic proposal included a 20 percent surtax on the 
income taxes paid by people earning more than 500000 annually it 
would double the beer tax of 16centspersixpack and the 
3centper bottle tax on wine and boost the 1250 per gallon levy 
on spirits by 2 
it would increase the 9centpergallon federal gasoline tax by 
11 cents and put a 4 percent sales tax on other forms of energy 
it also contemplates extending the 145 percent payroll tax 
people pay on their first 51300 of wages each year to all of 
their additional income if any the tax goes to the costs of 
hospital care provided by medicare 
the documents did not provide additional detail on the taxes in 
the republican roposal 
under the gop plan people earning 50000 annually or less 
would have to pay higher taxes totaling 41 billion americans 
with incomes above that amount would receive breaks worth 11 
billion the documents showed 
one official demanding anonymity said republicans offered the 
package thursday at ongoing negotiations at andrews air force base 
outside washington 
the document describing the democratic plan was dated tuesday 
fifth day of the 7dayold talks but it was unclear when the 
proposal was actually presented at the bargaining table 
officials demanding anonymity said the bargainers were 
beginning to be pressured by interest groups objecting to proposals 
such as higher taxes on beer and boosting the payments medicare 
recipients make differences remained over major stumbling blocks 
such as cuts to domestic programs and president bushs desire to 
cut the capital gains tax rate 
there is no single issue holding it up house speaker thomas 
s foley dwash said of the talks there are a lot of tough 
issues 
foley said he expected the bargaining at andrews air force base 
in maryland 10 miles from washington to conclude by sunday 
both sides have discussed the possibility of increasing the 
2860 monthly medicare premium which covers doctors bills for 
betteroff recipients it would be the first time the programs 
costs were adjusted to the income of the senior citizens it serves 
but officials involved in the talks said they would not be 
surprised to see the proposal toned down or withdrawn in light of 
the tremendous opposition the idea is attracting the 33 million 
senior citizens covered by medicare are considered a potent voting 
bloc 
we believe that proposal is a nonstarter said martin 
corry lobbyist for the american association for retired persons 
the nations largest senior citizens group 
bargainers considered limiting a tax increase on cigarettes to 8 
cents per pack said one official who asked to not be identified 
on wednesday they had discussed doubling the current 16cent levy 
anheuserbusch inc the nations largest brewer began 
submerging congressional offices with more than 1 million letters 
and 13 million petition signatures it has drummed up in a 
welladvertised campaign to block higher beer taxes 
we hope this will convince the negotiators that beer drinkers 
dont want to see this kind of discriminatory tax but well see 
said anheuserbusch spokesman mark abels 
one official said that bargainers were now discussing boosting 
levies on alcohol by 14 billion over five years instead of by 18 
billion but the official did not know what specific taxes would be 
applied to beer wine or spirits under those figures 
although details of the bargaining continued to seep out of 
andrews participants continued trying their best to staunch that 
flow 
as an example foley was asked by reporters if the negotiators 
had reached agreement on any issues 
i think probably maters that i would consider settled but i 
wouldnt want to under torture tell you what they are he 
responded

a swiss bank has withdrawn its offer to 
guarantee 50 million in loans to philadelphia and gov robert 
casey said thursday the state could not provide even shortterm 
relief to the nearbankrupt city 
mayor w wilson goode on wednesday postponed the citys attempt 
to sell 375 million in shortterm notes rather than face 
unacceptably high interest rates the swiss bank corp withdrew its 
guarantee of 50 million in temporary loan notes saying the city 
failed to meet certain conditions 
goode met with council members thursday and said he was in 
serious discussion with casey and robert odonnell a 
philadelphia democrat who is speaker of the pennsylvania assembly 
goode and casey are also democrats 
in a week im going to report where we are the mayor said 
in harrisburg casey said there was still hope that the notes 
could be sold when asked if the state could make a shortterm loan 
to the city he said obviously no our budget is closed at 
this point 
casey said he told goode that city officials and the business 
community must work together to solve the crisis 
the responsibility still remains with the elected leadership 
of that city the governor said i dont look at this in 
political terms weve been helpful to the city of philadelphia 
but we have an entire state to take care of 
the citys finance director betsy reveal said legal action 
against the swiss bank corp was being considered 
reveal said city officials signed a contract with the bank and 
met all conditions the bank said only that the city failed to meet 
certain conditions 
goode has said the city would be broke by late this month unless 
it receives a cash infusion and sought to sell the loan notes 
the greater the risk that a city would be unable to pay its 
debts the higher the interest it must offer to buyers of its loan 
notes 
the notes would be repaid from property and business tax 
receipts expected early next year even so the city projects a 
2064 million deficit in its 21 billion budget by next june 
four local banks last week rejected a city request to guarantee 
notes

a 2foot metal rod accidentally put in 
upsidedown caused the flaw in the hubble space telescopes primary 
mirror nasa investigators said thursday 
it is unfortunately an error we now believe an operator is 
likely to have made said lew allen director of nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory who led the investigative team 
it was a technical error made by people of good will who made 
a mistake he said 
the team on thursday concluded two days of meetings at hughes 
danbury optical systems inc which manufactured the 15 billion 
telescopes primary mirror in the late 1970s and early 1980s at 
that time hughes danbury was the optical division of perkinelmer 
corp 
the company conducted tests that revealed the error but they 
were considered unreliable at the time and disregarded allen said 
the name of the operator who made the mistake was not released 
the rod made of the temperatureinsensitive metal invar was 
used in a measuring device called a reflective null corrector 
which read the curve of the mirrors surface as it was polished 
the incorrect placement led to a 13 millimeter spacing error that 
caused the mirror to be made into the wrong shape 
no one could tell with a naked eye that the rod was upsidedown 
because it was surrounded by other parts of the null corrector he 
said 
the flaw called a spherical aberration has blurred the view of 
the orbiting observatory which was supposed to take razorsharp 
pictures of outer space 
it will be corrected during a previously scheduled 1993 space 
shuttle mission to replace the hubbles most powerful instrument 
the widefield planetary camera said charles pellerin director of 
astrophysics for the national aeronautics and space administration 
pellerin said it would cost an extra 15 million to correct the 
flaw nasa originally estimated the new camera would cost up to 65 
million he said 
allen said many tests could have detected the error during the 
manufacturing process but perkinelmer scientists and engineers 
didnt do them because they were pressured to finish the project 
the pressures including cost overruns and time constraints 
distracted those working on the mirror he said some tests that 
detected the error were considered unreliable at the time he said 
they could have been trusted they werent allen said 
but allen said that did not mean perkinelmer was negligent 
with 2020 hindsight one would clearly say there was 
negligence but you have to take into account the situation that 
actually existed he said 
the investigative team which visited hughes danbury three 
times will issue a final report soon allen said 
nasas office of the inspector general continues to investigate 
pellerin said 
the flaw discovered shortly after hubble was launched in april 
is one of a series of problems facing the space agency nasas 
shuttles were grounded because of fuel leaks and its magellan 
spacecraft temporarily ceased communication with earth while 
orbiting venus 
because of the hubble flaw nasa withheld about 3 million in 
socalled performance fees to hughes danbury pellerin said 
performance fees represent a companys profit after nasa has paid 
for labor costs 
nasas total contract with the company was worth about 450 
million and hughes has received 10 million in performance fees he 
said

japan will provide an additional 3 billion in aid 
to international peacekeeping forces in the persian gulf and 
nations suffering from the unsponsored embargo against iraq the 
government announced friday 
the cabinet decision brings japans total aid in the gulf crisis 
to more than 4 billion members of the us congress had 
complained japan was not doing more in the crisis and had not 
contributed enough in light of its high dependence on middle east 
oil 
misoji sakamoto the chief government spokesman said prime 
minister toshiki kaifu had telephoned president bush to notify him 
of the increase in contribution 
president bush expressed deep appreciation and told kaifu that 
he will tell his people that japan is playing an active role in the 
international effort in the gulf sakamoto told reporters 
sakamoto said japan would provide 1 billion to the usled 
forces deployed in the gulf region in the aftermath of iraqs aug 
2 invasion of oilrich kuwait in addition to 1 billion already 
pledged together iraq and kuwait possess 20 percent of the 
worlds oil reserves 
another 2 billion would go to egypt jordan and turkey to help 
them overcome setbacks from the economic embargo imposed against 
iraq he added 
of the aid for those frontline states sakamoto said japan would 
give 600 million in the first year as an exceptional measure to 
respond to the emergency situation 
he said it would be in the form of a loan at 1 percent annual 
interest repayable in 30 years 
the additional contribution to the peacekeeping forces was based 
on the development of the situation in the middle east and 
international efforts of other countries sakamoto said 
the 4 billion dollar total figure matched the contribution that 
japanese press reports said the united states was demanding from 
japan 
japan pledged aug 29 it would provide 1 billion dollars in 
nonmilitary aid to the peacekeeping forces the first shipment of 
800 fourwheeldrive vehicles and other equipment already has left 
for the middle east 
it also announced 22 million to help refugees stranded in the 
region 
sakamoto said japans increased contribution was not in response 
to us demands 
this is japans contribution to the world based on the united 
nations resolutions we are not only listening to what the 
united states says he added 
sakamoto said the expanded contribution was the maximum japan 
could provide at this point 
sakamoto also reiterated japans rejection of efforts by the 
us house of representatives to link japans contribution to the 
gulf peacekeeping effort with japanese support for american troops 
based here

the organization of american states wants 
tosend 400 election monitors to haiti but doesnt have the money 
secretarygeneral joao clemente baena soares said wednesday 
his remark at the regular weekly meeting of the oas permanent 
council was regarded as an indirect appeal for the united states to 
pay 51 million it owes the organization 
baena soares spoke after a haitian diplomat told the council 
haitians will begin registering for the election during the first 
week in october but ambassador raymond joseph said no date has

democratic vote in haiti may be greater now than at any time in 
its recent history 
mrs pascal trouillot 43 a widow and one of only a handful of 
female judges in haiti was a justice of the supreme court when 
selected by a coalition of opposition leaders to fill the post

americans accustomed to watching presidents 
and members of congress on television will get their first 
televised look at federal judges at work next year 
the us judicial conference which sets policy for the federal 
courts approved on wednesday a carefully controlled and limited 
plan to permit tv cameras to record and broadcast civil trials in a 
handful of federal courtrooms 
the threeyear experiment will begin in july limited to two 
federal appeals courts and six trial courts judges who volunteer

plans to bomb a us marine barracks in lebanon in 1983 but gave 
the cia only a vague warning about the attack in which 241 
americans were killed a new book claims 
the allegation is one of many by victor ostrovsky a canadian 
graphic artist who says he served for four years as an operative of 
the fabled israeli spy agency the mossad 
a new york court at the israeli governments request on 
wednesday issued a temporary order barring the publisher st 
martins press from distributing the book the suit said

the 300page book by way of deception the making and 
unmaking of a mossad officer was written in collaboration with 
canadian journalist claire hoy it purports to name many mossad 
agents and supervisors as it describes in detail ostrovskys

perus new president says washington can keep 
the millions in military aid its offering to step up the war on 
cocaine trafficking he wants cash to get farmers to stop growing 
coca and for highway construction so alternate crops can make it to 
market 
because the aid package is destined only for the fight against 
drug trafficking we are not going to sign this agreement 
president alberto fujimori said wednesday night 
his statement appeared to torpedo any hope his 6weekold 
government will accept the 359 million in military aid washington 
is offering this year to fight the cocaine trade 
peru could use the money the country is reeling from the

when the bay areabased tony toni tone talks 
about a revival the bands not flashing back to the 1960s high 
times in the haight or the jefferson airplane 
these guys were infants in the summer of love and they 
dont play any laidback hippie music 
what were talking about on the revival tip is a couple of 
things one is the revival of old sounds acoustic instruments 
theres too much of machines these days we wanted to bring the 
acoustic sounds back said vocalist dwayne wiggins 23 
and its the revival of tony toni tone we controlled 
everything on this album writing producing that means a lot to 
us 
not surprisingly the tonys second album came to be titled 
revival its already revived the sales which brought their 
debut lp who to the top of the charts who sold more 
than 700000 copies and had three no 1 singles on the black charts 
their first single off album no 2 the blues went top five 
as well 
mighty impressive work by the funky sixpiece band none of whom 
are named tony they are instead guitaristvocalist dwayne and 
his singing brother ray drummer timothy christian bassist elijah 
baker and keyboardists antron haile and carl wheeler 
while revival is not about the 60s theres a bit of the 
70s in there oakland stroke pays homage to sly stone while 
whatever you want echoes earth wind amp fire if theres a bit 
of the past in this bands current funk blame on on their 
upbringing says wiggins 
that wasnt purposely its something we inherited growing up 
influenced by certain musicians he said motown definitely 
james brown ohio players i like that kind of stuff barry white 
that big bottom sound 
the bands name came from a childhood expression among the 
members for looking good its biggest break came from a man 
with an inherited ear for music ed eckstine son of the brilliant 
billy eckstine who helped the group get a recording contract 
so how does the son of one of americas most influential jazz 
vocalists get an ear for funk 
eds real sharp hes part of the movement said wiggins 
referring to the new oaklandsan francisco music scene featuring 
mc hammer en vogue and digital underground 
he knows whats happening and hes got a real open mind to 
all types of music theres not too many people out there like 
him 
along with the music the tonys serve up some laughs 
revival opens with the sound of an old woman sitting quietly in 
a rocking chair she breaks the reverie by asking is you gonna 
record another album 
yes maam the tonys reply 
is it gonna be anything like the last album she asks 
no maam respond the tonys 
oh well let me take off my apron the boys is back yall 
dwayne laughs even now when asked about it 
thats just us joking on the mikes a lot of the time when we 
were joking in the studios we kept the mikes on cause we had a 
lot of tracks to blow wiggins continued we kept some of the 
stuff on the album 
up this fall for the band a headling tour an expanded lineup 
of tonys including a horn section and two backup singers will 
get out on the road and more hit singles can be expected wiggins 
said the group would like to release five more 
when the tour is done a third album will follow rest assured 
it will be done in oakland just like the first two 
ive seen other places traveled and investigated but i guess 
im just from oakland ive been here my whole life said 
wiggins im staying even with the earthquakes 
wiggins cant resist giving the needle to a caller from new york 
besides we got the best baseball team out here and rickey 
henderson he said laughing oakland athletics outfielder 
rickey henderson was traded last year by the yankees to the left 
coast he is the likely most valuable player of the american 
league this year

virtually every 10 years since this country 
was founded the nation has played musical chairs with seats in the 
house of representatives its a process that has grown more 
complex with time and technology marked this year by dueling 
computers 
the census bureau pioneered the development of modern computers 
in its efforts to get americans counted 
and today competing factions use the machines to pick apart 
census results seeking to squeeze out every bit of advantage to 
increase their political and financial standing 
americans are counted in every year that ends in a zero to make 
sure each state is fairly represented in the house 
thats because the original compromise that allowed the nation 
to get started provided for states representation to be equal in 
the senate while power in the house would be based on population 
divvying up the house seats sounds like a simple proposition 
divide the number of people by the number of house seats and assign 
one seat to each group of that size 
with 435 seats and a preliminary census count of 245837683 for 
1990 that would mean one house member for every 565144 people 
of course like most things in government it doesnt work out 
that easily 
to begin with house seats are assigned to states a district 
cant be partly in one state and partly in another that creates a 
problem since the populations of individual states dont always 
divide up evenly by 565144 
in fact wyoming doesnt have nearly that many people 
it will get a seat in the house anyway every state gets one 
indeed the first thing that happens when reapportionment time 
comes is that one seat is assigned to each state its dividing up 
the remaining 385 seats that gets complicated 
how to do this fairly has perplexed politicians since 1790 when 
thomas jefferson and alexander hamilton butted heads over the total 
number of seats and what to do when the number of people in the 
average district didnt divide evenly into the state population 
hamiltons plan prevailed in congress and president washington 
exercised the nations first veto when congress couldnt override 
the veto it passed jeffersons plan 
officials of small states complained that jeffersons plan 
discriminated against them and in 1840 a plan devised by daniel 
webster was used it awarded an additional seat to any state that 
had more than half of a district population left over after all 
seats had been divided up 
while various other methods were used over the years congress 
avoided taking representatives away from some states and shifting 
them to other states by the simple expedient of increasing the size 
of the house every 10 years 
in general the number of seats was increased to whatever level 
was needed so that states that grew could gain seats without other 
states losing seats 
from 1850 to 1900 a plan devised by samuel f vinton of ohio 
was used but it was abandoned after a mathematical problem was 
found called the alabama paradox it was discovered that increasing 
the size of the house caused alabama to lose a seat 
a more refined system called the method of major fractions was 
used in 1910 
eventually it became obvious that the house would one day 
become so large as to be unmanageable and in 1913 house membership 
was fixed at the current 435 seats 
but disagreement over the method to be used prevented any 
redistricting after the 1920 census 
the method of equal proportions was adopted in 1930 and is still 
used 
that means today when any state adds people and gains a new 
seat some other state has to lose one 
heres how it works 
a set of priority values is developed for each of the 385 
remaining seats and those values are multiplied by each states 
population 
that gives populationleading california the highest priority 
for the next available seat followed by new york and so forth 
this year it looks like california will wind up with 52 seats 
new york with 31 and so on down to wyoming alaska delaware 
montana north and south dakota and vermont whose populations are 
so small that all 385 seats are gone before they get a second one 
assigning the seats to states becomes a fairly straightforward 
task when the formula and populations have been programmed into 
computers 
it gets tougher afterward though as politicians and their 
consultants try to draw lines within the states to organize those 
seats each side tries to improve the chances of getting candidates 
from his or her party elected without being so obvious about it 
that a court throws the plan out 
that will occupy state legislators and their computers for much 
of 1991

picture if you can the galloping 
gourmet gone so spartan in the kitchen that his own family quit 
speaking to him over dinner 
that was a low point in the culinary and spiritual odyssey that 
has led graham kerr back to television 19 years after the wildly 
successful series that made him famous 
along the way a traffic accident nearly killed him and his 
wife treena they spent two years sailing around the world with 
their children they spurned tv and gave away their possessions in 
favor of aid to the poor and church work as bornagain christians 
and treena overcame alcohol and valium addiction and survived a 
heart attack 
now vowing never again to preach the rampant legalism that 
once banished pleasure from his kitchen kerr rhymes with hair is 
returning with a show under his own name starting monday on nearly 
100 tv stations nationwide 
we are the only show i believe that puts its food out to 
test in the audience on the show itself he said 
judging by three of the 44 episodes produced by treena at 
seattles king television kerr and his slimmeddown preparations 
pass the test handily 
gone are the long sideburns omnipresent wine glass and classic 
concoctions oozing calories and cholesterol the galloping gourmet 
brought to households worldwide 
exuberant as ever at age 56 he now seeks to create a cloud of 
aroma and color and texture and then steal into that cloud and 
steal away the fat and salt and sugar 
his recipes are analyzed down to the fat level of lemon 931 
percent and the salt count of celery 4 milligrams per stalk by a 
7000 computer and software from the university of minnesota 
school of public health 
when a recipe calls for wine its a wine without alcohol 
im trying to provide a creative alternative for people who 
say i dont want to drink wine and drive home he said 
he figures he spends about 11 hours converting a dish like 
quiche lorraine into a healthier and he hopes even more tasty 
alternative for each halfhour show 
rice and parmesan cheese replace the rich quiche crust one egg 
is used rather than three and the amount of ham is cut from six 
ounces to two in favor of mushrooms bell peppers sundried 
tomatoes and lots of thyme and basil he said 
we are very clear this quiche is not a quiche lorraine he 
said quiche lorraine is absolutely deadly real men dont eat 
quiche because real men want to live beyond their 14th birthday 
youll find butter and beef cream and eggs in my dishes but 
they will all be pegged down about twothirds he said 
a native of london kerr was born to wellestablished hotel 
operators and trained from age 15 he held the rank of captain and 
served as catering adviser during a fiveyear stint in the british 
army 
in 1958 kerr moved to new zealand where he was named chief 
catering advisor for the royal new zealand air force 
at the order of his senior officer he began appearing on tv he 
left the service launched a cooking show in australia and moved to 
canada where he hit the big time with 440 episodes of the 
galloping gourmet from 1969 to 1971 
witty amusing and sometimes outrageous kerr eventually reached 
200 million viewers around the world each week he sold 4 million 
worth of books including the galloping gourmet tv series 
the graham kerr cookbook and the complete galloping gourmet 
cookbook 
as producer treena won two emmy nominations 
then a vegetable truck piled into their onlocation vehicle 
outside san francisco while they recuperated the family sailed 
more than 24000 miles aboard a 71foot sailboat 
their personal life disintegrated treena was hooked on valium 
and two of his three children on alcohol and drugs the success of 
a fourminute show take kerr grew increasingly hollow and he 
abandoned it 
that was when their maid converted the couple to the pentecostal 
faith over the next decade the kerrs lived in colorado hawaii 
and oregon working in christian outreach programs then settled in 
tacoma wash in 1981 
always the primary cook at home kerr went from reveling in each 
new taste sensation to banning one food after another from the 
household 
salami chocolate even bran cereal when i found out it 
was about 40 percent sugar my poor family suffered he said i 
mean can you imagine i was preaching to a 7yearold child about 
colon cancer 
it was horrible treena said the kids would whisper about 
sneaking out to mcdonalds 
finally the family stopped talking to him at the table 
that got to me he said so i started to build back the 
enjoyment factor in my family cooking and my family started 
talking to me again 
the final ingredient of kerrs culinary rebirth was treenas 
1986 heart attack adding a personal incentive to wring as much 
fat salt and sugar out of his recipes as possible 
eating is a celebration he said weve got it with bells 
on why dont we enjoy it to the max but without risk

leopold stokowskis hands carve the air 
yellow and pink lights illuminating his every move as he brings 
bachs toccata and fugue in d minor to visual life 
soon he and the orchestra disappear replaced by clouds 
abstract lines shifting shapes and beams of light it is 
absolute music we are told in the opening moments of walt 
disneys animated tribute to classical music fantasia 
and this autumn stokowski will once again shake hands with 
mickey mouse as a restored version of the 1940 classic plays on 
movie screens throughout the united states 
the film two years in restoration will have its gala premiere 
sept 21 in philadelphia as a benefit for the curtis institute of 
music a tuitionfree conservatory for exceptionally gifted young 
musicians already showing in europe the film is scheduled for 
general release in the united states on oct 5 
fantasia was revolutionary when it appeared and today 
remains a landmark blend of cinema and music largely because of 
the collaboration of disney and stokowski the legendary conductor 
of the philadelphia orchestra 
disney had tinkered with synchronization of cartoons and music 
as early as 1929 in the skeleton dance the first of his more 
than 70 silly symphonies 
he first approached stokowski with the idea of recording dukas 
the sorcerers apprentice and animating it the plan grew into 
a concert of eight classical works narrated by deems taylor a 
popular composer and radio broadcaster 
the animated vignettes begin with abstract designs swaying to 
bach and shift to fireflies mushrooms flowers fish and thistles 
in tchaikovskys the nutcracker suite 
mickey puts on his masters cap and instructs brooms to carry 
water then loses control of them in the sorcerers apprentice 
moments after the vignette mickeys silhouette shakes hands with 
stokowski at the podium 
dinosaurs act out the origin of the earth to the strains of 
stravinskys the rite of spring 
fauns centaurs and a drunken bacchus populate mount olympus in 
beethovens pastoral symphony a tutuclad hippopotamus is the 
star of ponchiellis dance of the hours performing a graceful 
and funny pas de deux with a crocodile the vignette includes 
other dancing hippos crocodiles elephants and ostriches 
evil and the profane meet the forces of goodness and light in 
mussorgskys night on bald mountain and schuberts ave 
maria ends the film on a pious note as a processional is 
reflected in a pool of water 
the original soundtrack was recorded in april 1939 by the 
philadelphia orchestra under stokowski at the academy of music 
nearly half the orchestras members are graduates of the curtis 
institute and the walt disney co thought philadelphia would be 
the appropriate city in which to have the first showing of the 
restored version 
to restore the film disney used modern film stock and improved 
lenses to extract more detail and color from the original nitrate 
negative than seen in versions released a half century ago 
in a version of fantasia shown in theaters in 1982 and 1985 
the soundtrack was by studio musicians the new version not only 
restores the philadelphia orchestra but recreates stokowskis 
vision for a fantasound soundtrack that distributed sound 
throughout the theater in the days before stereo and digital sound 
the film originally traveled with a complex system of up to 135 
speakers to which the sound had to be switched manually it later 
showed in theaters with a simpler mono soundtrack 
the music however was never uniformly popular with critics 
many of whom considered stokowskis treatment of beethoven and bach 
as verging on sacrilege some of disneys caricatures have been 
criticized for being overly cute and the only black animated 
characters are servants for bacchus 
but stokowski saw the film as a pioneering development 
we who with walt disney made fantasia think of it not as 
perfect or final but as the beginning of a new art form he 
wrote in 1940 
our aim was to make use of all the most recent scientific 
developments in recording and reproducing music methods that 
seemed to us helpful in making music more eloquent and so be of 
greater service to all those who enjoy music 
much of the effort was to make the music flow around moviegoers 
as if they were in a forest listening to birds all around them 
instead of in a theater stokowski wrote 
what people will be hearing probably hasnt been heard since 
1941 the actual fantasound the way it was intended to be 
heard said terry porter who headed the sound restoration for 
disney its quite dynamic even by todays standard of films 
he used stokowskis handwritten notes old blueprints and 1940s 
journals to direct the music through modern theater sound systems 
he estimated 3000 pops and hisses were removed from the soundtrack 
we really tried to keep the music to its original integrity 
he said we didnt want to mess with the original sound if in 
removing a pop we would hurt the sound we left the pop in 
similar care was taken to adhere to the original visual images 
in restoration said pete comandini vice president of engineering 
for ycm laboratories which did the work under the direction of 
disneys leon briggs 
original negatives were rescued from disney vaults for all but 
about 15 minutes of the film comandini said 
each frame was individually examined and cleaned this dirt 
being on there for 50 years some of it was quite stubborn and had 
to be cleaned by razor blade he said 
the restorers mandate was to make no modifications it was a 
big jigsaw puzzle putting everything together making sure 
everything fit to the exact frame as it originally was comandini 
said 
finally the color was balanced and approved by the studio 
the picture is quite a bit sharper he said the colors 
are quite nice and rich and saturated theres a lot of detail in 
there thats subtle and probably hasnt been seen since it was 
released 
the curtis institute hopes to raise 100000 from the benefit 
screening of fantasia to be used toward a threeyear 52 
million fund drive said james mcclelland curtis development 
director 
the institute was founded in 1924 by mary louise curtis bok in 
memory of her father cyrus hk curtis founder of curtis 
publishing co the school counts conductor leonard bernstein 
composer samuel barber and pianist peter serkin among its graduates 
this fall 164 students from the united states and 13 foreign 
countries are expected to study with the schools 76member 
faculty the institute is tuition free so students are admitted 
based on their musical talents

from hightech chicken pot pies to powdered 
soft drinks a supersecret world is at work on much of our food 
the flavor industry replaces the savor we destroy making a tv 
dinner taste less like cardboard 
in processing food to get it into the form people want or to 
make it safe flavor is processed out said bob pellegrino 
general manager at cincinnatibased fries amp fries one of the 
nations largest flavor producers 
grandma went to her garden or market for fresh produce hours 
before preparing and serving it but weve come to expect food to 
wait months in warehouses and on store shelves before its popped 
into a microwave oven to be ready to eat in seconds and to still 
taste as good as grandmas 
to a surprising degree it does thanks to flavorists who have 
created an estimated 750 millionayear industry that helps make 
the food we eat palatable 
flavorists usually are chemists who have spent several years 
learning to identify and duplicate natural flavors many say then 
can discern thousands of flavors nuances such as the difference 
between the part of an apple near the skin and the part near the 
core 
the flavorists challenge is to restore natural flavors no 
matter what modern processing packaging storage and cooking have 
done to them 
americas changing lifestyle means that food processors have to 
compensate for flavor that used to be provided by animal fats 
cream and other highcholesterol foods that dont fit into our 
dietconscious lives 
there are a few words that are driving our industry light 
or lowfat natural and convenient pellegrino said 
flavoring agents are pervasive dairy products bakery goods 
desserts and beverages of all kinds are laced with flavorings just 
about every package in your pantry lists flavoring as an ingredient 
because ingredients are listed in descending order by weight 
flavoring is last because it comprises less than onehalf of 1 
percent of the weight of the product sometimes just a few parts 
per million 
that means 100 pounds of flavoring makes more than 20000 
pounds of product pellegrino said liquid flavoring rolls out of 
his plant in 55gallon drums and powders in 10000pound lots 
the flavormaking industry is secretive and clannish pellegrino 
said a food company that markets its brand has a proprietary 
interest in the way its pot pie pudding or potato chip tastes and 
doesnt want anybody else to produce that flavor 
theres a high level of trust between the flavor company and 
the food and beverage company pellegrino said service and 
confidentiality are important wed be out of business pretty 
quickly if we said we were flavoring this or flavoring that 
he refuses to identify any brand that uses his products but he 
says fries amp fries and a competitor international flavors and 
fragrances inc are among the nations largest each handling 
about 10 percent of the industrys business or upward of 50 
million a year 
there are about 100 flavor companies in the united states and 
about 80 of them belong to the washington dcbased flavor and 
extract manufacturers association said earl klinger the groups 
administrator 
the association refuses to acknowledge any ranking among the 
industrys companies or the volume of the business 
we really do not know for certain klinger said its not 
legally possible to patent copyright or otherwise protect a 
formula for a flavor so the only way one company can maintain a 
competitive advantage is to keep it a secret 
ive heard all sorts of figures and we really have no way of 
knowing 
flavorists like to say they can reproduce a flavor from taste 
the way some musicians play songs by ear in practice they usually 
start by analyzing the chemical content of a food by using a gas 
chromatograph and listing the ingredients 
then they recreate flavors in the laboratory altering them any 
way they choose by for example making a fruit drink taste riper 
sweeter or more tart 
there might be 500 components in any flavor and it is the 
distinctive formulation of those components that makes one brand of 
soft drink taste different from another brand 
this is very much a selfpoliced industry although we work in 
partnership with the food and drug administration pellegrino 
said 
flavoring ingredients come from the fdas generally recognized 
as safe list and many flavors are recreated from chemicals that 
occur naturally to produce the flavor being enhanced he said 
ruth weisheit supervisor of consumer affairs at the fdas 
cincinnati office said flavorings are regulated as food additives 
any new flavorings or new uses of a flavoring agent would require 
fda testing to make sure it is safe 
under the 1938 food labeling act artificial flavorings can be 
listed as flavoring without identifying individual ingredients ms 
weisheit said 
one of the reasonings is that a flavoring agent can 
contain literally hundreds of ingredients and it would be almost 
impossible to have a label large enough to list all of them she 
said 
not all flavorings are used in food ms weisheit noted they 
are in cough syrups lipstick mouthwash and drug products 
flavorings are widely used throughout the beverage industry 
from soft drinks and powdered mixes to liqueurs such as peach 
schnapps and apricot brandy 
a bigger challenge is making flavor additives that stand up to 
processing especially microwave cooking which tends to distort 
traditional flavors especially in meat and bakery products 
when you bake a cake a lot of the flavor comes from the 
baking process and you just dont get that from a microwave 
pellegrino said there is no charbroiled flavor in a microwaved 
hamburger without a flavor assist 
sometimes a laboratorycreated flavor thats good for one item 
is bad for another because of the way texture aroma and flavor are 
affected by cooking or the preservatives necessary to prolong 
shelflife 
in beverages you dont want the flavor to linger but you do 
want it in lowfat ice cream pellegrino said

as idahos famous potato enters the 21st 
century it may be dressed with something more than the same old 
sour cream and chives a new genetic identity 
scientists at the university of idahos aberdeen research and 
extension center are taking the first steps toward weaving new 
genes into the potatos molecular tapestry 
their super spud would have enhanced consumer appeal increased 
grower profitability and reduced environmental impact 
the potato is going to change its changing now said bill 
belknap a plant physiologist with the usdas agricultural research 
service 
the tuber of the future will be rugged it will ward off viruses 
and bruises withstand drought and even carry natural toxins to 
kill the insects used to feasting on it 
were trying to alter the genetic makeup and still make it 
normal in all other respects said dennis corsini a research 
plant pathologist in aberdeen its all designed to produce a 
crop more efficiently 
the idea of genetically altered food may make consumers leery 
but done successfully it could put the potatoes currently lost to 
insects and disease on the dinner table 
although genetic alterations are fairly new for idahos no 1 
crop they have been conducted for some time on plants like 
tomatoes or tobacco because the commercial end of the spud the 
tuber is produced on an annual cycle the researchers have only 
one chance each year to transform and then review it 
its terrifying belknap said spring comes whether youre 
ready or not you only get one shot per year 
belknap and colleagues gene jockeys he calls them have 
added two additional marker genes this year to several 
varieties of potatoes one resists a certain drug and the other 
contains a specific enzyme they will not change the potato as much 
as show a genetic change has taken place 
belknap applies agrobacteria containing the genetic signal to 
the host potatos tissue the bacteria create a disorganized 
tissue or gall as the new genes meld with the plants molecular 
dna ladder 
the genes it puts in are so cute you wouldnt believe it 
belknap said its how mother nature does it 
if the initial experiments turn out well this year corsini and 
research geneticist joe pavek will cross the altered plants called 
constructs with standard varieties like aberdeens lemhi 
russet in 1991 
then the new hybrids will be tested for quality and yield 
characteristics researchers will then start tinkering to improve 
their stamina in the field and storage bin 
one identified gene could make the potatoes resistant to black 
spots those ugly bruises beneath the skin other genes would fight 
soft rot or leafroll virus potatoes could even be designed to 
accommodate the droughts plaguing the west 
yet another gene would create a toxin fatal to the colorado 
potato beetle coast producers now spray their fields five times a 
year to combat it corsini said 
other potato problems are harder to eradicate belknap said it 
would require an extensive genetic overhaul to prevent sugar 
end or the migration of carbohydrates to one end of the tuber 
french fry producers reject those potatoes because the sugar turns 
dark brown when it hits the cooking oil 
but success could mean the demise of idahos worldrenowned 
baker the russet burbank that makes up 40 percent of the potato 
acreage in the country it is pollensterile and cannot be used as 
a parent plant so it probably will not be genetically crossed and 
someday a potato boasting super genes could take its place on top 
of the heap 
the agriculture departments animal and plant health inspection 
service oversees the tests and requires a long paper trail of 
applications before permits are granted

two professors say carbon dating of wood 
fragments and other evidence found a century ago in an ancient tomb 
in tennessee prove hebrews sailed to america centuries before 
columbus 
but the professors are having little success convincing other 
scholars 
cyrus gordon a former dartmouth college professor of judaic 
culture proposed the theory in 1971 after studying inscriptions on 
a stone from the tomb 
he believes the words are old hebrew for strong or 
strength and for judea based on the way the letters are 
drawn gordon an expert on epigraphy the study of old writings 
figures they had to be inscribed around ad 100 
the inscription is important because it is the first 
scientifically authenticated precolumbian text in an old world 
script or language found in america he wrote in a paper 
describing the finding it proves that some old world people not 
only could but actually did cross the atlantic to america before 
the vikings and columbus 
frank cross a semitic languages professor at harvard 
university is among the skeptics 
the inscriptions he said dont fit any paleohebrew script 
that i know most of the signs are unrelated a few have 
superficial similarities but they dont go together for that 
period 
cyrus gordon is the only scholar in the field of epigraphy 
that i know of who has taken the stuff seriously he said 
gordon of brookline mass stands by his findings 
for any rational person to deny these facts they have to deny 
not only the evidence of the inscriptions they have to deny all 
the rules of scientific dating he said 
gordon said brass bracelets from the tomb support his theory 
they contain a zinccopper alloy used by the romans from ad 45 to 
200 he said 
gordon said that for years he talked little about his theory 
because he had no way to prove the artifacts were as old as he 
believed he wanted to have the wood fragments carbondated but 
the process wasnt advanced enough to work on such a small amount 
of wood 
in 1979 with the advent of better testing methods j huston 
mcculloch of ohio state university began pestering the smithsonian 
institution which had the artifacts to have the wood carbondated 
finally in 1988 mcculloch an economics professor with an 
interest in epigraphy got the institute for the study of american 
cultures in columbus ga to pay for the dating 
it established that the wood dated to somewhere between ad 32 
and 769 columbus sailed to the new world in 1492 while the 
vikings landed in newfoundland canada sometime around 1000 
mcculloch and gordon theorize that hebrew sailors were trying to 
escape roman repression after one of two rebellions the first 
ending in ad 73 the second in 135 
gordon believes the sailors landed in the southeastern united 
states were forced inland because the coast was settled by 
american indians and got as far as loudon county in eastern 
tennessee about 30 miles southwest of presentday knoxville 
the bat creek tomb was unearthed in 1889 it contained nine 
skeletons with the heads of all but one pointing north under the 
skull and jawbone of the southpointing skeleton were several 
objects including the inscribed stone 
gordon theorized the southpointing skeleton was the leader of 
the settlement mcculloch said the wood fragments probably were 
part of an earspool worn by the leader 
cyrus thomas who headed the smithsonian team that unearthed the 
tomb believed the stone inscriptions were done by cherokee 
indians but gordon said the shape of the lettering isnt 
consistent with cherokee inscriptions 
mcculloch published the carbondating results in the journal 
tennessee anthropologist but they attracted little attention 
theres been kind of a stony silence he said its sort 
of been ignored 
mike shoemaker assistant editor of biblical archaeology review 
in washington dc isnt surprised though he considers the bat 
creek findings the best example of precolumbian contact in 
america gordons and mccullochs work has been ignored because it 
runs contrary to accepted theories shoemaker said 
its mostly ignored because its so controversial he said 
the prejudice about the idea that anyone came before columbus is 
so enormous its practically impossible to overcome

at 21000plus feet on mount everest 
courtney skinner knew he was in trouble every breath he drew was 
painful as if he had a crushed chest 
the pinedale wyo outfitter knew his only chance was to 
breathe in large amounts of oxygen quickly to counter the liquid 
that nearly filled his lungs a symptom of acute mountain sickness 
i was very critical he said under my own motivation i 
had no more power 
skinner a member of the 1988 cowboys on everest expedition 
became one of the first mountain climbers to test the gamow bag a 
pressurized bag resembling a humansize cigar tube that combats the 
effects of illnesses such as acute mountain and decompression 
sicknesses 
after 11 hours of inhaling oxygen in the bag skinner emerged 
with his lungs 90 percent clear and he was able to resume his 
ascent his alternative would have been abandoning the expedition 
and being carried to a lower altitude for lifesaving oxygen 
treatments 
highaltitude illnesses such as acute cerebral edema and acute 
pulmonary edema are caused by a lack of oxygen in the blood early 
symptoms include shortness of breath fatigue dizziness and 
nausea in later stages the sometimesfatal illnesses cause fluid 
to fill the lungs or the brain 
mountain climbers long have known that the cure for 
highaltitude sicknesses is descent the lower the altitude the 
more abundant the oxygen but descent isnt always possible 
particularly for climbers who are too ill to move or if the 
weather is bad 
the gamow bag gives the effect of lowering altitude 1 miles by 
pumping fresh air into the pressurized chamber zipped inside the 
bag climbers fill their lungs with muchneeded oxygen 
when the pressure started you could almost feel a warmth or a 
glow come over you recalled skinner you were more 
comfortable you werent fighting for each breath 
the bright redandyellow bag has been credited with saving 
about a dozen critically ill mountain climbers in the past three 
years says its inventor igor gamow a professor at the university 
of colorado 
now hes looking at ways of using the bag to aid balloonists 
and pilots and even scuba divers suffering from decompression 
sickness 
gamow who has a doctorate in biophysics and microbiology 
recalled that a suggestion from gary ruggera a former student led 
to the development of the bag 
he said igor if athletes can gain from the benefits 
just think what would happen to mountain climbers gamow 
recalled 
at the time gamow was conducting highaltitude training tests 
on athletes who worked out on equipment inside an 8foot 
pressurized bubble chamber he fitted that technology into the 
portable bag which weighs about 10 pounds 
the spring of 1987 found gamow stitching a length of 
polyurethane nylon on a sewing machine it would take maybe two 
hours sewing and 10 hours on your hands and knees sealing it with 
all sorts of sticky goop he recalled 
the first goop they used was a glue for repairing tennis 
shoes today the bag which is marketed by dupont corp is sealed 
with a heatseal process it sells for 3000 
ian d schokking a volunteer physician at the kunde hospital in 
the 13000foot sagamatha national park in nepal wrote to gamow 
this spring that the bag has saved the lives of at least two 
patients 
our location and the expense of oxygen makes your gamow bag 
the perfect technology for treating altitude illness within our 
treatment area which extends two days walk in four directions 
schokking wrote 
after spending most of his life in research gamow is delighted 
with the turn his career has taken hes traveled the world on 
behalf of his bag and makes annual educational trips to nepal

a 3yearold born deaf is learning to use an 
electronic device implanted in his ear to transmit sound and help 
him hear 
each time bradley drymon indicates hes heard a sound emitted 
from his therapists computer he thumps a blue box in front of him 
and a small colorful ball of cereal rolls down a chute 
he pops it into his mouth and waits for the next sound a beep 
on june 28 the sarasota tot had a tiny soundtransmitting 
electrode inserted into his ear canal during surgery at tampa 
general hospital the surgery came one day after the food and drug 
administration declared the procedure safe for children 
the electrode called a cochlear implant replaces the natural 
soundtransmitting connection between the ear and the hearing 
nerve the child didnt have that connection 
after his incision healed the threepart device had to be 
hooked up he just started learning to use his electronic ear with 
the help of two audio therapists at the university of south florida 
its going much better than expected said holly skinner a 
specialist who uses sign language to communicate with bradley she 
also dispenses the cereal 
when bradley first heard a beep it was pretty traumatic 
she said 
he started crying and trying to rip off his head we couldnt 
get him back in the room for an hour ms skinner said 
the therapists work to tune the device so it will receive the 
volume and pitch the boy can hear by watching his reactions they 
determine the softest volume he can hear and the loudest he can 
stand 
the 1inch wire winding in his ear has 22 electrodes each of 
which picks up a variety of pitches and volumes 
every once in a while his eyes will light up and youll know 
hes heard something said his mother sylvia drymon he even 
picks up the beat on the radio

the theory that more than four 
fundamental forces govern the universe is under attack again this 
time from physicists who measured gravity inside holes drilled for 
nuclear weapons tests 
the new study was published in the sept 3 issue of the journal 
physical review letters by j thomas of lawrence livermore national 
laboratory and peter vogel of the california institute of 
technology 
physicists long believed there were four basic forces of nature 
gravity electromagnetism which creates light electricity radio 
waves and microwaves the strong force which holds the centers of 
atoms together and the weak force which lets some atoms decay 
radioactively 
but starting in 1985 a series of experiments raised the 
possibility there might be a fifth force which slightly 
counteracts gravity and a sixth force which boosts gravity 
slightly 
those experiments were based on gravity measurements made inside 
a mine shaft on a television tower at the base of a cliff and in 
other locations all the experiments found the strength of gravity 
differed slightly from what was predicted by sir isaac newtons 
300yearold law of gravity 
that law says the gravitational attraction between two objects 
decreases with the square of the distance between them 
thomas and vogel analyzed gravity measurements made inside 
10footwide boreholes that extend down as much as 2 miles at the 
nevada test site where us nuclear warheads are detonated in 
underground tests 
they found the strength of gravity at various depths in the 
holes also differed from what newtons law predicted while that 
might be interpreted as evidence for additional forces of nature 
thomas and vogel came up with a much less exotic explanation the 
measurements were flawed by variations in the density of rock 
surrounding the holes 
earlier experiments claiming to support existence of fifth and 
sixth forces of nature also are likely flawed by the same problem 
they wrote 
in 1988 a similar argument was made after gravity was measured 
inside drillholes in greenlands ice sheet

an industrial pollutant dumped into the los 
angeles basins smoggy air shows up one to two days later in nevada 
and arizona a study says 
scientists traced the summertime movement of methylchloroform 
an industrial solvent that helps deplete earths protective ozone 
layer and also contributes to global warming caused by the 
greenhouse effect 
the chemical isnt produced by any natural source allowing 
researchers to use it as an indicator of the path followed by 
manmade pollutants 
they monitored levels of methylchloroform at claremont in the 
los angeles basin at cajon pass in the mountains above the basin 
and at spirit mountain nev and meadview ariz which are 185 
miles and 250 miles northeast of the basin 
the researchers found high methylchloroform levels in the los 
angeles basin on weekdays but low levels on weekends when most 
industries that use it are closed 
at the nevada and arizona sites methylchloroform levels were 
highest wednesday to sunday then lowest on monday and tuesday 
indicating a one to twoday lag for wind to carry the pollutant 
from of the los angeles basin 
the study was conducted by warren h white and edward macias of 
washington university in st louis david miller david schorran 
and thomas hoffer of the desert research institute in reno nev 
and david p rogers at the scripps institution of oceanography in

new research casts doubt on a theory that blames 
extinction of the dinosaurs on global warming caused by huge 
volcanic eruptions in what is now india 
the study is part of the longrunning debate on whether the 
demise of the dinosaurs and many other species about 66 million 
years ago was caused by an asteroid or comet striking earth by 
massive volcanic eruptions or by gradual climate change 
many supporters of the first two theories believe that either an 
asteroid or comet impact or largescale eruptions could have kicked 
enough smoke and debris skyward to block out sunlight plunging the 
earth into a time of deadly cold 
however some volcano theory advocates argue that massive 
eruptions of basalt lava at indias deccan traps 66 million years 
ago could have emitted enough carbon dioxide to cause a 
greenhouse effect trapping solar heat and making the climate 
too hot for dinosaurs and many other creatures 
that theory was tested by ken caldeira of new york universitys 
earth systems group and michael rampino who works for nyu and for 
the national aeronautics and space administration 
they calculated the deccan traps eruptions similar to the 
floods of lava that produced the pacific northwests columbia river 
basalts couldnt have spewed out enough carbon dioxide to cause 
global warming and mass extinctions 
the eruptions occurring over several hundred thousand years 
would have increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
by less than 75 parts per million enough to raise global 
temperatures by less than 18 degrees fahrenheit caldeira and 
rampino estimated 
this suggests that the extinctions were not caused by 
drastic greenhouse warming resulting from carbon dioxide released 
during deccan volcanism they wrote in the august issue of 
geophysical research letters

companies that do most of the countrys oil 
exploration say oil well investors need better tax incentives to 
meet president bushs call for more production but 
environmentalists are ready to fight any favors for the industry 
smaller oil companies which do most of the exploratory 
drilling say current taxes discourage investment in oil wells but 
environmentalists who think conservation is the way to break 
americas dependence on foreign oil say they will oppose breaks for 
oil companies particularly an opening of the arctic national 
wildlife refuge in alaska for drilling 
its clear that bush cannot understand what conservation 
means he still thinks it means freezing in the dark said dru 
schmidtperkins conservation analyst for the energy conservation 
coalition in washington 
she was responding wednesday to bushs call for more oil 
production in a televised speech to congress the night before the 
president asked lawmakers to speed the development of oil reserves 
in alaska and increase incentives for oil and gas exploration 
the american petroleum institute said bushs comments echoed 
some of what the industry has been asking for but that doesnt 
mean congress will go along 
in general he was saying what we would like to hear because 
our industry is in the doldrums said james merna spokesman for 
the independent petroleum association of america but he just 
didnt come up with the specifics 
environmental groups did not wait for specifics to blast bush 
for indicating that oil companies should be allowed into the arctic 
refuge which is believed to contain the nations largest untapped 
onshore reserve of crude oil 
ms schmidtperkins said bush has a blind spot when it comes to 
conservation measures that would make more sense in the long run 
such as requiring all cars to be made with greater fuel efficiency 
bush has opposed such a measure and his calls for energy 
conservation have not been backed up with any concrete proposals 
for saving fuel his critics point out 
the energy department expected to announce a new longterm 
energy plan toward the end of the year reportedly has an 
interagency task force examining ways to boost development of 
renewable energy sources such as solar wind and biomass 
but sen tom harkin diowa said there was no indication from 
the presidents speech that the administration was putting much 
emphasis in those areas 
never once did he mention renewable energy harkin said 
the oil industry says more exploration is part of the answer to 
reducing americas addiction to overseas crude but despite the 
rapid rise in oil prices that followed iraqs invasion of kuwait on 
aug 2 and the subsequent boycott of their oil there has been no 
rush to find more oil 
well have to look at prices today plus what is a reasonable 
outlook for prices in two to five years and even longer said 
michael e thompson a spokesman for amoco corp many of these 
projects are five or 10 or 20year projects 
major oil companies have not even been able to see yet what the 
persian gulf crisis will do to their earnings in the short run he 
said 
smaller independent oil companies drill about 85 percent of the 
nations wells according to ipaa which represents smaller 
companies its members could use some tax breaks to get out of the 
economic slump that set in when the price of oil collapsed in the 
mid 1980s 
independent oil operators used to borrow cash for drilling but 
many of the companies and the banks that loaned them money have now 
gone under said lloyd n unsell acting president of ipaa the 
number of independent producers has fallen from about 13000 to 
4500 since the bust and unsell said tax incentives might be 
necessary before investors will decide to pump money into oil deals

the london stock market typically a follower of 
new york and tokyo has managed to weather the persian gulf crisis 
better than its global rivals key index figures show 
based on calculations over the six weeks of the gulf standoff 
london stocks are off 79 percent compared with an 188 percent 
decline in japans key market index and a 10 percent drop in the 
dow jones industrial average 
analysts said wednesday that britain has fared better because 
its shares were more realistically priced before iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
britain also is the noncommunist worlds eighth largest oil 
producer making its economy less vulnerable to oil supply 
disruptions and oil price hikes they said 
stocks in japan and west germany where the index has fallen 
167 percent had been particularly overpriced analysts said both 
countries are heavily dependent on imported oil 
west germany also has suffered from the higherthanexpected 
costs of german unification said guenter redeker chief economist 
at chemical bank in frankfurt 
fears that the crisis would seriously disrupt oil supplies sent 
oil prices soaring from below 20 a barrel to above 30 that 
heightened concerns about inflation higher interest rates and 
recession and sent stock prices plummeting worldwide 
in addition to reflecting the performance of their component 
shares stock indexes also are good barometers of economic 
expectations which can affect economic performance itself 
trading volume has been low in the major markets during the 
global bear market the analysts said 
its typical of stock markets generally that when they fall 
there tends to be relatively little turnover its characteristic 
in markets that when they are going up turnover tends to be higher 
than when they are going down said paul turnbull a british 
economist with the london investment firm smith new court plc 
typically during times of turmoil money goes on the move 
investors surprisingly havent turned to the traditional safe 
havens of the us dollar and gold choosing the german mark 
instead redeker cited the attraction of relatively high german 
interest rates 
experts generally agree that the worlds major industrialized 
nations are less vulnerable to oil shocks now than they were in 
the 1970s 
we felt the uk should outperform said richard kersley an 
equity strategist at the london investment firm barclays de zoete 
wedd ltd it should continue and is justified 
the uk had its feet more firmly on the ground in terms of 
what its expectations of the world were before the gulf 
the gulf crisis has forced investors elsewhere to face up to 
poorer earnings prospects which existed even before the invasion 
kersley said slowing economic growth and higher interest rates 
around the globe are to blame 
middle east developments have basically operated as a 
catalyst turnbull said values in japanese and germany he said 
needed to fall anyway and they still need to fall further 
britain stands to gain billions of dollars of extra oil revenue 
the country which is not a member of the 13member organization of 
petroleum exporting countries produces some 2 million barrels a 
day in the north sea it has proven reserves about 4 billion 
barrels according to the parisbased international energy agency 
however higher oil prices likely will worsen britains already 
high inflation rate currently running just under 10 percent and 
likely delay a cut in its 15 percent interest rates 
here are how the four markets main indexes have fared during 
the crisis 
britains financial timesstock exchange 100share index 
closed at 21423 wednesday compared with 23262 on july 31 a

in an important settlement in the nations 
biggest product liability issue attorneys resolved almost all 265 
asbestos lawsuits related to the brooklyn navy yard pleasing a 
judge who wants to clear court dockets nationwide 
us district judge jack b weinstein and new york state supreme 
court justice helen e freedman on wednesday called off a joint 
trial in the cases which stem from asbestos exposure at the old 
shipyard dating to the 1940s 
the judges praised both sides for extraordinary efforts to 
dispose of these cases without expensive and timeconsuming 
trials details on the amount of the settlements were not 
revealed 
weinstein has been leading an effort to reduce the nations 
backlog of 90000 asbestos lawsuits clogging state and federal 
courts 
this is important to demonstrate that settlement of mass cases 
is possible said kenneth feinberg who was appointed by 
weinstein in april to try to settle the cases out of court 
weinstein also is participating in the restructuring of the 
manville trust which handles some 130000 pending settlement 
claims against manville corp and he is overseeing creation of a 
class action to resolve lawsuits against asbestos manufacturers 
that cannot meet outstanding claims 
in several court hearings in recent months weinstein has 
stressed the need for plaintiffs lawyers and defendant companies to 
reach outofcourt settlements he also has criticized the amount 
lawyers have received for handling the cases 
asbestos trials routinely require redundant legal investigation 
of each claim of illness or death related to asbestos the 
insulation material that was used widely at shipyards and other 
construction sites for decades the brooklyn trial had been 
expected to last six months 
attorneys in involved in the case said more than 200 of the 265 
pending lawsuits had been settled the judges said the remaining 
cases would proceed to trial separately in state and federal court 
rather than in a joint trial 
settlement negotiations had whittled the number of brooklyn navy 
yard cases down from 615 when weinstein and freedman announced 
consolidation into a single trial 
feinberg said negotiations would continue to resolve the 
remaining cases before opening arguments scheduled for next week 
new york has been slow to resolve serious cases involving 
diseases such as lung cancer and other respiratory ailments because 
of a glitch in state law 
unlike most other states new yorks legislature had applied a 
statute of limitations that effectively prevented lawsuits against 
asbestos makers illness from inhaling asbestos fibers can take 
decades to appear but the state had required suing close to the 
time of exposure 
in 1986 the state lifted the ban allowing claimants one year 
to file claims against asbestos manufacturers many of those 
claims some of which were diagnosed as long ago as 20 years only 
now are being resolved 
the government shipyard in brooklyn first opened in the 1780s 
and was known formally as the new york naval yard construction 
peaked during world war ii when 70000 people worked there round 
the clock the facility was ordered closed in 1964

customers of companyowned arbys restaurants 
will soon be able to pay for their sandwiches shakes and fries 
with a credit card under a program the fastfood operator is 
launching with mastercard international 
atlantabased arbys and other fastfood chains have been 
testing creditcard payment plans in specific markets for several 
years 
but arbys said wednesday its move to take its program to all 
its companyowned stores would make it the first major fastfood 
chain to accept credit cards on a national scale 
the company said it plans to start taking credit cards in early 
october at its companyowned stores in portland ore and later 
this year at companyowned stores in toledo ohio salt lake city 
utah memphis tenn and west palm beach fla 
in 1991 the program will be expanded to the other 17 cities 
where the company owns restaurants there are 2350 arbys 
restaurants nationwide but only 244 are owned by the company 
itself the others are franchised and it is up to their owners 
whether to take credit cards 
mastercard and arbys said they would spend 1 million over the 
next year to promote the program through advertising and signs in 
the stores 
rege braun director of research and development operations for 
arbys inc said the company expects that by taking credit cards 
sales will improve 
in tests in about 100 arbys restaurants in cleveland 
pittsburgh phoenix and youngstown ohio the company found the 
average purchase with a credit card was 6 to 7 compared with an 
average of 380 for someone paying with cash 
in many cases when you are using plastic the natural tendency 
is to be freer with your money braun said 
in addition he said the chance to pay with a credit card could 
attract customers who may otherwise go home because they had too 
little cash to feed the family or go to a more expensive restaurant 
that accepts credit cards 
braun said that while the marketing campaign will mention only 
mastercard arbys also intends to accept visa credit cards 
jody hancock a mastercard executive responsible for new market 
development said the company is involved in similar test programs 
with seven of the top 10 fastfood restaurant chains but that 
arbys is the first to begin expanding nationally to all its 
companyowned stores 
she said the system will use a payment technology that will 
allow customers to pay for their food in seconds without having to 
sign a receipt slip the store owner will pass the card through a 
monitor that will screen out stolen or invalid cards in less time 
that it would take to pay cash and get change she said 
she said mastercard has been intent on positioning itself as 
the best card for mainstream america and hopes to get movie 
houses parking lots and convenience stores to begin accepting the 
credit cards as well 
mastercard is accepted at 82 million locations around the 
world she said

two afterhours trading sessions mark the new 
york stock exchanges first decisive response to eroding market 
share and competing technology in the united states and abroad but 
not everyone is happy 
experts said the move risks alienating the nyses powerful 
specialists but is necessary to lure back large amounts of 
institutional stock trading that has defected to foreign markets 
particularly london 
the exchange is really trying to speed up the introduction of 
new technology and is using this afterhours trading as a way of 
getting it done hans stoll a finance professor at vanderbilt 
universitys graduate management school said wednesday 
i view it as a political way to introduce things that some of 
the membership finds unpalatable he said 
the nyse tuesday announced sessions that would last until 5 pm 
and 515 pm beyond the markets normal 4 pm close 
the sessions designed for trading by large institutions and not 
individual investors will provide muchdesired trading anonymity 
now available in some foreign markets and on competing private 
networks in this country 
its an effort to both modernize and deal with the realities 
of the global trading system said jeffrey tabak a principal in 
the new york program trading firm miller tabak hirsch amp co 
the london market which is entirely electronic with no trading 
floor or specialists monitoring trades is used widely by big 
institutions that conduct computerized program trades typically 
involving thousands of shares at once 
in the week of aug 2024 for instance 164 percent of all 
program trading activity was conducted on foreign markets exchange 
statistics show overall the percentage of trades in nyselisted 
stocks handled by the big board slipped to 69 percent last year 
from about 85 percent in 1980 
the nyse plan would try to staunch some of that lost business 
during the two afterhours trading periods known as crossing 
sessions buyers and sellers of stocks would be matched 
electronically 
the sessions could start later this year pending securities and 
exchange commission approval they would bypass the nyse floor 
specialists who regulate trading for the first time in the 
exchanges 198 years 
the exchange envisions some night trading in 1991 with 24hour 
trading by the year 2000 if members want it 
experts said declining revenue and new technology growth has 
pushed the big board into afterhours trading antagonizing 
specialists has long been a fear for the nyse and their reaction 
was predictably chilly 
it is a far cry from trading as anyone knows it said one 
floor specialist who spoke on condition of anonymity it is a 
feeble response to the perceived competitive threat 
the first afterhours session would run from 415 pm to 5 pm 
traders would be able to enter into the exchanges computer system 
orders to buy or sell stock or orders in which buyers and sellers 
already are matched 
at 5 pm the exchange would attempt to match and execute 
orders unmatched trades would be returned to customers all orders 
would be executed at closing prices and trading in a companys 
stock would be halted for the session if any news developed 
affecting its price 
the second session is designed to recapture program trading now 
done in london it would last from 415 pm to 515 pm and would 
continue regardless of news developments 
that session is expected to be crucial to big wall street 
program traders such as morgan stanley amp co painewebber inc and 
kidder peabody amp co which regularly trade after hours in london 
the most common of such trades now conducted in london involve 
converting stockindex futures contracts into the underlying stocks 
by selling the contract to a broker who sells the shares to an 
investor stockindex futures are contracts based on market indexes 
such as the standard amp poors 500 
the nyse hopes to erase the factors that make london attractive 
londons advantages include relaxed disclosure requirements 
guaranteed execution of trades no limitations on trading and 
cheaper costs 
under current big board rules each part of a program trade 
involving a market index must be conducted separately with all 
stocks traded at current market prices the new rules would allow 
an aggregate trade with prices based on the index level 
closing prices of individual stocks are not expected to be 
changed by the new sessions but some market data will be affected 
the nyse said trading volume from the first session will be 
incorporated into the days individual stock volumes and total 
volume volume and the total dollar value of trading in the second 
session will be reported separately 
there will be no public disclosure of participants in the trades 
in either session the exchange said but nyse regulatory 
guidelines will apply to the new trading

cocacola touts itself as the real thing in its 
advertising and consumers worldwide appear to have bought that 
line 
the soft drink finished ahead of sony mercedesbenz and about 
6000 other brands in a new survey by the image consulting firm 
landor associates 
the san franciscobased marketing firm interviewed about 10000 
people in the united states japan and western europe asking them 
to rate brands according to how familiar they were and how highly 
they thought of them 
trailing the top three brands in the global rankings were kodak 
disney nestle toyota mcdonalds ibm and pepsicola according 
to the survey results released wednesday 
twentythree of the top 50 brands in the global survey are from 
the united states 17 are european nine are japanese and one is 
from a company based in the united states and europe 
cocacola had led a similar landor survey conducted in late 1988 
cocacola also was rated the most powerful brand among us 
consumers and among european consumers when results for those 
groups were compiled separately sony was rated as the most 
powerful among japanese consumers 
don casey president of landor associates said the results 
demonstrated the importance of establishing an identity and 
sticking with it over the years 
the guys who have paid their dues and have a consistent image 
have done quite well he said 
casey said the results also indicate a contrast between 
realistic american tastes and the high aspirations of nonamerican 
consumers 
on the us list cocacola was followed by campbells disney 
pepsicola kodak nbc black amp decker kelloggs mcdonalds and 
hersheys 
the top 10 lists for european and japanese consumers included

a judge has cleared the way for a public 
hearing in the governments savings and loan case against neil 
bush and bushs attorney says the swords are drawn 
an administrative law judge has denied bushs request to dismiss 
the regulators case against him for alleged conflict of interest 
in his role as a former director of a collapsed colorado thrift 
judge daniel j davidson rejected bushs petition in an order 
issued tuesday the office of thrift supervision which is seeking 
to bar the presidents son from working for any bank or savings and 
loan made davidsons decision public late wednesday 
bush 35 was an outside director of silverado banking savings 
and loan association a denver thrift that failed in late 1988 at a 
cost to taxpayers estimated at 1 billion 
in written arguments submitted to davidson late last month bush 
said there was no possibility that he could continue the alleged 
abuses since silverado already has been taken over by the 
government bush continued to deny any wrongdoing 
the judge in a onepage order rejected bushs argument saying 
it was not supported by existing regulations or case law 
the next step is to go to the hearing bushs attorney 
james nesland said wednesday from his denver office the swords 
are drawn 
davidsons decision clears the way for a public hearing that had 
previously been scheduled before the judge starting sept 25 in 
denver sometime after the hearing the judge is expected to make a 
recommendation to the director of the office of thrift supervision 
timothy ryan 
in its response to bushs request the thrift agency had told 
davidson in a brief filed monday that bush could become a director 
at another financial institution and repeat the conduct that harmed 
silverado 
indeed throughout these proceedings bush has evidenced no 
willingness to consider that he has done anything wrong nor even 
any understanding that he ever had potential conflicts of 
interest the agencys brief said 
the office of thrift supervision said it was clear that bushs 
conduct was contrary to generally accepted standards of prudent 
operation and could cause harm to any financial institution if 
continued 
the regulators have accused bush of conflict of interest for not 
disclosing his business ties to two big silverado borrowers 
developers kenneth m good and bill l walters 
bush also could be a target of a negligence lawsuit that the 
federal deposit insurance corp is considering filing against him 
and other former silverado directors 
bush and nesland have maintained that the regulators actions 
are politically motivated

ecolab inc and the west german chemical 
company henkel kgaa plan to merge their european sanitizing and 
cleaning businesses the two companies said 
under the joint venture announced wednesday henkel would gain a 
19 percent stake in st paulbased ecolab a 13 billion service 
company and owner of chemlawn ecolab would acquire henkels 
cleaning businesses in 18 countries outside europe 
the agreement would eventually give henkel the ability to own up 
to 30 percent of ecolab 
the alliance allows ecolab to position itself for stronger 
international growth as the european community moves toward a 
single market in 1992 
ecolab chairman pierson grieve said a major motivation for the 
deal was to prepare the company for the economic unification of 
western europe 
in the cleaning and sanitation industry there are three 
companies larger than us in europe and the chances of us 
catching any of them were very small it would have required a lot 
of years and money he said the combination with henkel means 
that the joint venture will have the largest european market share 
in three of the joint ventures four product segments and the 
secondlargest share in the remaining segment he said 
what weve done is to strategically position ecolab so that 
over time in the 1990s well have shifted a lot of our marketing 
power technical ability and investment into the rest of the 
world he said 
the announcement got generally favorable reviews from securities 
analysts and the stock market 
frank rolfes an analyst with dain bosworth of minneapolis said 
the deal appears to be a good one for ecolab it will dilute 
ecolabs control and ownership but i think that the strong 
competitive position theyre acquiring will outweigh that he 
said 
in december ecolab issued 110 million of convertible preferred 
stock to henkel as an initial step in the deal the agreement 
includes the combination of the european cleaning businesses of 
both companies in a joint venture with each partner having a 50 
percent interest henkel will serve as managing partner and 
headquarters will be in dusseldorf the companies said 
in connection with the sale of noneuropean cleaning businesses 
to ecolab henkel will receive about 74 million and 56 million 
shares of ecolabs common stock henkel will receive an additional 
110 million reflecting its investment in the ecolab convertible 
preferred stock which will be retired when the deal closes the 
two companies said 
henkel will be represented on ecolabs board of directors 
the primary change will occur in europe with the creation of 
henkelecolab owned jointly by both partners initially this 
business will have approximately 750 million in revenues and about 
3500 workers the companies said 
ecolabs purchase of most of henkels remaining worldwide 
cleaning and sanitizing operations will initially increase ecolabs 
revenues by over 50 million in asia and latin america grieve 
said he said the deal should not dilute ecolabs 1991 per share 
earnings 
for the year ended dec 31 ecolab reported sales of 13 
billion and earnings of 27 million or 10 cents a share 
henkel had 1989 sales of 62 billion and net earnings of 2172 
million 
regulatory approvals are required in various jurisdictions the 
deal is expected to be completed at the beginning of 1991

families of seven people killed with 
cyanidecontaminated tylenol capsules eight years ago have won the 
right to go to trial to seek damages against the manufacturer of 
the pain remedy 
circuit judge donald p oconnell on wednesday rejected mcneil 
consumer products incs motion to dismiss the case for lack of 
sufficient evidence oconnell set trial for oct 19 but company 
lawyers said they will seek a continuance 
seven people died after taking capsules of extrastrength 
tylenol in 1982 and investigators concluded that someone poisoned 
the capsules after they left the factory no one has been charged 
with the killings 
even though the cyanide was put in the capsules after they left 
the companys control mcneil was negligent in not providing 
tamperresistant packaging said bruce r pfaff a lawyer for 
families of two of the victims 
in the three or four years preceding the poisonings the 
company received over 200 complaints of individuals writing that 
something was wrong with their tylenol pfaff said either 
capsules were missing or some other medication was mixed in or 
there were foreign objects pieces of metal and even fingernails 
pfaff said company investigations showed most or all of these 
complaints were traced to tampering after the medicine left the 
manufacturer 
he said the issue of tampering was a common subject in trade 
journals of the packaging industry for 10 years or more before the 
tylenol incident 
the plaintiffs attorneys will try to convince the jury that 
mcneil was negligent not merely in its packaging but also in its 
decision to sell the remedy in capsule form which is more subject 
to tampering that a tablet 
methods to deter tampering were well known and economically 
feasible pfaff said he said when the company redesigned its 
packaging after the poisonings it cost 2 cents a package to cure 
this problem 
in accordance with illinois law the civil action against mcneil 
specifies no amount being sought other than in excess of 
15000 
obviously the losses are far far greater than that said 
pfaff

competitive 
the stratfordbased company the helicopter division of united 
technologies corp will have a workforce of 11300 after the 
layoffs tuttle said 
the employees facing lay offs were informed wednesday of the 
companys decision he said 
in addition to stratford sikorsky has operations in bridgeport 
west haven shelton and trumbull as well as troy ala and west 
palm beach fla tuttle said most of the layoffs will come from 
sikorskys connecticut operations but he did not provide further

the united auto workers union whose influence in 
american labor shrank in the 1980s can pick and choose from a 
variety of options as bargaining with general motors corp enters 
its last days 
depending on the strategy chosen the uaw could have a dramatic 
effect on the already sagging us economy 
in a nutshell the union has three choices reach agreement 
before the current contract expires at midnight friday extend the 
current agreement beyond then or stage some kind of strike 
but such a decision may be moot if indications wednesday prove 
true 
union officials in detroit and elsewhere said there were 
indications that the union was moving toward a settlement before 
the midnight friday expiration of the national uawgm contact 
national uaw officials called local leaders to suburban detroit 
on monday amid speculation that national contract talks were 
heading toward a settlement rather than a strike but they 
cautioned that progress could be derailed at any time 
with a strike fund of about 770 million the union has the 
fiscal flexibility to take a large number of the gm workers out of 
the companys plants for a long time 
but the union may feel that a strike is unnecessary to 
demonstrate its dissatisfaction with gm 
ironically the companys moneysavings moves since the 
mid1980s have given the union the means to drive home its points 
with gm 
because of a move to a justintime parts delivery system 
for its assembly plants the union has regained some of the clout 
in garnered in the 1970s from its size 15 million members 
mostly in the auto industry 
gms reliance like other automakers on the justintime 
system which delivers parts to its assembly plants frequently a 
few hours before they are installed cuts warehousing and inventory 
costs but leaves the automaker vulnerable to labor problems 
the uaw demonstrated that last month when it staged a walkout 
involving about 2800 workers at gms ac rochester west plant in 
flint where fuel tanks and other parts of gm cars and trucks are 
made 
when the supply of fuel tanks stopped so did assembly plants 
the strike was seen as a signal of what the union could do to 
the automaker if national talks broke down 
by the time the sixday strike was over seven assembly plants 
and portions of more than a dozen component factories had been shut 
down temporarily idling more than 20000 workers 
whenever an assembly plant shuts down layoffs ripple out 
depending on how long production at an assembly plant is 
interrupted effects can be felt throughout the auto supplier 
industry including plastic glass rubber and steel makers 
labor negotiations in the auto industry come as the economy is 
slowing down and predictions of a recession are growing 
the government recently reported that unemployment in august 
reached 56 percent the highest level in two years annual growth 
of the gross national product has dropped to 12 percent and many 
analysts project it to fall further and orders for durable goods 
including cars have been flat 
in 1970 an alreadyweak economy slipped into recession when the 
uaw struck gm for 69 days said donald ratajczak of the economic 
forecasting center at georgia state university in atlanta at that 
time he said gm played a much larger part in the us economy 
than it does now 
therefore it gm by itself isnt going to take down the 
economy ratajczak said wednesday although its a negative 
were being hit by negatives all over the place 
he said auto negotiations this year come at a bad time when 
consumer psychology is hurting anyway you start to run up the 
unemployment rate from a strike and youll kill christmas

corroon amp black corps plans to merge with 
fellow insurance broker willis faber plc of britain were thrown 
into question by a higher cash offer from another insurer aon corp 
aon the holding company for the brokerage rollins burdick 
hunter group inc said wednesday it would pay 40 a share or 
about 840 million for corroon amp black 
that tops the stockswap merger agreement between corroon amp 
black and willis faber valued at more than 750 million 
in a terse statement wednesday responding to the offer corroon 
amp black noted its prior agreement with willis faber and said it 
would respond to aon after its board had time to study the bid 
willis faber said today it remained committed to its agreement 
with corroon amp black 
aon indicated it would not launch a hostile bid for corroon amp 
black should its target spurn the offer 
we are not interested in pursuing any transaction which is 
opposed by your board of directors aon chairman patrick g ryan 
said in a letter to corroon amp black chairman richard h miller 
in his letter ryan said that under terms of the willis faber 
merger corroon amp black can negotiate with and provide information 
to any third party which proposes a transaction with the board of 
corroon 
he also said corroon amp black was free to end its merger deal 
with willis faber in favor of a higher offer 
corroon amp black shareholders were scheduled to vote on the 
merger with willis faber on sept 28 the stockswap merger would 
give the shareholders 78 willis faber shares for each corroon amp 
black share or 3349 at current market prices in a deal valued 
at 754 million 
corroon amp black and willis faber are the worlds fifth and 
sixthlargest insurance brokerages respectively 
ira h malis an insurance industry analyst with alex brown amp 
sons inc in baltimore said that while aon had a higher bid on the 
table strategically the deal with willis faber makes more 
sense 
willis faber was a wholesale insurance broker while corroon amp 
black worked on a retail level malis said there was more overlap 
and likely to be layoffs in a marriage between aon and corroon amp 
black he said 
james guenther an analyst with duff amp phelps said he expected 
corroon amp black management to stick with the willis faber deal but 
he added that despite the deals merits the company will find it 
rather difficult to ignore this fairly significant premium 
investors bid up corroon amp black stock wednesday hoping the 
company might accept the offer corroon amp black shares shot up 
675 to close at 3762 in new york stock exchange trading 
aon shares declined a common response by investors to a 
company that has raised the possibility of taking on a heavy debt 
load to finance an aquisition 150 to 33 on the nyse 
willis faber stock which is traded on londons stock exchange 
was not affected by the announcement of the aon bid which came 
after the close of trading in britain the stock did not trade 
early today in london 
the corroon amp blackwillis faber merger announced in early 
june would allow both firms to expand in the others home market 
and eventually move into continental europe and the pacific rim 
the new firm britainbased willis corroon plc was expected to 
have 1990 revenue of about 1 billion it would create the worlds 
fourthlargest insurance brokerage in terms of revenue 
corroon amp black also provides risk management advice 
reinsurance brokerage and other services willis faber handles 
insurance and reinsurance brokerage as well as risk management 
services 
corroon amp black has nearly all its business in the united 
states while willis faber gets about 80 percent of its revenue 
from britain corroon amp black sold its 299 percent interest in the 
british broker minet holdings plc in february 1988 
aon has operations in the united states canada europe and the 
pacific besides rollins burdick its subsidiaries include combined 
insurance co of america and union fidelity life insurance co 
malis said a combination between corroon amp black and aon would 
create the thirdlargest insurance company in the nation and the 
fourth or fifth largest in the world 
aon likely would have difficulty pursuing a hostile takeover 
because of laws in delaware where corroon amp black is incorporated 
have created obstacles to thwart many unwanted bids

inflation sparked by higher oil prices resulting 
from the gulf crisis is threatening japans longterm economic 
expansion japans central bank governor said thursday 
but a quarterly survey showed most businessmen believe the 
economy is resilient enough to weather the crisis without a major 
setback 
rising price pressures and the new factor of current high oil 
prices require extreme caution bank of japan governor yasushi 
mieno told a convention of securities dealers the price 
environment is severe 
mieno and other officials addressing the convention noted that 
the gulf crisis had hit financial markets hard as investors reacted 
with concern over higher oil prices 
the tokyo stock exchange had stabilized during the summer after 
losing about onequarter of its value during a prolonged correction 
this spring but the gulf crisis further eroded the value of its 
key index 
on aug 23 the nikkei stock average hit 2373763 points 39 
percent below its record 3891587point close on dec 28 1989 
since then it has edged up in a series of volatile trading 
sessions on thursday the nikkei fell 14106 points to 2507508 
although the market has lost about 200 trillion yen or 145 
trillion of its value since december personal spending and 
corporate investment remain robust mieno said 
the bank of japans latest quarterly survey of business 
sentiment released earlier this week indicates that most 
executives remain fairly bullish about the economy despite the gulf 
crisis he noted 
the central banks business condition index edged down only 
slightly to 46 in august from 48 in may the index is the 
percentage of the 691 companies surveyed that report favorable 
business conditions minus those who report they are unfavorable 
japan is in its 46th straight month of economic expansion the 
central bank however has raised interest rates five times since 
may 1989 to help curb inflationary pressures generated by growth in 
the money supply and a labor shortage 
the latest hike on aug 30 raised the official discount rate 
by 075 percentage point to 6 percent

its crunch time in new yorks newspaper wars 
and thousands of jobs and some long journalistic traditions hang in 
the balance 
the economy combined with the competition is threatening two 
of the citys tabloids 
the noholdsbarred new york post which has suffered losses for 
years says that the hemorrhaging must end and that it will shut 
down with saturdays edition unless its unions agree to more than 
19 million in concessions 
at the moneylosing daily news monthslong labor negotiations 
appear stalemated management has made extensive preparations for a 
strike the unions continue working but are urging advertisers to 
boycott the paper 
there is an adequate market here for at least one tabloid 
paper possibly two said ken noble a media analyst with paine 
webber 
which would be fine for the two newspapers if new york newsday 
a third tabloid also losing money did not have a profitable 
parent the times mirror co patiently waiting for the market to 
sort itself out 
the citys fourth major daily the new york times is 
profitable though less so than a year ago 
the times also will seek concessions from the unions to the 
extent that they involve the same economic conditions that have 
affected the post and news said william adler a times spokesman 
all four newspapers are suffering from an unofficial recession 
slamming the northeast that has retail advertising down 
the post founded in 1801 by alexander hamilton has the worst 
economic problems three owners in the past two decades have lost 
millions of dollars now its already slim ad linage is down 
theyre the most likely to go out of business noble said 
on sept 4 post publisher peter s kalikow told the papers 
unions that he was losing 27 million a year on the tabloid and 
that he needed concessions from them of 174 million in payroll 
and 19 million in benefits 
he set an 8 pm friday deadline for an agreement otherwise he 
said the paper would report in its saturday editions that it was 
closing and 960 employees would be out of work 
he did not want to read about the future of the new york post 
in another newspaper said howard rubenstein a post spokesman 
with headlines like read my lips i lied and up yours 
to saddam hussein and its alltime classic about a tavern killing 
headless body in topless bar the post strikes a chord that 
summons readers to newsstands but its circulation is now about 
505000 down from 900000 in the past decade 
the new york post has been very honest in coming to us with 
this economic problem said george mcdonald president of the 
allied printing trades council an umbrella group representing nine 
unions at the post were going to do everything possible to help 
the post stay in business 
the news too is claiming losses 115 million from 1979 to 1989 
on revenues of 4 billion but also is trying to undo what it says 
are archaic work rules that result in overstaffing on the presses 
and among drivers 
in the last decade its circulation has dropped about 700000 to 
1180000 
the news has said it needs new color presses to replace its 
30to 40yearold equipment and stay competitive while the unions 
which represent about 3000 workers recognize the need for new 
presses they claim the news parent the tribune co of chicago 
is out to break them in order to sell the paper 
daily news unions point to the hiring of king and ballow a 
nashville tenn law firm they say has a reputation for 
unionbusting the hiring of replacement workers and the training 
of management to run the presses if workers strike 
management at the news has already told the unions that it 
expects concessions equal to anything granted the post to put on 
the pressure the unions are urging advertisers to boycott the news 
until a settlement is reached 
its a fight to the death over at the new york news right 
now said noble 
new york newsday meanwhile has trucks ready to roll if the 
news folds or goes on strike or if the post expires he said 
newsday with its circulation of 225000 would leap into the 
breach they sure would noble said

hamilton oil co and four partners plan to tap a 
giant natural gas reserve off the coast of scotland in a 285 
billion deal that could create the largest gas project in the 
british north sea 
the united kingdom department of energy agreed wednesday to 
allow denverbased hamilton and its partners to drill a series of 
wells in the bruce field 240 miles northeast of aberdeen scotland 
the bruce field is considered attractive because it also 
contains oil reserves that are expected to yield 80000 barrels of 
crude a day when production reaches its peak 
the field was discovered more than 10 years ago but the 
hamilton group only recently reached marketing agreements to sell 
the gas to two british power companies british gas and corby power 
ltd 
hamilton officials hope to start drawing gas in october 1993 
they said that when production reaches its peak in 1994 the field 
should produce 520 million cubic feet of gas a day making it the 
largest such project in the region 
hamilton an independent oil company will pay about 450 
million of the development costs and take a 16 percent stake in the 
project its partners include the french petrochemical companies 
elfaquitaine and total compagnie francaise des petroles as well 
as british petroleum and londonbased ultramer exploration ltd 
hamilton began drilling in the north sea with projects dating to 
1975 and the company has been stepping up its exploration in the 
area in recent years

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
today the fund that protects bank depositors will likely remain 
under stress for some time to come but he cautioned congress 
against hastily passing legislation that would only make the 
situation worse 
greenspan noted that the reserves in the federal deposit 
insurance fund now stand at their lowest level ever as a string of 
nearrecord bank failures has depleted fdic reserves 
there remain all too many problems in the banking system 
problems that have been growing of late as many banks including 
many larger banks have been experiencing a deterioration in the 
quality of their loan portfolios particularly real estate loans 
greenspan told a house committee 
it thus seems clear that the insurance fund likely will remain 
under stress for some time to come greenspan said moreover 
pressures would intensify if real estate market conditions were to 
weaken further or a recession were to develop in the general 
economy 
greenspans warning was similar although less specific than 
reports earlier this week from the congressional general accounting 
office and the congressional budget office 
both agencies warned that one large bank failure or a further 
downturn in the economy could wipe out the remaining 132 billion 
in the fdic insurance fund and force taxpayers to provide a bailout 
it was the depletion of a separate insurance fund for deposits 
in the savings and loan industry that prompted legislation last 
year that is expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of 
dollars over the next 30 years 
members of congress alarmed by the reports that the fdic fund 
is also in trouble have rushed to introduce legislation to boost 
its resources and thus avert a similar bailout for the bank fund 
greenspan cautioned that while reform is needed so is 
caution 
he spoke against proposals to reduce the insurance limit from 
100000 and said it would be difficult to administer a law which 
limited the number of deposits each individual could have 
he also said lawmakers should not be too aggressive in boosting 
the premiums banks must pay for deposit insurance and run the risk 
of making the industry uncompetitive 
greenspans testimony before the house banking committee 
followed two days of hearings this week by the senate banking 
committee on the state of the deposit insurance fund 
comptroller charles a bowsher of the general accounting office 
said tuesday that the fdic fund currently with 132 billion in 
resources is dwindling so rapidly that it could be wiped out by a 
recession or a single big bank failure taxpayers would be forced 
to cover the costs 
bowshers dire warning was followed by testimony wednesday in 
which the congressional budget office predicted that even without a 
recession some 600 to 700 commercial banks will likely fail over 
the next 3 years draining 20 billion out of the fdic insurance 
fund 
both reports heightened fears in congress that banks just like 
savings and loan associations could require a multibilliondollar 
taxpayer bailout unless something is done 
responding to the reports lawmakers introduced bills to uncap 
the deposit insurance premiums and treasury secretary nicholas 
brady indicated that the bush administration would soon offer its 
own proposal to raise premiums 
the fdic now charges banks 12 cents a year for every 100 the 
agency insures under the sampl bailout law passed last year the 
premiums will automatically rise next january to 15 cents per 100 
of insurance the fdic has proposed raising the assessment to 195 
cents 
but even with the larger increase the gao said insurance funds 
would still have insufficient reserves to cover possible losses to 
bank depositors during a recession without an infusion of taxpayer 
dollars

there were indications today that a settlement 
may be near in united auto workers union negotiations with general 
motors corp but both sides are quick to say that things could 
unravel 
the two sides are working against the midnight friday expiration 
of a labor contract covering 300000 active gm workers the 
deadline is the same for contracts between the uaw and ford motor 
co and chrysler corp 
in all more than 450000 active unionized workers are covered 
by the three agreements 
the uaw has scheduled a meeting of its gm bargaining council for 
a suburban detroit hotel on monday uaw local leaders and a 
national union source said it was likely the meeting was called to 
discuss tentative contract provisions 
however there still were two full days of bargaining left in 
the life of the current agreement and the talks could sour during 
that time they said 
this morning a uaw official who didnt want to be identified 
said progress was being made but unresolved issues included job 
security wages pensions and health care tentative agreements 
have been reached on a variety of matters including health and 
safety in factories and grievance procedures he said 
on wednesday uaw local leaders indicated the bargaining council 
meeting was an indication of progress in the talks 
why would they call the meeting and why would they want us in 
detroit on monday why would they want us in detroit if nothings 
settled asked joe garcia secretarytreasurer of uaw local 645 
at gms van nuys calif car assembly plant 
he said the meeting was set for the hyatt regency hotel in 
dearborn a hotel worker who did not identify himself confirmed 
that the uaw had reserved rooms for a large meeting 
a national uaw official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said wednesday that while such a meeting could be called to discuss 
a strike it was more likely that it would be used to describe 
details of a tentative contract 
topranking uaw and gm executives met wednesday morning to 
discuss outstanding contract issues said another uaw official who 
requested anonymity he declined to say what the issues were but 
it was nearly certain that one of them was job security the 
unions pet issue in this set of talks 
a gm statement said only that chairman robert stempel and labor 
vice president alfred warren met with uaw president owen bieber and 
vice president stephen yokich who is leading the unions 
bargaining effort with gm 
before the union puts any tentative settlement up for a 
ratification vote by its membership leaders typically brief local 
union presidents and bargaining committee chair people those 
officials make up bargaining councils of the unions gm ford and 
chrysler departments 
david fenwick president of uaw local 933 in indianapolis also 
said wednesday he had been called to the monday meeting of the gm 
bargaining council 
i dont see why they would schedule it the meeting for us on 
the 17th if we were going out fenwick said i would say they 
must be very close they must be calling us up there to inform us 
of contract terms 
earlier wednesday one of the uaw officials said talks were 
percolating after bogging down monday principally over job 
security 
things are moving the official said 
at gm negotiators have been focusing on economic issues in the 
final days of talks uaw officials have said tentative agreements

rhonepoulenc rorer inc a newly formed 
frenchamerican company plans to lay off 400 workers in france 
through a combination of early retirement and payroll cutbacks a 
union said thursday 
the company declined to comment but noted that its governing 
board meets friday in paris it plans a news conference next week 
the confederation francaise democratique du travail said the 
company created in july through the merger of rhonepoulencs 
human health division and rorer group inc of pennsylvania planned 
cuts at a variety of sites these included plants in hautsdeseine 
and seinemaritime as well as six factories of the propharm sa 
unit 
the union said two research centers would lose a total of 180 
employees as part of a plan to transfer research programs to the 
united states 
rhonepoulenc has been divesting nonessential assets in an 
attempt to offset the 2 billion cost of acquiring rorer most 
recently the group sold its spanish polyvinyl chloride business to 
societe nationale elf aquitaine while a group of french banks 
bought rhonepoulencs headquarters 
chairman jeanrene fourtou told a news conference that asset 
sales for all of 1990 could give the chemicals and pharmaceuticals 
group up to 15 billion francs or 282 million in fresh cash 
french stock analysts have questioned the timing of the rorer 
purchase suggesting that a slowing us economy will affect 
anticipated earnings the company also received a blow in august 
from us regulators who ruled that a planned venture with procter 
amp gamble co to distribute its overthecounter pharmaceutical 
products in the us market violated antitrust regulations

white house and congressional budget 
bargainers are considering new taxes on cigarettes and petroleum 
products as participants say they sense an approaching deal despite 
daunting remaining obstacles 
negotiators began a seventh consecutive day of talks late this 
morning cloistered at andrews air force base just outside the 
capital city in maryland 
they had worked until shortly after midnight as bargainers tried 
to close in on a package of tax increases and spending cuts saving 
50 billion in the fiscal year starting oct 1 and 500 billion by 
1995 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said today he remained 
optimistic about the talks even though thorny disputes remain over 
taxes and spending 
theres no single issue thats holding it up foley told 
reporters there are a lot of tough issues theyre all 
difficult 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
suggested that progress toward a budget breakthrough was hard to 
assess at this time everybody wants to keep the pressure on 
were still hopeful fitzwater said 
on wednesday the negotiators tackled the question of whose 
taxes will be increased they already have agreed to raise taxes 
and federal fees by 25 billion next year and 130 billion over the 
next five years 
participants said they discussed boosting the 16centsperpack 
cigarette tax perhaps doubling it which would raise 28 billion 
next year they continued their efforts to agree to higher taxes on 
alcoholic beverages an idea both sides have suggested 
in response anheuserbusch the nations largest brewer of malt 
beverages has been running can the beer tax advertisements 
walker merryman vice president of the tobacco institute said 
cigarette manufacturers have chosen a lowerprofile effort against 
any increase contending that a rise in tobacco taxes would hurt 
the poor disproportionately and cause job layoffs 
white house budget chief richard darman suggested slapping a 1 
percent tax on all petroleumcontaining products except livestock 
feed one official said a proposal that would cover items ranging 
from gasoline to cosmetics it would reap the government 800 
million next year and 7 billion over five years 
he also proposed a lowercost version of a tax on luxury items 
the democrats have advanced goods subject to the levy under both 
proposals include expensive cars private planes and boats 
jewelry furs and electronic equipment 
but one of the thorniest remaining hurdles is also a tax 
proposal president bushs proposal to lower the capital gains tax 
rate the levy is charged when property and other investments are 
sold at a profit republicans say a cut would stimulate more sales 
and thus bring in more tax revenue 
but democrats complaining that the idea would merely fatten the 
wallets of the rich say they wont accept it without a proposal of 
their own a boost in income taxes on the wealthy republicans 
reject that idea 
the parties also remain at odds over spending totals for 
domestic programs gop negotiators want domestic programs ranging 
from benefit programs like medicare to general government efforts 
like roadbuilding to be slashed by 130 billion over the next 
five years democrats want to hold the reduction to 90 billion 
we had to get to the tough questions and now were there 
said rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee 
one further complication was added when new yorks 34 members of 
the house signed a letter promising to vote against any deal that 
limits the deductibility on federal income taxes of state and local 
income taxes 
officials from states with high income taxes like new york 
fear that the idea under consideration by the bargainers would 
make it harder for states to raise taxes in the future 
it would kill new york said rep charles schumer dny 
who circulated the letter it would cause the exodus of many 
many people 
the negotiators have discussed boosting medicare premiums for 
betteroff recipients they also are nearing agreement on a deal to 
limit next years military budget to about 295 billion 11 
billion below the amount needed to keep up with inflation 
officials believe that the deficit will likely exceed 250 
billion a record in the upcoming fiscal year unless something 
is done without a budget agreement by oct 1 the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law will shrink the 12 trillion budget by 100 
billion an amount that would disrupt most federal programs

the bush administration unveiled a revised 
program today to ease the shortfall in oil but energy secretary 
james watkins said worldwide shortages could linger at near 1 
million barrels a day through the winter 
watkins said he believed the shortfall can be managed 
through conservation efforts and additional domestic production 
he left open the possibility of drawing oil from the strategic 
petroleum reserve in the coming months if conservation and 
increased production efforts fall short of expectations but he 
reiterated it was too soon to use the reserve which holds nearly 
600 million barrels 
thats a cherished reserve that has a finite life and we 
dont want to use it too early watkins told the senate energy 
and natural resource committee he said he was comfortable that 
the department would be ready to take oil from the reserve in short 
notice if needed 
the department outlined a revised combined program of energy 
conservation and oil production measures that officials said was 
aimed at cutting the oil supply shortfall in the united states by 
about 11 million barrels a day 
the new program including a radio advertising campaign urging 
conservation came amid increasing criticism that the 
administrations efforts to ease the countrys reliance on foreign 
oil have been more rhetoric than substance 
the president should give more than a speech he should give 
us a program sen paul simon dill said wednesday in response 
to bushs call for increased energy conservation in light of the 
persian gulf crisis 
watkins rejected such criticsm saying the administrations 
efforts to increase production and get americans to conserve oil 
are substantive we do not think they are trivial 
much of the departments program announced today mirrored the 
response plan announced shortly after the mideast crisis developed 
including calls on motorists to conserve fuel by properly inflating 
tires and various measures to expand production from existing 
domestic oil fields 
but watkins said as much as 165000 barrels of day also could be 
saved by fuel switching and urged that regulatory and other 
barriers be eased to promote switching he said there are 37 
natural gas pipeline proposals awaiting federal or state approval 
the plan also included tax incentives for oil and gas 
production expanded production from alaska and opening the arctic 
national wildlife refuge for oil exploration all proposals 
announced previously 
watkins said current crude oil stocks were well above levels at 
the same time last year but he said there was a 36 million barrel 
worldwide production shortfall in september and that the shortfall 
was expected to be gradually reduced to about 1 million by next 
january and slightly lower in the succeeding months 
the united nations economic embargo imposed on iraq slashed 
available production from iraq and occupied kuwait by 4 million 
barrels a day 
addressing a joint session of congress on the middle east crisis 
tuesday night bush asked lawmakers to enact measures to increase 
domestic oil and gas production and said conservation is 
essential to keep our energy needs as low as possible 
but environmentalists and some members of congress say the 
administration has been slow in developing an energy plan and is 
giving only scant emphasis to energy conservation while 
emphasizing expanded drilling possibly in environmentally 
sensitive areas 
never once did he mention renewable energy sen tom harkin 
diowa said of bushs speech 
but since returning from their august recess members of 
congress also have been short on specific proposals the exception 
has been house and senate legislation calling for dramatic 
increases in automobile fuel economy 
legislation sponsored by sen richard bryan dnev would 
require automakers to improve the average fuel economy of new cars 
to 40 miles per gallon by 2001 
on wednesday bryan and other sponsors said the measure would 
cut the demand for petroleum by 28 million barrels a day by the 
turn of the century but the white house has opposed the measure 
and a recently circulated policy memo suggested that the president 
likely would veto it

financing difficulties brought on by debt have 
delivered a blow to john c portmans reputation but the atlanta 
architectdevelopers lieutenants say obituaries are premature 
despite the recent series of emergency meetings with creditors 
over portmans unsecured loans officials of the portman cos 
maintain their operation is strong and its ventures are moving full 
steam ahead 
weve been in business 30 years and will be in business 30 
more the financing on our major projects is firmly in place there 
is no threat to the concrete and steel buildings of the portman 
companies executive vice president sam williams said wednesday 
following the latest session with creditors 
williams said the focus of the meetings is to create a pool of 
collateral to back the companys unsecured loans those that are 
not supported by assets or other collateral he said he expected an 
agreement to be reached within two weeks 
williams said portman has no intention of backing out of any of 
his current projects though some notably a 60story office tower 
in downtown atlanta are going up under less than ideal 
circumstances 
the atlanta venture to be called one peachtree center and 
designed as the tallest skyscraper in the south has been launched 
amid a period of rising vacancy rates in the citys office 
buildings 
williams argued that the severity of the downtown office vacancy 
situation has been inflated because most calculations have factored 
in two other skyscraper projects that have since been abandoned 
another major atlanta office building 191 peachtree tower is 
under construction now and nearing completion williams contends 
that the portman project currently in its early stages of 
construction will be in a prime position as the newest kid on the 
block when it opens in 1991 
in essence we now have the market position of the only new 
office tower in downtown atlanta with space available williams 
said real estate like any other business goes in cycles 
whos to say what cycle we will be in in the third quarter of 1995 
our crystal ball is not that good but weve been through real 
estate storms before 
portman who declined to be interviewed for this article has 
been on the defensive before though rarely for his business 
acumen 
his architectural style marked by streamlined exteriors and 
expansive indoor atriums have tended to be popular among the 
masses but maligned by critics who accused portman of building 
urban fortresses 
portman has steadfastly defended his modernist architecture as 
for people and not things 
after building his peachtree center cluster of office towers 
hotels and trade marts in downtown atlanta portman went on to 
major projects in cities including new york san francisco and 
singapore 
as the real estate market began to slump over the last three 
years however portman borrowed heavily and refinanced existing 
projects to launch new ventures 
among his new developments are the 300 million one peachtree 
center the 155 million inforum technology mart which opened last 
year in atlanta the 90 million san francisco fashion center 
which opened during the summer and the 195 million shanghai 
center an officehotelretail complex opening next month in china 
portmans operation is private and does not release financial 
data though his current debt load has been reported to be more 
than 16 billion 
he has been sued recently by dg bank deutsche 
genossenschaftsbank for allegedly failing to make a 3 million loan 
repayment and on sept 1 he stopped making payments to one of his 
main creditors equitable life assurances society of the united 
states on a 3326 million mortgage for his flagship peachtree 
center complex in atlanta 
williams said the companys problems are only with unsecured 
creditors who hold about 5 percent of the companys loans a 
spokesman for equitable this week declined to comment on the talks 
with portman though two other creditors citibank and swiss bank 
corp said positive progress was made at the latest meeting 
the 65yearold portman has made some bold architectural and 
business decisions during his career but publicly has maintained a 
reticent image he makes few public appearances except to announce 
new developments 
yet the talks with creditors have made him a reluctant front 
page item over the last month it is a position say some who are 
close to portman that the businessman doesnt like 
insurance executive jesse hill jr a friend of portman charged 
that much of the media coverage has been based on speculation and 
has weakened portmans position in negotiating with the bankers 
the man is obviously restructuring his finances said hill 
president of atlanta life insurance co hes in negotiations and 
if somehow the press wouldnt give him this terrible beating he 
has the assets and under normal circumstances he could work it 
out 
hill said he was especially offended by those who have grouped 
portman with new york developer donald trump and other highflying 
1980s entrepreneurs whose debtfinanced empires have taken a dive 
in the new decade 
there is some constant effort to compare john portman to 
donald trump hill said trump is no john portman and portman 
is no trump 
portman is a horatio alger story he didnt have a rockefeller 
center he built one the man is in a class by himself 
b eugene griessman a professor in the college of management at 
portmans alma mater georgia tech profiled the 
architectdeveloper for a 1987 book on achievers he said it is 
portmans nature to brush aside such obstacles when he has his mind 
set on a project 
hes a risk taker his next project is always his favorite 
said griessman 
williams said portmans current problems stem from tightened 
banking regulations that have followed the real estate slump and 
the savings and loan crisis banks are requiring lenders to come up 
with stronger backing for loans he said 
almost every real estate company in america will have to deal 
with it he said

economically speaking this year will be 
remembered for its summer until that time business economists 
thought they were dealing with a somewhat dull understandable 
rather tragic but predictable year 
then as july ended and august began said david seiders of the 
national association of home builders all hell broke lose a 
rather unscientific description but it comes close to describing 
the sensation 
first off the commerce department went through three years of 
statistics on gross national product most basic of all economic 
indicators revised the numbers and revealed the economy really was 
weaker than believed 
for those who rely on such numbers as professional economists 
do the news was traumatic it was right after this that a slew of 
brand new forecasts emerged from wall street all mentioning the 
likelihood of recession 
then came the july employment report the first major indicator 
of economic activity for the third quarter it showed employment 
falling and the jobless rate rising particularly in manufacturing 
and construction very bad news 
then iraq invaded kuwait world energy prices leaped inflation 
fears rose billions of dollars of value disappeared from stocks 
and bonds congress was unable to reach a budget compromise the 
savings and loan crisis seemed to worsen each day and the banking 
situation was found to be almost as bad 
the latest blow was the revelation by charles bowsher 
comptroller general of the general accounting office that there 
might be insufficient cash in the bank insurance fund to pay 
depositors of banks expected to fail 
bowsher told congress already trying to figure out how to 
handle 130 billion in costs from bailing out savings and loan 
associations that 35 banks with 451 billion in assets would fold 
this year 
all this and of course additional billions of dollars to 
support the military interdiction in the mideast was presented 
within two months to a nation and its congress already at an 
impasse over budget deficits 
what happened this summer has changed every economic forecast of 
business and government and probably the spending plans of most 
american households while economic insecurity had been growing 
its pace has quickened 
household insecurity is greater after the sharp decline in 
securities the increase in energy prices the slowdown in housing 
and the deterioration of the job market 
the latter is in far worse condition than indicated by the 56 
percent jobless rate factory jobs fell by 45000 in august 
bringing to 455000 the number of such jobs lost since early last 
year construction employment in some areas is in a depression 
employment fell by 40000 in august 
now according to janet norwood commissioner of the bureau of 
labor statistics only health services and state and local 
government are sustaining a strong pace of job creation and that 
suggests higher taxes 
perhaps the most pronounced attitudinal change resulting from 
the negative news is a feeling that the economy mightnt be able to 
stumble through problems as it has done before horizons have 
shrunk it is difficult to look far ahead 
those who have experienced such periods recognize however that 
the picture can change remarkably fast gloom can fade and hope can 
bloom if for example mideast problems were resolved 
edward yardeni chief economist for prudentialbache securities 
agrees for example that the financial system is rotten but says 
its not rotten to the core and its not too late to fix it 
and stock market guru james dines wonders if stocks havent 
fallen so low that bargains might soon begin to appear he has just 
issued what he calls an interim warning bulletin entitled 
approaching an important buy signal 
but whether the economic news continues to worsen and the gloom 
to deepen or whether it takes a more positive turn nobody is 
likely to forget these past two months any more than they can 
forget being mugged

fiat groups iveco truck subsidiary has 
agreed to buy a 60 percent stake in the stateowned spanish truck 
maker empresa nacional de autocamiones sa also known as enasa it 
was announced thursday 
spains state holding company national institute of industry 
selected the italian companys offer over a bid from daimlerbenz 
ag of west germany 
fiats iveco agreed to pay 12 billion pesetas or about 12 
million in cash for the stake according to the national 
institutes president jordi mercader 
he said iveco also agreed to spend another 12 billion pesetas 
or 120 million on buying new enasa shares that will be offered in 
january 
iveco europes secondlargest truckmaker after daimler will 
have a sixyear option to purchase the remaining 40 percent of 
enasa shares that remain under the national institutes control he 
said 
mercader told spanish national radio that the state holding 
company had accepted fiats offer because it was superior to that 
made by daimler 
mercader did not elaborate on the latest daimler offer 
this decision strengthens enasa as it faces the tough times up 
the road ahead mercader told national radio 
a key part of the sale agreement includes iveco guarantees for 
all 5700 current jobs at the companys three plants and enasas 
topline heavy truck brand name pegaso 
attempts by national institute of industry officials to salvage 
an earlier proposed sale to daimlerbenz reportedly floundered on 
the giant german truckmakers insistence on more job cuts state 
subsidies and a plant closure 
in a statement released in new york fiat said it hoped to take 
steps to enable enasa to broaden its product range in both light 
and heavy vehicle markets and to become more competitive 
this transaction is a further step in the internationalization 
of fiat group after the recentlysigned agreements with ford 
visavis the farm equipment business and nippondenso for the joint 
production of car air conditioners and heaters cesare romiti 
president and chief executive of fiat group and chairman of iveco 
last november the spanish government chose a joint bid by 
daimlerbenz and man ag of west germany to buy an 80 percent stake 
in the spanish company 
in doing so it passed over other offers by fiats iveco 
anglodutch truckmaker daf nv and ab volvo of sweden 
but the daimlerman joint takeover collapsed last july the 
government subsequently sought to get daimler to take a majority 
stake alone or with another european partner or to entice fiat to 
come in 
enasa reported sales of more than 11000 light and heavy trucks 
last year and earned 240 million pesetas or 247 million it was 
the first time enasa had posted an annual profit in years 
but analysts said the confusion this year over enasas future 
owners and slowing demand for trucks has produced losses through 
the first six months of 6 billion pesetas or 60 million 
the industrial vehicles division of fiat preoduced 139300 
vehicles last year iveco had operating income of about 486 
million on revenue of 64 billion in 1989

grain and soybean futures prices fell across the 
board thursday on the chicago board of trade paced by a sharp drop 
in the corn market after the government raised its estimate of 1990 
corn production 
in a crop report released after wednesdays close the 
agriculture department estimated the 1990 us corn crop at 812 
billion bushels up 8 percent from last years harvest and 3 
percent more than the governments august forecast 
the projection exceeded most analysts expectations 
the government left its soybean crop estimate unchanged at 184 
billion bushels as expected which was initially considered 
neutral for soybean prices 
but some traders may have been unwilling to accept the usdas 
prediction for continued strong soymeal export demand and sold 
contracts despite the report said anne frick senior oilseed 
analyst with prudential bache securities inc in new york 
other analysts said soybeans rallied earlier this week in 
anticipation of the report leaving the market vulnerable to 
profittaking 
at the close wheat futures were 3 cents to 6 cents lowr with 
the contract for delivery in september at 260 a bushel corn was 
5 cents to 8 cents lower with september at 233 a bushel oats 
were 2 cents to 5 cents lower with september at 107 a bushel 
soybeans were cent to 7 cents lower with september at 623 a

eastman kodak co on thursday introduced 
a printing system that will let personal computer users hook up 
with highspeed printers previously reserved for mainframes 
the company billed the system called lionheart as the most 
dramatic advance in office productivity since the mouse industry 
analysts were less effusive in part because of the systems 
250000 price tag 
the system uses new software with an enhanced version of kodaks 
existing ektaprint 1392 printer which can print documents at 
speeds of up to 92 pages per minute standard desktop printers turn 
out about eight to 10 pages per minute 
users can also get sets of finished reports sorted stapled 
and holepunched by selecting options at their desktop computer 
instead of filling out requests at their companys central copy 
center 
charles l trowbridge general manager of kodaks copy products 
division said lionheart is the divisions first step in a 
transition to digital imaging in the office 
the system is targeted at companies that make or print 500000 
copies a month such as government agencies and big law firms 
officials said 
it doesnt sound like a really big deal to me said industry 
analyst peter enderlin of smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york how many places are going to want to spend 250000 a pop 
you have to have a heck of a lot of personal computers to make it 
worthwhile 
i dont know if i would go so far as to say its as big as the 
mouse said another analyst b alex henderson of 
prudentialbache securities inc the 1392 is a very good printer 
but certainly youre not going to see one on every desktop 
kodak plans to bring out other versions of lionheart and other 
digital products sometime in the next year trowbridge said 
he said the company hopes to introduce its next new product in 
early 1991 
introduction of the divisions new line has already been delayed 
several months enderlin said the latest expectation had been that 
the new products would be out in october or november 
michael j murray kodak vice president and general manager of 
marketing said the lionheart system is compatible with ethernet 
ibm token ring and appletalk networks and accepts electronic 
floppy disk input

chicago board of trade officials announced plans 
thursday to fight two lawsuits they say seek to interfere with the 
boards ability to protect the integrity of the market 
ferruzzi group an italian company accused last year of trying 
to corner the soybean futures market filed a lawsuit wednesday in 
us district court seeking to block a board of trade disciplinary 
hearing the lawsuit said that the board of trade has a financial 
stake in finding ferruzzi at fault 
ferruzzi also has filed a 30 million lawsuit seeking damages 
against the board of trade accusing it of manipulating the market 
and conspiring to force prices lower when it issued an order 
forcing ferruzzi to liquidate most of its soybean holdings 
the cbot will resist these lawsuits to the fullest extent of 
the law board of trade chairman william f oconnor said 
thursday in a release we will not permit them to interfere with 
our responsibility to protect the integrity of the market through 
our disciplinary process 
the board of trades business conduct committee has a hearing 
scheduled monday to consider allegations that ferruzzi tried to 
manipulate the market in july 1989 and committed other violations 
the board of trade issued an emergency order july 11 1989 
directing all holders of july soybean contracts to liquidate their 
positions down to 1 million bushels 
ferruzzi was the largest position holder in that market and 
also held a clear majority of the soybeans that were deliverable on 
that contract said mark prout a spokesman for the exchange 
a situation like the one prout described puts the squeeze on 
other contract holders 
thomas r donovan president of the exchange said the commodity 
futures trading commission and the general accounting office 
conducted separate investigations of the emergency action and both 
concluded that there were no conflicts of interest by the board of 
trade

imagine a certificate of deposit tied to the 
price of oil or a new kind of junk bond now imagine that you own 
the patent to such an innovation and everyone who wants to market 
it is beating a path to your door and forking over big bucks 
one washington law firm thinks patenting financial innovations 
may be the wave of the future in an era of financial uncertainty 
shrinking markets and global competition 
the firm sutherland asbill amp brennan has issued a memorandum 
to its clients suggesting patents could be the most promising 
means for obtaining exclusive rights to a type of financial product 
or service for a significant period of time 
but others in law and finance are skeptical noting that few 
such patents have been secured in the past they think the idea may 
be patent nonsense 
our legal people indicate that its very hard to patent or 
copyright financial products and probably it wouldnt be 
protected anyway so i really havent looked into it much more than 
that said american stock exchange chairman james r jones 
i see a lot of lawsuits proliferating from this added john 
damgard president of the futures industry association a 
washingtonbased trade association maybe theres a real reason 
for it but at the moment it hasnt been demonstrated to me 
i think its a novel twist but im not ready to say its a 
major revolution yet said jack coffee a securities law expert 
and professor at columbia universitys law school stressing that 
his field is not patent law coffee added this is the 
intersecton of securities law and patent law and im not sure 
either side understands the full dimensions of it 
several government agencies and congressional offices have 
expressed interest in reviewing the sutherland asbill memo 
although no hearings or studies are planned 
in his 26page note peter trzyna an associate at sutherland 
asbill summarized the tools available for protecting financial 
innovations copyrights patents and trademarks and concluded that 
all have strengths in certain circumstances but he said patents 
while expensive and difficult to obtain may be the most effective 
a patent is the exclusive right to exclude others from making 
using or selling a device for 17 years explained oscar mastin a 
spokesman for the us patent and trademark office which last year 
issued a record 102712 patents for all sorts of devices 
he could not say how many financial patents have been applied 
for in recent years because patent applications are confidential by 
law it takes about 18 months to obtain a patent after a review by 
one of the governments 1400 patent examiners 
the cost ranges from 6000 and 20000 for filing and legal 
fees sutherland asbills memo estimated 
patents have the potential for causing the greatest 
reverberations in the financial industry the memo stated 
competitors could well find themselves foreclosed from marketing 
a product or class of products for 17 years or perhaps could do so 
only by paying royalties under a license courts are not timid 
about damage awards 
but obtaining a patent isnt simple explained patent attorney 
thomas p dowling of the new york firm morgan amp finnegan 
you cant patent an idea you have to patent a tangible he 
said 
dowling said a particular financial product cant be patented 
only the mechanical system that operates it or makes it different 
from other products 
explained dowling lets say theres a certificate of deposit 
with a return thats indexed to the price of oil and somebody 
starts to market the cd with some trade name as a means for hedging 
against the inflationary effects of oil prices 
now if they come up with a novel and unobvious system for 
creating that particular instrument for maintaining it for 
providing access to the subscribers and all of the other back 
office operations involved they can get a patent on the system 
but he said that wont stop someone marketing a similar product 
through a different system 
lets say someone patents a tamperresistant automated teller 
machine that uses a magnetic encoded strip to recognize customers 
bank cards and someone else comes along with an atm that reads 
optical encoding such as a hologram the patentholder of the 
magneticstrip system cant stop the second guy from also 
providing atm services but using a different technique said 
dowling 
so far there have been few instances of financial service 
companies obtaining patents for new products 
one of the first was merrill lynch amp co which patented its 
cash management account cma in august 1982 and successfully 
defended it against painewebber inc 
we have negotiated license fee arrangements with several of 
our competitors said frank macioce assistant general counsel at 
merrill lynch he said dean witter reynolds inc agreed to pay a 1 
million fee while painewebber and shearson lehman brothers inc 
have agreements that keep the amount they pay confidential he said 
stephen b judlowe the outside counsel who assisted merrill 
lynch in patenting the cma said he has no explanation for why few 
other firms have patented their new products but he said i 
think youre going to see more of it rather than less

the quality of us manufactured goods is on the 
rise according to a boston university study on manufacturing 
competitiveness based on a survey of company executives 
the good news for manufacturers is that the improvement rate on 
the quality of goods has increased in the last two years but the 
report also found new product development and cost as possible 
trouble spots on the us manufacturing front 
to get ahead of european and japanese manufacturers americans 
must hold strong on quality and improve on new product development 
and cost said jeffrey miller a professor at boston universitys 
school of management 
miller and professor jay kim drew conclusions about 
manufacturing based on surveys of nearly 200 executives of large 
us manufacturing firms the study was released by the 
manufacturing roundtable at boston university 
in the study beyond the quality revolution us 
manufacturing strategy in the 1990s researchers found that in 
1989 quality improved at an annual rate of 7 percent over 1988 
however cost and new product introduction time improved only 2 to 
3 percent per year over the twoyear period 
kim said the survey found that more than half the respondents 
start their process engineering activities after most of the 
product engineering is finished 
this results in longer lead time for new product development 
higher costs and missed opportunities in rapidly changing 
markets kim said 
the study found that american manufacturers do not view the 
introduction of new products by competitors as a serious threat 
miller said thats a dangerous misperception the nationwide 
emphasis on quality and the previous success of these firms in 
improving it may be distorting their perception of competitive 
realities he said 
work has begun on an international report to compare similar 
data for japan and europe kim said 
james howell an economist who runs his own consulting firm and 
formerly worked as an economist for the bank of boston said the 
report may reflect the fact that manufacturers as well as deans 
of engineering schools became concerned that other countries were 
doing a better job of maintaining high quality 
this is the area where the japanese have been just beating our 
pants off howell said 
but he said there are better ways to gauge quality improvement 
than asking manufacturing executives 
you really should ask the production engineer on the floor who 
is really trying to maintain quality production howell said 
the survey asked executives to weigh a number of factors in 
determining quality including defect rates liability and customer 
satisfaction kim said he said the numbers for quality improvement 
are significant because executives gave their companies lower marks 
for improvement in other areas 
still howell remained skeptical no executive has ever found 
anything wrong with his quality howell said

prosecutors filed a sentencing report thursday 
about financier michael milken that is believed to allege numerous 
uncharged crimes but it was not made public pending challenges 
from the news media 
an attorney for milken said he would oppose release of the 
papers before the former drexel burnham lambert inc junk bond 
executive is sentenced on oct 1 for his guilty plea to six 
securities and tax fraud counts 
the sentencing memorandum reportedly contains details about 
milkens alleged conduct unearthed by the government but never made 
public because of the plea agreement reached in april 
us district judge kimba wood gave attorneys for members of the 
media until monday to argue why the document should be released 
before milken is sentenced 
under the plea deal milkens lawyers agreed not to contest the 
release of the sentencing memo or the inclusion of conduct outside 
the plea they can however seek to block release prior to the 
date of sentencing 
assistant us attorney john k carroll said the government did 
not object to releasing a version of the report before sentencing 
but would delete references to unindicted coconspirators and 
confidential information related to an ongoing grand jury 
investigation 
the government normally does not release such memos which 
contain arguments for or against the severity of a sentence until 
the day of sentencing defense lawyers also can file a sentencing 
report 
milkens lawyers are expected to oppose early release of the 
report on the grounds that prejudicial publicity about milken could 
threaten his right to a fair sentencing high public interest 
generated by the case is one argument for early release 
we want this case treated in terms of sentencing the way other 
defendants are treated in this court and not different milken 
attorney martin flumenbaum said at a hearing 
there have always been high visibility cases in this court and 
the practice of withholding reports until sentencing has been 
invariably followed he said we bargained for it to be 
publicly disclosed at the date of sentencing 
richard tofel an attorney for dow jones amp co which owns the 
wall street journal said he would file a motion arguing in favor 
of early release flumenbaum was given until wednesday to respond 
prosecutors said a version of the sentencing report deleting the 
sensitive information could be prepared within 48 hours of a 
judges release order tofel said the newspaper would seek to have 
the full report released publicly either before or at sentencing 
earlier this year us district judge pierre leval refused to 
admit a sentencing report alleging that former wall street 
arbitrager robert freeman committed 20 crimes in addition to a 
single insider trading count he admitted 
that is not an issue in this case because milkens lawyers 
agreed that the government could raise at sentencing conduct not 
included in the plea deal 
milken faces up to 28 years in prison he originally was 
indicted in march 1989 on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering in 
the biggest securities fraud case in history

corn and wheat futures prices fell as expected thursday 
following a government forecast for increasing supplies of those 
grains but a drop in the soybean market surprised some observers 
on other commodity markets crude oil futures rose slightly 
precious metals were mixed cattle were mixed and pork futures 
retreated 
wheat futures settled 3 cents to 7 cents lower on the chicago 
board of trade with the contract for delivery in september at 
259 a bushel corn was 5 cents to 8 cents lower with september 
at 233 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with 
september at 107 a bushel soybeans were 7 cents lower to 1 cent 
higher with september at 623 a bushel 
in a crop report released after wednesdays close the 
agriculture department estimated an 8 percent increase in us corn 
production this year to 812 billion bushels 
the government also raised its projection for the nations aug 
31 1991 corn stockpile to 138 billion bushels from last months 
estimate of 121 billion 
similarly the usda boosted its wheat production estimate to 
276 billion bushels 35 percent more han last year and raised 
its forecast for the may 31 wheat stockpile to 946 million bushels 
from last months projection of 846 million 
those unexpectedly big numbers explained thursdays decline in 
corn and wheat prices analysts said 
but soybean prices also slipped despite the governments 
forecast for a 5 percent decline in soybean production this year to 
184 billion bushels and a reduction in the usdas aug 31 1991 
soybean stockpile projection to 200 million bushels from last 
months estimate of 225 million 
anne frick senior oilseed analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc said some but not all of thursdays soybean 
selling reflected an overflow of bearish sentiment from the 
neighboring corn and wheat pits 
she said additional pressure may have stemmed from skepticism 
about the governments logic in predicting that a decline in the 
amount of soybeans harvested in brazil next spring will lead to an 
increase in world consumption of us soybeans during the 12 months 
that began sept 1 
a case could be made for a smaller brazilian crop based on 
lower plantings but the impact on us usage from a smaller south 
american crop would more likely be felt in the 199192 crop year 
frick said 
other analysts said traders who bought soybean contracts earlier 
in the week in anticipation of a lower usda forecast for brazilian 
soybean production took profits thursday after the report confirmed 
their expectations 
crude oil and heating oil futures rose but nearterm gasoline 
fell thursday on the new york mercantile exchange in a lackluster 
trading session muffled by a shortage of news from the persian 
gulf 
light sweet crude oil settled unchanged to 38 cents higher with 
october at 3107 a barrel heating oil was 89 cent to 127 cents 
higher with october at 8348 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
48 cent lower to 84 cent higher with october at 9336 cents a 
gallon 
gold futures edged higher while silver futures slipped on new 
yorks commodity exchange 
gold settled 40 cents to 80 cents higher with september at 
38290 a troy ounce silver was 28 cents to 3 cents lower with 
september at 4773 a troy ounce 
profittaking pressured live cattle futures on the chicago 
mercantile exchange but feeder cattle advanced helped by the drop 
in corn prices 
hog futures retreated in line with weaker cash prices while pork 
bellies succumbed to profittaking after wednesdays strong gains 
live cattle settled 15 cent to 37 cent lower with october at 
7870 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 60 cent 
higher with september at 8820 cents a pound live hogs were 
unchanged to 48 cent lower with october at 5062 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 45 cent to 16 cents lower with february 
at 53 cents a pound

a potentially nasty split is looming among 
canadian pulp and paper workers over whether to agree to 
concessions or go on strike in hopes of a better contract offer 
about 800 workers were off the job thursday at a canadian forest 
proucts ltd mill in dalhousie new brunswick after rejecting an 
offer which the union said followed the socalled pattern 
settlement reached this summer with stoneconsolidated inc 
cp forests largest mill in gatineau quebec was also shut down 
by a strike one local representing 1105 workers at the gatineau 
mill voted against the offer while another local with 238 members 
voted for the deal 
but 1100 workers at the companys plants in la tuque quebec 
and troisrivieres quebec voted for the proposal and remained on 
the job 
it wasnt because we were satisfied but were in a recession 
and the industry is in a slump union local spokesman pierre 
bellerive said in a telephone interview from capdelamadeleine 
near troisrivieres 
people just didnt think it was the right time for a strike 
he said 
a spokesman for the montrealbased canadian paperworkers union 
declined comment except to acknowledge we have a difficult 
situation 
cp forest is canadas second largest producer of newsprint after 
abitibiprice inc of toronto which has 3800 workers on strike at 
mills in stephenville and grand falls in newfoundland chandler 
quebec iroquois falls ontario and three mills in thunder bay 
ontario 
talks between abitibiprice and the union collapsed tuesday and 
union negotiators urged members to reject the companys offer 
abitibiprice workers voted thursday on the deal and results 
were not yet known in beaupre near quebec city however the 
450member local at the abitibiprice plant has already accepted 
the offer and is on the job 
in the case of both companies the sticking points with workers 
have been demands to operate on two more statutory holidays in 
return for premiums of up to five times the basic rate of pay and 
calls for greater flexibility in assigning skilled tradesmen 
were shutting down the mill because our members dont want to 
give up anything on those issues said gilles sabourin a union 
spokesman at the cp forest mill in gatineau 
the union says allowing greater trade flexibility would cost 
jobs 
those two concessions were the hallmark of the pattern agreement 
reached earlier this summer with employees of montrealbased 
stoneconsolidated that agreement contained a 165 percent wage 
increase over three years 
every three years the union chooses a target company and 
negotiates what is called the pattern settlement which is supposed 
to serve as the industry model 
but this year although the wage increase was seen as generous 
by some industry observers in light of the plummeting profits of 
paper plants the pattern deal with stoneconsolidated roused the 
ire of workers elsewhere 
the concessions proved so unpopular the union said it would back 
any locals that wanted to fight them 
abitibiprice says it has offered employees a 165 percent wage 
increase over three years as well as all other gains negotiated by 
the stoneconsolidated mills 
the average base rate for a mill worker is 1537 1325 us 
an hour 
some industry analysts have predicted that any strike over 
nonmonetary issues would not last long 
separate negotiations are being conducted at cp forests plants 
in dryden and thunder bay workers at those two plants will be in a 
strike position at the end of september said a union spokesman

billionaire robert bass purchase of a failed 
california thrift is saving taxpayers money a bass associate said 
thursday challenging a studys conclusion that the buyout was the 
worst of the 1988 southwest plan bailouts 
the study prepared for the us house banking committee 
suggests the government will end up paying 437 billion to bail 
out the thrift more than double original estimate of 17 billion 
the fort worth startelegram reported thursday 
the newspaper said investigators also concluded that it would 
have been cheaper to liquidate american savings and loan 
association of stockton at a cost of 33 billion than to pump 
federal money into it 
but bass group principal bernie carl who was lead negotiator in 
the thrift purchase said that while the study was based on 
accurate figures from when the thrift was sold in december 1988 
they have not been correctly interpreted 
also carl said the 33 billion liquidation fee while correct 
at the time of the sale would have ballooned to 44 billion had 
the thrift actually been liquidated in total he estimated it 
would have cost the government 5 billion to liquidate the thrift 
jake lewis a staff member of the house banking committee said 
he would not address any specific figures or analysis of the study 
until after a hering on it friday 
the best we can tell is that it is not any document from this 
committee lewis said we do have some staff analysis but we 
have not made any release of any study from here 
carl said american savings was actually 1 billion deeper in 
debt than estimated when regulators assessed the 33 billion 
liquidation fee 
the bank board didnt understand how deep the hole was and 
im not sure they could have carl said thursday breaking 
longstanding policy not to comment on bass dealings 
after the sale american savings was divided into two financial 
institutions a healthy 15 billionasset thrift named american 
savings bank and a bad bank called new west federal savings 
with a 22 billion portfolio of troubled assets 
carl said that under the bass tenure 14 billion in troubled 
assets from new west have been liquidated at 700 million above the 
appraised value reducing the governments exposure to less than 
37 billion 
if the remainder of the troubled portfolio is liquidated with 
the same success he said the 700 million figure would climb to 
approximately 1 billion 
when the governments 30 percent share in american savings is 
considered carl said the taxpayers cost in the bailout is 1 
billion lower than initially estimated 
what these numbers really show is the deal didnt cost the 
taxpayers 1 billion it probably saved them that much carl 
said 
the study of 27 southwest plan deals was prepared for a banking 
committee hearing friday in washington 
chairman henry b gonzalez dsan antonio is reviewing the 
deals made in 1988 under the southwest plan he is focusing on 
american savings as well as the deals behind southwest savings of 
dallas and first gibraltar bank 
gonzalez has characterized most of the 94 transactions involving 
196 institutions as sweetheart deals that were overly generous 
to wealthy investors and too costly to taxpayer the overall cost 
of the savings and loan bailout has been estimated at 500 billion 
carl claimed the hearing is designed to take the heat off 
politicians and place it on those who bought insolvent banks 
its much easier to find a scapegoat than face up to the fact 
that they created the thrift mess to start off with he said 
in an article this week the publication american banker termed 
the american savings purchase a possible prototype for future 
government action the publication lauded the deal which involved 
little federal assistance bass of fort worth pumped 400 million 
into the thrift

monetary policy 
an easing in fed policy would lead to lower us interest rates

congress on thursday extended for another four 
years president bushs authority to tap the nations strategic 
petroleum reserve to stave off higher oil prices even though bush 
has not used it in the iraqi takeover of kuwait 
the bill which also would authorize increasing the size of the 
reserve from 580 million to 1 billion barrels of oil was approved 
by the senate on a voice vote and sent to the white house 
the house earlier passed the bill 3910 
democrats have widely criticized bushs refusal to draw upon the 
reserve to moderate the 50 percent increase in crude prices since 
iraqs invasion of kuwait in early august 
the administration has said it will use the reserve only if 
shortages develop contending it was never intended to influence 
prices a contention some analysts dispute 
a united nations embargo against iraqikuwaiti oil has reduced 
world supplies by about 43 million barrels of which about 600000 
barrels went to the united states 
the agreement from a housesenate conference committee 
reauthorizes the reserve through 1994 without action 
authorization to operate the reserve would have expired on 
saturday 
it also increases the amount of oil that the energy department 
may purchase and store from the current 750 million barrels to 1 
billion barrels the bill originally passed by the house extended 
the authority but did not increase the size of the reserve 
the strategic petroleum reserve is a stockpile of crude oil 
established in response to the 197374 arab oil embargo the oil is 
stored in salt caverns along the louisianatexas coast and has been 
accumulated at a cost of more than 20 billion over the last 
decade 
the system with its current actual stockpile of 580 million 
barrels could now replace 80 days of oil imports according to 
congressional committees should it be needed in an oil emergency 
that cushion has fallen from 110 days in the middle 1980s because 
of growing us dependence on foreign crude 
the measure also authorizes a test program for establishment of 
a stockpile of refined oil products such as gasoline and home 
heating oil 
congress and the administration have battled over the last 18 
months over whether to increase the reserve to 1 billion barrels 
president bush has opposed increasing the reserve

bernd zabel says there are some things 
hell miss while hes gone from this world for two years going 
to a saturday night movie going to a bar having dinner having a 
beer 
but all in all the 41yearold electrical engineer from munich 
west germany wont mind forgoing such pleasures for hell be in 
another special world a giant terrarium known as biosphere ii 
his closest neighbors will be seven fellow environmental 
pioneers or biospherians who will live with 3800 varieties 
of plants animals and insects inside the 2acre glassandsteel 
dome designed to duplicate earths ecosystem 
the 30 million privately funded biosphere is a prototype for 
sustaining life in space and and a laboratory for solving 
environmental problems such as pollution 
the worldwithintheworld will consist of the crew members 
habitat plus six others an agricultural area desert fresh and 
saltwater marshes ocean savannah and rain forest 
all food will be raised inside from 150 crops rotated 
seasonally to small goats chickens pigs and fish air water and 
wastes will be recycled 
only electricity will link the ecological system with the 
outside computers and telephones will provide communications with 
the rest of the world crew members will be able to leave via 
airlocks in an emergency 
the crew members named wednesday have worked together for at 
least three years on the project which begins dec 5 
im working five years toward the aim of the twoyear closure 
and the closer the day comes the more excited i get said zabel 
41 the crew captain 
the other crew members all single are abigail k alling 31 a 
marine biologist dr roy walford a gerontologist and nutritionist 
and professor of pathology at the ucla school of medicine linda 
leigh 38 scientific director sally silverstone 35 taber k 
maccallum 26 jane elizabeth poynter 28 and mark van thillo 29 
poynter of surrey england said the biospherians have been 
practicing their farming and several also have learned how to 
butcher animals nothing will be a surprise when we go in in 
terms of growing our own food she said 
alling acknowledged that everyone involved with the project has 
given some thought to the possibility that a crew member might go 
stircrazy in the biospheres confines 
my response is ive spent quite a lot of time at sea 
including a stint on a research ship off antarctica she said
