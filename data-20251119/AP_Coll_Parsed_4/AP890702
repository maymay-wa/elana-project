twelve years three planets and 44 
billion miles after leaving earth voyager 2 is converging on 
neptune a swirling bluegreen planet with a backward moon for the 
last stop on an extraordinary tour 
the solar system is our neighborhood and were getting to the 
end of the neighborhood said norm haynes voyager project manager 
at the national aeronautics and space admnistrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
voyager 2 already has detected a dark spot on neptune that may be 
a giant storm like jupiters great red spot as it nears the planet 
the probe will search for undiscovered moons and partial rings and 
at 9 pm pdt on aug 24 voyager will swoop within 3000 miles of 
neptunes north pole cloudtops the closest of its close encounters 
and the first spacecraft to visit the planet 
it will be 275 billion miles from earth after traveling 443 
billion miles along its curving path the information it sends back 
at the speed of light will take four hours and six minutes to arrive 
five hours after the closest encounter voyager will fly within 
25000 miles of the backwardsorbiting moon triton the other known 
moon is nereid 
voyager 1 and 2 laden with tv cameras and an array of sensors 
were launched from cape canaveral in 1977 they visited jupiter in 
1979 and saturn in 1980 and 1981 respectively voyager 2 reached 
uranus in 1986 voyager 1 now is heading toward interstellar space 
voyager 1 and 2 returned 65000 photographs of jupiter saturn 
and their moons and rings voyager 2 sent back 8000 pictures of 
uranus and its moons and will take another 8000 of neptune 
at a cost haynes pegged at 865 million through the neptune 
encounter the voyagers returned more new knowledge about the 
outer planets than existed in all of the preceding history of 
astronomy according to nasa 
neptune discovered in 1846 is 30700 miles in diameter six 
times earths size and the fourth largest planet after jupiter 
saturn and uranus a neptunian year lasts 165 earth years and a day 
lasts 17 to 18 earth hours a detail voyager may pinpoint neptune 
usually is the eighth planet but because of plutos elongated orbit 
neptune will be the ninth and outermost until 2007 
scientists expect voyager to discover at least 10 small moons 
said deputy project scientist ellis miner 
some moons may confine or shepherd the 5 to 12milewide 
incomplete rings called ring arcs orbiting neptune said 
physicist ed stone nasas voyager project scientist and a vice 
president at california institute of technology 
voyager also may discover dust bands and 50 to 100 partial rings 
in addition to the three to six arcs scientists believe they 
detected from earth stone added the partial rings possibly made 
of dust and pebbles most likely are debris from the collision of a 
comet and an ancient moon he said 
voyager should be some 33400 miles above neptunes clouds when 
it crosses the ring region so it is unlikely to be destroyed by an 
unseen arc he said 
the probe also will study neptunes weather scientists believe 
the 6200milewide dark spot it found probably is similar to 
earths hurricanes or jupiters great red spot the source of the 
internal heat driving neptunes storms is a mystery earths comes 
decaying radioactive material in rocks 
neptune is pale bluegreen because methane or natural gas in 
its mostly hydrogenhelium atmosphere absorbs red light scientists 
suspect that a third of the way toward the planets center the 
atmosphere becomes a superhot slurry of hot water and rock so 
neptune like neighboring uranus probably lacks a distinct 
skysea boundary stone said 
despite any internal heat neptune receives 900 times less 
sunlight than earth so the temperature at the top of its atmosphere 
is 350 degrees below zero fahrenheit about the same as on triton 
stone said 
scientists believe triton 1400 to 2240 miles wide roughly 
the size of earths moon will be the most fascinating part of 
voyagers flyby 
when a planet and its moons form from a spinning disk of gas and 
solid material the moons should orbit in the direction the planet 
rotates tritons reverse orbit suggests it once orbited the sun 
like a comet or a planet but collided with a moon to form a new 
backwardsmoving satellite stone said 
triton probably is cold and geologically inactive with an icy 
mantle over a rocky core but it once may have had a molten interior 
that created ridges valleys cliffs canyons and volcanoes that 
voyager might photograph 
observations from earth indicate tritons atmosphere contains 
methane and nitrogen sunlight likely converts methane into complex 
hydrocarbons creating a transparent reddishorange photochemical 
haze stone said the hydrocarbons may form heavier particles 
coating the surface with frozen sludge 
could the organic chemicals have allowed life to develop on 
triton 
the temperature is very very cold so i think its unlikely 
he said 
scientists believe triton has extreme seasons because its orbit 
around neptune is highly inclined one pole faces the sun for 82 
years and the other remains in darkness this may mean tritons 
atmosphere gets thinner and thicker as methanenitrogen icecaps 
cover one pole then the other 
researchers discarded the theory that triton has liquid nitrogen 
oceans but puddles or lakes are possible along with fields of 
nitrogen ice crystals stone said 
nereid about 190 to 620 miles wide has a very elongated 
elliptical orbit caltech astrophysicist peter goldreich speculates 
nereid once had a circular orbit that was disturbed by gravity from 
triton or a large passing object 
if voyager confirms that neptune has a magnetic field the planet 
also may have an aurora like earths and a mysterious ultraviolet 
electroglow a magnetic field should trap a radiation belt 
around neptune similar to earths van allen belts jupiters 
radiation belts damaged some of voyagers equipment haynes doubts 
similar problems at neptune 
voyager 2 has worked 12 years with only relatively minor 
failures although it contains electronics equal to 10000 
television sets he said 
commands sent to voyager and photos and information it sends to 
earth travel at the speed of light but the oneway trip still take 
four hours six minutes nasa is using 38 dishshaped radio antennas 
in new mexico california australia spain and japan to capture the 
radio signal which is like trying to see a 20watt light bulb 
burning 275 billion miles away 
both voyagers are expected to return valuable data well into 
the 21st century before their power supplies run out in about 
2020 nasa said 
after neptune voyager 2 will join voyager 1 and pioneers 10 and 
11 in seeking the true edge of the solar system where solar wind 
gives way to interstellar wind billions of miles beyond the planets

imagine a 20watt 
refrigerator light bulb burning in the dark 275 billion miles away 
now imagine the sophisticated eyes needed to see the light 
voyager 2 heading for neptune is emitting 20 watts of radio 
signals information coded in binary bits ones and zeros on the 
space probes health and from its scientific instruments and cameras 
think of that lightbulb as flickering and that flickering 
contains the information that voyager is sending back to us said 
bill brundage voyager preparation manager for the very large array 
radio telescope 
the signals have become fainter since voyagers encounters with 
jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 the signals and 
commands sent to the 12yearold probe take four hours and six 
minutes to cross 275 billion miles at the speed of light larger 
antennas and more sensitive receivers are needed on earth to receive 
the signals and more power is needed to transmit commands to the 
craft which will pass fly within 3000 miles of neptune on aug 24 
the national aeronautics and space administrations deep space 
network is used to talk to voyager the dsn has three complexes 
goldstone in californias mojave desert madrid spain and 
tidbinbilla australia near canberra 
when voyager flew by uranus the california and australian 
listening posts used three antenna dishes each one 210 feet across 
and two 112 feet and the madrid station used one of each said 
mary beth murrill a spokeswoman for the nasa jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena calif the canberra complex also was linked 
to australias 210foot parkes radio astronomy telescope 
for neptune the 210foot dishes at goldstone canberra and 
madrid have been increased to 230 feet and another 112foot antenna 
was built at madrid in addition the vla is being used in 
conjunction with goldstone parkes again is linked with canberra 
and a japanese telescope will be added to the network 
the different sites ensure that at least one station can 
communicate with the spacecraft despite the earths rotation 
brundage said 
the vla alone gives us almost a third more images than if we 
didnt have it said norm haynes voyager project manager at jpl 
the vla is a oneofakind spaceage erector set sitting on an 
ancient lake bed the site is skirted by four mountain ranges 
protecting it from much of the electronic interference from 
television radios aircraft and the like 
it consists of 27 white dishshaped antennas each 82 feet in 
diameter 92 feet high and weighing 235 tons the dishes sit on the 
plains of san augustin amid tumbleweed cattle and sparse vegetation 
at an altitude of 7000 feet 
the dishes are arranged along three arms of railroad track laid 
out in the shape of a y two arms are 13 miles long and the third is 
118 miles the earth rotates the y like a turntable creating 
images that have the same detail as if using a radio telescope up to 
26 miles in diameter 
a special 36wheel transporter moves each antenna to one of 72 
observation stations along the three arms this acts like a zoom 
lens the farther out the dishes the higher the resolution the 
closer in the larger the field of view 
nasa spent 65 million to equip each dish to receive voyagers 
signals it also set up special techniques and installed two big 
diesel generators to guard against lightningcaused power 
fluctuations during the thunderstorm season 
the separation of the listening posts around the world just 
like the separation of the vla dishes strengthen the sensitivity 
of the network the signal vla gets from voyager is sent via 
satellite to goldstone where the two signals are combined decoded 
and sent via microwave to jpl in pasadena

the young womans enthusiasm was 
contagious i did it i did it she said smiling broadly and 
barely standing still after casting her first vote in a democratic 
election 
the right to vote is taken for granted and often ignored in 
countries with a longer tradition of rule by and for the people 
but in eastern europe brutalized by 50 years of war stalinism 
police repression false propaganda and economic mismanagement that 
simple act in the polish national elections june 4 seemed nothing 
short of a miracle 
communist rule came to eastern europe as the result of the world 
war ii military might of the soviet union but perestroika and 
glasnost under soviet president mikhail s gorbachev are giving 
countries that used to be referred to as satellites the leeway 
to experiment with democracy 
economic pressures are also helping the cause of political 
reforms 
with communist economies proven unable to compete with the west 
in a hightechnology age the ideological rationale for 
marxismleninism that it makes life better for the common man and 
woman has been stripped away 
in the course of one or two years the concept of free 
competition among different political parties has gone from being an 
unimaginable dream to being hoped for and even counted on in poland 
and hungary 
poles and hungarians will even get a rare firsthand look at the 
leader of a western democracy this month when president bush stops 
to visit prior to the annual summit of industrialized democracies in 
paris 
bush will find a poland that has just held the first democratic 
parliamentary elections since world war ii in which candidates 
backed by the solidarity movement took 99 of the 100 seats 
the elections to the sejm were not free the opposition was 
allowed only to run for 35 percent of the seats solidarity took all 
161 of those its platform remove the partys leading role and 
hold free elections in four years 
in hungary that might be too slow a commission is working to 
draft a constitution expected to provide for fully free multiparty 
elections as early as next year it also will guarantee free speech 
independent courts and other human rights 
the rapid pace of democratic change in hungary was underlined by 
the reburial with honors june 16 of imre nagy leader of the 1956 
antisoviet revolt who was executed for treason hundreds of 
thousands of people were on hand for the ceremony and joined a 
veteran of 1956 in swearing we will never again be slaves 
party leaders in poland and hungary have been quoted as saying 
they hope the communist party will win planned free elections in the 
future but if not the party will accept the voters verdict and 
relinquish power 
in poland the opposition is led by lech walesa and the 
solidarity movement which embraces workers intellectuals and much 
of the powerful roman catholic church in hungary reform is mainly 
the work of intellectuals including a potent liberal wing of the 
communist party itself 
both countries already have seen the spontaneous reformation of 
longbanned political parties and associations as if they only were 
in suspended animation for the past half century there also are 
totally new political grouping such as environmentally conscious 
greens 
elsewhere in eastern europe democratization is not so advanced 
where it exists at all what is happening in poland and hungary has 
raised hopes among some citizens while disquieting the mostly aging 
leaderships 
east germany and romania the most hardline states have 
commented with dismay on hungarys move toward democracy under 
the flag of renewing socialism forces are at work that strive for 
removing socialism said east german politburo member joachim 
herrman romania said the ceremonies to honor nagy were clearly 
fascist antisocialist in nature 
both countries brook no dissent in romania dissidents are 
jailed while in east germany they are likely to find themselves 
deported to the west 
in prague the czechoslovak leadership has paid enthusiastic lip 
service to the kremlin reforms but failed so far to implement them 
amid an ongoing if secretive debate about whether change is needed 
in bulgaria leader todor zhivkov remains true to a lifetime of 
skillfully aping whatever policy holds sway in moscow in july 1987 
he embraced economic reform exciting bulgarias intelligentsia and 
younger technocrats 
but zhivkov and longtime comrades on the ruling poltiburo blocked 
dissent within the party last year dissident groups the first seen 
in four decades of communist rule are closely watched by security 
forces and troublemakers are expelled 
in yugoslavia the communist party leadership in slovenia the 
most economically advanced of the countrys six republics has 
tolerated a broad degree of pluralism while rejecting demands for 
multiparty democracy from mushrooming independent groups those 
calls have been echoed by intellectuals in croatia and servia the 
two largest republics but ethnic tensions among the republics have 
complicated any broad alliance for reform 
serbian president slobodan milosevic however uses authoritarian 
tactics and insists on oneparty orthodox communist rule putting 
him at odds with other republics particularly the slovenes who 
are now threatening secession if conflicts go unresolved

thunderstorms packing 90 mph gusts roared through northern texas 
late sunday and rivers continued to rise in louisiana and 
mississippi 
the flooding the aftermath of record rainfall from tropical 
storm allison could continue for weeks meteorolgists said 
dallas fire officials received reports of two tornadoes touching 
down the storms knocked down power lines leaving about 50000 
homes without electricity authorities said 
about a dozen mobile homes near lake worth were knocked off 
foundations and struck by windblown trees said fort worth fire 
department spokesman walter mcconnell 
there were no immediate reports of injuries 
in louisiana at least 700 homes and numerous roads remained 
flooded with scattered storms and showers replacing the unremitting 
rain of the previous five days one town got nearly 29 inches of 
rain in less than a week 
a tornado destroyed a taxidermy business and 70 mph winds swept 
the outskirts of alexandria in the central part of louisiana said 
sgt anthony ribaudo of the rapides parish sheriffs department 
ribaudo said he couldnt tell if the storm would worsen flooding 
in the area 
its already so bad one more storm doesnt seem like 
anything he said 
an earthen dam in another rural part of the state was reported 
near collapse and most residents near it had evacuated 
in alexandria a 12yearold boy died when he jumped into a 
stormflooded ditch and was sucked into a culvert saturday 
afternoon one of three deaths blamed on the storm authorities 
said four deaths were blamed on the storm in texas 
in mississippi authorities braved rain and lightning to search 
for a teenager missing after he and a companion went swimming in a 
swollen creek 
the body of the companion was recovered early sunday near 
natchez on the east bank of the mississippi 
about 180 miles north about 200 people were evacuated from 
coahoma county homes as a flood swept through their neighborhoods 
during the night allisons leftover rain and thunderstorms moved 
slowly eastward and shifted the heavy rain pattern into the 
tennessee and ohio valleys 
the national weather service said fields and timberland were 
likely to stay flooded for weeks because there was nowhere for all 
the water to go 
the red river itself is at bankfull from grand ecore 
downstream to alexandria and below said ernest ethridge a 
weather service meteorologist in shreveport 
all these tributaries that received the torrential rains are 
unable to empty their water into the main channel he said so 
it spreads out becomes a big lake 
at least 10 parishes louisianas equivalent of counties got 
12 to 15 inches of rain he said with 20 inches or more measured in 
winn and natchitoches parishes he said some lakes and rivers 
crested sunday and others were expected to do so monday or later 
all were flooding he said 
in winn parish about 70 miles southeast of shreveport deputies 
kept watch on the deteriorating mirror lake dam which initially had 
been expected to collapse by daybreak 
its doing better than we thought it would but its not going 
to hold long said deputy benjamin phelps some trees that were 
holding it yesterday washed out during the night now its just 
dirt 
he said no evacuation had been ordered but most of the people in 
the 50 or so homes nearby left on their own 
theres people getting smart and getting out he said 
about 100 houses were evacuated around saline lake along the 
western edge of the parish 
downstream authorities estimated that the flooded lake saline 
lake where about 100 houses were evacuated would rise at least an 
extra foot if the mirror lake dam broke 
winnfield got the weeks worst rain 2875 inches since 
wednesday 
the suns out and the waters receding at the present 
said mayor max kelley however he said more storms were expected 
and the dugdemona river had not yet crested about 100 houses were 
flooded in the town 
i would imagine our economy is going to suffer he said 
at the weather service ethridge said winnfield got 32 inches of 
rain in june the wettest month on record and 7 inches above the 
previous record set in december 1983 shreveport had its wettest 
june ever with 1701 inches of rain he said lowland flooding would 
continue to increase for the next few days and then probably remain 
for a couple of weeks

the governor of missouri told 
antiabortion lobbyists saturday that legalized abortion contributes 
to dropouts suicides and low selfesteem among youth 
gov john ashcroft speaking to the national right to life 
committees annual convention two days before the supreme court was 
expected to rule on a missouri case that could determine the future 
of legalized abortion in america said abortions contributed to a 
vacuum of values among the youth 
what kind of signal are we as a society sending them about the 
value of life we need to send an unmistakable message that there is 
a fundamental value in life itself he said 
the law being reviewed by the supreme court puts restrictions on 
abortions and defines life as beginning at conception upholding the 
missouri law or even parts of it could reverse or seriously erode 
the 1973 roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
the roe decision is simply a miserable failure ashcroft 
said drawing loud applause and i hope that the supreme court 
announces it is overturning the roe decision and giving back to the 
states the right to make public policy 
the court has said it may rule monday on the case webster vs 
reproductive health services or delay its decision for further 
review 
earlier saturday us rep chris smith rnj told delegates 
they must not become complacent in light of victories the movement 
has achieved over the last 20 years 
weve got to regroup weve got to rededicate weve got to 
realize that the fight is just beginning smith said 
over the past two decades our message has been getting 
through our efforts are bearing fruit without us it would have 
gotten worse said smith one of three congressmen with strong 
antiabortion records in the house 
in the minneapolisst paul suburb of robbinsdale meanwhile 
about 300 protesters on both sides of the issue picketed and sang 
saturday morning outside a clinic where abortions are performed 
dixie riley of the national organization for women said now 
representatives were on hand to make sure that the women can get 
into the clinic and exercise their constitutional right for as 
long as it lasts we all know the roe v wade decision is being 
reconsidered 
reps james oberstar dminn and henry hyde rill also 
addressed the group 
america has been called a disposable society but that 
shouldnt include people oberstar said 
many religious groups support the antiabortion position he said 
but there is more than religion alone to guide us in this issue 
because theres incontrovertible medical and biological evidence 
that life begins at conception the congressman said 
hyde said abortion is just another indication of decay in the 
morals of america the high incidence of alcoholism and drug abuse 
and the lack of religious guidance for many people are other 
indications he said 
the moral infrastructure of america has broken down hyde 
said we must be the rebuilders 
the greatest civil right the greatest human right of all is 
the right to life he said

a bomb exploded early sunday at a 
crowded exhibition attended by president ranasinghe premadasa and 
senior members of his cabinet but they escaped injury police said 
however at least one person was killed and 30 were wounded they 
said 
no one claimed responsibility for the blast which occurred 
shortly after midnight at a governmentsponsored exhibition in 
mahiyangana 70 miles northeast of colombo 
but police blamed members of the peoples liberation front a 
leftwing ethnic sinhalese group trying to overthrow the 
sinhalesedominated government 
also sunday security forces in the south arrested 3237 
sinhalese youths suspected of belonging to the front according to a 
police official in colombo 
it was the largest such crackdown against the group in nearly two 
years said the officer who cannot be identified under briefing 
rules 
the front has been blamed for more than 3500 killings since july 
1987 when indian peacekeeping forces arrived on this indian ocean 
island to enforce a peace accord between the government and the 
tamil minority 
the front contends the accord grants too many concessions to the 
tamils and the indian soldiers threaten sri lankan sovereignty 
front members have vowed to kill anyone who supports the pact 
last month premadasa asked india to pull out its troops by the 
end of july india refused saying a quick withdrawal could stir 
even more ethnic violence 
india sent troops to sri lanka under a peace accord signed by 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi and premadasas predecessor 
junius r jayewardene the accord proposed to give tamils limited 
autonomy in exchange for surrendering their weapons but militant 
tamils rejected it 
tamils who comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
contend they suffer job and educational discrimination sinhalese 
make up 75 percent of the population

in the office of kenneth carr the new chairman 
of the nuclear regulatory commission hangs a small framed copy of a 
oncesecret message that reminds him both of atomic powers promise 
a generation ago and its troubles today 
under way on nuclear power says the flash from the uss 
nautilus signalling the launching of the maiden voyage of the first 
vessel in the world to be propelled by a nuclear reactor the date 
was jan 17 1955 and carr was a crew member 
he remembers that historic moment as a highwater mark in the 
military use of nuclear power 
a generation later carr 64 is taking the helm of the nrc with 
the commercial nuclear power industry at a low ebb crippled in 
large part by a widespread public fear of the atom a fear carr 
says is irrational but powerful and enduring 
from his first day monday as chairman of the federal agency that 
regulates commercial nuclear power carr says he intends to press 
the search for ways of overcoming public opposition to nuclear 
plants he has no illusions of quick success 
i think its going to be a generational change before you get 
the public acceptance he said in a recent interview 
no electric utility has ordered a nuclear plant in this country 
since 1978 and even nuclear powers biggest advocates see no sign 
of the drought ending soon 
public opposition isnt the only reason for nuclears stagnation 
but carr thinks its the one obstacle most deeply rooted in the 
history of atomic power 
todays adult population he says was introduced to nuclear 
power in an era in which strict secrecy not public education was 
the watchword of nuclears promoters and regulators the result was 
a mystic of littleunderstood danger 
we tried to keep it bottled up keep the genie in the bottle 
even long after it was out carr says noting a determination of 
the truman and eisenhower administrations to guard american nuclear 
knowhow not only from the soviet union and other potential us 
enemies but also friendly nations and even the american public 
i think we didnt do a good job at all of educating the 
public he says 
carr is a native of kentucky he retired from the navy as a vice 
admiral in 1985 last serving as deputy and chief of staff to the 
commander in chief atlantic command and the commander in chief of 
the us atlantic fleet 
he was a crewman on an assault landing craft in the pacific 
theater during world war ii later he was appointed to the us 
naval academy as a member of the class of 1949 among his honors are 
the distinguished service medal and legion of merit 
his experience in the nuclear navy gave carr firsthand knowledge 
of the nuclear secrecy he now bemoans 
even more basic to americans unease about the atom he says is 
a lingering memory of the stunning destruction caused by the only 
two nuclear bombs ever dropped on the japanese cities of hiroshima 
and nagasaki in august 1945 
thats what our generation sees when the words nuclear and 
atomic come they see that big ball over there and they see that 
picture of that one building standing there in the rubble he says 
the only thing that will change that carr believes is the 
passage of time and a stronger effort by government and industry to 
teach young people about nuclear energy if they fully understand 
it he says they wont fear it 
carr is replacing another retired navy officer lando zech jr 
as nrc chairman he has high praise for zech who served with carr 
on the uss nautilus for two years and has been a close associate 
since carr became an nrc commissioner in 1986 
now hes leaving me bailed out on me carr says using the 
maritime lingo that frequently flavors his speech 
during the two years he expects to spend as chairman carr says 
his top goal will be to set the ground rules for deciding whether to 
extend the operating licenses of us nuclear plants 
the licenses of existing plants are good for 40 years and the 
first expirations will come toward the end of the century decisions 
must be made soon he says because utilities need at least 10 years 
lead time to replace their plants if its decided that four decades 
of use make the reactors too dangerous to keep using

police at an international youth 
festival seized danish and finnish human rights banners and some 
european delegates sunday accused north korea of using the festival 
for selfpromotion 
more than 15000 people from 180 countries are in pyongyang for 
the 13th world festival of youth and students the biggest 
international gathering ever staged by the communist government 
the banners were seized at the opening cremonies saturday 
the danish banner read human rights in north korea too while 
finlands banner protested north koreas refusal to allow the human 
rights group amnesty international to attend the oneweek event 
the finn delegation had decided to drop out of the festival to 
protest the confiscation but reversed its decision sunday after 
north korea apologized and said two amnesty international 
representatives would be given visas to attend 
matti tohianen of the finnish delegation said police hit the 
hands of the four students carrying the banner and grabbed it during 
opening ceremonies 
north korea apparently balked at allowing amnesty representation 
because the group has criticized north koreas human rights record 
the danish delegation also was considering pulling out of the 
festival after police briefly detained three of its members for 
unfurling the human rights banner during a speech by president kim 
il sung 
the union of nordic center youth issued a statement saying the 
confiscation of banners was not within the spirit of the 
festival 
other delegates said they had received letters from the north 
koreans warning they would be held personally responsible for any 
actions at the opening ceremony that were critical of the host 
country or other participants 
a norwegian delegate said her group smuggled in a banner 
expressing solidarity with the suppressed chinese prodemocracy 
movement 
the finnish delegates also circulated a statement calling for the 
chinese government to respect the freedom of expression and stop 
the ongoing arrests and executions 
north korea has supported chinas crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement in that country twentyseven people have been executed 
since the movement was crushed by the military last month 
rachel kyte a representative of the european national youth 
council said her group was not happy about the staging of the 
festival in north korea one of the worlds most closed and tightly 
controlled nations 
she complained about the orchestrated chanting of national 
slogans at the opening ceremony in which 70000 north koreans 
performed in a threehour music dance and light show 
torhugne olsen a member of the international federation of 
liberal and radical youth called for a ban on opening and closing 
ceremonies 
we want festivals to be international events and not events of 
the host country he said 
the festival last held in moscow in 1985 brings together youth 
from socialist countries and mainly leftist organizations to discuss 
political topics and stage various art theatrical and sports shows 
the festival organizers refused to put the china events on the 
agenda 
north korea has set out to use the festival to show the world it 
can stage an international event as successfully as the rival south 
korean government which was host to the summer olympics in seoul 
last year 
dozens of new stadiums hotels and apartments have been built 
and many of pyongyangs 2 million people have been mobilized to 
prepare or participate in the festival 
in south korea about 1000 radical students gathered at seouls 
yonsei university on sunday to protest the government ban on 
participation in the youth festival 
relations have been strained between the two koreas since the 
korean peninsula was divided in 1945 into the communist north and 
capitalist south the countries fought a war from 1950 to 1953 and 
remain bitter enemies

the letter to deborah gore dean an aide to the 
secretary of housing and urban development didnt waste any words 
dear debbie it began 
help 
paul 
paul goulding a financial consultant who was working on behalf 
of a community organization said he was at the end of his rope that 
july day a few years ago 
in his case the plea did not work in many others it did 
an examination of ms deans correspondence during her years at 
the top of hud shows that help was her business particularly for 
certain developers and wellconnected republican consultants 
relatively few of the hundreds of letters released by hud were 
signed by ms dean however accompanying documents show that she 
gave the final approval to many letters over the signature of her 
boss thenhousing secretary samuel r pierce jr they were then 
signed by a machine at her command 
ms dean 34 is at the center of investigations of influence 
peddling at hud where she has been identified as the person who 
controlled millions of dollars for housing rehabilitation 
she has refused to testify before a congressional panel 
investigating hud citing her constitutional right against self 
incrimination 
and aside from earlier interviews with the wall street journal 
she has avoided contact with the news media last week when she 
accidentally answered a call at her lawyers office from the 
associated press she politely but firmly declined to talk and 
quickly put her attorney on the phone 
her rise through the ranks at the department was stymied only by 
the senate which derailed her nomination to be assistant hud 
secretary but it was from her post as executive assistant to 
pierce the job she held until she left the department in 1987 that 
she exerted her control 
goulding said in an interview that he had gotten nowhere in 
trying to persuade hud to boost a rent subsidy for a housing 
development on the south side of providence ri hud already had 
given money to fix up the project but it needed higher rent 
subsidies to make it financially workable he said 
goulding wound up seeking the help of ms dean 
i took a shot and called her he said she was always very 
polite to me and very nice and offering to be of help but i didnt 
get anywhere never translated into anything positive 
unfortunately 
goulding wasnt alone 
members of congress wrote to pierce to push for projects back 
home often they got letters back saying all the money had already 
been spent 
in the spring of 1985 for example sen john heinz rpa wrote 
a dear sam letter to pierce although the news was bad the tone 
was friendly when he got back letter addressed dear john and 
signed just sam 
the letters tone was set by ms dean as was the signature on 
formal occasions she would have the machine called an autopen sign 
samuel r pierce jr but when the mood called for it she would 
have the letter signed sam 
internal file slips from hud carrying the initials of everyone 
in the chain of command reviewing a particular piece or 
correspondence indicate that the final stop before the mail box was 
at ms deans desk it is not known whether pierce himself saw any 
of the correspondence because his initials are not on the slips 
pierce whose handsoff style of management at hud has been 
sharply criticized in the wake of disclosures about political 
influence costly misjudgments and outright stealing that plagued 
the department has said he was betrayed by his aides and singled 
out ms dean 
she liked power pierce said in an interview with the new 
york times she liked the idea that i can call the shots i can 
get this for you if i want i can stomp on you i can kill you 
thats the kind of thing she liked 
among the people who beat a path to her door were former interior 
secretary james watt gop political consultant paul manafort gop 
fundraiser and now ambassadordesignate to luxembourg fred bush 
and philip winn a former hud official who now is ambassador to 
switzerland all of them came away with money for the projects they 
represented bringing some of them sixfigure fees from grateful 
clients 
but ms dean who held little formal authority at the department 
occasionally invoked that lack of official power to give people the 
brush off 
first i feel i must explain once again she wrote in 1985 to 
allen moore who was seeking funds for a los angeles project 
neither i nor secretary pierce have any authority to designate 
moderate rehabilitation funds to you or your client i have tried to 
make this clear in the past 
they are issued on a competitive basis and there are far more 
requests than there are units available ms dean wrote 
no one would dispute that there were more requests for help than 
there was help available but few people would agree that the hud 
funds were awarded in fair competition 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of a subcommittee 
investigating hud has called the notion of competition a sham and 
an illusion 
goulding who said he was personally hurt for a while that his 
social contacts with ms dean did not translate into money has 
become forgiving over time 
unfortunately debbie sometimes tells you things that arent 
necessarily accurate goulding said its not because she means 
badly its that she over commits herself

a fierce dispute over the future of organized 
crime strike forces the justice departments shock troops in the 
war against the mob is heating up within the law enforcement 
community 
this is a turf fight its as simple as that says 
philadelphia attorney peter vaira a former strike force chief in 
that city who once headed the presidents commission on organized 
crime 
a senate judiciary committee hearing is set for july 21 on the 
strike forces teams of prosecutors initially established by robert 
f kennedy at the justice department to specialize in organized 
crime and labor racketeering 
currently based in 14 cities they have compiled a record of 
achievements that even critics call impressive 
organized crime leaders from boston new york philadelphia 
cleveland chicago kansas city and other cities are currently 
serving long prison terms as a result of strike force investigations 
indeed boston attorney jeremiah t osullivan a former new 
england strike force chief recalls a wiretap as early as 1981 in 
which hoodlums were heard to speak hopefully of chances that the 
strike forces would be disbanded 
actually the strike forces will be disbanded in effect if not 
in name under a plan announced by attorney general richard 
thornburgh say supporters of the units within the legal community 
thornburgh plans to place the strike forces which now report 
directly to washington under the control of presidentially 
appointed us attorneys who traditionally have been the top 
federal prosecutors in their communities 
i think its an unfortunate decision says temple university 
law professor charles rogovin essentially what is being done is 
the dismantling of an apparatus that has really developed a 
remarkable kind of expertise 
former strike force officials say there have been resignations in 
boston brooklyn and los angeles that in part were caused by 
thornburghs plan in fact osullivan says it was one factor in 
his own departure 
he says he had battled for years to hold the strike forces 
together and i just didnt have the energy to fight this fight 
one more time 
new york attorney edward a mcdonald formerly chief of the 
brooklyn strike force is critical of what officials 
euphemistically call the merger of the strike forces i like to 
call it the abolition or destruction of the strike forces 
nonsense retort justice department officials they say the plan 
guarantees that the strike force will remain intact but under 
control of us attorneys thus ending squabbling and rivalries 
are we going to spend 30 percent of our time arguing over whose 
case this is or are we going to make the case asks edward sg 
dennis assistant attorney general and no 2 official at the justice 
department 
praise is coming from virtually all of the nations us 
attorneys i think this is an excellent idea says chicago us 
attorney anton r valukas what it would do is substantially 
increase our ability to continue the war on organized crime 
gone are the days when us attorneys lacked the sophistication 
to launch the complex undercover investigations needed to catch 
mobsters says valukas he points to the operation graylord 
cases that revealed widespread bribery in chicago courts and 
resulted in conviction of scores of judges lawyers and court 
officials 
us attorney james richmond of hammond ind chairman of the 
15member attorney generals advisory committee points to stunning 
successes of rudolph giuliani and other us attorneys in new york 
where the strike force was merged into the us attorneys office 
the arrangement has produced some spectacular successes against 
organized crime 
this will certainly not diminish the fight against organized 
crime says richmond it will enhance it 
current strike force attorneys have remained silent in the 
debate one current strike force prosecutor who asked not to be 
identified by name cited a march 9 memo from dennis warning that 
violations of publicity guidelines could mean firing 
former strike force chiefs however have mounted a lobbying 
campaign designed to save their old program they say thornburgh has 
carried a longstanding grudge against the program 
he had innumerable runins with the pittsburgh strike force 
when he was us attorney in the early 1970s and it left a bad taste 
in his mouth says douglas roller former strike force chief in 
chicago 
and questions have been raised concerning the strong political 
ties that usually mark relations between us attorneys and the 
local establishments in their communities indeed the post of us 
attorney has been a launching pad for many political careers 
the loyalties of us attorneys are to the senators who 
nominated them says bruce fein a former justice department 
official and now a conservative analyst of the federal court system 
the issue came up at a june 20 hearing of the house criminal 
justice subcommittee when rep george sangmeister dill 
questioned dennis 
there are always a lot of calls like old moe has been a good 
contributor to the party for all these years and its a shame that 
youre doing to him what you are sangmeister said i think the 
us attorney should be completely absolved from that 
dennis suggested that in such a case the us attorney might 
recuse himself bow out to avoid a conflict and let an aide make 
the decision 
the us attorney is not going to recuse himself because 
somebody down in the party says take it easy on moe sangmeister 
shot back you dont recuse yourself for stuff like that

fatal accidents involving recreational boaters 
have decreased dramatically over the past two decades but many 
weekend skippers fear increasing congestion in waters has made 
pleasure trips more dangerous than ever 
fewer recreational boaters were killed last year than in any year 
since the coast guard began charting such statistics in 1961 
despite a 300 percent increase in the number of pleasure crafts in 
us waters 
without a doubt the waters are safer said john dane 
government relations manager at the national marine manufacturers 
association its a dramatic improvement 
the fatality rate which peaked at 202 deaths per 100000 boats 
in 1971 was 55 per 100000 boats last year according to coast 
guard documents 
the coast guard said 946 recreational boaters died in 1988 the 
first time the number fatalities has dipped below 1000 the number 
of boats meanwhile has increased from less than 6 million to an 
estimated 173 million 
but not everyone believes the fatality statistics are a 
reflection of a safer boating environment 
i dare say the waters are probably less safe than they were 20 
years ago said michael sciulla vice president of boat owners 
association of the united states which represents 310000 
recreational boat owners i hear from many boat owners that they 
are fearful of drunk boaters that they are fearful of boat owners 
who dont know the rules of the road and theyre fearful because of 
the increasing congestion of boats on our waterways 
and congestion it seems will only get worse 
in 1961 the coast guard estimated that there were 585 million 
pleasure crafts in us waters the estimate for 1988 was 173 
million a threefold increase 
boating is approaching a 20 billion industry sciulla said 
seventyfive million americans hop in a boat at least once a 
year its become an extraordinarily popular pastime over the past 
few decades 
the boating explosion over the past 25 years may explain another 
coast guard statistic that stands in stark contrast to the declining 
fatality rate the rising number of reported accidents and reported 
injuries 
reported boating injuries increased from 2757 in 1985 to 3476 
three years later boating officials however are quick to point 
out that only about 10 percent of the nonfatal marine accidents are 
reported 
when the figures change its not easy to tell if there are 
more or less accidents or better reporting or other factors its 
hard to draw conclusions said albert marmo assistant chief of 
the coast guards auxiliary boating and consumer affairs division 
even if congestion is causing more accidents and injuries most 
experts agree the steadily declining fatality rate is impressive 
the first turning point in recreational marine safety came in 
1971 when congress passed a sweeping safety law that included 
mandatory federal standards for boat construction 
in the 11 years before the law was enacted the annual fatality 
rate was 198 per 100000 boats over the next 17 years the average 
fatality rate was less than 10 per 100000 boats 
after dipping dramatically in the first five years following 
enactment of the federal law from 202 to 99 per 100000 boats 
the fatality rate leveled off through the late 1970s 
the rate however continued its downward spiral during the 
1980s from 95 in 1980 to 55 last year 
coast guard capt bill griswold chief of the coast guards 
auxiliary boating and consumer affairs division attributes much of 
the recent decrease to public awareness programs targeting 
drunkenness at sea

thousands of american servicemen and 
civilians finished moving over the weekend onto us bases widening 
the rift with the regime of gen manuel antonio noriega 
the us militarys southern command says the move is intended to 
maintain a low military profile in the face of harassment by the 
panamanian defense forces in recent months 
it also seems designed to increase pressure on noriega to step 
down as chief of the defense forces and panamas de facto leader 
it will deprive the countrys already battered economy of about 
60 million a year the americans were spending they will now make 
purchases in stores and other facilities within the southern command 
a total of 6400 americans including dependents were involved 
in the move which was ordered in may by the defense department when 
violence broke out after the may 7 presidential election 
government opponents and international observers said opposition 
candidates won the vote by 31 but noriega voided the results 
alleging interference in the campaign by the us government which 
has been trying to oust him since his indictment in miami last year 
on drug trafficking charges 
the move to military bases involved not only servicemen but also 
civilian employees of the southern command and its various branches 
all had been living in houses and apartments offbase onbase 
unmarried personnel are assigned to regular barracks while married 
people and families live in military housing the biggest complaint 
is lack of privacy 
civilians especially were reluctant to move one civilian 
employee of the army who spoke on condition of anonymity said they 
did not see the reason for it since this was not a war zone 
however there were 55 reports of harassment by panamanian 
authorities in may and six in june they included the detention of 
us military personnel who were questioned by police in panama city 
for alleged petty offenses and then released 
the mass move also disappointed some panamanians who profited 
from the american presence offbase 
it is going to be hard to rent those apartments again soon 
said a superintendent of one 34unit apartment building it was 
leased early this year by the southern command for its servicemen 
and employees 
a real estate agent who like the superintendent spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the building owners went into debt to 
finance improvements special water tanks air conditioning 
security as conditions for a contract with the us military 
they thought they were looking at longterm contracts the 
agent said 
the americans were paying 15 million a year in rents alone in 
panama their rent and the other money they spent helped keep this 
countrys economy barely afloat after more than a year of us 
economic sanctions imposed following noriegas indictment 
panama was a leading international financial center with about 
120 banks holding an estimated 30 billion in assets 
a flight of capital caused by the more than yearlong political 
struggle over noriegas rule has reduced assets to about 8 billion 
according to government figures 
opposition leaders say unemployment last year more than doubled 
to 23 percent 
in march acting president manuel solis palma said usimposed 
sanctions which barred payments to the government caused a 20 
percent drop in the gross national product in 1988 
a total of 12000 us military personnel are on duty in the 
southern commands 10 army navy and air force installations in this 
country the troops include 2000 sent in may by president bush to 
protect us interests after the election

about 35 soldiers in the israeli army commit 
suicide each year the head of the armys personnel department said 
in a newspaper interview published sunday 
thirtytwo soldiers committed suicide from april 1988 to april 
1989 maj gen matan vilnai told the daily haaretz the military 
command confirmed the figures 
vilnais interview was a departure from the militarys customary 
reluctance to provide such data which could have a negative effect 
on soldiers morale 
no figures on attempted suicides were given the newspaper and 
army said the average of 35 suicides was for recent years but they 
did not say which years 
neither vilnai nor the military command knew if any of the 
suicides were related to the 18monthold palestinian uprising 
against israeli rule in the occupied gaza strip and west bank 
vilnai said 30 percent of those who killed themselves were 
reservists troubled by family and financial problems they are 
pushed into the act by the availability of weapons and the hope that 
relatives will get financial compensation from the army he said 
israeli men are drafted at the age of 18 for a threeyear period 
of regular duty and serve up to 40 days a year as reservists until 
age 55 women are drafted for two years of regular service and some 
of them are required to serve as reservists afterward 
the tel avivbased jaffee center for strategic studies says 
israel has a 170000strong standing army and 370000 reserves 
vilnai said an average of two to three female soldiers commit 
suicide every year he said most of the regular soldiers who have 
killed themselves did so during the first year of their military 
duty 
haaretz said the armys personnel department recently issued 
instructions on how to spot troubled soldiers to prevent suicides 
however the paper said this activity is quite limited since it 
is feared that dealing with the question of suicide may in fact 
increase the number of suicides

latin jazz night has become a fixture at the 
annual jvc jazz festival and saturday nights edition provided a 
fine crosssection of jazz salsa and entertaining combinations of 
the two 
the headliners were the fania six allstar musicians from puerto 
rico they were preceded by flutist herbie mann whose 35year 
career has been on the rise during the last few years since he 
formed the brazilian group brasil jazz 
the evening was opened and nearly stolen by the fiery 
dominican jazz pianist michel camilo the crowded bill limited 
camilos set to about half an hour but in that time he generated 
enough energy to light a town of 10000 for a week 
camilos command of the piano is unlike anything else heard in 
jazz he is a consummate technician yet he keeps his technique 
under the tightest control never allowing it to outrun his musical 
ideas 
he played only his own compositions taken from his latest album 
the tunes revealed him to be a composer of considerable depth and 
inventiveness particularly in the beautiful ballad nostalgia 
he introduced as his special guest paquito drivera in whose 
group camilo first came to prominence the two have recorded 
together but no longer tour together but they havent lost their 
rapport drivera was ready to match camilos fireworks 
herbie manns group was a disappointment but that may not have 
been entirely his fault the restraint and sophistication of manns 
brazilianinflected group was a poor choice to follow camilo 
although mann is the bigger name he should have opened for camilo 
his second problem was a poorly adjusted sound system the bass 
critical for the rhythmic sway of brazilian music was inaudible 
through much of manns set 
he repeatedly indicated to offstage technicians that he couldnt 
hear himself play but the problem apparently was never corrected 
his special guest was dave valentin a flutist who mann recalled 
encouraging when valentin was 16 despite the sound problems 
valentins arrival on stage gave manns group some needed energy 
and it became clear that the group had not been at its best 
the highlight of the evening was the last set by the fania six a 
group of puerto rican musicians some of them based in new york 
associated with the fania record label they are johnny pacheco on 
flute and vocals ray barretto on congas papo lucca on piano bobby 
valentin on bass robert roena on bongos and nicky marrero on 
timbales 
this was classic salsa they rhythms were irresistible the 
melodies engaging and the solos impressive pacheco made part of the 
set into a flute extravaganza when he invited valentin and mann on 
stage 
the three flutists played off one another reaching peaks they 
couldnt have scaled alone it was one of those special moments that 
can occur in jazz festivals in which artists who dont normally 
perform together are suddenly thrust on stage at the same time

about 5000 protesters also massed at the airport and about 1000 
mostly western residents held their own rally in support of the 
protesters 
the military crackdown on prodemocracy student protesters in 
china has caused much apprehension in this british colony which is 
to revert to chinese rule in 1997 
last week the foreign affairs select committee of britains 
house of commons rejected a proposal to allow british passport 
holders in hong kong to emigrate to britain about 35 million of 
hong kongs 57 million people hold british passports 
hong kong citizens believe that beijing cannot be trusted to live 
up to its promise to keep hong kongs capitalist system intact for 
50 years after 1997 
in brief remarks upon his arrival howe did not raise the issue 
of mass immigration from hong kong he said he had come here to 
reaffirm british determination to secure a democratic and 
prosperous future for hong kong 
you have no stauncher friend than britain he said 
the whole world has condemned the violence and repression weve 
all witnessed in china over the last few weeks he added 
nowhere has that view been more vigorously expressed than in 
britain and in hong kong you feel threatened and beleaguered by 
what has happened so thats why im here 
howe said the british government believed that the 1984 
britishchinese agreement to return hong kong to china still 
provides the right foundations for the future 
at the airport demonstration leaders gave howes personal 
secretary a petition with about 600000 signatures pressing for the 
right to emigrate to britain 
the protest organizer the rev lo lung kwong said demonstrators 
were extremely dissatisfied that howe did not accept the 
petition himself 
we feel that he does not seem to have the courage to face the 
hong kong people personally he said 
earlier about 1000 westerners gathered in central hong kong to 
protest howes visit 
ive lived here for about 12 years and i consider hong kong 
home said gasper jones a british businessman who came to the 
rally with his two sons both born in hong kong london is selling 
these people down the river if they dont act and act fast hong 
kong as a trading center as a financial center is finished all 
the bright people in my company have left or are leaving 
another 10000 people marched through hong kong to the government 
house carrying signs that read howe can you sleep at night 
and end to british honor 
i fled the communists in vietnam in 1975 said lee ho fat a

these hooligans in beijing and ask myself am i going to have to

mikhail gorbachevs visit to paris this week will 
include a trip to the bastille and talks with president francois 
mitterrand that likely will cover frances unwillingness to discuss 
reducing its nuclear force 
the trip comes one week before france celebrates the bicentennial 
of the french revolution and plays host to a summit of the seven 
major western industrialized nations it will include a visit to 
strasbourg where the soviet president will address the council of 
europe 
gorbachev who arrives tuesday will be the first leader from the 
east bloc to speak at the council he is expected to define more 
precisely the european role of a soviet union that has strived to 
restructure its economy 
a very important political declaration from the soviet 
leadership to the european public and political leaders on the 
subject of a common european house will be the thrust of the 
speech said andrei grachev deputy chief of the communist partys 
international department speaking to reporters at a briefing friday 
the common european home an idea first expressed during 
gorbachevs visit to france in 1985 has been a vague concept in 
soviet diplomacy as the kremlin seeks to improve relations with its 
western european neighbors the term implies an end to the cold war 
and a change in soviet foreign policy 
gorbachev is expected to use his speech to spell out the kind of 
cooperation the soviets are looking for in human rights 
environmental protection culture and the battle against terrorism 
in talks with mitterrand on tuesday and wednesday gorbachev is 
likely to bring up once again frances own nuclear arsenal which 
the soviets see as an adjunct of the us nuclear force 
during his last visit gorbachev made sweeping arms control 
proposals that later were the basis for ussoviet disarmament 
negotiations but he failed to bring mitterrand into separate talks 
on reducing frances independent nuclear force 
the french socialist president told gorbachev then that it was 
not reasonable to think that there could actually be 
negotiations 
a spokesman for the presidential palace said friday that 
mitterrand would like to discuss chemical weapons with his soviet 
counterpart as well as regional conflicts such as lebanon and 
cambodia 
the french president also would like to see a reversal in the 
trade deficit with the soviet union 318 million in the first 
three months of this year compared to 773 million for all of 1988 
in 1988 the main soviet exports to france were oil and gas while 
france imported primarily machinery and equipment 
gorbachev also plans to tour the place de la bastille on tuesday 
where on july 14 1789 workers stormed a prison fortress unleashing 
events that led to the french revolution 
on wednesday he will sign a series of sovietfrench agreements 
and have meetings with mayor jacques chirac premier michel rocard 
and then with students and intellectuals at the sorbonne university 
gorbachev will meet with mitterrand again thursday before leaving 
for strasbourg 
the visit to france which took over the rotating chairmanship of 
the european economic community on july 1 is not expected to break 
new ground in frenchsoviet relations nor will the 58yearold 
soviet leader find the french as effusive as the west germans who 
thronged his stops during his visit there last month 
still polls show gorbachev to be far more popular with the 
french than president bush the paris matchbva poll last week 
showed gorbachev inspired confidence in 60 percent of 1000 french 
people surveyed while only 51 percent felt the same about bush 
he is more charismatic than bush and better known said 
dominique moisi of the french institute for international relations 
but the french expect much less of him than the west germans 
and they are more skeptical of the soviet union besides french 
crowds simply tend to be less demonstrative than german ones

the late soviet leader nikita khrushchev was quick 
to denounce his colleagues as disloyal during the stalinist purges 
of the 1930s a soviet newspaper reported sunday 
we need to destroy those scoundrels sovietskaya rossia 
quoted khrushchev as saying at the 1937 conference of the moscow 
communist party organization while destroying one two or 10 we 
are doing the deed on behalf of millions 
we should step over the dead bodies of our enemies for the sake 
of the people 
the article was based on previously closed archives and written 
by historian a ponomarev assistant director of the history 
institute of the moscow communist party 
khrushchev who rose to lead the soviet union from 1953 to 1964 
published his memoirs in the west but glossed over his role in the 
purges of his predecessor josef stalin who killed millions of 
soviets in consolidating his control excerpts from khrushchevs 
autobiography were published in the soviet union this year 
the newspaper report indicated that khrushchev rose by joining in 
stalins accusations of disloyalty 
he was part of a new group whose members were more loyal to 
stalin who entered the leadership due to their active fight 
against rightists wrote ponomarev 
when khrushchev moved up to ukrainian party leader he had words 
of praise for his successor ai igarov the article said but 
within months igarov was being blamed for mistakes and khrushchev 
joined the chorus according to the report 
this time khrushchev spoke of him as an old enemy hired by 
trotskyites and rightists who had been involved in hostile actions 
in leningrad and moscow ponomarev wrote 
lev trotsky was a bolshevik rival who was denounced by stalin 
forced into exile and eventually assassinated in mexico thousands 
of soviets were put to death on charges of conspiring with trotsky 
against the soviet leadership 
in the early years of stalins attacks on his colleagues 
khrushchev was party chief of a workers school called 
promakademiya the article said that as soon as khrushchev took the 
post in 1930 40 communists were hauled before the party leadership 
to answer questions on their loyalty 
the newspaper also said khrushchev was one of the first to accuse 
nikolas bukharin a member of the ruling politburo in the 1920s who 
was ousted by stalin in 1929 in fact khrushchev had to retract his 
early criticism after the party newspaper pravda published a letter 
praising bukharin the article said 
later the tide turned against bukharin and he was executed in 
1938

the united church of christ a 
progressive denomination with roots in the earliest american 
colonies is struggling to end a 10year battle over whether its 
national offices should leave new york city 
the 703 delegates of the denominations 17th general synod hoped 
to decide monday whether to combine its national offices now 
scattered in three new york city locations in a single new york 
location or move them to cleveland 
synod delegates will also elect a new president on monday one of 
the candidates is a woman who if elected would become the first 
woman president of a major protestant group in the united states 
leaders of the 32yearold 18 millionmember denomination 
expected the synod to handily approve a study committees 
recommendation to move the headquarters denomination to cleveland 
presbyterian and lutheran denominations involved in mergers also 
have moved from the city in recent years 
but after four days of meetings the synod has become sharply 
divided over whether the cost savings available in cleveland are 
worth losing some ecumenical ties in new york 
those favoring new york wear apple stickers on their name tags 
delegates favoring cleveland wear a sailboat 
most people feel that there are some compelling arguments on 
either side said the rev reiss potterveld senior minister at 
congregational church of northridge calif near los angeles 
potterveld chairs the 33member committee that for nearly seven 
hours on saturday reviewed the earlier committees study of the 
issue his committee set up mondays decision by endorsing the 
cleveland proposal 2110 with two abstentions 
the uccs last national meeting in 1987 rejected a 
recommendation to move the headquarters to st louis ordering the 
formation of a study committee instead 
people are sick of this the uccs evan golder said adding 
that another deferral is unlikely the headquarters debate has raged 
for 10 years he said since the denomination was forced by a 
landlords decision and the new york rental market to split its 
offices 
no poll of the full delegation had been taken on the issue but a 
proposal already on the synod floor would scrap the committees 
recommendation and move two of the new york ucc offices to the third 
office at the interchurch center which houses 65 church and other 
nonprofit organizations 
the ohio delegation more than 70 people is the synods largest 
and its leaders have lobbied hard for a move to cleveland 
particularly among large delegations from nearby states 
critics say a move from new york would diminish the uccs 
standing in the ecumenical community 
this church has a historic and strong involvement in the 
ecumenical movement potterveld said this move will put certain 
hardships on that both committees recognize that it ecumenism is 
part of our heritage and will continue to be part of our future 
but not all agree the uccs ecumenical efforts are best served in 
new york and supporters of the move to cleveland say it would save 
millions in rent and other costs and bridge a symbolic gap between 
the national and local church 
the nominees for president of the denomination are the rev paul 
h sherry of chicago and the rev yvonne delk of union city nj if 
delk wins she would be the first woman president of the united 
church of christ or other major protestant denomination 
the president of the ucc is the denominations senior minister 
chief executive and its official representative in ecumenical 
relations while the president has no doctrinal or authoritarian 
power over the denominations members the position is widely viewed 
as an important theological platform 
the denomination formed in the 1957 merger of the congregational 
christian churches and the evangelical and reformed church it is 
unrelated to the church of christ a loosely associated group of 
conservative churches

new york over the weekend became the first state 
to limit the grueling work hours of interns and residents to reduce 
the risk of error by dazed and exhausted doctorsintraining 
new york which trains 16 percent of the nations doctors is 
leading a national movement away from the centuryold tradition of 
36hour shifts and 100hour work weeks for postgraduate trainees in 
medicine the health department now limits shifts to 24 hours and 
the work week to 80 hours 
several hospitals in the city had already implemented the 24hour 
rules and a medical council is preparing guidelines that will be 
enforceable nationwide 
long hours have been a rite of passage for years and years 
said dr joseph sachter chief emergency room resident at 
metropolitan hospital in new york city but theres been an 
astonishing change in two years 
proponents of the tradition say shunning sleep toughens young 
doctors to the rigors of medicine and lets them study the 
progression of a patients illness critics say blearyeyed 
residents endanger patients and can even kill them 
you come in pretty blind in july and august its no secret 
the mortality rates are the highest when the interns are brand new 
you dont know whats going on even with an enormous amount of 
direction said a 33yearold new york city intern who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
state health commissioner dr david axelrod said todays doctors 
must learn more than their predecessors make more decisions and 
treat sicker patients 
is it ideal if a resident works 24 hours no but its a lot 
better than 36 hours at a time said sachter 
the hospital association of new york state and blue cross backed 
by the state medical society have sued to block the regulations 
charging they will be too costly the hospital industry estimates 
4500 to 5000 workers must be hired statewide to implement the plan 
a health department study of hospitals with high mortality rates 
raised serious questions about the quality of supervision and the 
dangers posed by resident fatigue axelrod appointed a panel to 
address the issue after the 1984 death of the daughter of 
authorlawyer sidney zion 
libby zion 18 died after going to new york hospital for 
treatment of an earache and fever a grand jury while indicting no 
one found ms zions death resulted from inadequate care and errors 
by unsupervised interns and residents 
we have a sense that there are problems related to fatigue but 
its harder to attribute a poor decision to fatigue and much easier 
to determine that supervision was not present said health 
department spokeswoman faith schottenfeld 
in february drs dennis h novack and david b reuben of rhode 
island hospital described fatigueinduced mistakes in a letter to 
the journal of the american medical association 
they told of a gettogether where residents admitted giving the 
wrong antibiotic overlooking diagnoses mistranscribing orders and 
falling asleep while writing up a history 
but traditions die hard 
when axelrod and dr bertrand bell professor at albert einstein 
college of medicine started pressing for reform in 1987 they were 
lambasted and torn apart by the new york medical establishment 
said sachter 
older physicians say i did it theyre going to do it i 
think were coddling these kids axelrod said in a may speech 
our elders dont recognize that medicine has changed 
the chicagobased accreditation council for graduate medical 
education the accreditation body for all teaching hospitals in the 
united states is about to issue work limits for some specialties 
and strengthen supervision for all of them 
the guidelines will be phased in as each hospital comes up for 
accreditation over the next three or four years said james 
weinlader director of residence review committee activities 
critics say hospitals rely on residents for cheap labor they 
earn about 30000 a year which comes to 625 an hour for a 
100hour week costs are a big concern to the new york hospital 
association which says twothirds of the 220 nonprofit or public 
hospitals it represents lost money in 1988 
the health department has granted hospitals 226 million in 
reimbursements for more staff to take over some jobs previously done 
by interns and residents the hospital association says its members 
need 149 million more 
as for enforcement of the regulations the health department will 
be satisfied for now with a goodfaith effort said schottenfeld

sometime monday night or early tuesday robert 
merry will retrieve old nancy from her secret hiding place and 
take her to the town common in rowley about 30 miles north of 
boston 
there the 1200pound revolutionary warera cannon will be fired 
just twice on independence day before ging back in hiding for 
another year a precaution merry says is necessary to keep the 
militiamen in neighboring georgetown from stealing her 
we only move her under cover of darkness said merry 45 who 
holds the honorary post of town cannoneer we have to be very 
careful because of the neighbors they send spies out once in a 
while 
horsefeathers replied alan aulson a member of georgetowns 
board of selectmen 
we already have the real nancy said aulson 41 if you go 
down to the georgetown town hall youll see her right there 
mounted on a block so the guys from rowley cant take her 
as for rowleys fat old muzzleloader aulson said they put a 
few firecrackers in it and they make a nice bang but that doesnt 
make it real 
the annual cannon fusillade between rowley and georgetown in 
which sarcasm and subterfuge long ago replaced black powder and 
shot has been a fourth of july tradition for more than 100 years 
it all started in 1775 when a colonial raider capt john 
manley captured the british frigate nancy off the massachusetts 
coast and rowleys militiamen were assigned to guard the ships 
cannon 
in 1839 the town of new rowley now georgetown seceded from 
rowley and ownership of the cannon came in dispute 
according to one local legend the rowley militia hid it in the 
rowley river which kept it out of the hands of the upstarts from 
new rowley but somehow ruined its ability to shoot 
another legend has it that a clever georgetown carpenter 
fashioned a fake cannon out of wood in 1877 after old nancy had 
been stolen back and forth several times 
merry says the georgetown militia probably had some kind of 
devilment in mind such as switching the cannons and making off with 
the real one but the plot was foiled when an observant rowley 
resident noticed that georgetowns horsedrawn artillery carriage 
wasnt sinking very deep in the mud 
he just walked over and stuck his jacknife in the barrel of the 
cannon and that was the end of that merry said 
today both rowley and georgetown have iron cannon georgetown 
claims its cannon cant be fired because its the original the one 
that came out of the rowley river 
merry replies that having a nonfiring cannon is the price you 
pay for cheap imitations acquired at some topsfield yard sale 
both towns are celebrating important anniversaries this year 
rowley which has 3900 inhabitants is turning 350 georgetown 
with 5700 residents turns 150 
neither side expects the dispute over old nancy to be resolved 
anytime soon 
i sure hope not said merry if it did it would just be an 
old cannon

mary hatwood futrell urged americas teachers 
to embrace change and remember her as having chalk dust on the 
sleeves of her soul in an emotional farewell speech sunday to the 
national education association 
futrell president of the 2millionmember union for the past six 
years steps down at the end of the summer a vote on her successor 
was scheduled monday at the annual nea representative assembly 
attended by some 8400 delegates 
futrell is widely credited with bringing the nea into the thick 
of education reform and helping it shed an obstructionist image 
fueled by attacks by president reagan and other conservatives in the 
past decade 
in a 17page speech interrupted more than 60 times by applause 
cheers and standing ovations futrell exhorted her members not only 
to participate in but to lead the education reform movement 
we need massive systemwide restructuring and the plan we 
follow must be a plan conceived written and implemented by the 
educators of america she said we have the programs we have 
the organizational expertise to use our collective bargaining power 
to impact areas that go far beyond the issue of salary as critical 
as that issue is and always will be 
futrell said nea must continue to say no to the voucher 
salesmen to the tuition tax credit peddlers to the elitists the 
politically ambitious and the educationally inexperienced all 
those who think they know our business better than we do 
but she also urged the organization once labeled the status 
quo incarnate by former education secretary william bennett not 
to stand in the path of worthwhile reforms 
we must embrace change and reject reaction she said we 
must continue to expand politically and professionally as we have 
over the last 20 years especially the last five years we must 
push hard we must take risks we must never let up 
futrell an alexandria va resident who has not ruled out an 
eventual run for congress took some parting shots at reagan and 
also at president bush 
bush declined both a preelection candidate interview with the 
group and an invitation to speak this weekend at its meeting about 
onethird of the union consists of registered republicans according 
to futrell 
weve had enough of leaders who whittle away at our schools 
then complain that the foundation of education is crumbling 
futrell said weve had enough of leaders who think education 
policy is having their picture taken in a first grade class just in 
time for the nightly news 
the departing union chief reiterated nea calls for full funding 
of national education health and nutrition programs for 
disadvantaged children and dismissed conservative criticism of the 
group as having a cash register mentality 
the bankers dont apologize for saying they need more 
money she said referring to the savings and loan crisis the 
generals dont apologize and were not going to apologize either 
futrell touched on gun control homelessness the global economy 
negative campaigning and other broad issues in the course of her 
speech but ended on a personal note that brought her a lengthy 
standing ovation 
i am still mary the teacher who 20 years ago sat where you are 
sitting and i am still a teacher and i always shall be she said 
so my dear friends if you remember me i want you to remember me 
as mary hatwood futrell someone who has chalk dust on the sleeves 
of her soul 
the two men vying to succeed futrell are vice president keith 
geiger of michigan and executive committee member john wilson of 
north carolina geiger is generally considered more moderate and 
more likely to continue on the course set by futrell

more than 200 relatives of 
people killed when a us warship shot down an iranian airliner a 
year ago have sued the makers of the ships radar system a 
spokesman said sunday 
nagib ghafoor said the suit was filed june 28 in us district 
court in san francisco on behalf of relatives of 83 of the 290 
victims 
the announcement of the lawsuit came on the eve of the july 3 
anniversary of the 1988 tragedy when an iran air airbus was shot 
down by the uss vincennes in the persian gulf 
vincennes crew members said they mistook the airliner for an 
iranian f14 fighter coming in to attack 
the jetliner was on a commercial flight from the iranian city of 
bandar abbas where a large air base is located to dubai in the 
southern united arab emirates 
ghafoor said the lawsuit was filed against the general electric 
corp and other entities which designed and manufactured the radar 
equipment on board the uss vincennes 
ge is based in fairfield conn the company has not seen the 
suit yet so its inappropriate to comment said jack batty a 
company spokesman 
most of the passengers aboard the illfated airbus were iranians 
pentagon analysts have said splitsecond decisions aboard the 
vincennes were affected by the inability of radar operators to 
immediately match the planes radar trace with digital direction 
altitude and speed information displayed on another screen 
ghafoor said the complaint charged that the radar equipment 
indicated the aircraft approaching the vincennes was an f14 diving 
in an attack mode at an altitude of 4000 feet rather than the iran 
air flight which was climbing 
he said claims against the united states on behalf of the 
families are in the process of being filed as well 
the iranian government has been seeking a world court verdict 
against the united states and demanded financial compensation for 
the 290 dead 
he did not mention any figure for the compensation sought but 
said the group would be guided by the amount of compensation the 
iraqi government paid the families of american sailors killed in an 
iraqi air strike on the us frigate stark in the persian gulf on 
may 16 1987 
the iraqis said the ship was hit because the pilot of a mirage 
fighterbomber mistook it for an iranian warship 
iraq has agreed to pay 273 million to the families of 37 us 
crewmen killed aboard the stark meaning each family would receive 
around 740000 
the united states had asked for 296 million for the families 
along with an unspecified amount for 21 sailors wounded in the 
incident

wind for money and treats her almost like shes the baby 
sitter his brother says 
jim hurt speaking in the july 10 issue of people magazine said 
hurt and jennings were foolish in the way they went about having a 
child the couple has a 6yearold son alex 
and that led to disaster i see it as a tragedy said the 
actors younger brother 
in the long run yes he took care of them financially jim 
hurt said but he always kept sandra guessing as to when the 
payment would come in this attitude of keeping her twisting in the 
wind is what did most of the damage sandra was never a 
golddigger 
jennings is suing hurt in manhattan charging she was his 
commonlaw wife and entitled to half his earnings since 1982 the 
couple who split in 1983 were never married but lived together for 
several years including a few weeks in south carolina which 
recognizes commonlaw marriages 
the enmity between the pair may be the result of old wounds from 
those days jim hurt said 
if sandras relationship with bill had been healthier if hed 
shown her more courtesy over the years then there wouldnt be such 
bitterness now he treats her almost like shes the baby sitter

a place like lincoln

as wretched as new york has gotten in so many ways cavett 
said i still get a thrill every time i cross one of the bridges 
and see the skyline i think god i love being in the midst of all 
this 
but then on the other hand being in the midst of it i dont

an unprecedented statewide crackdown 
by 1000 officers ended early sunday with nearly 2200 people 
arrested on charges of using or dealing crack many suspects were 
back on the street within hours 
operation rock pile also seized more than 3000 rocks of the 
purified form of cocaine generally sold in peasized amounts that 
are smoked in a pipe 
many suspects were arrested by officers posing as dealers others 
were captured in raids and dramatic foot chases 
its gone way above our expectations said broward county 
sheriff nick navarro coordinator of the sweep 
at some points saturday night authorities took in suspects at a 
rate of 100 an hour with more than a third of the arrests in urban 
southern florida more than 400 arrests took place in the mostly 
rural western panhandle 
it shows that crack is not just an urban problem said 
broward sheriffs spokesman al gordon we arrested people ranging 
from inner cities to the country from kids to very mature adults 
among those arrested was bessie hardin 59 and her son ot 
nelson both of kissimmee she had 11 grams of cocaine in her 
underwear said osceola county sheriffs lt rick drew her son 
had 3 grams on him 
the 48hour effort described as the largest single antidrug 
campaign in the nation targeted streetlevel users and dealers the 
people who keep the big distributors in business said george 
crolius a broward sheriffs spokesman 
many of the suspects were charged with cocaine possession or 
sale and then used bail bondsmen to post 5000 to 10000 bail 
im just walking one out right after another said an 
orlandoarea bondsman who spoke on condition he not be identified 
for me the drug bust is great 
in orlandos poor winwood community some doubted whether the 
marathon drug bust would make a difference 
no way said one dealer clutching a plastic bag of crack 
no way is it going to help 
one night wont do it but if they keep doing what theyve 
been doing it will help a lot said althea shaw a 33yearold 
resident 
the tactics used in the sweep particularly undercover stings 
raised concern with the florida chapter of the american civil 
liberties union 
anytime you have reverse stings with police used as a lure for 
drug users youre entering a very sensitive area said aclu 
counsel charleen carres the aclu is in favor of battling drugs 
but we dont feel peoples rights should be violated in the rush to 
stop drug traffic 
three undercover patrolmen suffered minor injuries in broward 
county after their car was rammed by a vehicle driven by a suspect 
in addition to crack authorities found more than 10 pounds of 
cocaine and three pounds of other drugs including heroin and 
steroids more than 44300 was confiscated and about 300 cars a 
boat and nearly 50 firearms were seized said crolius 
gordon said florida sheriffs plan more such sweeps 
look how much we took in he said it shows these type of 
operations work

president bushs nomination of his chief 
political fundraiser to be us ambassador to luxembourg is in 
deep trouble because of his involvement in the housing and urban 
development scandal senate republican leader bob dole said sunday 
i would guess it may be a while before he goes to luxembourg 
dole said of frederick m bush who is no relation to the president 
but was the finance director for both his 1980 and 1988 presidential 
campaigns 
and if he goes it may just be as a visitor dole quipped 
frederick bush was questioned extensively last thursday and in 
may by the house government operations committee about hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in consultant fees which his lobbying firm 
bush amp co reaped in 1986 and 1987 for hud projects in puerto rico 
in the testimony frederick bush acknowledged he had contacted 
political appointees at hud but said he did not feel that he had 
political influence with them because of his campaign efforts on 
behalf of george bush or his job as deputy director of the vice 
presidents staff from 1982 to 1984 
i made the distinction between what i call political access and 
political influence the 40yearold ambassadordesignate told the 
house panel 
dole interviewed on cbs face the nation program said he 
was not urging the president to withdraw frederick bushs nomination 
ill support the president dole said adding but i think 
youve got to be realistic in this business i dont believe the 
senate foreign relations committee is going to be in any hurry to 
confirm his nomination or to report his nomination favorably

four greenpeace activists jumped into 
the baltic sea on sunday to block the way of the us cruiser 
ticonderoga which the environmental organization said might be 
carrying nuclear weapons 
the warship steamed past the activists and sailed into the 
stockholm harbor 
the cruiser signaled with its horns and police in small boats 
tried to pick our people up from the water but didnt succeed 
greenpeace spokesman magnus furugard said 
two hours earlier police boarded and confiscated the greenpeace 
vessel moby dick and arrested the eight activists on board on 
charges of planning a sabotage action furugard said 
we did not plan anything criminal we carried out a 
demonstration furugard said its a crime to bring in nuclear 
weapons and a crime to spread nuclear weapons 
the swedish government forbids foreign ships to bring nuclear 
weapons into its waters but it assumes that the prohibition will be 
respected and does not question visitors 
the us navy refuses to confirm or deny whether a particular 
ship carries nuclear weapons 
greenpeace announced friday it was planning a peaceful action to 
protest the visit of the cruiser which the organization said 
normally carried nuclear weapons 
the government has failed in its duty to stop the spread of 
nuclear weapons in the world furugard said 
the us ship was scheduled to stay in stockholm two days

a student involved in chinas crushed democracy 
movement looked out over tiananmen square on sunday and mourned what 
he said was the death of his generations campaign for a freer 
society 
it was as if i could see all the people all the tents again 
before my own eyes he said with a wistful smile four weeks to 
the day after soldiers and tanks wrested the square from 
prodemocracy student activists 
it used to be so lively brimming with energy people marching 
here listening to speeches there singing over there he said 
after gazing over the immaculate and empty square from the 
rostrum of tiananmen gate or the gate of heavenly peace it feels 
as though ive died and come back again 
it was four sundays ago that the peoples liberation army blasted 
through hundreds of thousands of unarmed civilians and flattened the 
tent city that had sprung up on tiananmen the heart of the movement 
for democratic reforms 
martial law authorities opened the gate and two parks adjacent to 
it to tourists saturday to mark the 68th anniversary of the founding 
of the chinese communist party 
only a few dozen soldiers with automatic rifles ringed the 
100acre square sunday afternoon the square was scrubbed clean of 
all traces of the hundreds of thousands who crossed it during the 
popular uprising 
the student one of three representatives from his school who 
took part in meetings of the banned beijing autonomous student 
union studies social sciences at a wellknown college in the 
chinese capital he did not want his name used 
he spent many nights in a sleeping bag and then a makeshift tent 
on tiananmen after students began their occupation of it may 13 
now he says he and fellow students are still reeling from the 
violence of june 34 the government says up to 300 died but 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources say up to 3000 
lost their lives 
my classmates who took part in the movement writing posters 
marching at school chanting slogans were completely stunned by 
the outcome he said 
some he said are quietly accepting the government line that 
troops were needed to quell the counterrevolutionary turmoil 
because they want to join the communist party to further their 
careers 
if a man and woman are equally qualified for a job work units 
will want the man but if the woman is a party member theyll want 
her he said it means the person was good in school is in good 
health has the right thoughts and is likely to move ahead in the 
world 
the student said he had been planning to apply for party 
membership this year but scrapped the idea after the crackdown 
i can criticize the student movement given that the results 
were hardly what we wanted but i cant bring myself to trample 
people underfoot thats what you have to do to be a party member 
these days he said 
during the protests which began in midapril i thought it was 
something we must do he said but the result was something that 
should never ever have happened i havent been able to reconcile 
this with myself yet 
we didnt think enough we were very optimistic we were making 
noise being heard we thought we were adding a little democracy to 
our system now people have died 
he thinks the crackdown has beaten student voices into silence 
at least for a few years 
the warm spirit of the students has been crushed they have no 
political energy he said his eyes downcast if anyone 
continues this movement it will be after deng xiaoping dies and it 
wont be my generation of students

a suspected ira car bomb exploded on 
a british military base sunday evening killing a soldier and 
injuring his wife and three children officials said 
the bomb went off as the man opened the door of the car and his 
family waited to get in police said 
the attack in a housing area on the base was the second in two 
weeks on a british installation in west germany 
officials said bomb disposal experts found another explosive 
device in the area and defused it residents in nearby apartment 
buildings were evacuated and police searched for other bombs 
there was no claim of responsibility for the attack but 
officials suspected the irish republican army which is fighting to 
end british rule in northern ireland 
the indications are that this is the kind of attack that can be 
attributed to the ira said hansjuergen foerster a spokesman for 
the federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe 
squadron leader marion yates a spokeswoman for the british 
military in west germany said the explosion occurred in a married 
living quarters area 
we also understand that three children and a woman were taken 
to hospital with injuries she said 
hanover police said the injured were the mans wife and three 
children and that they were were slightly injured in the blast 
the names of the victims were not immediately released police 
and british officials believed the soldier owned the car 
on june 19 a bomb ripped through the living quarters at a 
british military barracks near osnabrueck no one was injured in the 
blast but police suspect the ira was responsible for the attack 
on june 14 west german prosecutors indicted two suspected ira 
members on attempted murder charges in 1987 and 1988 bombing attacks 
aimed at the british military that wounded 46 people most of them 
west germans 
the ira has attacked british troops in europe in its campaign to 
force the british out of northern ireland and unite the 
predominantly protestant province with the mostly roman catholic 
irish republic

parishioners at a roman catholic church held a 
prayer service sunday a week after the church was ordered to close 
but an archdiocese of detroit spokesman said the action was 
understandable 
about 50 members of mother of consolation church held a 45minute 
prayer service said dario guidarini president of the parish 
council it was not a formal mass 
theres no problem with that said archdiocese spokesman jay 
berman im presuming it was something of a spiritual farewell by 
the people who participated 
berman said he didnt know whether any other churches already 
ordered closed or merged held similar services sunday seven of the 
30 targeted parishes closed friday and two more closed saturday 
raising the number closed or merged to 25 the archdiocese said last 
week 
on friday attorneys representing 17 of the 30 churches filed a 
motion to block the closings with the michigan court of appeals the 
court said it would consider the motion no earlier than wednesday 
earlier in the week wayne county circuit judge james hathaway 
denied a request to block some of the closings saying civil courts 
had no jurisdiction over internal church policy 
appeals to the vatican to overrule cardinal edmund szoka who 
ordered the closings and mergers last fall also have been rejected 
the church cites declining membership a shortage of priests and the 
costs of maintaining the large churches 
at least one of the churches have already been sold to a 
protestant congregation 
guidarini said he believed church members would comply with a 
court decision upholding the archdioceses order 
well talk but if the appeals court rules against the people 
we probably will surrender the key he said

authorities worked sunday to locate relatives of 
the last victim to be identified among the four people killed when 
an explosion and fire tore through the midsection of a 10story 
office building 
investigators said sunday that the woman in her early 30s was 
identified saturday night by her boss as a secretary for dams 
inc a construction consulting company her name was withheld until 
her family could be notified 
a total of 23 people were injured in fridays blaze as of 
sunday nine remained hospitalized with two in serious condition 
including a woman who leaped from a sixthfloor window and broke her 
legs and an ankle whose condition earlier had been critical

when an electrical worker was changing a fuse triggered the blaze 
friday much of the building was evacuated quickly but a number of 
workers were trapped and broke out windows to escape choking plumes 
of smoke 
fire officials focused their investigation saturday on whether 
extensive electrical work being done in the building played a role 
in the fire and whether some of that work violated city codes 
acting fire chief tom perrin said those who died could have been 
saved had a sprinkler system been installed in the 10story 
building which was built in 1962 before city codes required 
sprinklers in buildings more than eight stories tall 
the building is managed by american management co of torrance 
calif harry komsky vice president of the company said saturday 
that an investigation would begin into the fire he would not 
comment on the lack of sprinklers

an ancient spanish sword found on a farm in 
northwestern georgia belongs to the three artifact hunters who dug 
it up not the owner of the farm because he waited too long to claim 
it a judge has ruled 
floyd county superior court judge larry salmon ordered that the 
sword be returned to the three men who dug it up on john dickeys 
land on the coosa river in 1982 without dickeys knowledge or 
permission 
studies indicate the sword was taken to a coosa indian village at 
the site during the spanish explorations of hernando de soto in 1540 
or during a later spanish expedition in 1560 the village was 
attacked in the mid16th century and many of the people were killed 
by metal weapons 
research indicates the sword was made in spain between 1520 and 
1540 and it is an important link establishing that spaniards came 
through floyd county in the 16th century dickey said 
its going to be a shame if goes somewhere else he said 
according to the court order filed friday dickey waited too long 
before claiming the sword which had been loaned to the staterun 
etowah mounds archaeological museum he did not claim ownership 
until 1987 after a fouryear statute of limitations had run out 
dickey said sunday he did not try to get the sword known as de 
sotos sword back sooner because university of georgia 
archaeologists assured him they were pursuing ownership for the 
state

three barricaded nuns who fled their morris 
township monastery after a nearly ninemonth standoff are in hiding 
but will continue their protest against liberalizations of their 
order a relative said sunday 
one of the carmelite nuns remained locked in the monasterys 
infirmary on sunday refusing to leave 
theyre not giving up said anne ercolano mother of sister 
maria one of those who abandoned the monastery early saturday 
morning 
they left because they want to protect their vows ms 
ercolano said in a telephone interview sunday from her home in 
castleton ny they plan on keeping their appeal going as long as 
it takes to set things straight 
the four nuns had been barricaded in the infirmary of the 
monastery of the most blessed mary of mount carmel since oct 4 
when their protest shattered the calm behind the buildings 
whitestone walls and drew international attention 
the carmelite order teaches solitude and prayer with a strict 
adherence to separation from the outside world the rebel nuns have 
said they took refuge in the infirmary because they feared eviction 
by their mother superior prioress teresa hewitt for speaking out 
against liberalizations she introduced such as television and sweets 
during the first days of the protest mother hewitt held news 
conferences from behind iron bars denouncing the unruly members of 
her flock for attempted anarchy repeated calls to her telephone 
number sunday got only a busy signal 
the separation took its emotional and physical toll on the 
protesters ms ercolano said and led them to leave the infirmary 
for more comfortable surroundings while the fight continues she 
refused to say where her daughter and the other nuns have gone 
theyre getting fresh air and for once theyre getting some 
peace and quiet ms ercolano said they dont want to be 
bothered they just want the case to go forward 
the nuns have said they have an appeal before the apostolica 
signatura the highest court at the vatican lower arms of the 
vatican have twice ordered the nuns to end the protest but they 
refused and promised to continue protesting until hearing from the 
apostolica signatura 
paterson diocese spokesman tim manning said the diocese was to 
serve them notice monday that if they did not leave proceedings 
would begin to remove them from the order 
that needs to be reevaluated before the diocese decides the 
next move manning said there are regulations within the order 
forbidding the nuns to leave the monastery for any reason with very 
few exceptions and those regulations will have to be reviewed too 
betty sutton a lay person who has served as a spokeswoman for 
the nuns said she did not know they were leaving or where they are 
ive noticed a change in their attitude in the last month as 
if somebody was in contact with them who theyve been listening 
to mrs sutton said 
the nuns had been questioning their own tactics in the past few 
weeks after adamantly believing they were doing the right thing 
mrs sutton said 
they thought their protest remained valid even when a letter from 
the vatican ordered them out of the infirmary she said 
five nuns began the protest in october sisters john of the 
cross philomena bernadette maria and teresita 
sister john now nicole prescott returned to her hillside home 
in march citing health reasons 
sister teresita remained in the infirmary 
ms ercolano said sister teresita did not think the nuns should 
have left because she felt the monastery was their home 
manning said he did not know what would happen with sister 
teresita that would be part of a review set for monday he said

attorney general dick thornburgh said sunday he 
has directed the justice department to compile a list of federal 
prisoners convicted of burning the us flag in anticipation that 
they will be freed under a recent supreme court decision 
if some one is entitled to relief then all are entitled to 
relief thornburgh said referring to the courts 54 decision in 
a texas case in which the court said flag burning is a 
constitutionally protected form of political protest 
however he said he doubted that more than a handful of 
federal prisoners are involved 
thornburgh made the comments on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley in response to a question about carlos mendozalugo a 
puerto rican nationalist now at the us penitentiary in atlanta 
mendozalugo who was given a oneyear prison sentence after 
pleading guilty to a federal charge of flag desecration last week 
filed a petition in us district court for his release 
my expectation is that he probably will be entitled to that 
relief thornburgh said of mendozalugo who burned a us flag 
two years ago in front of a us post office as a protest for puerto 
rican independence 
the courts striking down the texas statute in all likelihood 
would encompass the federal statute that was passed at the time of 
the flagburning demonstrations during the vietnam war the 
attorney general said

an 11yearold californian flying around the world 
touched down on sunday in kuibyshev a city that foreigners have 
been forbidden to enter for more than four decades tass reported 
kuibyshev which lies on the volga river about 450 miles 
southeast of moscow is one of many soviet cities closed to 
foreigners because defenserelated industries are located there 
we would be happy if our visit to your city opened the doors 
for all foreigners the pilots father gary aliengena was quoted 
as saying by the soviet news agency 
the elder aliengena is accompanying his son tony aboard the 
cessna 210 
tass said kuibyshev has been closed since world war ii when 
defense industries were evacuated there from the western part of 
the soviet union which was then under nazi german occupation 
for the last 60 years only one foreign aircraft has landed in 
this region without special permission tass said that was a 
fascist bomber which in october 1942 tried to destroy a 
strategic bridge across the volga it was shot down 
the area may be opened to foreigners because many of its defense 
industries are being converted to the production of civilian goods 
such as furniture sporting equipment and disposable syringes tass 
said 
soviet reporters in kuibyshev asked the young aviator a resident 
of san juan capistrano his impressions of the winding volga 
it is very beautiful like the mississippi he was quoted as 
saying 
tony began learning to fly at the age of 4 and became the 
youngest person to solo by flying an ultralight aircraft at age 9 on 
march 13 1988 
this 47day 19000mile flight dubbed friendship flight 89

gorbachev during a threeday stop in moscow but he was told

police and troops on sunday 
ringed a village where 11 people were reported killed in a riot 
triggered by citizen protests over being forced to become part of 
the black homeland of bophuthatswana 
residents of the homeland town of leeuwfontein said as many as 
2000 people had been rounded up in a police dragnet a private 
civil rights group said some were being beaten and stoned by police 
seeking vengeance for the clash saturday between security forces and 
residents 
the reports could not be confirmed 
witnesses said the riot erupted after security forces moved in to 
break up an illegal gathering at a local sports field in the 
village of leeuwfontein 150 miles northwest of johannesburg and 
opened fire without warning killing two people and wounding several 
others 
they said an angry mob then attacked a government armored 
vehicle setting it afire with gasoline bombs four of the nine 
officers inside burned to death and five others were killed with 
axes and rocks as they tried to escape the witnesses said 
police confirmed that two people were killed by gunfire but said 
the nine officers were the victims of an unprovoked attack 
although they were described as police the type of vehicle involved 
is normally used by the army forces there 
police and military roadblocks were set up around leeuwfontein a 
town of about 15000 that was incorporated dec 31 into the tribal 
homeland of bophuthatswana over the objections of most of its 
inhabitants 
bophuthatswana is one of nearly a dozen black homelands within 
south africa that the government considers nominally independent 
the homelands are not recognized internationally as separate 
countries and critics say such boundary changes in south africa 
have deprived thousands of people of south african citizenship and 
the job opportunities that go with it 
the homeland system in effect helps south africas black 
population now at 28 million the 5 million whites control the 
economy and dominate the government 
officers were searching for weapons ammunition and other 
equipment taken from security forces during the turmoil the south 
african broadcasting corporation said 
journalists were allowed into the sports field where scorched 
ground and bloody rocks were visible but saw none of the detainees 
that villagers claimed had been rounded up by police in a sweep that 
lasted well into sunday 
observers said the figure of 2000 arrested was probably 
exaggerated mrs joanne yawitch a spokeswoman for the transvaal 
rural action committee trac a private organization said quite 
a lot of people had been detained but could not give any figures 
the south african press association quoted her as saying some of 
those held were gathered into an open space and stoned and beaten 
by the police but did not know if anyone had been killed 
many other people were said by local residents to have fled into 
the thick bush around leeuwfontein some of them making their way 
across the illdefined boundaries to refuge in nearby south african 
black townships 
independent witnesses also confirmed that south african police 
using powerful casspir armored vehicles were taking part in the 
postriot dragnet the south african press association earlier 
quoted a police spokesman lt rw olivier as denying tracs claim 
that south african police were operating in the territory 
bophuthatswana actually seven separate parcels of territory in 
the northcentral part of the country has an estimated population 
of 17 million 
some residents of leeuwfontein have asked south african courts to 
overturn a 1988 government edict that added their town of 15000 
people and neighboring braklaagte with 9000 people to 
bophuthatswana 
braklaagte citizens earlier lost a legal appeal and in march 
police there were accused of beating people who refused to declare 
themselves citizens of bophuthatswana

american pianist van cliburn who warmed the hearts 
of soviet music lovers in the midst of the cold war on sunday 
repeated the spectacular performance of the piano concerto that 
launched his career 31 years ago 
with roses from the audience at his feet cliburn drew bravos and 
even screams sunday night at tchaikovsky hall as he performed 
tchaikovskys piano concerto no 1 
president mikhail s gorbachev and his wife raisa joined in the 
standing ovation and later expressed their enjoyment privately in a 
35minute meeting backstage with the towering 54yearold texan and 
his 92yearold mother 
he played like a god said dallas morning news critic john 
ardoin who flew to moscow to review the performance i dont see 
how anyone under this pressure and much emotion could play like he 
did 
before playing cliburn told the 1500 people packed into the 
oval hall for 31 years i have felt like i had two homes i will 
soon be asking permission from your distinguished president 
gorbachev to buy an apartment in moscow i will be coming for 
muchneeded visits for my music for my soul to russia and to 
moscow 
gorbachev and his wife laughed even before the request for an 
apartment in housingshort moscow was translated into russian but 
cliburn protested mr president i was serious 
cliburn who lives in fort worth texas said after his meeting 
with the gorbachevs that the soviet leader told him he would help 
arrange the apartment 
sunday was cliburns third performance in 11 years he came out 
of retirement to play for the gorbachevs at the white house in 1987 
he will play monday night at the tchaikovsky conservatory on the 
same stage where he triumphed in 1958 
during applause for the tchaikovsky concerto many in the hall 
were briefly stunned when a television light next to the gorbachevs 
box exploded the soviet president calmly leaned out looked at the 
smoking light stand and resumed clapping 
as is typical in the soviet union the concert hall had no air 
conditioning and the heat was oppressive enthusiastic fans crowded 
the aisles while hundreds more waited outside for a glimpse of 
cliburn 
the pianist his waves of hair perfectly coifed despite the heat 
also played liszts piano concerto no 1 in eflat major a debussy 
prelude and the schumannliszt widmung 
one of those in the audience was nake flock who said she heard 
cliburn play in moscow in 1958 when he won the tchaikovsky 
competition for young pianists with his performance of the 
tchaikaovsky concerto 
ms flock said she flew to moscow from her home in leipzig east 
germany and paid 4650 for a concert ticket that had a face value 
of 341 
his technique hasnt changed said ms flock the mother of a 
piano student at the tchaikovsky conservatory but he has become 
more impulsive more sentimental 
some 20 players in the moscow philharmonic orchestra backing him 
were members of the same ensemble 31 years ago that accompanied him 
on the night he won the tchaikovsky competition 
the gorbachevs toasted cliburn with tea apple pie and red wine 
said susan tilley president of the van cliburn foundation in fort 
worth texas who was one of a handful of people allowed into the 
meeting the foundation sponsors an international piano competition 
and concert series 
they said come back any time cliburn said after the meeting

theodore roosevelt 
celebrated in stone on mount rushmore 50 years ago should be 
celebrated today for his environmental spirit interior secretary 
manuel lujan jr said sunday 
were not here just to talk about stewardship of our natural 
resources were here to act lujan told an estimated 4000 to 
5000 people who turned out to commemorate the 50th anniversary of 
the unveiling of roosevelts face on the monument 
as the audience sang along with a military band that played god 
bless america a song introduced at the original dedication of 
roosevelts chiseled face 50 years ago a 90by45foot us flag 
that had been hung on the mountain was drawn back to reveal the 
sculpture once again 
when sculptor gutzon borglum decided roosevelts features would 
be carved next to the 60foottall faces of george washington 
thomas jefferson and abraham lincoln many people wondered if 
roosevelt really belonged with the other presidents on the granite 
mountain 
but lujan and other speakers said roosevelt was a good choice for 
the huge sculpture known as the shrine of democracy because he was a 
president for the common person and a leader in the conservation 
movement 
lujan said president bushs administration is dedicated to 
protecting the environment by reducing acid rain reversing damage 
to the ozone layer restoring wetland nesting areas for waterfowl 
and protecting endangered species 
the administration will work to promote the nations economic 
growth but not at the expense of the environment said the interior 
secretary who played key roles in environmental legislation during 
two decades in congress 
make no mistake about it our commitment to conserving our 
natural resources will never be sacrificed to corporate 
profit he said 
the huge red white and blue flag was not placed in front of the 
sculpture as scheduled at dawn because of wind gusting to 35 mph 
a crew of workers on the mountain raised the 300pound banner for 
the first time at midmorning quickly lowering it because the wind 
was too strong threatening their safety and the flag itself 
the program stayed on schedule as winds dropped and work crews 
hoisted the flag into position during the speeches which were given 
in the ampitheater at the base of mount rushmore 
gov george mickelson said it was fitting that roosevelt was 
honored on the mountain because he traveled extensively in the 
territory that would become the state of south dakota several 
decades before becoming president in 1901 
roosevelt first arrived in the 1880s to hunt and buy ranch land 
in the area that later became north dakota mickelson said 
the governor said roosevelts travels in the west led to his 
later efforts to conserve the nations resources and to place more 
than 100 million acres of forest land into the public trust 
he knew that somehow the hills and forests we love so much 
must be protected for future generations mickelson said

sinhalese extremists sunday stormed a 
crowded festival attended by president ranasinghe premadasa and key 
cabinet members and set off a bomb that killed at least two people 
police said 
premadasa and the cabinet ministers were in a secret wellguarded 
location and were unharmed authorities said thirty people were 
injured many critically 
no one claimed responsibility for the blast which occurred 
shortly after midnight saturday near mahiyangana about 70 miles 
northeast of colombo police blamed the leftwing peoples 
liberation front which opposes tactics used by the government to 
end the insurgency by tamil rebels 
police would not say if the attack was aimed at anyone in 
particular 
it could have been at anybody we dont know said one police 
officer speaking on condition of anonymity 
elsewhere authorities said security forces arrested 3237 youths 
suspected of belonging to the peoples liberation front it was the 
single largest crackdown against the group in nearly two years 
also sunday 18 people were reported killed by sinhalese hit 
squads in central and northern sri lanka 
tamils who comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
contend they are discriminated against in jobs and education 
sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population and control the 
government and military 
according to police in mahiyangana several armed youths entered 
the grounds where 200000 to 300000 people gathered for the 11th 
annual village reawakening festival and they exploded a bomb near 
the main stage 
the 10day festival is aimed at encouraging people to build 
better houses for themselves and to repair their rundown villages 
the attack the first on such a festival came despite increased 
security including the posting of a large number of military 
commands around the grounds 
the peoples liberation front has been blamed for more than 3500 
killings since july 1987 when indian peacekeeping forces arrived on 
this troubled island to enforce a peace accord between the 
sinhalesedominated government and militant tamils who have been 
fighting for a separate homeland since 1983 
the front contends the accord grants too many concessions to the 
minority tamils and it says the presence of indian soldiers 
threatens sri lankas sovereignty front members have vowed to kill 
anyone who supports the pact 
india became involved in the ethnic problems of the nation 
because its own 60 million tamils are sympathetic to the rebel cause 
in addition to the bombing police blamed sinhalese extremists 
for the deaths of seven moderate sinhalese in kurunegala about 65 
miles northeast of colombo and for seven other deaths in colombo 
officers also said they found four sinhalese youths shot to death 
in the town of kegalle 50 miles northeast of colombo 
armed with automatic weapons and empowered by tough emergency 
laws soldiers and police raided homes and arrested 3200 suspected 
radicals in the sinhalesedominated south officials said 
armed troops also forced open a hostel in colombo and arrested 37 
medical interns who allegedly belong to the front the weekend 
newspaper sun claimed the medical facullty of colombo university has 
been the vangaurd of the fronts antigovernment campaign

in the west bank a 12yearold palestinian was shot and killed 
in a clash between troops and stonethrowing arabs twelve arabs 
were reported wounded in other incidents 
the death raised to 539 the number of palestinians killed in the 
18month revolt against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip twentythree israelis also have died 
in another development a report on israel radios english 
service said defense minister yitzhak rabin told sundays cabinet 
meeting that the justice ministry had authorized the use of 
plastic bullets against any arab male in the occupied territories 
whose face was masked 
the report did not elaborate and it was not carried on any 
subsequent israel radio broadcasts sunday night 
an official in the defense ministry speaking on condition of 
anonymity would neither confirm nor deny the report but he said 
the defense ministry asked the justice ministry last month to 
liberalize orders to open fire 
the official said the military asked permission to shoot the 
masked leaders of violent demonstrations with sometimes lethal 
plastictipped bullets under very very special circumstances 
he did not specify the circumstances 
if the measures were approved in principle by the justice 
ministry the ministry would then decide under what conditions the 
military could open fire and the defense ministry would then issue 
new orders the spokesman said 
an army spokesman said no such orders have been issued 
under current regulations soldiers may only open fire at 
palestinians who are building roadblocks or preparing to attack 
soldiers or if their lives are in danger the army spokesman said 
many palestinian protesters mask their faces in arab keffiyehs 
or headdresses 
the palestinian condemnation of the united states came in a 
leaflet by the unified national leadership of the uprising it noted 
the deteriorating economic situation in israel and called for a 
further boycott of israeli products 
for the first time uprising leaders called for a twoday strike 
among the 810000 israeli arabs and urged them to provide material 
aid and food to their brethren in the occupied lands 
radical palestinian groups have recently increased their efforts 
aimed at inciting israeli arabs who live among the 35 million 
jews to take a more active role in the uprising some israeli arabs 
have staged sympathy strikes 
the leaflet criticized the us position as always biased 
toward the zionist enemy and supportive of the elections under 
occupation and it praised european countries for supporting a 
unsponsored peace conference with the participation of the 
palestine liberation organization 
the leaflet came as president bush reportedly reassured prime 
minister yitzhak shamir of his support for shamirs peace plan 
which calls for balloting in the occupied territories and 
negotiations with elected palestinians on limited selfrule 
uprising leaders reject the plan because it does not call for an 
independent palestinian state 
israel radio said the backing came in a letter but shamirs 
spokesman avi pazner said the letter had not been received 
the daily haaretz newspaper reported bush was angry over shamirs 
support for building jewish settlements in the occupied territories 
which run counter to us policy calling for israel to give up land 
in exchange for peace 
haaretz quoted bush as saying i dont understand this shamir 
as he banged his palm on a table at a meeting in washington the 
paper said the session was attended by sen daniel inoyue dhawaii 
and seymour reich chairman of the conference of presidents of major 
jewish organizations 
the fatal clash sunday broke out when troops encountered 
violent resistance as they entered the village of idna to arrest 
suspects an army spokesman said he said the army was investigating 
the circumstances of the youths death 
the victim identified as khalil awad tabran was shot in the 
chest said officials at alia hospital in nearby hebron 
twelve palestinians were wounded sunday by army gunfire 
including a 24yearold woman listed in critical condition with a 
gunshot wound to the chest arab hospital officials said an army 
spokesman confirmed two of the wounded 
about 30 israeli mayors chained themselves outside shamirs 
office sunday to protest unemployment which has reached 86 percent

civil rights leaders commemorated the day their 
movement became law sunday by praying at the crypt of martin luther 
king jr and challenging president bush to live up to his stated 
commitment to their cause 
mr bush has got to get up and make the white house the right 
house said the rev joseph lowery president of the southern 
christian leadership conference its not enough to talk that 
talk we need him to walk that walk 
the sclc was marking the 25th anniversary of the passage of the 
civil rights act of 1964 which banned segregation in public 
facilities and has been used in court actions against discrimination 
in the workplace 
lowery one of several civil rights leaders who met with bush 
friday said recent supreme court decisions against affirmative 
action programs have left black leaders doubting that the president 
would work to protect progress made under the law 
im going to remain hopeful for the time being lowery said 
mr bush has good instincts he wants to do whats right in this 
regard 
on friday bush called on congress to reauthorize the civil 
rights commission which is set to expire nov 30 but earlier last 
week attorney general dick thornburgh said the bush administration 
would not push congress to overturn the supreme court decisions 
lowery said civil rights leaders are concerned that bushs latest 
statements might be just rhetoric and added that bush is gonna 
have to make up his mind on either bolstering black membership in 
the gop or pleasing ultraconservatives 
lowery was joined at kings gravesite by rosa parks whose 
refusal to sit in a segregated section of a montgomery ala bus in 
1955 sparked the civil rights movement 
mrs parks said bushs statements sounded good but we are 
waiting for real real action 
we cannot lull ourselves to sleep with words she said 
about 200 people gathered for the prayer service during which 
lowery blasted supreme court justice sandra day oconnor for her 
position against affirmative action 
glory be to god if it werent for affirmative action shed 
still be in arizona presiding over a microwave lowery said 
adding that the american public should remind sandra who she is 
we bled too profusely and died too young to let any supreme 
court turn us around lowery said

syrian gunners blasted the christian 
sector of the lebanese capital with shellfire sunday and rival 
militias backed by syria and iran clashed in street battles in 
moslem west beirut police said 
ten people were killed and 29 wounded they said 
a soviet envoy and the foreign ministers of three arab countries 
working for a settlement of lebanons 14yearold civil war arrived 
in syria 
since the latest round of fighting began in march 396 people 
have been killed and 1532 wounded 
police said eight people were killed sunday and 20 wounded in the 
syrian bombardment of christian east beiruts sprawling residential 
districts of ashrafiyeh and furn elshubbak 
one shell crashed into the bedroom of antoine abiaad 31 a 
maronite catholic priest and his wife renee 24 in ashrafiyeh 
they were killed as they slept said a police spokesman who cannot 
be named under standing rules 
the syrians also pounded a 25mile coastal stretch to prevent 
food fuel and arms supplies from reaching the christian enclave 
north of beirut police said christian militia gunners responded 
with intermittent barrages of 155mm shellfire 
the police spokesman said two people were killed and nine wounded 
in the fighting between the moslem militias the gun battles raged 
all night and through sunday morning between the syrianbacked 
shiite moslem amal militia and the proiranian hezbollah or party 
of god 
it was the first major clash between the factions since the death 
of irans revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on 
june 3 
the fundamentalist hezbollah and the more secular amal have been 
fighting for control of the millionstrong shiite community the 
largest single sect in lebanon 
the latest round of fighting in lebanons civil war broke out on 
march 8 between army commander gen michel aouns 20000 troops 
most of them christians and an alliance of syrias 40000 troops 
and druse forces hezbollah and amal had stayed out of that 
confrontation 
soviet envoy alexander bessmertnykh flew to damascus after 
winning a pledge from iraqi president saddam husseins government 
syrias main arab foe to halt arms shipments to the lebanese 
christians if the syrians stopped their daily bombardment of the 
christian enclave 
syrias government newspaper althawra said the iraqi pledge was 
a maneuver to mislead the arab league committee 
bessmertnykh carried a message from soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev to syrian president hafez assad said a soviet source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
syria and iraq have close ties with moscow the soviets were 
iraqs main arms suppliers during the eightyear iraniraq war and 
syria is moscows leading arab ally 
the arab league committee includes king hassan ii of morocco 
king fahd of saudi arabia and president chadli bendjedid of algeria 
the 22nation arab league has asked the committee to find a 
settlement to lebanons war by november 
but so far it has been unable to enforce even a ceasefire called 
in may 
the foreign ministers of the three countries were in damascus to 
discuss the truce violations 
aoun lashed out at the arab committee for keeping silent on 
syrian violations of the ceasefire 
the arab committee is becoming a helpless spectator while the 
syrians persist in their daily defiance of the arab league 
ceasefire calls this is pushing the lebanese to despair he said 
in a statement broadcast by christian radio stations 
if the arab league which is supported by the united nations 
is incapable of making the syrians respect its resolutions then it 
must declare the syrians as the defiers aoun said 
syria entered lebanon under a 1976 arab league mandate to halt 
the civil war christians say the syrians lost their role as neutral 
peacekeepers because they have sided with moslems in the civil war 
meanwhile in southern lebanon two militiamen of the 
israelibacked south lebanon army were wounded sunday when their 
armored personnel carrier hit a mine police reported 
a police spokesman said the explosion occurred in kfar falous in 
israels selfdeclared security zone a strip of lebanese border 
territory the israelis have occupied since 1985 
the spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
said the lebanese militia retaliated by shelling the villages of 
kakaiyat iljisr and zoutar sharqiyyeh no casualties were reported

the opposition socialists pulled ahead of the 
governing liberal democratic party on monday in municipal elections 
viewed as a gauge of how well the scandalridden liberal democrats 
will fare in national elections 
women were expected to tilt the vote in favor of the opposition 
following a campaign that focused on a sex scandal in the governing 
party 
with 47 of the 128 seats in the tokyo metropolitan assembly 
decided the japan socialist party had won 22 nine more than the 
liberal democrats according to the japan broadcasting corp 
the early results were considered significant since the 
socialists held only 11 assembly seats coming into sundays 
election the liberal democrats had 63 
the clean government party had five seats the communist party 
three and independent candidates had won four the television 
network said 
about 518 million people or 587 percent of the eligible 
voters cast ballots sunday that was up from 535 percent in the 
last election in 1985 the tokyo board of elections said 
the election was being closely watched as a sign of how the 
liberal democrats who have ruled japan since 1954 will do in a 
national election july 23 for half the seats in the upper house of 
the parliament or diet 
more than 61 percent of registered women voted compared to 5616 
percent of men the board said 
the high turnout especially among women was expected to favor 
the opposition the opposition campaign focused on national issues 
including an unpopular 3 percent consumption tax passed by the 
liberal democratic party an influencepeddling scandal that forced 
the resignation of prime minster noboru takeshita and a sex scandal 
centering on reports the new prime minister sousuke uno has kept 
paid mistresses 
the kyodo news service reported a womens group in miyazaki 
western japan gathered signatures from more than 1000 women on a 
petition for the prime minister saying it is an embarrassment for 
japan to be represented at the summit by a person who tramples over 
women 
uno took office last month and soon afterward japanese media 
published an interview with a former geisha who said uno paid her 
for sex the woman later appeared in a television interview and 
reports that uno kept other mistresses filled the press last week 
the scandal has further tainted the liberal democratic party 
which was badly shaken by the socalled recruit scandal which 
forced the resignation of takeshita on june 2 
the scandal involved the recruit co a publishing conglomerate 
accused of handing out millions of dollars in political 
contributions and bargainpriced stock in exchange for political 
favors 
only 25 percent of tokyo voters polled recently by the asahi 
shimbun newspaper said they planned to support liberal democrat 
candidates down from 34 percent who expressed support in 1985 
a kyodo news service poll released thursday showed 16 percent 
supporting the japan socialist party the main opposition party 
while support for the liberal democrats had fallen from 424 to only 
132 percent 
a poll published in the mainichi shimbun a national daily said 
the ruling party was likely to lose heavily 
the poll showed women were breaking away from the liberal 
democratic party women who said they would shift from the governing 
party to the socialists jumped from 8 percent to 18 percent while 
those who said they would vote for the liberal democrats shrank from 
33 to 18 percent

and a tugboat with pollution booms aboard began its journey to 
drydock sunday morning nine days after hitting a rock and spilling 
420000 gallons of oil into the ocean

its captain and crew on the trip to new york was nudged by the 
tugboat to loosen its anchor chain and then began moving under its 
own power with a puff of black smoke from its engines

oil leaking from the vessel said petty officer brian kelley of the 
coast guards boston office he said coast guard aircraft would 
check the ship periodically during the trip 
the ship will enter new york harbor during monday afternoons 
high tide and will be repaired at new york shipyard corp on the 
site of the old brooklyn navy yard 
coast guardsmen and onlookers at brenton point state park were 
not sorry to see the tanker depart 
the sooner they get out of here the better said gunn 
im glad to see its gone agreed joseph sweetland of 
middletown a regular sunday visitor to the park theres a lot 
better view out here and with that thing sitting out there anything 
could happen i guess

to the spill and said it would not leave a lasting mark on newport 
after three months goes by this is all going to be 
forgotten said rich boccio of seekonk mass you come back here

dropped back from the tanker the tugboat carrying booms in case of 
another accident with the small amount of oil remaining on the ship 
was the only vessel scheduled to accompany the tanker on its entire 
trip to new york

heating oil at the time of the accident most of that oil was pumped 
out of the ship immediately afterward but a layer of between a 
quarterinch and 2 inches thick remained said coast guard lt paul 
wolf he said the oil was being held in place by 24 feet of water 
and was not considered a threat to leak out

voters on sunday tested the strength and 
honesty of the historically powerful institutional revolutionary 
party in elections in five states troops guarded polls in baja 
california and michoacan where close races were expected 
also voting were residents of the states of campeche chihuahua 
and zacatecas 
polls officially closed at 6 pm but some remained open longer 
to allow people waiting in line at closing time to vote under 
mexican law the government has a week to announce election results 
opposition party members congressmen and the independent front 
for the defense of the vote monitored the 1166 polling places in 
baja an opposition stronghold to see if president carlos salinas 
de gortaris promise of clean elections was upheld 
if he doesnt accomplish this everybody will see it and people 
will stop believing in him said jorge barnetche of the 
3000member independent citizens group 
the opposition national action party alleged that officials in 
the northwestern border state used forged documents to register some 
people more than once it also said officials burned 24000 voter 
identification cards of purported dead people last week but that 
many of the cards belonged to opposition supporters 
some of bajas 882461 registered voters lined up early to choose 
a new governor mayor and state legislature the other states were 
choosing state legislatures chihuahua also was electing all 67 
mayors 
in a hillside neighborhood of tar paper and plywood shacks in the 
border city of tijuana baja voters said they began gathering 
outside polling stations at 530 am 
i vote to improve the government they make promises but dont 
live up to them said antonia cerillo one of dozens waiting in 
line at one polling place 
the governing party faced tough opposition in baja california 
from conservatives and in michoacan the home of leftist opposition 
leader cuauhtemoc cardenas who ran for president last year 
some polls opened late in michoacan which was electing a new 
24member legislature the governing party held 18 of these seats 
from the last election in 1986 
in elections last year michoacanos gave 64 percent of their vote 
in the presidential election to cardenas heading a leftist 
coalition he recently formed the democratic revolutionary party 
in chihuahua congressman pedro cesar acosta of the conservative 
national action party or pan said no major incidents had been 
reported by late afternoon but there were problems with the 
indelible ink used to mark voters fingers a common complaint in 
mexican elections 
in some cases it works to the point of burning the finger 
he said by telephone in others it doesnt make a stain until 
hours later in my case it worked from the beginning and hasnt 
come off and its been four hours since i voted 
pan made substantial gains in chihuahua in 1983 but lost ground 
to the pri three years later in elections marked by allegations of 
fraud abel vicencio tovar another pan congressman alleged the ink 
was part of pris operation carrousel to have voters go from one 
polling place to another casting ballots 
in baja the latest polls showed a dead heat between conservative 
ernesto ruffo and governing party candidate margarita ortega 
ruffo 37 a popular former mayor of the pacific coast city of 
ensenada said saturday night that the situation was calm despite 
his partys complaints of voter irregularities 
were used to these irregularities but we will watch officials 
and we are confident that the election will be successful said 
ruffo if he wins he will become the first governor from an 
opposition party since the governing party was founded and rose to 
power 60 years ago 
ms ortega 38 is considered honest even by her opponents and 
if she wins she would become mexicos third woman governor 
the opposition was hopeful of winning in this prosperous border 
state because its citizens gave salinas only one third of their 
votes in last years election 
a poll published friday in the mexico city daily la jornada 
showed ruffo at 337 percent and ms ortega with 327 percent of 
potential voters 
opposition parties claimed widespread voter fraud in the 
presidential election but the governing party denied that salinas 
has since campaigned against fraud and corruption

investigations of alleged theft coverups 
and illegal political contributions at gulf power co have prompted 
new accounting and ethics policies among the toughest in corporate 
america the utility says 
at least three gulf power employees have been fired or pressured 
to resign because of alleged financial wrongdoing company officials 
say others were reprimanded or reassigned as part of efforts to 
halt corruption 
a federal grand jury probe a mysterious plane crash and the 
disappareance of a graphic designer who worked for the utility all 
helped to place gulf power under intense scrutiny in the last year 
i am truly convinced that gulf power is on the right track 
now dr reed bell a pensacola pediatrician and chairman of the 
utilitys audit committee wrote in a june 26 letter to employees 
virtually all of the problems i believe to be part of the 
companys past 
bell has been a critic of past practices accusing management of 
keeping him and other outside directors in the dark about what he 
termed unethical conduct misconduct mismanagement coverups and 
money laundering 
hanging on walls throughout gulfs headquarters now is a copy of 
an ethics code prohibiting the doctoring of company books using 
corporate funds for indirect political contributions breaking laws 
for business ends having financial conflicts of interest and 
accepting gifts from companies doing business with the utility 
many of the prohibitions cover the sorts of troubles that began 
surfacing when douglas mccrary received an anonymous letter replete 
with allegations after he became gulfs president in 1983 
mccrary brought in a pair of investigators 
top executives reimbursed the company for using certain materials 
and services for personal purposes although insisting most had been 
normal perquisites 
last year two former gulf managers were convicted of tax fraud 
and a pensacola businessman was convicted of perjury in kickback 
schemes they allegedly stole more than 80000 by billing gulf for 
materials never delivered 
little attention was paid to gulf outside the florida panhandle 
until almost a year ago when a federal grand jury began probing the 
financial practices of its atlantabased parent southern co 
on april 10 1988 gulf became a focus of national attention when 
its senior vice president jacob horton and two southern pilots 
died in a plane crash four minutes after taking off from pensacolas 
airport 
the cause of the crash remains a mystery but just hours before 
the crash horton was told the audit committee had recommended that 
he be fired because of accounting irregularities 
an investigative report submitted to the committee indicated 
internal revenue service agents had targeted horton southern 
president edward addison former southern president alvin vogtle and 
state sen wd childers dpensacola a close friend of horton 
the bizarre happenings continued when lawyer fred levin who met 
with horton the day he died claimed four dead canaries with their 
necks broken were left outside his office and homes apparently as 
warnings against singing to authorities 
although the full scope of the investigations has yet to be 
disclosed gulf officials say they have taken steps to tighten the 
utilitys purchasing contracting and warehousing operations they 
also have suspended an informal political fundraising organization 
and encouraged employees to anonymously report alleged wrongdoing 
a vendor can no longer do business with gulf power co unless 
they have a contract with the company said gulf spokesman carter 
haynes used to if there was something i needed at an office 
supply store i could pick up supplies and they could bill us 
mccrary also has sent a letter to vendors urging them to let him 
know if employees have tried to coerce them into making political 
contributions because that is against company policy and no longer 
tolerated haynes said 
the report to the audit committee alleged horton had arranged for 
the utility to reimburse a supplier for a 1000 campaign donation 
current and former employees have complained they felt pressured 
into making contributions through gulfs official political action 
committee 
the atlanta grand jury has subpoenaed campaign finance records of 
32 state local and federal candidates in florida including those 
of sen bob graham former gov reubin askew and former sen paula 
hawkins a subpoena is not an indication of any wrongdoing 
contracts for legal and other professional services now are more 
detailed and can be approved only by mccrary haynes said 
a midmanagment official had approved contracts with ray howell 
a graphic designer paid 12 million by the utility from 1980 
through last year 
howell flew to atlanta to testify before the grand jury dec 7 
but never appeared he turned up two days later in the office of a 
missouri lawyer to sign over his interest in their pensacola home to 
his exwife he was never seen again

the people who helped bring down ivan f boesky 
are moving up two floors and over about seven blocks 
the new york regional office of the securities and exchange 
commission will be trading its longtime base at 26 federal plaza in 
lower manhattan for new quarters near the world trade center later 
this month 
after more than 20 years at the aging 42story government office 
building that also houses the fbi immigration and naturalization 
service and some 80 other federal agencies near the citys courts 
and municipal buildings the sec local staff is moving into private 
office space closer to the financial district it regulates 
the agency will exchange the slighty shabby federal building with 
its beige walls and balky elevators for two entire floors atop 75 
park place a sleek glass and metal 13story office building that 
opened less than two years ago 
the new york office biggest of the secs nine regional offices 
will be expanding its office space from 34000 square feet to 40000 
square feet according to renee miscione a spokeswoman for the 
general services administration which administers federal office 
buildings 
other tenants in the new location include the publisher rr 
donnelly amp sons and the legal department of the citys housing 
authority 
while sec regional administrator lawrence iason and his staff of 
about 200 are happy about the move they also dont have much choice 
the 850 staffers of the federal environmental protection agency 
who already occupy parts of 12 floors at 26 federal plaza need more 
space and the secs offices fit the bill 
but its not like the move isnt beneficial dorothy heyl 
regional counsel for the sec in new york said during a recent 
interview as she tried to find room for storing 100 office chairs 
that arrived three weeks early 
the public reference room where company filings and other sec 
documents are made available will be expanded slightly said iason

texas oilman t boone pickens jr says a stiff 
arm from a japanese company that rejected his bid for three board 
seats shows that japan is blocking foreign access to its financial 
markets 
i believe my experience symbolizes in many ways usjapanese 
trade relations on a much broader scale pickens wrote in a 
bylined frontpage article in sundays dallas times herald it 
certainly underscores that the usjapan trade relationship is not 
a twoway street 
the fact is that japan inc does not want an outsider observing 
its system from the inside he added and apparently it will do 
anything even if it defies common sense to prevent open access 
to japans financial markets 
koito manufacturing co last week rejected the amarillo oilmans 
bid for seats on its board of directors pickens boone co is the 
largest shareholder in the tokyobased company with 202 percent of 
stock 
koitos secondlargest shareholder toyota motor corp viewed 
as the real power behind koito has placed three directors on the 
companys board 
pickens wrote that he went to tokyo to press for shareholder 
rights and was given a stiff armhe said he wasnt surprised 
though because the koito board in april rejected his request for 
representation 
boone cos acquisition of its stake from a wellknown japanese 
raider kitaro watanabe may have raised koitos suspicion of 
pickens but pickens said the company shouldnt be wary of him 
common sense dictates that boone co koitos largest 
shareholder should also be entitled to three seats he wrote 
but common sense is not having the upper hand in this whole affair 
or for that matter in much of presentday corporate japan 
pickens compared japans corporate climate to american business 
100 years ago a time of huge cartels 
at the turn of the century we began to break up those trusts 
and open our markets to everyone who wished to participate he 
wrote the trustbusting unleashed americas entrepreneurs and 
proved to be a great boon to the country 
pickens also said that japan must open its economy or face a 
decline in prosperity 
while the japanese people have done remarkably well in recent 
times if they do not make serious attempts to open their closed 
economy their continued economic prosperity will undoubtedly suffer 
if not of stagnation from within perhaps of retaliation from 
without he said
