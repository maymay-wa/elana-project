violinist itzhak perlman the soloist zubin 
mehta the conductor and beethoven the composer for a music lover 
this new york philharmonic concert at avery fisher hall was about 
as good as it gets 
perlman began the evening with romance no 1 for violin and 
orchestra followed by the somewhat more familiar romance no 
2 he played them with a tone of warmth depth and purity 
the orchestra was glittering in its performance of the eighth 
symphony mehta began it at a brisk tempo the orchestra seemed 
to lean into it and flowing together they propelled themselves 
through the music the result could be compared favorably with any 
favorite recording of the symphony 
after intermission came concerto for violin and orchestra in d 
major the orchestra sounded marvelous and perlman exquisitely 
and seamlessly changed tone from white to full of colors he 
concentrated one could almost see his mind dictating glissandos 
and trills had the audience reacted as opera audiences do there 
would have been applause after every solo during one poignant 
passage the audience seemed too intent to breathe

a robber whose cucumber gun fooled cashiers 
into handing over more than 18800 has been sentenced to seven 
years in prison 
ernest coveley 37 wrapped the vegetable in a plastic bag and 
waved it like a sawedoff shotgun at cashiers in mortgage lending 
institutions known as building societies a court was told on two 
occasions when he was unable to afford the price of a cucumber he 
used an iron bar 
defense lawyer stephen pownall said coveley used a cucumber 
because it was the most innocuous thing he could think of 
but circuit judge edwin who sentenced coveley on monday told 
the defendant he had frightened his victims 
they were put in great fear not to say terror by you the 
judge said 
i have no doubt you used the cucumber so that if you were 
caught later in the street you would be able to point to the 
vegetable and deny any responsibility for what you had done 
coveley pleaded guilty last month to eight robberies in east and 
northeast london between may and july saying he used the money to 
buy drugs

the most dangerous women in the ancient world 
spent a fortune on perfume and the vanity of at least one biblical 
king can be measured by the size of his bathtub 
the lavishness of the ancients royal boudoir and bath will be 
on display starting nov 14 in an israel museum exhibition of a 
1000piece collection of toiletries from ancient israel 
blownglass eyeliner kits jewelstudded makeup palettes 
polished bronze mirrors gold hairpins faience cosmetic boxes 
among the collection is an ivory cosmetic spoon that once held 
the eyeshadow of queen jezebel the 9th century bc ruler who gave 
makeup a bad name there is also the only surviving juglet of 
balsam the favorite scent of the egyptian queen cleopatra 
cosmetics in antiquity appealed at first to both men and 
women over the centuries cosmetics became more used by women 
said michal dayagimendes curator of biblical archaeology and 
organizer of the exhibit 
she said cosmetics were used as a means to color the faces of 
gods to make them appear less cold and remote soon priestly 
attendants adopted the colorings and ultimately so did ordinary 
people 
in the hot dry climate of the middle east cosmetics also 
served a medicinal purpose 
wearing makeup repelled the little flies that caused 
inflamation of the eyes also eyeshadow took the place of 
sunglasses reducing the glare she said 
like their modern counterparts ancients squandered vast sums on 
pampering themselves indulging in cosmetic fads that sometimes 
were silly and harmful 
ancient egyptians used a reddish ochre makeup over the entire 
face romans lightened their faces with a powder made from 
crocodile excrement greek women used a finely ground lead to turn 
their faces white and spent hours in the sun to bleach their hair 
the greeks were aware that the lead caused great damage but 
beauty was above everything else dayagimendes said 
roman women went to great extremes to braid and curl their hair 
and many wore wigs 
but the greasy look was in mainly because oil was used to 
combat lice the pests and more than 80 lice eggs were found for 
example on a 2000yearold wooden comb recovered recently from 
the qumran caves near the dead sea 
neros wife pompaea was especially extravagant 
every day she took a bath in asses milk when she was finally 
banished from rome she was allowed to take 50 asses with her just 
to make sure she could have her daily milk bath said 
dayagimendes 
her bath did not survive but that of herod the great was 
retrieved a few years ago from his ruined kypros winter palace near 
jericho the 1ton sixfootlong alabaster bathtub is a monument 
to the grandiose style of one of the ancient worlds great builders 
and architect of the second jewish temple 
the man obviously had good taste and enjoyed all the 
luxuries she said pointing to the regal tray where oils and 
lotions once rested on the side of the tub 
the costliest luxury in the ancient world however was perfume 
and ancient israelites made the most famous variety balsam from a 
nowextinct tree that once grew on the edges of the dead sea 
to please cleopatra the roman general anthony acquired a whole 
orchard of the precious balsam trees near jericho so she would 
always have a supply of her favorite fragrance which cost twice as 
much as silver 
calling it serpents poison sages of the jewish talmud 
recount that the daughters of jerusalem put balsam in their shoes 
and on seeing attractive young men clicked their heels to release 
the fragrance as a lure 
today the only surviving balsam is a 1ounce flask covered in 
palm matting that has lost all its allure only a musty oily scent 
remains in the padded box where it is kept 
it must have been sweet heavy and oily it was their taste 
but you cant say more said dayagimendes 
to give museum goers a whiff of the past dayagimendes has 
enlisted the help of experts in holland and israel to recreate a 
fragrance similar to the ones in biblical times 
i used all the plants mentioned in the bible in connection 
with perfumes and scented ointments she said adding that 
ingredients included cinnamon myrrh and frankincense 
the result is avishag a perfume named after a consort of king 
david a twoounce bottle is being marketed at the exhibition for 
50 
we thought it would be intriguing to smell something of 
antiquity and this way you can take something home to remember 
besides a brochure she said

amanda blake who played miss kitty in 
the longrunning gunsmoke television series died of 
aidsrelated complications not cancer as previously reported her 
doctor said monday 
blake did have throat cancer but that wasnt the reason that 
she died said dr lou nishimura a sacramento internist 
after blake died aug 16 at mercy general hospital in 
sacramento a statement composed by the hospital and the actress 
friends reported her death as the result of her long battle with 
cancer 
blake 60 had aids symptoms for about a year said nishimura 
he said he didnt know how she contracted the fatal disease 
blakes fifth husband mark spaeth an austin texas city 
councilman and developer died of pneumonia in 1985 at age 45 they 
married in april 1984 and divorced a short time later 
blakes death certificate listed the immediate cause of death as 
cardiopulmonary arrest due to liver failure and cmv hepatitis cmv 
or cytomegalo virus hepatitis is aidsrelated said nishimura who 
treated blake during the year before her death and signed her death 
certificate 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and cancer were listed on 
the certificate as contributing to her death 
nishimura was interviewed following a report friday on 
sacramento television station krbk quoting friends of blake who 
said aids had played a role in her death 
aids is caused by a virus that attacks the bodys immune system 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or syringes 
shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from 
pregnant women to their offspring 
once a twopackaday smoker blake had undergone surgery for 
oral cancer in 1977 and afterward made appearances throughout the 
country on behalf of the american cancer society 
jerri ewen a mercy general spokeswoman said she reported 
cancer as the cause of death at the request of blakes close 
friends when somebody dies you go by what the wishes of the 
family are in this case the friends were the family ewen said 
ewen said she never saw the death certificate 
death certificates are public documents under california law and 
are recorded with the county where a person dies 
ewen said the hospital reported the death to the federal centers 
for disease control 
blake reigned as miss kitty queen of dodge citys long branch 
saloon for 19 years in the tv series gunsmoke set in the 
lawless cattle town of dodge city kan in the late 1800s

guest appearances for tv game shows movies of the week and such 
series as edge of night hart to hart and love boat

mementos of white bigotry from 
yesteryear little black sambo dolls colored only signs 
figurines of grinning watermeloneating urchins are becoming hot 
collectors items among american blacks who once scorned them as 
hated symbols of humiliation 
the booming market for black collectibles has attracted such 
celebrities as bill cosby oprah winfrey whoopi goldberg and 
heavyweight boxing champion mike tyson who reportedly collects 
african slave chains and shackles 
black people buy these items for the very same reason that 
jewish people research the holocaust says jeanette b carson a 
prominent figure in the black memorabilia business the black 
experience during and after slavery was a holocaust we must never 
forget 
ms carson 56 a retired state department specialist in african 
affairs began collecting black artifacts about seven years ago 
the 600 items that fill her home near washington dc range from 
quilted dolls handsewn by former slaves to a mirrored mahogany hat 
rack valued at 800 to 900 which prize fighter joe louis once 
kept in his dressing room 
ms carsons homebased firm ethnic treasures inc sponsors 
dealer shows and auctions from new york to atlanta she also 
publishes black ethnic collectibles a bimonthly magazine with 
8000 subscribers and heads the national association of black 
memorabilia collectors with more than 500 members nationwide 
ms carson says the business has grown from about 50 dealers in 
1983 to more than 500 this year with an estimated 500000 in 
annual sales the number of collectors like dealers once mostly 
white but now predominantly black has soared from about 10000 to 
more than 35000 in the past six years she says 
her personal collection includes 100 handfashioned dolls and 
other objects presenting a positive image of blacks including 
commemorative stamps and coins historical photographs and 
newspapers and record albums paintings and sculptures by black 
artists 
no less valuable she says are the racist artifacts that older 
black customers find highly offensive like souvenir placemats from 
a 1940s chain of restaurants in the western states called coon 
chicken inns whose logo was a winking smiling black face or 
the framed sign reading colored seated in rear dating from 
1929 or the original 1897 sheet music for a negro dialect song 
titled ma curlyheady babby 
or the yellowed postcards with cartoons of wideeyed pigtailed 
black children they were called pickaninnies in those days 
engaged in such pursuits as riding mules picking cotton sitting 
on a toilet seat or tugging at the tails of florida alligators 
they all tell a story says ms carson they are important 
because they document our history both the positive and the 
negative it is particularly important to pass them along to young 
people so they know where they came from and where they are 
going 
ms carson said there was a time when older blacks including 
her parents destroyed aunt jemima cookie jars and amos n andy 
toys as painful reminders of racial stereotypes created for the 
amusement of whites 
but ms carson said popular interest in collecting and 
preserving black memorabilia has increased with the rise of a 
younger generation which is proud of its racial heritage 
this is one aspect of bringing our history and culture to 
light she said if our children continue to be misinformed by 
history books which focus on what happened in white america they 
wont feel they belong to this society or have any idea of the 
important contributions their ancestors made to this country

students can take a short and somewhat 
quirky stroll through history at the rollins college walk of fame 
600 slabs and chunks of stone recalling famous people through the 
centuries 
theres a stone from the cathedral crypt in havana that once 
held the remains of christopher columbus theres a slab of worn 
flagstone from the east portico of george washingtons home at 
mount vernon va theres a bit of stone from atlanta donated by 
the family of slain civil rights leader martin luther king 
honored are half the signers of the declaration of independence 
most of the american presidents flagmaker betsy ross composer 
richard wagner aristotle henry wadsworth longfellow 
most of the rocky memorabilia were collected by hamilton holt 
president of the the small private college from 1925 to 1949 
holt a wealthy new englander who was active in the world peace 
movement that led to the formation of the united nations had 
friends around the world who helped with his hobby 
adm richard byrd brought a souvenir from the mountains of the 
south pole and presented it to the campus himself in 1938 
president harry truman joined holt for a stonelaying ceremony in 
his honor on march 8 1949 after receiving an honorary degree 
the stones are of no intrinsic value holt once wrote 
yet each one of them is eloquent with suggestion and 
inspiration 
each of the geological souvenirs has been carefully set in a 
slab of concrete engraved with the name of the person it represents 
and the place where it originated 
for years the stones were part of an asphalt pathway and were 
actually walked on defaced and weathered but they have recently 
been cleaned and restored and set off from the walkway itself by 
concrete borders 
the landscaped walk of fame was rededicated on its 60th 
anniversary this past weekend 
not everyone proposed for the walk has actually been honored 
in 1945 someone donated a stone from the fireplace of adolf 
hitlers bunker in berlin holt accepted planning to use it in a 
walk of ill fame 
but either holt or a successor thought the better of the plan 
and the hitler relic has been lost

throughout his 1988 campaign for the 
presidency george bush complained of excessive interference by 
congress in the daytoday running of us foreign policy 
echoing president reagan bush maintained it is impossible to 
conduct any kind of sensible and coherent foreign policy with 535 
secretaries of state insisting that their views prevail 
as president bush also has had occasion to complain of 
congressional micromanagement as he did when congress imposed 
restrictions on the transfer of us aircraft technology to japan 
but for the moment at least the complaints are going the other 
way 
senators are complaining that when they do seek policy direction 
and advice from the state department department representatives 
often are either silent or nowhere to be found leaving lawmakers 
to thrash matters out as best they can 
the problem they say is not one of 535 secretaries of state 
it is the difficulty of obtaining the views of representatives of 
the only official secretary of state james a baker iii 
at a recent hearing of the senate foreign relations committee 
the issue under discussion was a law enforcement treaty drafted as 
a weapon in the war on drugs 
sen jesse helms rnc offered four modifications or 
understandings 
what did the state department think about changes in 
interpretation of the treaty its diplomats had negotiated 
no state department official was present to respond whereupon 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny erupted 
the state department is systematically yielding its position 
in foreign relations he said i do not know what they think 
they are doing 
they have let the central intelligence agency take over the 
estimates of world situations and take over most of their embassies 
and on things like these treaties they will not even show up 
 
they are becoming a caricature moynihan said it is 
as if they had finally decided to agree with the people who despise 
them 
they are afraid to come here and say they are not in favor of 
these understandings the senator said they are fearful of 
having to do so if they are fearful why dont they get a job 
where you dont have to take a position on anything or maybe that 
is what they think the state department job is 
finally a member of the staff of the state departments legal 
office arrived to say that the department did indeed object to the 
understandings but not enough to delay action on the treaties 
themselves 
so the understandings and the treaty were approved 
but the complaints continued 
on the senate floor sen warren rudman rnh was outvoted in 
a bid to waive the requirement that no appropriations for the state 
department be approved until congress passes an authorization bill 
his motive this years authorization is bogged down in a 
difficult conference between the senate and house foreign affairs 
committees 
rudman contended the department is known to vigorously object to 
major portions of the authorization bills 
his side would have prevailed and funding for the state 
department would have been assured if the department had had the 
courage to speak out rudman said 
my understanding is that the department was unwilling to go on 
record because they were fearful of offending the authorizing 
committees rudman said i hope the department will have more 
courage in the conduct of its other affairs than it does in this 
one 
they were not willing to stand up and be counted rudman 
said and added 
i will give the state department a message here on the floor 
of the us senate i have stood up and been counted for that 
department in the last nine years 
i shall not do so again

an engineering professor who penned a 
history of the pencil says that while the topic hasnt gotten much 
ink it is anything but pointless 
drawing on two years of research duke university professor 
henry petroski has written a 450page book on the pencil that 
includes the following 
you could probably draw a line 70 miles long with one pencil 
it would probably cost 50 for a person to make a 10cent 
pencil 
there are 2 billion pencils produced in the united states 
annually 
the socalled lead in a pencil is actually graphite and clay 
the more clay the harder the point 
erasers didnt appear on pencils until about 100 years ago 
there was a great debate about whether children in schools should 
be given pencils with erasers petroski said people said if 
they had erasers they would be encouraged to make mistakes 
what he doesnt know is when the first pencil as we know it 
today was produced 
people dont record the origins of such common things 
petroski said 
he does know that the first illustration of a pencil appeared in 
1565 the date generally noted as its origin 
petroskis book the pencil a history of design and 
circumstance is being released in january 
petroski intended to write about the cultural role of 
engineering the pencil was merely to serve as an introduction to 
some of his thoughts on engineering 
i couldnt find much written on the pencil and soon realized 
there was no definitive history of it petroski said 
that led petroski to do his own 
petroski thinks the pencil will continue to make its mark it 
has withstood the invention of the typewriter the ballpoint pen 
the printing press and the computer 
theres no reason its ever going to disappear he said 
its held up as a model of design

a new analysis by the agriculture department 
says poland is close to providing enough food for itself and that 
aid from the united states and other countries may be needed for 
only a brief period 
despite the muchpublicized long food lines and empty food 
shelves in polish shops poles are not starving the report said 
annual per capita meat consumption at 63 kilograms about 139 
pounds in 1988 is approximately the same as in norway spain 
sweden and the united kingdom 
it added total caloric intake nearly 3300 calories a day 
per capita is close to that of western europe but markedly 
below that in the us 3500 the country is close to becoming 
selfsufficient in food and may face only a shortterm need for 
food assistance 
the latest us food aid for poland was formally signed on 
friday providing up to 10000 metric tons of pork bellies the 
meat is part of a 100 million package of us food aid pledged by 
president bush this fiscal year 
ambassador jan kinast of poland said the 10 million worth of 
pork helps us to meet our immediate needs and that his country 
has many complex reforms underway that are aimed at boosting farm 
output 
if there is additional us aid in polands future kinast said 
he hoped it would include such products which would help us 
stimulate the agricultural production of his country 
solidarity leader lech walesa put it more bluntly a day earlier 
in gdansk when he expressed thanks for the first emergency shipment 
of us grain i am not delighted with this kind of help he 
said i treat this help as a kind of necessity so we can work 
out solutions 
walesa said it would be better if americans would send combines 
and other machines to help farmers produce more in poland 
the usda report by economists nancy j cochrane and francis 
urban in agricultural outlook magazine said many reforms have been 
instituted by the polish government the first noncommunist 
leadership in the eastern bloc but that longterm solution to 
polands food problems will require drastic improvements in farm 
efficiency and cost control 
basic policy changes that have been suggested include a more 
determined drive to consolidate polands fragmented private farms 
almost 70 percent of polands agricultural land is in private 
farms the maximum holding is 100 hectares 247 acres but the 
average is only five hectares less than 125 acres the report 
said 
these farms account for about 80 percent of polands gross 
agricultural output with the remainder coming from some 4500 
state farms of about 1000 hectares 2470 acres each 
many of the private farms are fragmented into several small 
plots and all are undercapitalized the report said many are 
operated by older people as younger workers leave for city jobs 
the state farms are less efficient and require large subsidies 
also under the old central planning system state farmers got top 
priority for the distribution of inputs such as fertilizer 
seed and machinery the report said 
polish agricultural output has improved dramatically since 
the sharp declines after martial law was imposed in the early 
1980s especially in grain production but livestock output the 
meat poultry and dairy products needed for consumers has slumped 
since it rebounded in the mid1980s 
red meat production for 1989 is likely to slip by 6 percent 
the report said the sector suffers from poor profitability and 
perennially tight feed supplies 
farm output continues to be hampered by shortages of production 
supplies inadequate storage and transportation facilities 
fertilizer use dropped in 1989 for the third consecutive year 
reflecting shortages and high prices there are shortages of small 
machinery and spare parts 
moreover while poland has an excellent network of 
agricultural research institutes there is no effective extension 
service that can transmit the results of this research to the 
farmers the report said

the cia says the average soviet citizen earned 
the equivalent of 8850 last year less than half the average 
americans earnings of 19970 
the central intelligence agencys handbook of economic 
statistics 1989 shows the us figure was higher than that of 
other major noncommunist countries with the average japanese 
shown as earning 14340 and the average west german 14260 
earnings of the average american grew by 29 percent in 1988 
the average soviet citizen enjoyed an increase of only 05 percent 
the handbooks 1988 edition did not include a figure for the 
soviet union though other statistics indicate the average 
citizens earnings there was 8363 in 1987 compared with 18200 
for the average american 
the cia makes these comparisons on a purchasing power basis 
that means it does not translate foreign earnings into dollars at 
prevailing exchange rates but at theoretical rates that would 
equalize the cost of a basket of goods and services in the two 
countries being compared the document did not say what those 
theoretical rates were 
a few other comparisons were given for 1988 life expectancy was 
69 years for the soviet union 75 years for the united states and 
78 years for japan the average american used up energy equal to 
burning 56 barrels of oil while the average soviet consumed only 
35 barrels worth 
there were a few more cars than one for every two americans 
572 per thousand and only one for every 24 soviets 42 per 
thousand according to the cia the soviet figure came from 1986 
and may have grown some by 1988 
soviet international trade was closer to balance than americas 
the united states imported 128 billion worth of goods more than it 
exported while the soviets had a surplus equal to 34 billion 
total production of goods and services in the soviet union was 
valued at 25 trillion compared with 49 trillion for the united 
states the soviet population was larger at midyear 2964 million 
compared with 246 million for the united states both populations 
were growing at the same rate 09 percent a year 
for 1987 us loans and grants to the third world were given as 
93 billion and soviet economic aid as 22 billion rising to 
73 billion in 1988 no comparable 1988 figure was given for the 
united states 
the cia reported some east european countries as turning in a 
better earnings record than the soviets for the first time in 
1988 czechoslovakia joined 29 other countries where the average 
citizen earns the equivalent of more than 10000 annually the 
only country to join that group last year the figure for 
czechoslovakia was 10140 east germany was already a member with 
average earnings of 12480 last year 
at the bottom of the cias table were 45 countries from 
afghanistan to zaire where average earnings were 401 a year or 
less most of them under a dollar a day

pinball played in brightly lit smokefilled 
parlors where millions of japanese escape stress and engage in 
lowstakes gambling has long rivaled baseball as japans national 
pastime 
the game of pachinko and its often gaudy parlors also are at 
the center of political scandal following allegations the industry 
sought to protect its earnings by paying off legislators 
after two days of special discussions on the issue in parliament 
last week however politicians now seem ready to let the issue 
fade both opposition and governing party legislators have 
acknowledged receiving donations from the industry but deny any 
wrongdoing 
the industry has about 15000 parlors nationwide and total 
annual revenues estimated at up to 140 billion about 10 million 
japanese are believed to play pachinko regularly 
players rent 25 small steel balls for 70 cents and try to 
shoot the balls through a maze of pegs into winning holes often 
decorated as flowers or airplanes before the balls fall to the 
bottom of the upright machine 
each success heralded by bells and flashing lights brings a 
payoff of 15 or so more balls an automatic firing mechanism is 
manipulated to control the velocity of each shot 
the clanging of balls ringing bells and loud march music drown 
out most other sounds in the parlors and seem to hypnotize pachinko 
players who sit shoulder to shoulder in crowded rows 
the balls are later counted and exchanged for prizes such as 
cigarette lighters that can be turned in for cash at booths near 
the parlors a good days play would bring in more than 70 
because all transactions are in cash making it virtually 
impossible to trace a parlors income the game has created a tax 
collectors nightmare 
its inevitable that our industry is a big tax evader said 
the manager of one tokyo pachinko parlor on condition of anonymity 
its all done in cash and if someone wanted to cheat im sure 
they could 
police believe organized crime runs parlors or extorts 
protection money from them 
tax officials long have sought tighter regulations one idea 
proposed by the national police agency was the introduction of 
prepaid cards to replace the cash and make tracking pachinko funds 
easier 
the weekly magazine shukan bunshun has charged that lawmakers 
from japans leading opposition party the socialists took bribes 
to oppose introduction of the cards 
bunshun also alleged huge sums of money from pachinko ended up 
in the hands of north koreas communist government with whom the 
socialists have close relations but japan has no diplomatic ties 
it also charged north korea was using pachinko money to bribe 
japanese politicians and illegally influence government policy 
many pachinko parlors are owned by koreans living in japan 
about 30 percent of whom are loyal to north korea 
although many were born and grew up in this country most of 
japans 677000member korean community do not have japanese 
citizenship and receiving political donations from foreigners or 
foreign organizations violates the political fund control law 
kim kuk han a spokesman for the general association of korean 
residents in japan said his pronorth korea organization has made 
no political donations through the pachinko industry or otherwise 
to japanese legislators 
but the pachinko scandal has become the latest of several 
sex and money scandals that have plagued japanese politics over the 
past year 
the socialists have acknowledged that party members received 
56000 in donations the governing liberal democrats said thursday 
that their party and 52 of its members have received 822000 in 
donations from the industry 
however both parties have denied wrongdoing and the issue the 
subject of two days of special hearings is not expected to be 
seriously investigated in future parliament meetings

vice president dan quayle says hes happy that 
president bush is keeping him on the 1992 ticket but says its too 
early to talk of having any presidential ambitions of his own 
bush in an interview published sunday by the dallas morning 
news said quayle absolutely will be his running mate again 
his comment appeared to be an offhanded way of acknowledging his 
own hat will be in the ring for a second term something the 
firstyear president has not said publicly before 
white house chief of staff john sununu asked sunday if bush had 
meant to end any suspense about his own intentions said i think 
theyve been thinking in terms of an eightyear team all along i 
hope thats not a surprise to anybody 
sununu speaking with reporters on the tarmac at westchester 
county airport in white plains ny added with a laugh i need 
the job 
quayle appearing on the nbctv program meet the press 
said i am very pleased that the president is pleased with the 
job that i am doing asked whether he had thought about running 
for president himself he said what has crossed my mind is just 
doing a good job right now 
bush visited his mother dorothy walker bush at her home in 
greenwich conn on sunday after participating in a convocation at 
his prep school phillips academy in andover mass 
mrs bush 88 hospitalized for a week in september with 
pneumonia was well enough to take part in a presidential photo 
opportunity outside her front door before her son departed 
i want you to see how well my ma looked bush told reporters 
as he and older brother prescott jr helped her outside 
at andover the class of 42 graduate told the crowd of 2500 
assembled on the schools great lawn i loved those years they 
did indeed teach the great end and real business of living a 
phrase from the constitution of the school founded in 1778 
even now its lessons of honesty selflessness faith in god 
enrich every day of our lives said bush 
in bushs day there were no girls and only two black or hispanic 
students at phillips also called andover today girls comprise 
almost half the 1217 students and there are 156 black or latin 
students 
the convocation marked the 200th anniversary of the visit of 
another president george washington two of whose grandnephews 
later enrolled in the young rigorous academy they proved no match 
for the curriculum or the new england weather and had to withdraw 
the school also draws pupils from dozens of foreign lands and 
it paraded its diversity with a procession of flagbearing 
students as well as bible readings in several languages 
bush a star athlete and student leader who went directly from 
andover to become a navy combat pilot in world war ii said he was 
taught that we were put on earth to help others 
back in the early 40s this formed the essence and character 
of phillips academy and you can still feel its power today he 
said 
bush made the nostalgic visit without his wife barbara who 
returned to the white house directly from camp david because of a 
stomach ailment

an imitation rice wine produced at a factory in 
the southern china province of guangdong has poisoned scores of 
people killing 21 and sending at least 136 others to hospitals 
reports said today 
the poisoning occurred over the past week in zhaoqing city 
about 125 miles west of the british colony of hong kong 
four people have been arrested in connection with production of 
the imitation wine which had a level of methyl alcohol far above 
standards set by the government according to reports appearing in 
the probeijing ta kung pao newspaper 
wen wei po another probeijing newspaper that gave the latest 
casualty figures said quick removal of the product from store 
shelves was difficult in part because some greedy entrepreneurs 
continued to sell the wine despite a mass media campaign warning 
people of the deadly liquor 
the official china news service reported that officials from one 
city district searched more than 60 businesses saturday and 
confiscated more than 545 gallons of the poison alcohol

the white house national security adviser says 
he believes west germany can cope with the thousands of east german 
refugees crossing its border but concedes the situation may be 
explosive 
west germany can handle it brent scowcroft said sunday on 
the cbstv program face the nation but he added were 
making plans for whatever might happen 
it would be easy for something to happen something 
unexpected which could turn what is still even despite a million 
people a relatively orderly process into chaos or an explosion 
scowcroft said 
the separation of germany into two parts since world war ii has 
been a recurrent source of eastwest tension 
the democratic reforms sweeping the soviet bloc have rekindled 
the german question because said scowcroft there is no east 
german nation they distinguish themselves only by their political 
and economic system so that to the extent that they reform they 
undercut their reason for existence 
scowcroft predicted that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
in his planned dec 23 summit with president bush will not ask 
the west for massive credits for poland and hungary as they move 
out of the soviet orbit 
i dont think his intention is to throw eastern europe to the 
west to bail out said scowcroft i think he is using 
developments in poland and hungary to bolster his own attempts at 
reform

the government has cheated itself out of 
millions of dollars by misinterpreting legislation that specifies 
who uses federally subsidized water says a general accounting 
office report released today 
the congressman who wrote the law blames the interior department 
and the gao advises congress to close loopholes that let interior 
interpret the law the way it does 
the law was written for states where water is scarce primarily 
the west california farmers have been the greatest beneficiaries 
of the loopholes 
wealthy farmers in californias central valley have subverted 
the intent of federal water laws and top interior department 
officials aware of the abuse declined to take corrective action 
said rep george miller dcalif 
miller said he rewrote the law in 1982 governing the cost of 
federal water to western farmers so that large farms would receive 
a limited amount of cheap federally subsidized water 
only farms of 960 acres or less would be eligible 
but owners of large farms got around the law by reorganizing 
into 960acre tracts that qualified for the subsidies 
congressional expectations have not been met said the gao 
which is congress investigative arm 
the interior department however said it is following 
congressional intent although spokesman joe hunter of the 
departments bureau of reclamation said he had not seen the gao 
report and did not want to comment on specifics in it

tad tuleja may have attended too many 
academic parties where names dropped like a shower of perrier or 
maybe it was the plethora of publications he dug through as a 
student of literature 
whatever it was tuleja by day a writing instructor at the 
university of massachusetts school of management now spends much 
of his time engaged in what he calls mockademia books that 
poke fun at scholarly research 
his latest work the catalog of lost books is a collection 
of titles of imaginary research such as salamanders are people 
too and canary row a takeoff on the title of steinbecks 
cannery row tulejas version is the tale told by a canary 
taken into coal mines in the 1930s to check the quality of air 
in lost books the premise is that despite the tons of 
treatises lining bookstores there were books so outlandish they 
have been buried from the first book a story in stones from a 
prehistoric cave to a new age classic ayuh speaks he lists 
100 lost books 
i did a lot of work in literature as a young man and i got 
real sick of it the catalog is my revenge tuleja said a grin 
taking the sting out of his assessment 
probably the vast majority of people in academia are 
bright and interesting he said but theres always those 
that are around that are into dropping names in 16 languages 
you only need a few irritating moresubtlethanthou people

most people remember martin luther king 
jr and the ultimate price he paid in the struggle for racial 
equality but few know of william moore and his oneman march 
against segregation or emmett till who was shot mutilated and 
dumped in a river for speaking to a white woman 
the creators of the nations first monument to the martyrs of 
the civil rights movement hope to change that preserving the 
memories of fallen heroes and inspiring young people to carry on 
their work 
the stark black civil rights memorial was dedicated sunday in 
montgomery the cradle of the confederacy and the city where 
king began the national movement for racial justice with a boycott 
of buses in 1955 and 1956 
im really thankful that hes there said mary moore 
birchard of birchardville pa moores wife when he was gunned 
down near attalla in 1963 this is the first recognition bill has 
received in 26 years 
i was just overwhelmed said mamie till mobley of chicago 
whose 14yearold son was slain during a visit to money miss in 
1955 i knew it would be moving but its something where you 
cant anticipate how you will feel 
several of the 5000 people who attended the ceremony broke down 
in tears as they touched the cool water that flows across a 
circular black granite slab engraved with a timeline of events of 
the civil rights era 
the slab which bears the names of 32 blacks and eight whites 
who died in the struggle sits in front of a black granite wall 9 
feet high and inscribed with the words king chose from the bible 
for his first speech of the montgomery bus boycott until 
justice rolls down like water and righteousness like a mighty 
stream 
the 700000 monument at the headquarters of the southern 
poverty law center was designed by maya lin architect of the 
vietnam veterans memorial in washington dc 
it shows what did happen and what can happen said julian 
bond georgias first black state legislator since reconstruction 
i think its important that when you lean over to touch a name 
you see your own face reflected in the water 
martin luther king iii a county commissioner in atlanta said 
its a tremendous tribute that will be here through the ages for 
those yet unborn i look forward to coming back again and 
again 
after the ceremony king had his first contact with his fathers 
former confidant the rev ralph david abernathy since the 
publication of the latters recent book which portrayed the elder 
king as having a weakness for women 
abernathy who has been scorned by many black leaders because of 
his book and the walls came tumbling down shook hands and 
spoke briefly with his best friends son 
he expressed the fact that he was hurt abernathy said i 
told him that i love him and hell understand someday hopefully 
the southern poverty law center sharply criticized abernathy for 
walking onto the podium at the end of the ceremony and joining 
hands with others singing of we shall overcome 
his ploy was simply a cheap effort to bring himself back into 
the fold of the civil rights movement after selling out its most 
honored hero it said in a statement 
though kings is the most prominent name on the monument bond 
said it was important to remember other victims of what he called 
american apartheid 
without degradating dr king this was a lot more than a 
martin luther king movement he said many were ordinary 
everyday people who rose above their ordinariness to make a 
difference 
others attending included ethel kennedy widow of robert 
kennedy rosa parks whose refusal to give up her seat to a white 
man prompted the montgomery bus boycott and myrlie evers widow 
slain civilrights leader medgar evars 
hoping to use the monument to reach the young the law center 
published a magazine that tells the story of each person named on 
the monument and sent copies to schools around the country 
on sunday 7yearold herbert franklin touched the name of his 
grandfather herbert lee a voter registration worker who was 
killed by a white legislator in liberty miss in 1961 
ive tried to tell my children how their grandfather was 
killed said lees daughter shirley franklin of kenner la 
now they can see it for themselves

the rev ralph david abernathy whose 
recent memoirs contained embarrassing assertions about the late 
martin luther king jr stirred another furor at the dedication of 
the civil rights monument 
at sundays dedication of the memorial to 40 people killed in 
the civil rights movement abernathy walked unbidden to the front 
to join hands with others in singing we shall overcome 
to many who are angry about his portrayal of the rev martin 
luther king jr as one with a weakness for women the appearance at 
the southern poverty law center was an intrusion 
along with 14000 other persons the rev ralph abernathy was 
invited to attend the dedication of the civil rights memorial 
the law center said in a hastily prepared statement he was not 
asked to sit on the podium or make any comments 
his ploy was simply a cheap effort to bring himself back into 
the fold of the civil rights community after selling out its most 
honored hero 
last week the atlanta minister wrote to say he wouldnt attend 
officials of the law center said 
after the ceremony abernathy shook hands and exchanged brief 
remarks with martin luther king iii his first contact with the 
king family since his book and the walls came tumbling down 
was published last month 
he said he was hurt and im sorry hes hurt abernathy 
said he expressed the sorrow and grief that i have done to his 
family i told him ive told nothing but the truth and didnt think 
i was revealing anything new 
king a county commissioner in atlanta left quickly after the 
ceremony without speaking to reporters 
abernathys book says king was with two women and fought with a 
third the night before his assassination in memphis tenn on 
april 4 1968 
many black leaders say the book betrayed the man who made 
abernathy his secondincommand during the turbulent civil rights 
era 
johnnie carr who heads the montgomery improvement association 
the elder king founded during the 1950s bus boycott shook her 
finger at abernathy after the ceremony and was visibly upset about 
his book 
well talk later she told him 
rep john lewis dga one of those who criticized the book 
said he still considered abernathy a friend 
i have no malice no ill feeling lewis said an occasion 
like this brings people together and helps them forget about 
conflict 
abernathy said he regrets nothing about the book 
in the last speech he made and i quote martin said ralph 
david abernathy is my best friend in the world he said he 
would have wanted me to reveal that he was a human being

kansas city area voters faced with one 
of the nations worst drug problems will decide tuesday whether to 
raise taxes by 14 million a year to fight back 
were doing everything we can right now with the money we 
have jackson county prosecutor albert riederer told a church 
group last week the additional money he said would be used for 
more police prosecutors courts and drug treatment programs 
but some community leaders dont like the way the money from the 
proposed onequartercent county sales tax would be divided some 
say 30 percent of the additional money isnt enough for treatment 
programs that have sixweek to sixmonth waiting lists for poor 
addicts 
if you can pay your own way its no trouble said dianne 
cleaver who runs the mental health department at swope parkway 
health services but if you cant we cant help you its 
criminal to keep these people out when they want help 
other groups complain officials arent using the crimefighting 
resources they already have 
rev michael roach whose coalition of innercity churches wants 
officials to place drug treatment centers on public land and use 
health safety and fire codes to shut down drug houses said his 
group supports the tax 
but what we really need is for the city to make this its first 
priority thats what would really help roach said 
alvin brooks the citys human relations director whose ad hoc 
group against crime has rallied the black community to march 
outside crack houses agrees the tax is flawed but he thinks it 
will pass 
its going to pass because people are afraid he said 
they dont know what to do to stop this drug problem if they 
vote for this at least they feel theyve done something 
many agree the money would only scratch the surface of kansas 
citys drug problem 
the area was shocked last year by 136 killings the 
ninthhighest rate in the country according to the fbi about 40 
percent of those were related to drugs up from just 6 percent six 
years ago riederer said 
the federal government has estimated that the area the 
nations 29th largest metropolitan area ranks sixth in the 
availiability of crack three years ago police presented 60 drug 
cases to the county prosecutors office this year the office 
already has seen 700 
the quartercent sales tax which all county residents can vote 
on would generate 98 million or 14 million each of the seven 
years it continues 
we know in general that people say theyre willing to pay if 
the money is earmarked for drugs riederer said if we can get 
that word out we have a legitimate chance

barry sadler who cowrote and sang 
the hit vietnam warera ballad of the green berets died 14 
months after being shot in guatemala where he reportedly was 
training anticommunist contra fighters 
he was 49 
sadler who suffered brain damage in the mysterious sept 7 
1988 shooting died sunday at the veterans administrations alvin 
c york medical center hospital spokesman albert archie said a 
cause of death wasnt given and an autopsy will be performed he 
said 
thenarmy staff sgt sadler helped write the ballad while 
recuperating from a leg wound he suffered while serving as a medic 
in vietnam the song the no 1 hit in the country for five weeks 
in 1966 glorified the fighting men of the special forces during 
the early days of americas involvement in vietnam 
he went on to write 20 adventure books featuring a mercenary 
named casca but never repeated the musical success of the ballad 
which sold 9 million singles and albums his other efforts included 
producing and writing a bicentennial year album called of thee i 
sing 
he was a very loyal person with oldfashioned prinicples 
said a friend bill parrish of nashville he was a solider that 
was his job he talked of caring for people and had established a 
trust fund for orphans in vietnam 
in recent years he spent time in central america 
sadler was shot in the head as he got into a taxi in what 
authorities said was apparently a robbery attempt the crime 
remains unsolved 
according to one friend duke faglier sadler helped with 
firearms training for the usbacked contras in their fight to 
overthrow the nicaraguas leftist government 
after sadler was shot in guatemala city faglier recounted death 
threats sadler had received during five years living in guatemala 
im sure it made us less than popular faglier said of the 
training without saying who financed the effort 
faglier said he shared quarters with sadler in central america 
but another friend col lew millet of idyllwild calif 
discounted sadlers soldier of fortune image he said his friend 
went to central america as a soldier and medic 
he liked the people there millet said i dont think 
barry was directly involved as a soldier of fortune it keeps you 
young to stay in touch with your old profession and that was 
barrys interest 
since the shooting he has been hospitalized in cleveland or at 
the va hospital here named for the world war i hero and tennessee 
native known as sgt york friends recently described sadler as 
lucid and able to use one arm though at times during his

decisions for himself

college students often are willing to cheat and 
are obsessed with grades and careers but lack basic skills they 
should have learned in high school according to a poll of 
professors 
despite this disdain for students and dissatisfaction with 
autocratic administrators more college teachers are satisfied 
with their jobs than five years ago according to the poll released 
sunday 
twothirds of the 5450 campus faculty polled by the carnegie 
foundation for the advancement of teaching believe there has been a 
widespread lowering of standards in us higher education 
threequarters consider their students seriously unprepared in 
basic skills and 68 percent believe colleges spend too much time 
and money teaching students what they should have learned in high 
school 
public education despite six years of reform is still 
producing inadequately prepared students concluded the survey 
the condition of the professoriate attitudes and trends 1989 
it was the fourth survey of its kind since 1969 
fiftyfive percent agreed that most undergraduates at their 
schools only do enough to get by 70 percent believed students 
have become more gradeconscious and 84 percent agreed that 
students have become more careerist in their concerns 
fortythree percent said students are more willing to cheat to 
get good grades 
professors were hardly more flattering about their bosses 64 
percent rated the administration on their campus either fair or 
poor a percentage hardly changed from surveys in 1984 and 1975 
sixtynine percent regarded administrators as autocratic 
only half felt their college or university is managed effectively 
on the other hand more faculty members expressed overall 
satisfaction with their professional lives than five years ago 
only 20 percent thought that this is a poor time for young 
people to consider academic careers compared with 50 percent in 
1984 
seventyseven percent felt exciting things were taking place in 
their disciplines and an identical percentage disagreed with the 
statement if i had it to do over again i would not become a 
college teacher 
nearly half 49 percent believed job prospects have improved 
for undergraduates in their fields 
fortyeight percent rated their salaries as good or excellent 
up from 40 percent five years ago but twothirds still believed 
their salaries have failed to keep up with inflation 
the campus adage publish or perish appears as true as ever 
54 percent believed its difficult to gain tenure without 
publishing compared with 55 percent in 1984 in 1975 just 46 
percent felt that way and in the first such carnegie survey in 
1969 the number was 41 percent 
professors in all disciplines but engineering also gave a 
ringing endorsement to liberal arts 56 percent agreed that 
undergraduate study in america would be improved if there were less 
stress on specialized training and more on liberal education 
compared with 51 percent in 1984 
only 19 percent of engineering faculty felt that way 
the good news is that faculty are more committed to liberal 
education than five years ago and our conclusion is that the 
profession is healthier now said foundation president ernest l 
boyer in an interview 
on the dark side are the harshly negative faculty feelings 
about the academic preparation of their students 
the survey conducted in february by mail by the wirthlin group 
of mclean va had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 1 
percentage point 
there are approximately 489000 fulltime college faculty in 
us institutions of higher education according to federal 
statistics

the new president lawnker rene mouawad 
is an art lover who favors christianmoslem reconciliation despite 
his backing by the three largest maronite catholic clans that 
dominate the mountainous north 
mouawad from the rugged region of zghorta is often referred to 
as the cool zghortan 
parliament elected the 64yearold mouawad sunday as the 
countrys ninth president under terms of an arabbrokered peace 
plan aimed at ending a civil war that has killed more than 150000 
people 
mouawad a member of parliament for 32 years was first elected 
for the zghorta region in 1957 when he was 32 
his wife naila hails from the issa khoury clan they and the 
mouawads are allied with the powerful franjiehs in the northeastern 
zghorta region 
the franjiehs who have their own marada or tigers militia 
are headed by former president suleiman franjieh one of the last 
of the oldstyle maronite warlords 
mouawad graduated from the frenchaffiliated st joseph 
university in christian east beirut with a law degree in 1947 he 
started his own practice in the northern provincial capital of 
tripoli two years later but gave it up when he entered parliament 
he was named minister of telegraphs and telecommunications in 
1961 and held the post until february 1964 he was named minister 
of public works in 1969 and minister of education in 1980 
while he held the education portfolio mouawad sliced through 
sectarian hatreds to organize examinations for christian and moslem 
youngsters whose studies were interrupted by war in 1981 he 
established a zone of legitimacy where all students could take 
their exams 
he requisitioned all schools in the hazmiyeh jomhour and 
fayadiyeh districts east of beirut so students could do their work 
protected by a multisect brigade from the lebanese army it was 
the first time in six years christian and moslem students had been 
able to do that 
mouawads effort was expanded to include students from villages 
in the israelioccupied border enclave in south lebanon 
his love of art led him to sponsor an operation to salvage 1000 
paintings and sculptures from education ministry warehouses set on 
fire in israeli air raids july 18 1982 during israels invasion 
of lebanon 
seventy policemen rescued most of the works from warehouses in 
moslem west beirut and stored them in underground vaults of the 
central bank 
mouawad took part in the 20member national dialogue 
committee formed in september 1975 to find a settlement to the 
civil war then five months old but that peace effort collapsed 
mouawad and his wife married in february 1965 and had their 
first child michael later that year they also have a daughter

the next mayor of spokane will be elected 
on a platform of garbage 
two years after a contract was signed to build a municipal trash 
incinerator the stalled project remains a divisive issue that has 
dominated this years race for mayor 
the lone city council member to oppose the burner is considered 
the frontrunner sheri barnard received 52 percent of the vote in 
septembers mayoral primary nearly double the total of her 
runnerup councilman rob higgins whom she faces in tuesdays 
nonpartisan runoff 
higgins says barnard won the primary because of an 
antiincinerator fringe group that doesnt reflect true public 
opinion he insists the electricitygenerating wastetoenergy 
plant is the best solution to spokanes garbage problem and 
emphasizes that nine of 10 city and county elected officials 
support the project 
its just a matter of time before people realize theyre 
right he said 
however one poll suggests that time hasnt come the poll 
published last week by the spokesmanreview and spokane chronicle 
showed barnard leading higgins by 46 percent to 27 percent 
both candidates have tried to raise other issues but have been 
unable to shift the focus from the 134 million waste disposal 
system built around the incinerator 
barnard says she is the only elected official who has listened 
to residents who tried unsuccessfully to get a vote on the 
incinerator in 1987 the state supreme court disallowed the attempt 
to place the issue on the ballot 
opponents say the burner would harm residents health and the 
environment 
seventy percent of the people wanted to vote on this in 1987 
and that vote was denied to them theyre still very angry over 
that barnard said 
she said opponents also were angered that the plants location 
was moved to a site near spokane international airport without a 
public hearing 
higgins maintains that the plant would pose no significant 
risks and that more hearings have been held about it than any 
other public works project in spokane 
higgins has warned that canceling the project would risk 
spokanes economic development cancellation would cost 55 million 
to 70 million he said barnard places the amount at 12 million 
and said that would be far less costly than paying off construction 
bonds over 20 years 
higgins has attacked barnard for offering no workable 
alternative to the trash burner she says she favors more recycling 
and has suggested shipping spokanes solid waste to a new regional 
landfill building a stateoftheart landfill in spokane county or 
building an industrial composting plant

gambling supporters are betting they can 
persuade a skeptical governor and legislators to follow the lead of 
gary voters and approve construction of casinos on the citys lake 
michigan shoreline 
voters in this economically depressed steel town endorsed casino 
gambling by a wide margin in a nonbinding referendum saturday 
setting the stage for a battle in the 1990 general assembly over 
casino legislation 
an opportunity for jobs and economic revitalization thats 
going to be the pitch said state rep earline s rogers dgary 
in the absence of the state coming up with a way to solve our 
problems weve come up with something ourselves 
democratic gov evan bayh tempered his opposition to the idea in 
comments after the vote but only slightly 
im opposed to casino gambling but im willing to sit down 
and look at all the arguments for and against and i have yet to do 
that bayh said you never say never 
theres little chance a casino bill would get far in the 1990 
general assembly session if the governor threatens a veto said 
house republican speaker paul s mannweiler 
democratic mayor thomas v barnes and other gary casino 
advocates believe the city could support five lakefront 
casinohotels which would create 25000 casinorelated jobs and 
another 10000 jobs for construction workers 
those figures coupled with a 604 percent vote in favor of 
casinos make a strong case casino advocates believe of the 
22042 people who voted 13309 favored casinos and 8733 or 396 
percent were opposed turnout was 323 percent 
the more we tell our story the more people look at the 
numbers the more inclined they are to look at the opportunity 
favorably said robert spolyar a lobbyist for casino operator 
resorts international of atlantic city nj i think weve got a 
50 percent chance and im conservative 
bayh said he believed the referendum result is important but 
uncompelling given the low voter turnoutt 
the mayor said the turnout was modest because of the citys 
firstever saturday voting an experiment with electronic voting 
machines that intimidated some voters and the decision to save 
money by opening just 18 polling places instead of the usual 155 
any effort to bring gambling here faces an uphill battle because 
of moral objections mannweiler said 
in my mind even though gary says this is a localoption 
issue that we ought to help gary help themselves casino gambling 
is not something i look very favorably on seeing in the state of 
indiana anywhere said mannweiler

lawyers for a driver who allegedly drank 
as much as a case of beer before a fiery crash that killed 27 
members of a church youth group hope to turn the murder trial into 
a forum on school bus safety 
the crash the nations secondworst involving a school bus and 
most deadly blamed on drunken driving already has prompted 
sweeping safety proposals from the national transportation safety 
board 
and the judge who will preside over the trial set to begin 
wednesday has ruled that attorneys for defendant larry mahoney can 
introduce evidence that the design of the 12yearold bus 
contributed to the smokeinhalation deaths of 24 children and 3 
adults on may 14 1988 
mahoneys pickup truck was traveling the wrong way on interstate 
71 outside carrollton near the ohiokentucky line when it slammed 
into the school bus carrying members of the first assembly of god 
among the group returning home to radcliff from an outing at a 
cincinnati amusement park one adult and 39 youths escaped some 
with serious injuries 
the crash blocked the front door and sent choking clouds of 
smoke through the bus as seat covers burned 
after studying the crash the ntsb in march urged that the 
oldest 20 percent of the nations school buses be taken off the 
road because of safety flaws the board also recommended stricter 
standards for fuel tank protection emergency exits and the 
flammability of seat covers on school buses 
defense attorney bill summers said the defense will try to 
convince jurors the buss design flaws are at least partly to blame 
for the deaths 
no one died or was injured by the accident itself summers 
said last week 
he complained that mahoneys reputation was damaged in ntsb 
hearings the attorney likened the hearings to the salem witch 
trials but said mahoney acknowledges a role in the deaths and 
injuries 
he believes that he had a part in it yes summers said 
adding hes not a murderer 
special prosecutor paul richwalsky will argue that mahoney is 
responsible for the deaths under a 1984 state law that makes a 
drunken driver guilty of murder if he wantonly engages in conduct 
which creates a grave risk of death of another person 
rejecting the bussafety reasoning richwalsky said the 
defense is always looking for somebody or something else to blame 
the defendants bloodalcohol level was found to be 026 percent 
90 minutes after the accident and an ntsb expert testified during 
board hearings that at the time of the 1055 pm accident it 
likely would have been 029 percent 
that is nearly three times the states definition of drunken 
driving and twothirds of a lethal dose of alcohol said ntsb 
investigator john moulden who estimated mahoney would have 
consumed a case 24 cans of light beer to reach that level 
summers ruled out a lastminute pleabargain before the carroll 
circuit trial begins 
the defense argued in pretrial motions that blood test evidence 
being used by richwalsky should be excluded as illegally obtained 
but judge charles satterwhite rejected that contention 
the ntsb concluded the probable cause of the accident was 
mahoneys drunkenness contributing to the deaths the board found 
was the puncturing of the buss fuel tank and the resulting fire 
as well as its flammable seat cushions and bench seats that partly 
blocked the rear emergency door the kentucky medical examiner 
blamed the deaths on smoke inhalation and said none of those aboard 
was seriously injured by the impact

art is not nice intones macheath also 
known as mack the knife the villainous dandy of londons soho 
underworld 
it is an opinion that the director and much of the cast of a 
new heavyhanded production of 3 penny opera affirm over and 
over during what seem like three long acts 
the quirky spelling of its title aside this revival which 
opened sunday at broadways luntfontanne theater offers few 
surprises or insights into a classic piece of musical theater its 
main draw at least at the box office is sting the goldenhaired 
rock star making his broadway debut as mack 
sting certainly looks the part a sinister sexy peter pan done 
up in waist coat spats and white gloves his acting has a 
rudimentary charm but he has trouble barking out the savage lyrics 
michael feingolds new translation of bertolt brecht and 
negotiating composer kurt weills difficult melodic line 
thats one of the shows problems sting is the weakest 
performer in the musical and macheath is its centerpiece its his 
brutal story that brecht and weill tell with such irony mack 
secretly marries the virginal polly peachum daughter of a big soho 
crime boss her parents plot to have him hanged and he goes in 
jail eventually mack ends up on the gallows only to be pardoned 
before the noose is tied around his neck 
brecht and weill told their story with wicked glee but much of 
it is smothered here by director john dexter his bunch of ragtag 
ruffians and dispossessed are particularly unconvincing they mouth 
brechts messages about the downtrodden but look as if they are 
just playing at being poor 
in true brechtian style a white curtain swirls across the stage 
between scenes and song titles are projected onto screens on 
either side of the stage a narrator introduces each scene he also 
gets to sing mack the knife the one song everyone knows from 
the score 
the narrator is played by ethyl eichelberger a cadaverous 
baldheaded ray bolger lookalike the looselimbed eichelberger 
gets the majority of choreographer peter gennaros meager dance 
steps except for a wan tango for sting and suzzanne douglas one 
of macheaths brothel playmates there is little formal movement in 
the show 
other cast members have a good handle on the musics peculiar 
style georgia brown as the revengeful mrs peachum seizes the 
score with a zestiness missing from the rest of the production 
alvin epstein as her equally unremorseful husband exudes a fine 
comic sensibility so does kim criswell as lucy brown a spurned 
girlfriend who helps mack escape from jail she also possesses one 
of the strongest voices in the cast 
nancy ringham temporarily replacing the indisposed maureen 
mcgovern is a real find an actress who can sing her polly 
peachum is sweet but not simpering a woman who quickly embraces 
the criminal life of her husband 
the scenic design by jocelyn herbert confines the show rather 
than liberating it the small orchestra is perched above the 
playing area forcing everything to be played down front center 
stage the thin settings from stable to shop to brothel to prison 
to the gallows fly down from the proscenium arch or barrel in from 
the wings 
dexters last broadway show m butterfly had a surprising 
amount of theatricality for a play a perfect combination of 
setting costumes lighting and the right actors now dealing with 
a musical he restricts his imagination and the characters to 
reiterating what brecht and weill want to say 
first comes the feeding then the moral code goes one of 
brechts more trenchant lines but with this new 3 penny opera 
its impossible to care who eats whom or what to survive only the 
message gets batted home now with deadening results 
in other reviews 
the play may have sting but it has no sting wrote howard 
kissel in mondays daily news nothing about this production 
suggests that live theater can be as exciting as mtv 
sting is a stiff onstage frank rich wrote in todays 
editions of the new york times and far from trying to tart up 
threepenny opera for broadway mr dexter makes the show look so 
spartan that by contrast our town might seem decadent 
clive barnes in mondays new york post gave a favorable review 
praising the show as quite effortlessly the best musical in 
town this season next season and for anticipated time 
shiftless shifty and determinedly dishonorable sting has a 
natural presence and makes a debonair banditvillain said barnes

a leading tamil rebel group raided 
camps of rival factions in an eastern district leaving 47 dead in 
the first major intertamil clash since indian peacekeeping forces 
withdrew military officials said today 
two supporters of the rebel group that launched the attack were 
publicly executed in retaliation area residents said 
one tamil activist warned of a bloodbath now that the 
indians are gone from the area 
sundays fighting took place at tampiluvil and tamputte villages 
20 miles southeast of ampara town 
military officials who cannot be identified under briefing 
rules said about 250 members of the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam raided two military camps run by rivals and killed 41 men at 
least six tigers also were killed in the fighting they said 
the tigers are the largest and most militant of the minority 
tamil groups fighting a 6yearold separatist war with the 
government 
angered by sundays attack members of the eelam peoples 
revolutionary liberation front publicly executed two tiger 
supporters in neighboring akkaraipattu according to residents 
contacted by telephone 
residents who spoke on condition of anonymity said the two 
were shot 
the camps raided by the tigers apparently are run by a shadowy 
group known as the tamil national army a militia organized by 
former rebel groups to keep order in the area 
a tiger leader in colombo who confirmed the attack said 
action has been taken to dismantle the illegal tamil national 
army he spoke on condition of anonymity and did not eleborate 
military officials said 140 members of the civilian volunteer 
force and tamil national army were either captured by the tigers or 
surrendered during the attack the tigers also drove away two 
tractor loads of weapons including 100 rifles they said 
a leader of the eelam revolutionary organization a tamil group 
closely associated the tigers warned of more clashes 
there is no proper apparatus to look the lawandorder 
situation which means there will be a bloodbath among the 
groups velupillai balakumar told reporters today 
however sri lankan army commander lt gen hamilton wanasinghe 
said sunday that troops had been rushed to the area to halt 
violence 
india withdrew about 4000 soldiers from ampara district two 
weeks ago heightening fears of intertamil fighting 
the fighting marked a new phase in the struggle by the tamil 
tigers and other guerrilla groups for a separate tamil homeland in 
the north and east 
most groups gave up the armed uprising under an indiamediated 
accord in july 1987 the tamil tigers briefly accepted the 
agreement but later rejected it 
indian soldiers came to sri lanka to supervise the accord the 
force has been withdrawn in phases and the remaining 36000 
soldiers are scheduled to leave by dec 31 
tamil militants are demanding a separate nation claiming 
discrimination by the majority sinhalese 
tamils are mostly hindus and make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people the predominantly buddhist sinhalese comprise 75 
percent of the population and dominate the government and military

greeces political crisis deepended again 
today after the conservative new democrats for the second time in 
five months narrowly missed achieving a parliamentary majority in 
national elections 
a tough period of bargaining was expected to begin shortly on 
forming a new government with the countrys three major parties 
widely divided over economic policy and the presence of us 
military bases 
the result of sundays election could be another life for 
andreas papandreous socialists who were felled in junes vote due 
in part to a banking scandal that has led to the former prime 
minister being indicted 
a government dominated by the socialists would almost certainly 
include communists 
with 98 percent of the vote counted new democracy led by 
constantine mitsotakis had 463 percent for 148 seats in the 
300seat parliament 
that was three more than it won in june but three short of the 
number needed to control the government after eight years of 
socialist rule and a brief coalition administration 
papandreous panhellenic socialist movement or pasok won 407 
percent of the vote for 128 seats a gain of three the 
communistled coalition of the left and progress got 108 percent 
of the vote and 21 seats a loss of seven 
the other three seats went to independents a leftist backed 
jointly by pasok and the coalition a greekmoslem and an 
environmentalist for the first time in greeces political history 
without a doubt our political life is entering a difficult 
phase mitsotakis told a news conference on sunday e was 
expected to receive a presidential mandate within 48 hours to try 
forming a new government 
after the june election his party joined with the communistled 
coalition of the left and progress in an unusual alliance to launch 
investigations of scandals under papandreou 
that administration resigned last month after parliament 
indicted papandreou on charges of involvement in the 
multimilliondollar banking scandal and of ordering wiretapping of 
the telephones of his friends and foes 
papandreou has denied the charges 
it gives us special satisfaction that after the june 
elections we have had such a significant rise despite the 
unbelievable barrage of attacks against us and despite the fact 
that we were out of the government he told reporters on sunday 
the leftist coalitions loss of seven seats in sundays poll 
suggested their supporters were unhappy about the alliance with 
conservatives 
the communists vowed before the election that they would not 
work with the conservatives again however they also said they 
would not support the socialists with papandreou as leader 
after the socialists strong showing it seemed certain that 
they would insist on keeping papandreou in place 
the athens stock exchange today reflected disappointment in the 
election results 
every stock opened lower this morning apparently reacting to 
the economic uncertainty we are in store for said a broker 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the daily kathimerini newspaper which supports the 
conservatives called for a repeat of the successful 
cooperation between new democracy and the leftist coalition 
mitsotakis 71 campaigned on promises to cut the governments 
heavy role in the economy and strengthen ties with nato and the 
united states he accuses the former socialist government of 
ruining the economy 
papandreou 70 promised to boost pensions and other benefits 
he said he would hold a referendum before approving any new base 
treaty with the united states 
the coalition wants to remove us bases from greece and favors 
a strictly controlled economy 
the inconclusive elections in june ended a 15year period of 
stable government dominated by papandreou and another charismatic 
politician prowestern constantine caramanlis who founded new 
democracy in 1974 
sundays was the sixth election since the return to democracy 
after the 196774 military dictatorship

one evening at the us embassy in moscow four 
balalaikas serenaded vladimir horowitz on his return to his native 
land after more than a half century suddenly the virtuoso pianist 
grabbed a fork and started tinkling his own accompaniment on the 
empty bottles at his table 
he would do things nobody else would dare like a volcanic 
rock opening said mark sydorak a pianist and recording engineer 
earlier that evening in 1986 horowitz drew tears from a soviet 
audience when he appeared on stage in the communist country he had 
vowed never to see again 
but horowitz who died sunday at the age of 85 had never really 
left 
through his playing breathed the grand russian romantic style 
that is ending with his death a fiery explosion of technique 
emotion and elegance 
he hypnotized us we were jumping out of our seats said 
vladimir viardo a soviet pianist in new york who was in the 
audience for that moscow concert 
a whole epoch went away with his death we have lost a branch 
of pianism an oldfashioned elegant style that we will never 
meet again he was a direct descent of the school of the 19th 
century said viardo who is the only soviet artist allowed to 
move to the west while retaining his citizenship 
we all thought he was going to live forever he was so 
joyful he added 
as horowitzs concerts became more infrequent people flocked to 
each one as if going on a pilgrimage 
the biggest mistake that people made is that they classified 
him as some sort of a supertechnician i think his greatest asset 
was in his musicianship said sydorak he was well beyond any 
pianist multidimensional as opposed to other greats such as 
artur rubinstein 
the aura he generated was only enhanced by his absence from the 
stage from 1953 to 1965 after he reportedly suffered a nervous 
breakdown but the highstrung neurotic sensibility that brought 
him to that edge also nourished his playing 
horowitzs pianistic electricity was indelibly marked by that 
personality his enormous lightningquick fingers drew the most 
surprising pianissimos and powerful fortissimos from the keyboard 
long after he became a musical icon an almost childlike 
insecurity pushed him to prove himself again and again 
he felt that his fingers were made out of glass and that they 
would break said sydorak who has heard every concert horowitz 
played in new york since his comeback in 1965 he was scared of 
the stage but he came back because he longed for the stage 
to reassure the pianist horowitzs psychiatrist reportedly 
stood in the wings during the performances 
and as his age grew so did horowitzs other eccentricities 
he refused concerts in any place that could not produce filet of 
sole for his meals prepared by his travelalong cook 
also traveling with him was the only instrument on which he 
would play the steinway concert grand that was a gift from the 
piano maker on the occasion of horowitzs wedding in 1933 horowitz 
allowed it to be adjusted only by one technician franz mohr for 
the unique belllike resonance that filled the great concert halls 
and later televisions of the world 
what one saw towering above the keyboard were horowitzs 
sprightly amused eyes still animated by a curiosity that spilled 
into his fresh witty musical explorations 
horowitz pranced lightly on his personal keyboard specially 
made so he didnt have to push the keys down far and could play in 
an unusual almost flat position 
he would play with flat hands his technique was especially 
elegant he had inner power the little passages made you 
ticklish said viardo he had extreme inner freedom and 
musicality he was just pure music with a great release inside 
as he passed his 80s horowitz changed his repertoire replacing 
some of the flashiest most difficult pieces with the elegant 
simplicity of mozart or the depth of bach 
but his technique did not deteriorate said sydorak 
neither did his need for approval 
he was praising himself all the time he needed it but he 
got the praise said viardo his art was profound he was not

president mikhail s gorbachev told economists to 
be cautious as they try to ease shortages and strengthen the ruble 
because he said consumers will rebel against radical change 
according to a report published today 
gorbachevs comments were aimed at economists who argue that 
imposition of a market economy could quickly solve the problem of 
shortages and bolster the nearly worthless soviet currency 
i know only one thing that after two weeks such a market 
would bring the whole nation out on the streets and sweep out any 
government even one declaring devotion to the people he said 
economists must not only take into account what the economy 
needs but what people are willing to accept politically gorbachev 
said 
we must look at how much this or that proposal takes reality 
into account and how it will be accepted and digested in the minds 
of the people the soviet leader told a conference of economic 
specialists 
the comments were reported today in the communist party daily 
pravda it did not say when the conference was held 
gorbachev reiterated that the country must not turn back to its 
old administrative methods or embrace capitalism 
he said the current economic woes stem from a reform program 
that has not been completely worked out yet 
the changes are aimed at developing a still illdefined 
socialist market system 
economist oleg t bogomolov a prominent economist who sits on 
the congress of peoples deputies and directs the institute of the 
world socialist system complained of large social limitations 
in economic policy to steady the plunging value of the ruble 
its impossible to touch prices seriously its impossible to 
freeze salaries he said 
gorbachev said work was under way on a comprehensive program of 
economic reforms that would be presented to the congress 
presumably when it meets in december 
he did not give details but he said the changes would deal with 
the countrys finances and the consumer market as well he also 
said they would further refine the strategy of reform

the soviet union today eulogized native son 
vladimir horowitz as a musical phenomenon whose brilliance belonged 
to neither the united states nor the soviet union but to the world 
horowitz born in kiev in imperial russia in 1904 died sunday 
in new york where he had lived more than 60 years he was 85 
he left this country in 1925 and returned only once 61 years 
later enrapturing fans in concert halls in moscow and leningrad 
this death is a tremendous loss not only for musicians but 
for the whole world since horowitz was one of the greatest 
phenomena of our time said boris pokrovsky the artistic 
director of moscows bolshoi theater 
he belonged to all peoples all countries not russia or 
america thank god that something at least was recorded for 
posterity pokrovsky said 
the death of horowitz was reported too late in new york on 
sunday to make todays edition of the only national daily newspaper 
that publishes on monday the communist party paper pravda 
but official radio moscow and the tass news agency both issued 
reports today a holidary preceding tuesdays celebration of the 
72nd anniversary of the bolshevik revolution 
radio moscow recalled horowitzs return to his native land in 
april 1986 and said his performances in halls filled to capacity 
are still alive in the memories of music lovers in this country 
tass called him a remarkable improvisor who emphasized 
emotion in his performances 
despite the suspicions of the cold war years horowitz was 
wellknown in the soviet union 
his return for concerts at moscows tchaikovsky hall and the 
leningrad philharmonic was an outgrowth of improving relations 
between the two superpowers that included growing cultural 
exchanges 
in moscow horowitzs april 20 1986 concert drew hundreds of 
people who lined streets and alleys near the tchaikovsky hall 
asking every passerby if they had an extra ticket only about 400 
tickets for the 1800seat hall went on public sale and the rest 
were given to officials wellknown musicians or handed out by the 
us embassy to music students 
you cant sense his age at all soviet composer alfred 
schnitke said at the time he plays with total freedom but at 
the same time with great control 
vladimir feltsman a young soviet pianist who has since won his 
struggle to emigrate to the united states said of horowitzs 
performance in moscow i have no words i could just go home and 
kill myself happily after hearing this

it is still a crime to insult the 
royal family in the netherlands as a 24yearold dutchman recently 
learned when he was fined 500 guilders 230 for displaying a 
poster depicting queen beatrix as a pig 
most dutch frown on insults to the house of orange whose fate 
and fortunes have been entwined with the low countries for 400 
years 
periodic polls indicate the public overwhelmingly favors 
retaining its constitutional monarchy 
the orange family belongs to the antique furniture that weve 
inherited and it would be unwise to do away with it they might 
be very valuable said historian coenraad tamse of groningen 
university they offer a simple icon of the continuity of dutch 
nationa identity 
since 1898 the dutch have been led by three queens the dour 
wilhelmina a symbol of hope during the fiveyear nazi occupation 
the motherly juliana and now the practical beatrix who has a 
strong sense of her role in dutch life 
beatrix has a very strong notion of historic continuity even 
though nothing could be further apart than the role of 16thcentury 
william and hers said royalty writer fred lammers referring to 
prince william of orange who led the dutch fight for independence 
from spain in the 16th century 
although the 51yearold beatrix is far from a figurehead her 
official statements are closely tailored to fit the policy of the 
elected government 
an attractive woman with the characteristic ruddy cheeks of her 
countrymen beatrix is unpretentious in public and dresses like a 
prosperous middleclass matron 
she and her husband claus a former west german diplomat mix 
easily with the public and eschew extravagance 
but beatrix reportedly is concerned with maintaining respect for 
the monarchy and insists on being called majesty rather than 
maam which her mother juliana preferred 
over the centuries the house of orange has survived financial 
and romantic scandal as well as occupation by napoleons forces in 
17951812 and by hitlers in 194045 both times its members fled 
to england 
its current hallowed image dates from wilhelmina beatrixs 
grandmother who was groomed to fit the mold formed by the 
supposed dutch national traits virtuousness diligence charity 
religiosity and aversion to violence professor tamse said 
wilhelminas bond with her people was irrevocably forged by her 
frequent moraleboosting radio speeches from london during world 
war ii 
periodic scandals have failed to tarnish the orange image 
during the 1950s there was queen julianas reported dependence 
on a faith healer which the media attributed to her depression 
over the nearblindness of her daughter princess christina born 
in 1947 
in 1964 daughter princess irene enraged hardline protestant 
factions by rejecting the royal familys dutch reformed protestant 
faith for roman catholicism to marry prince carlos hugo de 
bourbonparma a pretender to the spanish throne 
julianas husband prince bernhard was dutch industrys 
unofficial ambassador until his implication in the lockheed bribery 
scandal in 1975 
he was stripped of his rank as inspectorgeneral of the dutch 
armed forces but is still highly popular and active in conservation 
issues 
even the royal familys wealth reported to range from 80 
million to 44 billion has failed to incite popular resentment 
beatrix and her family live in huis ten bosch house in the 
woods an estate in the hague visible from the public highway 
except for state occasions beatrix is driven around in a ford 
their three sons study in the staterun university system and 
room with friends 
the heaviest public insult to the monarchy came in 1980 when 
juliana abdicated in favor of beatrix during the inauguration 
dutch monarchs are not crowned stonethrowing squatters rioted 
outside 
in hindsight the inauguration riots had less to do with the 
monarchy than with anything else the housing situation 
unemployment and the like writer lammers said but as

east germanys communist government today 
published the draft of a new law allowing citizens 30 days a year 
of free travel in the west after 19000 east germans joined the 
westward stampede over the weekend 
a cabinet minister urged the communist partys ruling politburo 
to resign and activists planned to stage another prodemocracy 
rally in leipzig tonight to maintain pressure on the government for 
reforms 
an opposition leader reacted coolly to the new travel proposal 
and said authorities will need to do more to gain public trust 
travel is not the primary problem in east germany said 
sebastian pflugbeil a cofounder of new forum the largest 
opposition group too many have left the country already 
the leadership must make other steps to prove it is earnest in 
its reform efforts and to win the trust of the people pflugbeil 
said in an interview with west berlins rias radio station 
the tension between the people and the party has never been so 
great as today he said 
in an apparent bid to discourage further exodus to west germany 
where east germans are automatically granted citizenship the 
government promised to ease restrictions on foreign travel before 
the year is out 
announcing the decision interior minister friedrich dickel said 
on national television sunday night we want to give the 
possibility to all citizens to travel wherever they want without 
any restrictions 
all east german citizens would be allowed to travel freely 
abroad up to 30 days a year he said the draft law will be 
discussed publicly until nov 30 and will then go to parliament it 
should take effect by years end he said 
in addition passport applications will be handled within 30 
days with urgent cases settled in three days or less dickel said 
he indicated that illegal stays in the west would be decriminalized 
only direct violations of the border will be punished dickel 
said indicating this referred to escapes over the border with west 
germany or the berlin wall 
freedom of travel has been a major demand of east germans who 
have taken to the streets by the hundreds of thousands over the 
past month to protest decades of authoritarian rule 
the only country east germans can currently visit without exit 
visas is neighboring communist czechoslovakia through which 
thousands have poured since it opened its western frontier 
about 1 million people took to the streets of east berlin on 
saturday in the largest protest in the nations 40year history 
demanding free elections freedom of speech and an end to the 
communist partys leading role 
the staterun news agency adn on sunday quoted culture minister 
hansjoachim hoffmann as saying the ruling politburo should resign 
to give the new general secretary a real chance 
we need as quickly as possible a new government he was 
quoted as saying 
the countrys new leader egon krenz has promised major 
reforms including freer travel in an effort to staunch the flood 
of refugees that is sapping east germanys labor force of skilled 
young workers 
since august more than 70000 east germans have fled to west 
germany through hungary and via west germanys embassies in prague 
and warsaw 
at least 19000 more fled west after authorities announced 
friday that east germans could travel to west germany from 
czechoslovakia without any restrictions the emigres were however 
considered to be giving up their east germany citizenship 
on sunday thousands of young east german refugees rolled into 
west germany at the rate of more than 100 an hour causing a 
traffic jam that stretched several miles back into czechoslovakia 
today more were arriving but at a slower pace 
in his appeal for personnel shakeups hoffmann also told a 
crowd in leipzig on sunday that he thinks the 42member cabinet 
should be streamlined 
krenz said friday that five elderly politburo members would step 
down two other members of the 21member politburo were dismissed 
when krenz on oct 18 replaced longtime leader erich honecker his 
mentor 
all those removed were closely associated with honeckers 
18year rule as party chief 
in other protests sunday about 10000 demonstrated in dresden 
for action on environmental problems and 10000 protested for 
reforms in wilhelmpieckstadt guben adn said

investigators searched today for five suspects 
in the citys largest drug seizure and continued to extract cocaine 
from drums of a caustic powder that were found in a warehouse 
the suspects may have fled because of news stories about the 
friday raid which reporters learned about from a radio channel 
used by law enforcement officials 
authorities focused their search on a man from peru who heads 
the company that rented the warehouse his colombian wife and three 
others the new york times reported today 
mary cooper an agent and spokeswoman for the drug enforcement 
administration said the street value of the cocaine could reach 1 
billion about 8800 pounds or nearly 4 tons of cocaine were 
removed from drums by saturday 
the work was suspended sunday because the path of the new york 
marathon brought runners past the warehouse and fumes could have 
been dangerous cooper said agents resumed their work today 
the 8800 pounds already extracted was estimated to have a 
street value of more than 700 million cooper said 
at this time the seizure appears to be in the top five 
nationwide she said 
the cocaine was wrapped in plastic bundles and put in drums that 
contained powdered sodium hydroxide which is the active ingredient 
in lye 
the raid was the latest in a series of large drug seizures in 
the united states 
on sept 29 214 tons of cocaine were found in an unguarded 
warehouse near los angeles on oct 5 authorities discovered 9 
tons of cocaine in a house in harlingen texas and about 6 tons on 
a panamanian ship in the gulf of mexico 
the raid in queens occurred after an anonymous tip to the 
brooklyn district attorneys office smugglers apparently believed 
the cocaine packed in plasticwrapped bundles would go 
undiscovered because it was surrounded by sodium hydroxide which 
can burn the skin and damage lungs 
the drugs were believed to belong to the cali cartel one of 
colombias largest cocaine distributors

as thousands more east germans 
cross into the country and strain temporary shelters west 
germanys leaders are urging communist leaders in east berlin to 
move rapidly on fundamental reform 
hansjochen vogel leader of the opposition social democrats on 
sunday appealed to east germans to stay home and push for change in 
their own country 
in an article for the welt am sonntag newspaper vogel said he 
respected the decision of east germans to emigrate to west germany 
but we are appealing to all those who are thinking of 
emigrating to carefully examine whether they should not stay in 
east germany to support the process of democratization and to 
engage themselves in that process he wrote 
ernst breit head of the national trade union federation 
cautioned the refugees not to entertain mistaken notions about life 
in west germany we have to make it clear to them that west 
germany is not paradise 
karl heinz horndasch a spokesman for the federal border police 
in munich said late sunday that the number of temporary shelters 
for the refugees had jumped from four on friday to 25 nationwide 
we are considering now whether we will have to open more 
horndasch said by telephone 
chancellor helmut kohl and other leading politicians called on 
east germanys new leader egon krenz to adopt reforms quickly to 
stop the exodus 
we hope that things will change so that people will not have 
to leave their homeland to find happiness kohl said 
east germany today published the draft of a new law allowing 
citizens 30 days a year of free travel in the west and speeding the 
processing of passport applications the law also would 
decriminalize illegal stays in the west although direct violations 
of the border such as escaping over the berlin wall would be 
punished interior minister friedrich dickel said 
alfred dregger a parliamentary leader in kohls coalition 
government urged the east german leadership to allow free 
elections 
the communist partys monopoly on power is eroding dregger 
said the protest movement is a wild fire that egon krenz and the 
communist party can only put out by free elections 
thousands more east germans flooded into west germany through 
czechoslovakia after their government permitted its citizens for 
the first time to cross to the west through that country with 
nothing more than east german identification papers 
the pace of the weekend exodus slowed today but the tally of 
east german arrivals since saturday was 19000 and still rising 
some germans said east germanys leaders had figuratively 
opened a hole in the berlin wall with the new czechoslovak escape 
route 
driving their sputtering trabants and wartburgs filled with 
stereos luggage and children the refugees needed to travel only 
15 miles from the east german border to reach bavaria in west 
germany 
many of the latest refugees went to temporary shelters 
horndasch the police spokesman said 12500 refugees were in 
military barracks police training centers a gymnasium and other 
temporary shelters he said many were staying three to four days 
before heading off to find housing and jobs 
some local police and relief workers wondered when the crush 
would end 
how long will they keep coming that you have to ask mr 
krenz said uwe luethje a border police officer at the 
schirnding border crossing in northeastern bavaria 
at times sunday the refugees coming over the border at 
schirnding caused traffic jams backed up several several miles into 
czechoslovakia 
horndasch the border policeman in munich said about 1400 more 
refugees were expected later in the day on trains from prague the 
czechoslovak capital 
the people will keep fleeing as long as they can said 
christian schreiber a 23year dental technician from staaken 
outside east berlin 
in addition to the east germans arriving at schirnding and 
waidhaus 10 trains carrying refugees from prague also crossed into 
marktredwitz

supporters of christian leader gen 
michel aoun today roughed up lebanons maronite catholic partriarch 
and forced him to kiss a picture of aoun for supporting a peace 
plan the general opposes police said 
about 100 young aoun supporters stormed the compound of 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir in bkirki north of beirut shortly after 
midnight and ransacked it police said aouns supporters also 
rallied in the streets of east beirut and other christian areas 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said other aoun loyalists stormed at least six other 
churches in the 310squaremile christian enclave early today 
firing automatic rifles in the air and burning tires 
the assaults came a day after parliament elected a maronite 
catholic president as part of an arab leaguesponsored plan 
designed to end lebanons 14yearold civil war 
sfeir the spiritual leader of the maronites lebanons main 
christian sect supported the parliamentarians against aoun 
sfeirs office alleged that a 40man army unit of aouns troops 
assigned to protect the patriarch did not try to stop the 
protesters as they charged the compound in the hills above beirut 
the rioters broke into the patriarchs bedroom dragged him 
out of bed forced him to kneel with two senior aides and 
forced them all to kiss posters of aoun a police spokesman said 
sfeir 68 fled after the onehour assault to his summer 
residence in diman in syriancontrolled north lebanon his office 
said in a statement 
the unrest flared hours after parliamentary deputies forced out 
of beirut after aoun threatened to shell them convened at the 
kleiat airbase in north lebanon and elected maronite deputy rene 
mouawad president to head a national reconciliation government 
mouawad 64 is lebanons ninth president since independence 
from france in 1943 aoun has been living in the presidential 
palace and refused to give it up to mouawad 
on saturday aoun declared parliament dissolved in a bid to stop 
it from meeting to elect the president and ratify the peace plan 
he rejected the plan because it did not set a deadline for the 
withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon 
legislators moved their session to the base beyond the range of 
aouns artillery 
in a speech after his election mouawad a 32year 
parliamentarian called the peace plan approved last month in 
saudi arabia an introduction to a new lebanese republic he 
promised to quickly appoint a cabinet that would patch up broken 
ties and reunite what had been fractured 
the accord increased parliaments seats from 99 to 108 
distributed equally between christians and moslems and curtailed 
presidential powers to give the prime minister and parliament 
speaker both traditionally moslems a larger share in the 
decisionmaking process 
the police spokesman said sfeir urged rioters to leave his 
compound but they were hysterical 
some protesters broke through into the small church in the 
compound and desecrated it by smashing benches and throwing sand 
and rocks on the carpets and paintings the spokesman said 
he said aouns loyalists tore pictures of the patriarch and pope 
john paul ii from the walls and replaced them with posters of aoun 
who is also a maronite 
in east beirut and other christian areas aoun supporters 
blocked key intersections with rocks and blazing tires and chanted 
mouawad will not be allowed into the liberated christian area 
one group drove around beiruts christian sector in a convoy of 
about 50 cars firing automatic rifles in the air honking horns 
and shouting there is no leader but aoun mouawad is a syrian 
lackey 
schools shops restaurants banks government offices and other 
businesses closed throughout the christian enclave in a general 
strike to protest the election 
in a statement broadcast by radio lebanon which is controlled 
by aoun the general told his supporters to limit your protests 
to civilized and peaceful methods 
he remained in the bunker of the hilltop presidential palace in 
suburban baabda east of beirut unwilling to surrender the 
shellwrecked building to mouawad 
asked whether the general would turn over the palace to the new 
president an aoun aide snapped you must be kidding 
the general does not recognize the election how would he turn 
over the palace the symbol of legitimacy to someone whom he 
doesnt recognize as the legitimate president said the aide who 
refused to be named 
mouawad who spent the night at his family mansion in the 
northern mountain resort of ehden drove to nearby diman around 
noon to pay his respects to patriarch sfeir his press office 
said 
men performed folk dances and women sprayed mouawad with rose 
water and rice in a traditional gesture of greeting 
the presidency is yours mouawad is a hero they chanted 
salim hoss who headed a moslem cabinet that has vyed for power 
with aouns christian government for 14 months also drove to diman 
to meet mouawad and sfeir 
hoss a sunni moslem announced his resignation a few minutes 
after mouawad was elected sunday 
lebanon has not held parliamentary elections since 1972 and it 
had been without a president since september 1988 when president 
amin gemayels sixyear term expired and parliament was unable to

backed by mayor art agnos but polls suggest the 
multibilliondollar expenses from the recent earthquake have eroded 
support 
a second san francisco ballot measure would allow unmarried 
couples including homosexuals to formally establish their 
relationships as domestic partners registered partners working 
for the city would be entitled to the same funeral leave benefits 
as married people if their partner dies

organizations and major corporations would increase the sales tax 
to 45 percent from 4 percent to generate 400 million more for 
schools 
proposal b with no organized backing and a tiny budget would 
raise the sales tax to 6 percent cut property taxes some 15 
billion and put about 350 million more into schools 
proposal a has money and b doesnt said state sen dan 
degrow a proposal b backer but they both face an uphill fight 
both or neither could pass if both garner majorities the one 
with the larger one would prevail 
the michigan state chamber of commerce wants voters to reject 
both 
the further we get away from the capitol the better the 
reception said chamber vice president richard studley 
david rohde a political science professor at michigan state 
university said there is indeed a lot of cynicism at least 
about anything that involves spending money and increasing taxes to 
spend money its not impossible but any tax increase has a tough

the soviet coal minister met with striking miners 
in the soviet arctic today but failed to persuade them to end their 
illegal walkout which officials say threatens winter fuel supplies 
mikhail i shchadov met for three hours with strikers from 11 
mines in the pechora basin but did not adequately assure them their 
working social and living conditions would improve said alexander 
petrovsky who attended the session 
miners were promised improved living and working conditions in 
july after a nationwide strike 
workers in the largest mine of the pechora basin struck oct 25 
to protest government delays in fulfilling the promises 
they were joined last week by miners at 10 other shafts and now 
only two mines in the region are working with more than 15000 
miners reported on strike 
shchadov told miners that part of the july decree pledging the 
improvements was being implemented on schedule and that the rest 
was awaiting action by the supreme soviet legislature according to 
petrovsky who spoke in a telephone interview 
petrovsky and strike committee member nikolai a teryokhin who 
was interviewed in moscow said miners were not satisfied with 
shchadovs report and would continue the walkout 
on sunday premier nikolai i ryzhkov said the situation in the 
coal industry creates an inadmissible situation in ensuring vital 
supplies for our people for the work of basic and other sectors of 
the national economy 
ryzhkov in remarks distributed by the official tass news 
agency asked the strikers to show reason and a sense of civic 
duty 
the strike violates a law passed by the soviet legislature last 
month banning walkouts in such vital sectors as energy and defense 
a local court has ruled the strike illegal but has not moved to 
halt it 
government officials are scheduled to meet with miners nov 17 
to review how well the government has kept its promises

the communist party central committee 
today began preparing its program for an upcoming nationwide 
congress that aims to revamp the party and revive its flagging 
fortunes 
during the course of a daylong plenum the committee planned to 
debate ideological changes the preliminary program and the partys 
position on the economic program of the new solidarityled 
government 
we are meeting in an atmosphere shaped by unfavorable social 
moods thus the bigger are party expectations for a bold 
programmatic offer the official news agency pap quoted party 
leader mieczyslaw f rakowski as telling the meeting 
continuing a practice started earlier this fall the party 
briefly allowed reporters in for the opening of the session before 
closing the plenum for debate 
the future course of the party became a key issue after the 
polish communist party became the first in the east bloc to lose 
control of the government with the aug 24 election of prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
in an interview with the party daily trybuna ludu politburo 
member leszek miller said the most important issues are the 
questions not about what we want to achieve but how we want to do 
it 
an internal survey of the party conducted in september indicated 
that 72 percent of the members favored a complete retooling of the 
party starting with its name 
the central committee also planned to discuss procedures for the 
election of delegates to the party congress that are supposed to be 
held under new democratic rules 
it was decided at a plenum oct 3 that the election of the 
delegates should occur by dec 20 
top party members have said the party will transform itself into 
a broad party of leftist and social democratic forces at the 
congress in january 
a party official who refused to be named said one of the most 
important issues at the plenum would be discussion of the partys 
position on the mazowiecki governments economic reform program 
which aims to introduce a marketstyle economy 
in the conditions of the market economy the realization of 
the principles of justice as well as other leftist values is 
especially difficult there are no ready recipes miller said

a woman who says she is hank williams srs 
daughter lost a supreme court bid today for a share of the late 
country music legends copyright royalties 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that cathy yvonne 
stone waited too long before suing over the royalties 
ms stone 36 was born in alabama five days after williams died 
jan 1 1953 at age 29 
her mother bobbie jett and williams signed an agreement a few 
months earlier in which he acknowledged he might be the father of 
the thenunborn child 
the girl first was adopted by lillian stone williams mother 
after mrs stone died the child was adopted by george and mary 
deupree the deuprees in 1967 refused to be included in court 
proceedings to determine whether williams had fathered any children 
other than hank williams jr now a country music star 
mrs deupree first told her adopted daughter in 1973 that the 
elder williams may have been her natural father but ms stone did 
not take any immediate legal action to establish her real parentage 
ms stone waited until 1985 soon after marrying attorney keith 
adkinson to file federal and state court lawsuits seeking a share 
of williams songwriting royalties 
state courts in alabama ruled she was williams daughter but not 
his legal heir 
the 2nd us circuit of appeals based in new york city threw 
out her claim for the royalties last april 
the appeals court which presumed that williams was ms stones 
father said there may have been good reason for her not to sue 
soon after learning the apparent truth 
her delay at least until 1980 may be explained by loyalty to the 
deuprees or out of fear of the notoriety a suit would generate the 
appeals court said but it added there is simply no plausible 
explanation for delay in filing the complaint until september 1985 
ms stones procrastination and delay which silently allowed time 
to slip away remain as the only reason for her failure to bring 
suit earlier 
the appeals court said permitting a suit after so many years 
would be unfair to the other copyright owners including hank 
williams jr 
the case is stone vs williams 89295

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether money given directly to mormon missionaries by church 
members is a deductible donation under federal tax law 
the justices voted to hear the appeal of a mormon couple from 
idaho who were denied tax deductions for subsidizing their two 
sons missionary service 
the church of jesus christ of latterday saints has 67 million 
members and about 35000 fulltime missionaries through the world 
nearly all are supported by relatives or other church members 
the high courts decision expected by july will resolve 
conflicting federal appeals court rulings that allow such 
deductions in six states and ban them in nine states 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last year ruled that the 
internal revenue service correctly refused to treat the donations 
made by harold and enid davis of idaho falls as taxdeductible 
charitable contributions 
such direct donations are not deductible because the mormon 
church does not exercise sufficient control over how the money is 
spent the san franciscobased appeals court said 
its ruling set a binding precedent for nine western states 
idaho arizona alaska california hawaii montana nevada oregon 
and washington 
about 16 million mormons live in the states encompassed by the 
9th circuit 
the denverbased 10th us circuit court of appeals explicitly 
rejected the control requirement adopted by the 9th circuit 
court 
in a ruling that set a binding precedent for colorado kansas 
new mexico oklahoma utah and wyoming the 10th circuit court said 
such direct donations to missionaries are taxdeductible because 
their primary purpose is to further the churchs aims 
the new orleansbased 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled 
that such donations by residents of louisiana mississippi and 
texas may be taxdeductible if the amounts paid match a specific 
request from the church for those amounts 
at issue is that part of the federal tax code defining a 
deductible contribution to charity as a contribution or gift to 
or for the use of a qualifying organization 
bush administration lawyers although contending that the 9th 
circuits interpretation of federal tax law is the correct one 
asked the justices to grant review to the davises appeal 
noting the thousands of missionaries supported by individuals 
government lawyers said the issue presented in this case will 
govern the tax liability of many united states taxpayers 
they added the general issue has ramifications beyond the 
specific context of the churchs missionary program 
the church asks a missionarys family to contribute the 
necessary financing if a family is unwilling or unable to 
contribute the necessary funds the church seeks direct donations 
to the missionaries from other church members in the same community 
the davises spent about 7600 subsidizing their son benjamins 
missionary work in new york city in 198081 and about 1500 for 
their son cecils missionary work in new zealand in 1981 
the subsidies for neither son exceeded amounts set by the church 
the davises made the deduction claims belatedly unsuccessfully 
seeking refunds of 177971 and 261310 respectively for the 
two years 
the case is davis vs us 8998

mozambiques ambassador to the united nations 
described as one of africas richest men lost a supreme court bid 
today to shield himself from a potentially costly divorce lawsuit 
in connecticut 
the justices over one dissenting vote let stand a ruling that 
diplomatic immunity does not protect ambassador antonio deinde 
fernandez from being sued by his estranged wife 
justice harry a blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case 
but four votes are needed to grant such review 
connecticut courts placed an 8 million lien on fernandezs 
property pending the outcome of the divorce case 
the connecticut supreme court ruled last september that barbara 
fernandez should have her day in court to determine whether she is 
entitled to the family home in greenwich conn 
the state court said the vienna convention on diplomatic 
relations does not give the ambassador immunity in the divorce case 
because the government of mozambique issued a waiver permitting the 
connecticut courts to dissolve the marriage 
the state court said it did not have to decide whether mrs 
fernandez would be entitled to sue for a property award even if 
there were no waiver 
the vienna treaty allows mrs fernandezs claim for ownership 
of the family residence to be heard in this case the state court 
said it is for the trial court to determine whether to grant 
her title to the disputed real property 
but the state court said connecticut courts lack authority to 
award mrs fernandez any support payments 
mrs fernandez said her husband has a net worth of more than 75 
million and has admitted to being one of the richest men in 
africa 
the couple married in arlington va in 1961 and were separated 
in early 1985 
in his supreme court appeal fernandez said the divorce suit 
also infringes on his diplomatic immunity by examining his private 
life 
the trial judge will hear evidence about his health his 
finances and the reasons for the divorce fernandez said 
this will require the deepest intrusion into the ambassadors 
most personal affairs factors that would directly challenge the 
prestige and dignity of the diplomat his lawyers said 
asked for their views justice department lawyers said the court 
should reject fernandezs appeal 
the case is fernandez vs fernandez 881042

neither side is willing to budge in the 
machinists strike against the boeing co which vowed not to make 
any new contract offers after union negotiators rejected its latest 
proposal 
they have our best proposal this is our final offer larry 
mckean chief boeing negotiator said sunday 
then they wont get any planes countered tom baker 
president of machinists district lodge 751 boeing will find that 
our members are angry and determined not to be insulted and 
degraded by takeaways and phony number games 
after six days of meetings with a federal mediator talks 
collapsed saturday when union negotiators rejected the last company 
offer the strike began oct 4 
talks were not expected to resume anytime soon 
both sides need some time to make some pretty hard 
decisions mediator doug hammond said if they came back in the 
moods theyre in now they wont get anything done except to snipe 
at each other 
mckean said the new contained improvements in lump sum payments 
overtime and retirement benefits but it had no more money than a 
proposed threeyear pact rejected by the union oct 3 
baker said the union had no intention of putting the latest 
offer before its members because it would be rejected and putting 
it to a vote would only mean more anger 
the machinists represent about 57800 workers including 43300 
in the local district lodge 12000 in wichita kan 1700 in 
portland ore and a few hundred at scattered sites in other 
states 
mckean said an average 10 percent of those represented by the 
machinists are crossing picket lines nationally ranging from 4 
percent in the puget sound area where union membership is 
mandatory to 34 percent in wichita where membership is voluntary 
under state law 
union leaders have maintained the figures are far lower

the supreme court today passed up a chance to 
decide whether huge punitivedamage awards in personalinjury 
lawsuits may be unconstitutional 
the court with one dissenting vote rejected appeals in two 
cases from alabama and one from nevada that raised the issue 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in all three 
cases but four votes are needed to grant such review 
the justices last june ruled by a 72 vote that such 
multimilliondollar awards do not violate the constitutions ban on 
excessive fines but the decision left open the possibility that 
the awards may so exceed actual damages that they violate 
dueprocess rights 
the clause says states may not deprive anyone of property 
without due process of law those wishing to limit punitivedamage 
awards say due process should prohibit unlimited jury discretion in 
civil cases 
left undisturbed were a 6 million judgment an insurance company 
was ordered to pay a nevada stroke victim a 275 million award to 
an alabama woman whose teenage daughter was killed in a car crash 
and a 500000 award to an alabama couple who bought a defective 
mobile home 
in the nevada case combined insurance co of america had been 
ordered to pay 200000 in compensatory benefits and 59 million 
in punitive damages to thomas ainsworth of sparks 
ainsworth suffered a stroke in 1982 while undergoing an 
angiogram in which dye is injected into the blood vessels to find 
out if they are blocked ainsworth had suffered from occasional 
dizzy spells 
the insurance company was sued because it refused to pay a claim 
for 9600 on grounds the stroke was caused by a disease the 
buildup of plaque in the arteries ainsworths policy covered 
accidents but not diseases 
a jury decided the stroke was the result of an accident and the 
insurance companys refusal to pay caused ainsworth and his wife 
cruel and unjust hardship 
one of the alabama cases stemmed from an 80mileperhour drag 
race between thomas eugene clardy and james k kervin in montgomery 
in the earlymorning hours of aug 30 1986 
clardy attempting to pass kervin swung his truck into the 
opposite lane and crashed headon with norma hoffmann 16 clardy 
who was drunk and ms hoffmann were killed 
the girls mother martha hoffmann sanders sued kervin and the 
estate of clardy who owned a real estate company a jury awarded 
her 275 million in punitive damages 
clardys widow debby appealed 
in the other alabama case wayne and carolyn jaye bought a 
vintage enterprises mobile home in 1985 from a dealer in opelika 
ala the vehicle was made at a vintage plant in georgia 
the jayes said there were various problems with the mobile home 
including a ceiling that needed to be replaced the couple said 
some defects were remedied but other attempted repairs were 
inadequate 
a jury in alabama awarded the jayes 20000 in compensatory 
damages and 500000 to punish the manufacturer 
vintage enterprises said the award forced it into bankruptcy and 
to shut down a plant in henderson nc where 150 people were 
employed 
business leaders have clashed for years with lawyers and 
consumer groups over the legitimacy of huge judgments in civil 
cases 
those who oppose the bigmoney awards say they squelch american 
competitiveness and development of new products particularly new 
forms of medical treatment 
consumer activists say punitive damages are a powerful deterrent 
to corporate greed which poses a threat to public safety and 
wellbeing they say smaller compensatory awards may be viewed by 
larger corporations as an acceptable cost of doing business 
some state legislatures reacting to soaring insurance rates 
recently have put caps on how much money can be recovered in 
personalinjury cases no such law was at issue in the cases acted 
on today 
the cases are combined insurance co vs ainsworth 89282 
clardy vs sanders 89440 and vintage enterprises vs jaye

the supreme court today allowed federal 
officials to place price ceilings on natural gas recovered from a 
vast underground reservoir in the texas panhandle 
the court without comment rejected appeals by texas state 
officials and gas producers who challenged orders of the federal 
energy regulatory commission 
at issue were gas reserves under a panhandle area 124 miles long 
and 20 miles wide 
the commission in 1984 identified 37 oil well operators it said 
were interfering with the interstate sale of gas found under the 
same land as the oil wells 
because of the underground formations in the panhandle oil well 
operators often must drill through gasbearing rock to reach the 
lowerlying oil deposits 
the commission said the oil well operators were taking gas 
intended for interstate sales and selling it within texas for 
higher prices 
the natural gas policy act of 1978 permits some hardtoproduce 
gas to be sold at higher prices to encourage gas production the 
law requires gas previously committed to interstate commerce to be 
sold at lower prices 
the texas railroad commission which regulates gas production in 
the state joined the oil well operators in claiming the federal 
agency exceeded its authority and mistakenly classifed the 
panhandle gas 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals in april upheld the 
federal commissions orders saying it found overwhelming support 
for the reasonableness of the agencys decisions 
bush administration lawyers urged the justices to leave the 
appeals court ruling undisturbed 
the cases are railroad commission vs ferc 89196 and walker 
operating corp vs ferc 89394

republicans are bracing for a fierce fight 
over the nomination of black conservative clarence thomas as an 
appeals court judge saying it could rekindle the socalled judges 
war that raged in the reagan era 
if they try to do to clarence thomas what they did to bill 
lucas and bob bork and you might as well throw in john tower then 
its going to be allout bloody war sen orrin hatch rutah 
said after the nomination arrived in the senate last week 
democratic senators are treading warily 
i am one of those who has spoken out for more minority 
representation on the courts but i dont want ideologues says 
sen paul simon dill who like hatch is on the senate 
judiciary committee that will consider thomas nomination will 
he apply the law or will he apply his philosophy 
civil rights forces thus far have been holding their fire but 
for months they have been building a thick dossier on thomas and 
clearly are weighing an intensive fight to block his confirmation 
as a member of the us circuit court of appeals for the district 
of columbia 
that would guarantee a return to the brand of political drama 
that flared last summer when the lawmakers killed the nomination of 
black republican william lucas to become the justice departments 
civil rights chief 
such fierce skirmishing between liberals and conservatives 
accompanied the nominations of robert bork to the supreme court 
daniel manion to the appeals bench and other judicial candidates 
during the reagan administration 
behind the socalled judges war has been a fight for the 
philosophical tone of the federal courts which grew more 
conservative in the eight years that reagan appointees donned 
judicial robes and president bush can carry the change further as 
he fills 57 current vacancies on the federal bench 
actually the administrations laggard pace in finding 
candidates has brought on a lull for most of this year 
bush has sent just 18 judicial nominations to the senate this 
year causing impatience even among senate allies 
until the thomas nomination the only contested judicial nominee 
has been vaughn walker a san francisco attorney who antagonized 
gay rights groups and compounded his problems by waiting months to 
resign from a private club with a history of bias against women and 
blacks 
thomas offers fodder for a more dramatic conflict 
he climbed out of childhood poverty in the rural south 
graduated from yale law school and became a protege of sen john c 
danforth rmo 
however the outspoken 41yearold conservative has been a storm 
center since he became chairman of the equal employment opportunity 
commission more than seven years ago 
a disciple of conservative economist thomas sowell he says that 
government should enforce fairness but in contrast to many black 
leaders rejects any notion that government should compensate for 
the wrongs of the past 
i adhere to the principle that individuals should be judged on 
the basis of individual merit and individual conduct thomas once 
said no one should be rewarded or punished because of group 
characteristics 
civil rights advocates say inaction by thomas has caused 
thousands of job discrimination cases to fall through the cracks 
his actions as head of the eeoc suggest that he lacks the 
commitment to equal justice the qualifications and the judicial 
temperament for a lifetime appointment to one of the nations most 
important courts a group of civil rights groups and labor unions 
told the senate in a letter last week although the letter 
criticized thomas it did not call on senators to reject him but 
only to postpone their decisions until all the information is in 
republican senators are quick with reminders that democrats and 
civil rights groups blocked the confirmation of lucas 
lucas in senate judiciary committee testimony rejected chances 
to criticize recent supreme court decisions limiting civil rights 
laws his answers led rep john conyers dmich to drop his 
endorsement and a number of black officials were among lucas 
critics 
after the nomination died however sen strom thurmond rsc 
and other gop lawmakers complained that a black candidate deserved 
a better chance the gesture amused civil rights leaders who 
remember thurmond as a leading advocate of states rights in the 
days of segregation 
ive been listening to sen thurmond for a long time says 
naacp lobbyist althea simmons its interesting to see that he is 
advocating for blacks when he has been just the opposite 
she said the naacp could announce its decision on thomas within 
seven or eight days and that qualifications not race would be the 
sole criteria 
race has nothing to do with this nomination said nan aron 
of the alliance for justice a leading civil rights organization 
clarence thomas has a record of being chair of the eeoc and he as 
chair was engaged in the enforcement of civil rights in this 
country and it is that record that we must expect the committee 
will scrutinize carefully 
the day after the white house sent the nomination to capitol 
hill danforth told the senate that thomas has one thing going 
against him and that is that he is a black lawyer of fairly 
conservative political and judicial philosophy 
the interest groups that did a job on william lucas in the 
senate judiciary committee are mobilizing again to do a job on 
clarence thomas

prime minister margaret thatcher has weakened her 
position and kicked off the race to succeed her by saying she plans 
to step down after winning another term opposition leaders and 
political observers said 
a prothatcher newspaper today said she had merely stated the 
obvious and that her statements were no cause for astonishment 
mrs thatcher told the sunday correspondent in an interview 
published sunday that she hoped to lead her conservative party to a 
fourth successive election but said it was unlikely she would try 
for a fifth 
i think people would think it was time for someone else to 
carry the torch she told the newspaper 
the sunday times of london said in a commentary mrs thatcher 
has committed a colossal blunder 
she has given the riders for the tory succession their 
starting orders years in advance of the actual race the 
newspaper said 
the next election must be held by the summer of 1992 but it is 
expected mrs thatcher will call it in 1991 
mrs thatcher who turned 64 last month has never previously 
made it clear in public when she plans to retire as party leader 
she was elected in 1979 the first female prime minister in europe 
and won reelection in 1983 and in 1987 when she said she planned 
to go on and on 
earlier this year mrs thatcher overtook liberal lord asquiths 
19081916 tenure as prime minister to become britains longest 
continuously serving prime minister of the 20th century 
mrs thatchers popularity is the lowest of any prime minister 
since opinion polls began in britain 50 years ago and senior 
colleagues have publicly admonished her to change her leadership 
style following the surprise resignation of her treasury chief 
nigel lawson 
lord callaghan former labor prime minister whom mrs thatcher 
defeated in 1979 said her comments had considerably weakened her 
position 
if her party wins the next election it is expected mrs 
thatcher would step down before her term ends to allow her 
successor to choose a time to call a new election 
my guess is that the tory party will want someone as leader 
who could take them through the next parliament callaghan said 
if mrs thatcher resigns while in office her successor elected 
by the party automatically becomes prime minister with approval of 
queen elizabeth ii but convention dictates that he or she seek a 
mandate in a general election as soon as possible 
the sunday times speculated she would step down by 1994 mrs 
thatcher would celebrate her 69th birthday that year and her 
husband denis will be 79 and his age may have been a factor in 
her decision the newspaper said 
the newspaper predicted the opposition labor party will try to 
promote leader neil kinnock as the occupantinwaiting of 10 
downing st who is ready able and willing to complete a full 
term 
kinnock called mrs thatchers comments the interview of 
someone preparing herself for quitting mentally margaret thatcher 
is preparing herself for packing her bags 
in an editorial today the prothatcher daily telegraph said 
mrs thatcher was merely stating the obvious by indicating she 
would not seek a fifth term 
even were she not to fight a fifth election mrs thatcher 
could yet enjoy seven more years in charge it said 
by then she would be in her 70s and her devoted husband a 
decade older nonetheless what other politician would be 
expected to entertain an inquiry about his or her intentions in 
seven years time and can it really be a cause for astonishment 
that mrs thatcher is unwilling to commit herself to political 
activity in her mid70s and beyond

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether a motorist who pleads guilty to drunken driving and related 
traffic offenses in a fatal car crash later may be prosecuted for 
homicide and assault 
the court said it will hear an appeal by law enforcement 
officials seeking to prosecute thomas j corbin in connection with 
an oct 3 1987 accident on route 55 in lagrange ny 
the new york court of appeals the states highest court last 
july barred corbins prosecution on homicide and assault charges 
the state court said such a prosecution would violate 
doublejeopardy protections 
corbin was accused of crossing a double yellow line and striking 
two other vehicles headed in the opposite direction brenda dirago 
who was driving one of the other cars was killed 
corbin pleaded guilty 24 days later to drunken driving and 
driving on the wrong side of the road he was fined and his 
drivers license was suspended for six months 
the local judge who sentenced corbin apparently was unaware 
someone had died in the crash no one from the dutchess county 
district attorneys office appeared in court when corbin pleaded 
guilty or was sentenced for the traffic violations 
two days after the january 1988 sentencing the district 
attorneys office learned what happened and won an indictment on 
various criminal charges including negligent homicide and reckless 
assault 
the new york state court of appeals threw out the indictment on 
grounds it violated corbins right against facing multiple 
prosecutions for the same offense 
the state court said that while corbin and his lawyer may have 
been less than forthcoming in their dealings with the local judge 
it certainly cannot be said the traffic infraction prosecution 
was conducted or the conviction obtained with the knowledge of 
the dutchess county district attorneys office 
the state court barred use of a state law aimed at preventing 
people from pleading guilty to minor offenses to escape prosecution 
for more serious crimes 
that law is designed to apply to cases in which prosecutors are 
unaware or unable to inform judges of pending prosecutions for the 
more serious offenses the state court said 
the state court also relied in part on wording in a 1980 supreme 
court ruling that raised but did not answer definitively the 
doublejeopardy question in similar circumstances 
in corbins case the state court said the prosecution stated 
in its charges that it intended to use the acts underlying the 
traffic offenses to prove negligent homicide and reckless assault 
the case is grady vs corbin 89474

the talk in school district 27 was about hiring 
white christians not blacks or jews and providing patronage jobs 
and cutting deals 
colman genn the school superintendent taped all this talk with 
a recorder fastened to his back and a microphone stuck to his 
chest the undercover educators work revealed at a hearing oct 
23 led to the suspension of nine elected officials amid charges of 
patronage racism and antisemitism in their queens district 
we need a system with people responsible for dealing with 
children instead of feeding off children genn said in explaining 
why he did what he did our children should not be seen as cash 
cows 
genns colleagues say his students have always come first ever 
since he came to the citys school system in 1958 as a gym teacher 
as he moved up genn won raves for his work as principal of the 
manhattan center for math and science an east harlem specialty 
school that blossomed under his leadership 
but things changed after he arrived in july 1987 at district 27 
an area that includes the predominantly white howard beach and 
breezy point sections although more than half the districts 
students are black the ninemember school board included a single 
black representative 
of the districts 1690 teachers 825 percent are white above 
the city average of 707 percent and its 35 principals include 
only a halfdozen blacks below the city average 
under the citys decentralized system 32 locally elected boards 
run the citys elementary and junior high schools 
few new yorkers vote in school board elections there is little 
media oversight of school board activities perhaps as a result 
some boards have been exposed in recent years as fonts of 
corruption 
genn 53 learned firsthand how district business was done 
during a march 1988 trip to los angeles for a convention he was 
dining with local board members james sullivan and samuel granirer 
when they laid it all out genn testified before a school 
commission last week 
i was told that if i was a good boy and allowed them to handle 
the hiring and appointments i would have a long life and tenure as 
superintendent genn recalled 
an infuriated genn approached the joint commission on integrity 
in the public schools about the conversation they persuaded him to 
surreptitiously tape his future talks with board members to expose 
what was going on 
genn although sometimes visibly nervous and sweating did 
just that swapping pta meetings for gettogethers with sullivan 
granirer board member sal stazzone and 10thgrade teacher richard 
lipkowitz the contents of the tapes recorded between feb 6 and 
oct 13 made clear exactly what was important to some district 
officials 
on one tape sullivan suggests creating a deputy superintendent 
post specifically for a black to quell minority hiring concerns 
but he insisted the appointee be pliable i cant have a 
expletive mau mau i dont need anybody beating the war drums 
on another recording stazzone and lipkowitz are heard 
discussing district 27 when the latter is suddenly struck with an 
absurd thought 
ive never heard the word children or education enter into 
our discussions in the last few years said lipkowitz 
with anybody responded a laughing stazzone 
and on a third sullivan explained how he expected business to 
be done in the district im a political leader thats why im 
here and i make sure my people get jobs 
genns predecessor marvin aaron did his hiring out of a 
synagogue sullivan said on one of the tapes 
the queens district attorney and us attorney andrew maloney 
have received copies of the tapes for possible criminal 
prosecutions most of those involved have declined comment but 
sullivan asserted his innocence 
ive always acted in the best interests of the children and 
the parents of school district 27 said sullivan 
the tapes were played when genn testified before a commission 
hearing a day later acting schools chancellor bernard mecklowitz 
suspended the board the fourth such move in the past three years 
in the citys troubled system 
although genn feared a backlash and requested police protection 
he has heard little but praise for his role 
colman genn is a modernday hero said james gill head of 
the commission he acted out of conscience he didnt act to 
promote himself thats what makes him a hero 
ive received calls from kids i taught 25 30 years ago 
said genn everybody was concerned but everybody was very 
positive

the former head of transit casualty co 
a highrisk insurer that left up to 4 billion in unpaid claims 
when it crumbled in 1985 has pleaded innocent to a charge of 
filing a false financial statement 
george pettengill bowie 64 transits former chairman and chief 
executive officer entered the plea thursday in circuit court after 
his indictment by a cole county grand jury county prosecutor 
richard callahan said sunday 
transits courtappointed liquidator burleigh arnold said 
transit left 3 billion to 4 billion in unpaid claims in all 50 
states from mainly corporate customers with highrisk insurance 
policies including policies on race horses and toxic waste dumps 
that made transit the biggest property and casualty insurance 
failure ever in this country said michael barrett jr staff 
director for the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations which is probing the case 
callahan kept the indictment sealed until sunday 
the charge stems from the companys 1984 financial statement 
which indicated a 219 million surplus when in fact transits 
records were incomplete inaccurate inauditable and in such a 
state that it was impossible to construct an accurate financial 
statement the indictment said 
the statement was filed with state regulators 
their records were so unreliable they shouldnt have filed 
anything callahan said 
bowies lawyer arthur margulis said the 1984 statement was 
drawn up in compliance with missouri law and industry practice he 
said there was no intent to defraud 
nevertheless bowie resigned friday as a partner in the law firm 
of wilson elser moskowitz edelman and dicker because of the 
charge margulis said 
filing a false annual statement is a felony punishable by up to 
five years in prison no trial date has been set for bowie who is 
free on a 250000 signature bond 
cole county circuit judge byron kinder ordered the state to 
liquidate transit in 1985 
transit obtained a missouri charter in 1945 to sell liability 
policies for the transportation industry in the 1960s beneficial 
standard corp acquired transit and moved its headquarters from st 
louis to los angeles 
though based in los angeles the company maintained its missouri 
charter giving the state jurisdiction over its liquidation 
arnold and several regulators said transit expanded rapidly in 
the early 1980s by giving its 17 managing general agents freedom to 
write highrisk policies 
agents wrote policies for satellites horses and toxic waste 
dumps among others arnold said transit found itself with a 15 
million claim from union carbide corp for part of carbides 
liability in the 1984 gas leak in bhopal india that killed more 
than 2500 people arnold said 
many of the managing general agents never kept adequate records 
and the company did not have a central computer to keep track of 
its policies 
the way things were being done there wasnt any way even 
transit casualty could know what was going on said donald 
ainsworth director of the missouri division of insurance from 1981 
to 1985 policies were being written that were not being 
reported

the president of the national conference of 
catholic bishops today issued a rallying cry to end abortion on 
demand in a speech celebrating the bicentennial of the catholic 
hierarchy 
in a speech opening the fall meeting of the bishops conference 
archbishop john may of st louis paid respect to the nations 
democratic traditions and said the roman catholic church must 
exercise its right to express its opinion on abortion 
dont forget the baby thats all the catholic church is 
saying to america said may in what was also his farewell address 
as conference president 
leaders of the nations largest religious denomination are 
scheduled to discuss statements on abortion the middle east and 
aids and elect a new president during the fourday meeting 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati conference vice 
president is expected to be elevated to the presidency while nine 
other archbishops vie for the vice presidency 
the bishops on sunday celebrated a special bicentennial mass in 
the basilica of the assumption the nations oldest cathedral 
marking the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the diocese 
of baltimore and the appointment of the rev john carroll on nov 
6 1789 as the first us catholic bishop 
in his speech may said americans need to hear the 53 
millionmember churchs voice on issues ranging from the middle 
east to poverty but the one issue where clearcut moral 
principle stands tall above all else is abortion 
if someone were to propose dropping any 6monthold baby who 
seemed to be a burden to the family into the baltimore harbor may 
said people would be aghast 
what is the difference between a child a few months after 
birth and a child a few months before may said 
the nations approximately 300 catholic bishops will take up the 
abortion issue tuesday when debate is scheduled on a proposal 
calling on catholics to give urgent attention and priority to 
the issue 
in his talk may also praised a proposed document on the middle 
east as an example of the american way of reaching agreement by 
discussion and consensus 
on sunday a bishops committee announced some lastminute 
revisions in its mideast statement which had been criticized by 
jewish groups 
the criticism of the draft statement by the ad hoc committee on 
the middle east said the proposal went too far for calling on 
israel to negotiate directly with palestinians over territory and 
sovereignty 
the revisions added a statement that there must be negotiated 
limits to the exercise of palestinian sovereignty to protect 
israels security it also noted that israel has been the victim of 
acts of terrorism by groups aligned with the palestinian cause 
it is our conviction that a truly open moment for peace exists 
in the middle east said the committee made up of archbishop 
roger mahony of los angeles cardinal john oconnor of new york and 
archbishop william keeler of baltimore 
the revised document toward peace in the middle east 
perspectives principles and hopes also adds a call for the 
release of all hostages held in lebanon 
the statement on aids came after an earlier document approved by 
the conferences administrative board came under attack the 
document was criticized for giving conditional approval to condom 
education in public schools as long as sexual abstinence outside of 
marriage was presented as the only medically correct and morally 
sure way to prevent aids 
the drafters of the first document the many faces of aids a 
gospel response said it showed a willingness to work with 
people of other faiths and a recognition that condoms may save some 
lives when used by individuals who could not be persuaded to change 
their sexual habits 
but some bishops said it would be misinterpreted as condoning 
artificial birth control and sex outside marriage 
the proposed statement called to compassion a response to 
the hivaids crisis attacks condom education as a quickfix 
approach and urges that youngsters be taught chastity instead 
mahony chairman of the commitee that drafted the second 
statement said bishops never have indicated a willingness to 
compromise on catholic teaching to become more influential in the 
public policy debate 
even to start down that road is fraught with difficulties 
he said 
with church custom dictating pilarczyks succession of 
archbishop john l may of st louis as president of the bishops 
conference interest has turned toward the vicepresidential 
election 
the candidates who have agreed to be nominated are archbishop 
anthony j bevilacqua of philadelphia keeler mahony archbishop 
eugene a marino of atlanta archbishop theodore e mccarrick of 
newark nj archbishop j francis stafford of denver archbishop 
oscar h lipscomb of mobile ala archbishop daniel w kucera of

the government today announced tough new 
capital standards designed to reduce further failures of savings 
and loan institutions 
these new standards will require savings institutions to 
become stronger and will thereby reduce the exposure of the federal 
deposit insurance fund to losses said m danny wall director of 
the office of thrift supervision 
the ots created by the savings and loan bailout law passed by 
congress last summer estimated that 800 thrift institutions with 
assets totaling 600 billion would not be able to meet the capital 
requirements immediately 
those failing to comply will have immediate grwoth restrictions 
imposed on them by the ots and will be required to develop capital 
restoration plans detailing the steps they will take to meet the 
new standards 
the announcement was made as james barth ots chief economist 
told an sampl industry group in chicago that thrift institutions lost 
at least 25 billion in the julyseptember quarter likely the 
best performance in a year 
anticipating the new standards many thrifts have been selling 
assets and reducing their size recently and the ots said many of 
them will be able to meet the new requirements by the time they 
take effect on dec 7 
a key provision in the reform bill requires sampl owners to risk 
more of their own capital as a buffer between losses and government 
deposit insurance funds 
the standards require sampls to keep in reserve at least 15 
percent tangible capital 3 percent core capital and meet a 
riskbased capital requirement 
tangible capital consists of common stock plus retained earnings 
but excluding most intangible assets such as goodwill 
core capital consists of tangible capital plus goodwill 
goodwill is an accounting term referring to the amount above actual 
cash value paid by an investor for a troubled thrift 
riskbased capital consists of 8 percent of the value of 
riskweighted assets when the new rule is fully phased in 
the minimum capital for the credit risk component the risk 
of a loan not being repaid is calculated by multiplying the value 
of each asset including offbalancesheet commitments by one of 
five risk factors and holding 8 percent of the result as the 
minimum required capital the ots said 
it said the five risk categories range from zero percent for 
cash to 200 percent for certain delinquent loans and repossessed 
property 
for example it said a typical home mortgage has a risk factor 
of 50 percent thus the minimum required capital on a 100000 
home mortgage loan would be calculated by multiplying 100000 by 
50 percent and the resulting 50000 by 8 percent resulting in 
4000 risk capital 
the riskbased capital requirement was described as the most 
important of the three standards which will make sampl standards 
no less stringent than those imposed on the commercial banking 
industry

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether lawsuits charging employers with violating a key federal 
antibias law must be filed in federal rather than state courts 
the justices said they will review a 27000 judgment won by a 
chicago ridge ill woman against the yellow freight system co 
the trucking company she works for 
lawyers for yellow freight are urging the justices to rule that 
coleen donnelly waited too long before filing a lawsuit invoking a 
federal law title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 that bars 
onthejob discrimination 
mrs donnellys lawsuit invoked the federal law within a 
required 90day deadline but the case at that time was in an 
illinois state court lawyers for yellow freight said that does not 
meet the deadline requirement because its appeal contends federal 
courts have exclusive authority to hear title vii cases 
some federal appeals courts have ruled that such suits must be 
filed in federal court but the chicagobased 7th us circuit 
court of appeals ruled that state courts have coexisting authority 
to hear title vii cases 
the 7th circuit court noted that congress in passing title vii 
did not say whether lawsuits invoking the law must be filed in 
federal court 
unless congress includes an explicit statement vesting 
jurisdiction exclusively in federal court state courts may presume 
that they share jurisdiction concurrently with the federal courts 
over a federal cause of action the appeals court said 
mrs donnelly applied to yellow freight for a job as a 
dockworker in october 1982 although the company was not hiring at 
the time mrs donnelly was told she would be the next dockworker 
hired 
although yellow freight began hiring dockworkers again in 
february 1983 mrs donnelly was told repeatedly that the company 
was not hiring 
she was hired 18 months after the february 1983 startup of 
hiring 
mrs donnelly in early 1985 filed charges with the federal equal 
employment opportunity commission alleging sexual bias in yellow 
freights delay in hiring her 
the commission issued a righttosue notice on march 15 1985 
triggering a 90day deadline 
mrs donnelly sued in state court within the deadline but her 
original lawsuit did not allege a title vii violation only a 
violation of the illinois human rights act 
the suit later was amended to include allegations of a title vii 
violation 
after yellow freight had the case transferred to federal court 
mrs donnelly was awarded 276566l in back pay and prejudgment 
interest 
the case is yellow freight system vs donnelly 89431

the nations savings and loans lost at least 25 
billion in the julyseptember quarter a large loss but still 
likely the best performance in a year a government economist said 
today 
james barth chief economist of the office of thrift 
supervision said preliminary figures indicate that sampl red ink 
will be at its lowest point since a 18 billion loss in the third 
quarter of 1988 
thrifts last year lost a record 134 billion official figures 
for the julyseptember period of this year will not be released 
until next month but if barths projection proves correct losses 
for the first nine months of this year will total 97 billion on 
track for a slight improvement for all of 1989 
barth speaking at the annual convention of the us league of 
savings institutions said losses in the latest quarter were 
concentrated heavily in the approximately 260 institutions under 
government control although the rest of the industry also lost 
money 
he attributed the reduction to government steps to close or 
rescue failed sampls and said he expected the decline in losses to 
continue 
the fact that weve gotten rid of a lot of institutions 
suggests that the numbers should get smaller over time barth 
said 
in washington meantime the thrift supervision office announced 
toughened capital standards designed to prevent further sampl 
failures it estimated that 800 thrifts with assets totaling 600 
billion would not be able to meet the new requirements when they 
take effect dec 7 and would be subject to restrictions on growth 
in september the industry continued to shed assets for the 
fourth consecutive month in an effort to meet new capital standards 
going into effect next month barth said institutions reduced 
their portfolios by about 15 billion up from a record 134 
billion shrinkage in august he said 
deposit outflows totaled about 9 billion up from 51 billion 
in august and close to the record 108 billion in january he said 
meanwhile sampl executives looking back on their industrys most 
turbulent year in five decades are wondering if they fought a 
little too hard to wrap themselves in the american dream of home 
ownership 
when leaders of the league mapped strategy last year for the 
debate on a taxpayer bailout of the industry they decided their 
key argument would be that sampls are needed to finance housing 
congress listened legislation enacted aug 9 authorized 50 
billion to rescue or close an estimated 500 failed sampls however 
it also required the survivors to devote more of their assets to 
home lending 
starting july 1991 70 percent of thrift assets must be in 
housing up from 60 percent currently 
as sampl executives gathered today for the 97th annual convention 
of the industrys oldest and largest trade group the 70 percent 
requirement was the top item on a list of changes they want 
congress to make in the threemonthold bailout bill 
we think this may have gotten us into the overkill area 
said league president frederick l webber 
its a classic example of getting killed by a myth said 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
they bought their own propaganda and now theyre choking on it 
the problem is that the new rules are taking effect as advancing 
technology makes it easier for competitors to enter the mortgage 
market and on the eve of a decade expected to see the housing 
sector weaken in response to the aging of the baby boom generation 
james w christian chief economist of the league estimated 
that new households in the 1990s will require 12 million to 13 
million new housing units down from 15 million units in the 1980s 
and 175 million units in the 1970s 
however you varnish it weak aggregate demand for housing 
is going to be part of the picture of the 1990s he wrote 
recently 
according to ely technology has split the home financing 
business into three parts mortgage funding mortgage servicing and 
mortgage origination 
insurance companies and pension funds are taking over the 
funding part by purchasing securities from freddie mac and fannie 
mae large congressionally chartered companies that buy mortgages 
to back the securities they sell 
since anyone can sell a mortgage to fannie mae and freddie mac 
sampls now must compete for origination business against commercial 
banks and private mortgage companies 
and because most thrifts are too small to compete effectively 
against large computerized mortgageservicing operations which 
collect homeowners monthly payments they are losing that part of 
the business as well ely said 
webber however said we are confident there will be a 
successful thrift industry provided we can correct some of the more 
onerous parts of the sampl bill 
among the other changes the group wants 
a reduction in the industrys contribution to the bailout the 
12 regional federal home loan banks which are industry owned and 
provide lowcost loans to member sampls ar being tapped for 26 
billion in retained earnings through 1991 and theyre supposed to 
contribute 300 million a year to help pay the interest on 
government borrowing for the bailout 
an increase in the limit on loans to one lender the bill cuts 
the limit from 100 percent of capital to 15 percent under the old 
standard one default could push an sampl into insolvency but webber 
said 15 percent may be too stringent and suggested something 
between the two figures would be more appropriate 
equal deposit insurance premiums for both thrifts and 
commercial banks both types of institutions will have to pay more 
for deposit insurance but the thrift rate will be higher than the 
bank rate until 1998 when both types of institutions will pay 15 
cents for every 100 in deposits

environmental leaders from around 
the world began meeting today with the goal of persuading 
industrialized nations to commit themselves to measures to stop the 
potentially catastrophic greenhouse effect 
the dutch the hosts of the twoday 68nation conference hope 
participating nations will commit themselves to stabilizing 
emissions of greenhouserelated gases by the end of the century 
the greenhouse effect is believed to be the cause of a gradual 
warming of the atmposphere the warming could eventually turn 
fertile land into deserts and flood densely populated coastal 
plains 
experts believe that to stop the effect a major reduction is 
needed of emissions of greenhousecausing gases particularly 
carbon dioxide chlorofluorocarbons known as cfcs methane and 
nitrous oxides 
but a number of nations are unwilling to commit themselves to 
such measures for now and say this conference is not the proper 
forum for such commitments 
they want to postpone formal discussions until a meeting of the 
intergovernmental panel on climate change in washington next year 
a draft communique calls for recognition of the need to 
stabilize emissions by the year 2000 and to develop policy tools 
to achieve that goal 
the united states britain and japan had opposed the communique 
but on sunday agreed to reopen talks on the issue according to 
marjan van der giezen a spokeswoman for the dutch environment 
ministry 
it looks as if we might succeed in keeping those three 
aboard ms van der giezen told the associated press 
participation of major industrialized nations in the fight 
against the greenhouse effect is essential according to pier 
vellinga the dutch environment ministrys key expert in climate 
policy 
in all developed nations in the northern hemisphere including 
the east bloc produce 65 percent of all greenhouserelated 
emissions vellinga said

president bush had dinner with former 
president nixon at sunday to hear a report on nixons 
justconcluded trip to china white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said today 
during his trip nixon had urged the united states and china to 
put aside differences and resume normal relations despite lingering 
tensions from the bloody crackdown on prodemocracy forces 
the president bush found those views quite interesting and 
productive but our general policy has not changed fitzwater told 
reporters we do want to preserve the relationship and as 
events proceed we will continue to consider possible actions that 
would change our relationship 
the white house dinner had not been announced in advance after 
the meeting nixon returned to new york 
other dinner guests included vice president dan quayle deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger national security adviser 
brent scowcroft deputy national security adviser robert gates cia 
director william webster white house chief of staff john sununu 
and michel oksenberg a china scholar and a member of nixons 
entourage 
fitzwater also disclosed that bush met at camp david md on 
saturday with officials from the cia state department and national 
security council to receive the first in a series of briefings to 
prepare for his dec 23 shipboard meeting in the mediterranean 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev off the coast of malta 
he said bush also would hold talks with experts outside of the 
government 
the president will be extremely well prepared as evidenced by 
the first meeting and many to come we know what we want out of 
it fitzwater said we know what we want to say we want out of 
it a good conversation that illumniates the policies on both 
sides 
while the united states has been trying to keep expectations 
low the soviets have taken a different tact soviet spokesman 
gennady gerasimov suggested the talks would lead to the end of the 
cold war 
fitzwater deflected questions about that comment by jokingly 
saying well youve got to be a little careful about old 
gennady hes pretty smooth sometimes his unfamiliarity with the 
language kind of overstates things were on the right track

the decisionmaking inner cabinet has accepted 
an american plan for preliminary israelipalestinian talks but 
demanded written us assurances on several points including that 
plo members be excluded 
without these assurances we will not enter into these 
talks said yossi ahimeir a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak 
shamir 
the bush administration welcomed the action and called on egypt 
and the palestinians to respond promptly 
we still think theres a lot of work to be done but we think 
its a positive sign in terms of moving the process forward said 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
despite israeli demands for us assurances on various points 
fitzwater said the cabinets decision provides further impetus 
for an israelipalestinian dialogue 
the vote came 10 days before shamir plans to visit the united 
states to meet with jewish groups and senators he hopes to meet 
with president bush but the two sides have not yet agreed upon a 
meeting 
the inner cabinet voted sunday 93 to accept the plan designed 
by secretary of state james a baker iii 
finance minister shimon peres who leads the leftofcenter 
labor party welcomed the decision saying it will keep the united 
states involved in the search for peace 
i think this has great significance because we prevented the 
loss of america as part of the peace process peres said on 
israel television 
israeli media reports had said the united states might put 
middle east peace efforts aside for other issues if bakers peace 
offer were rejected 
ahimeir said israel will ask for six assurances 
he said israel wants guarantees there will be no talks with the 
palestine liberation organization and that talks be limited to 
israels elections proposal which offers limited autonomy in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
bakers offer calls for an israelipalestinian meeting to break 
a stalemate over the stalled israeli plan first announced six 
months ago 
israel television said another of the six assurances was that 
washington would support israel if it left the talks because ground 
rules were violated 
peres and a spokesmen for shamir said israel expects the us 
assurances in writing 
sundays cabinet vote was unanimously supported by labors six 
ministers but created a split in its coalition partner shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc those ministers voted 33 
likud hardliners say the baker plan will lead to indirect 
negotiations with the plo the move will bring disaster 
industry and trade minister ariel sharon said on israel radio 
in cairo the plos executive committee announced it had 
crystalized a united position on the baker plan but members 
would not say if the organization accepted or rejected the proposal 
should the plo approve the plan the next step would be for 
baker to meet with egyptian and israeli officials to work out the 
composition of a palestinian delegation acceptable to israel

about 60 junior high school teachers took a 
unanimous stand monday against allowing three moslem girls wearing 
headscarves in class 
the vote came as students returned to school after a holiday 
weekend that featured a new attempt by the government to end a 
debate pitting freedom of religious expression against laws 
separating church and state 
after the teachers shut them out of the classrooms leila and 
fatima athaboun and samira saipali went to the school library to 
sit out the day as they have done since the dispute began in 
midoctober 
the girls have refused pleas from principal ernest chenieres to 
remove the hijab covering head neck and ears which they say 
islamic law orders them to wear in public 
chenieres maintains the scarves are potent religious symbols 
that amount to proselytizing banned by french law from the public 
school system 
the issue of wearing religious symbols in school has been 
emotionally charged since the 19th century when advocates of a 
secular school system free from the influence of the roman catholic 
church won a bitter fight 
on saturday education minister lionel jospin said he would seek 
an advisory opinion from the council of state which rules on 
constitutional issues but can be asked for advice on any topic the 
government chooses 
jospin has been criticized from within his governing socialist 
party and elsewhere for a decision that authorities should discuss 
the issue with students and parents to persuade them to remove the 
scarves 
if persuasion fails jospin said students must attend classes 
scarves or not his decision to ask the council of state for a 
judgment was supported sunday by premier michel rocard 
islam is the secondlargest religion in france with more than 3 
million adherants in a population of 55 million

authorities have shut down dozens of black 
markets in the capital exposed thousands of illegal street traders 
and confiscated thousands of pornographic books in a 100day 
campaign a newspaper said monday 
the campaign unearthed 110000 unlawful businesses and gained 
the government 567000 in taxes and fines the newspaper said 
it said 36 black markets were closed down and 500 unlawful 
cliques many dealing in fake or inferior goods were disbanded 
among the main targets of the cleanup were privately owned hair 
salons bars cigarette booths street billiard operators black 
market moneychangers and unlicensed street traders 
the paper said the campaign part of a nationwide drive against 
pornography netted 820000 copies of books magazines and albums 
it also appeared linked to moves initiated by the governments 
current conservative leadership to control private enterprise 
authorities stress that private enterprise will continue to play 
a supplementary role in chinas socialist economy but since the 
june crackdown on the prodemocracy movement and subsequent purge 
of reformers advocates of marketoriented private trade have been 
on the defensive 
many private businesses or small collectives have halted 
operations because of increased taxes or inability to get credit 
energy or raw materials because the government now gives priority 
to staterun enterprises 
before the campaign beijing officials had expressed concern 
over what they described as a rampant increase in unlicensed 
business activities 
the report also said officials had persuaded 80000 rural 
laborers who operate many of the free market street stalls to 
return to their hometowns 
it said similar campaigns will be repeated to provide a clean 
and fresh atmosphere for the asian games in beijing next 
september and october

democrats l douglas wilder and james florio striving to give 
their party a gubernatorial election sweep on tuesday brushed 
aside favorable polls today and appealed for a strong turnout as 
the offyear campaign wound down on a lingering negative note 
the only polls that count are the polls taken tomorrow said 
wilder when asked about a survey that said he was nine points ahead 
of republican j marshall coleman in the race for governor of 
virginia turnout is very important said wilder bidding to 
becomne the first black elected governor of any state 
coleman also sounded optimistic saying republicans can taste 
this victory the force is with us 
in new jersey rep florio greeted morning commuters in newark 
and vowed to campaign as if his race with republican rep james 
courter for the governorship were considered a tossup 
the democratic candidate was fighting overconfidence after a 
poll that said he was leading courter by 24 points a florio 
victory would give the democrats a governorship held by republican 
thomas kean for eight years 
the virginia and new jersey races as well as the contest for 
mayor of new york city were marked by a succession of negative 
commercials that had party leaders suggesting it was time to look 
for a way to tone down the attacks 
republican rudolph giuliani said sunday that if he is elected 
mayor of new york he will order an investigation of democrat david 
dinkins finances dinkins bidding to be the first black mayor of 
the nations largest city responded that former us attorney 
giuliani just cant get the prosecutor out of himself 
today giuliani amended his statement by saying dinkins should 
be investigated it is not the function of the mayor to 
investigate of course that will be up to federal and state 
authorities he said through a spokesman 
the two races for governor and the new york mayoral contest are 
getting the most attention in a light political year being watched 
for political trends that might impact on the 1990 elections when 
34 senate seats 36 governorships and 435 house seats are on the 
ballot 
in houston 11 candidates are vying to fill the house seat held 
by the rep mickey leland who was killed in a plane crash in africa 
new york is only one of hundreds of cities holding elections 
around the country in detroit 71yearold mayor coleman young is 
trying to fight off a spirited challenge from 40yearold tom 
barrow the man he beat easily four years ago 
cleveland voters are choosing between councilman george forbes 
and state sen michael r white in a contest marked by nasty 
personal attacks from both sides 
two cities new haven conn and seattle are considered 
likely to elect their first black mayors state sen john daniels 
upset the democratic establishment choice in his partys primary in 
new haven a city that is 30 percent black norm rice is the 
favorite in seattle where blacks are only a small percentage of the 
electorate 
the customary list of ballot propositions includes proposals to 
finance a new baseball park in san francisco and to express 
opposition to cruise missile testing in maine 
faced with the possibility of losses in the three most visible 
1989 races republican party chairman lee atwater minimized the 
significance of this years contests all politics is local he 
said during an appearance sunday on abcs this week with david 
brinkley 
his democratic counterpart ronald h brown was on the same 
program and reflected his partys optimism when he said victories 
tuesday by wilder florio and dinkins would indicate that clearly 
were moving in a new direction 
the emotional question of legalized abortion showed the 
strongest potential for a political turnaround at the gateway to 
the 1990s during the past decade opponents of legalization claimed 
creit for helping elect supporters of their view including 
republican presidents ronald reagan and george bush and defeat 
several members of congress who supported abortion rights 
but last summers supreme court decision opening the way for 
states to restrict access to abortions appeared to energize 
advocates of legalization 
wilder ran television ads proclaiming his support for abortion 
rights while coleman courter and giuliani all found themselves 
trying to temper their opposition 
in an interview late last week brown said abortion has had 
tremendous impact politically i think the democratic party is on 
the right side of the issue 
were trying to be the majority party and were a big enough 
party to have differing viewpoints on all issues and specifically 
abortion said atwater appearing to move his party away from a 
hardline position opposed to abortion 
during their joint appearance on abc brown and atwater sparred 
on the subject of what to do about the negative tone of campaigns 
i think theres too much of it on both sides said brown 
urging atwater to join an effort to curb the candidate attacks 
when atwater said he would enlist in that effort only if it 
included discussion of new campaign laws proposed by bush and 
largely unacceptable to democrats brown retorted this is really 
a case of changing the subject isnt it the subject is negative 
politics dirty campaigning 
with giuliani battling to overtake dinkins in heavily democratic 
new york city his media adviser roger ailes said there would be 
no letup in the attack strategy 
the only question is can dinkins get over the finish line with 
the question of integrity dragging around his ankles said ailes 
a leading architect of president bushs 1988 campaign 
with republicans holding a twoseat edge in the new jersey 
assembly florio was concentrating on districts democrats have 
targeted as key to their effort to regain control 
our message seems to have gotten through florio told 
supporters at a sunday breakfast but if i dont have people in 
the assembly that are philosophically in line with the message ive 
been trying to get across then im going to have a mission to 
carry out with one hand tied behind my back 
a richmond timesdispatch poll said wilder was leading coleman 
by nine points with 19 percent still describing themselves as 
undecided 
coleman was in the northwestern part of the state to conclude a 
weekend in which he charged his rival with privately pledging to 
coal miners he would sabotage the states righttowork law by 
permitting unions to collect dues from nonunion workers covered by 
union contracts wilder says he supports the righttowork law 
its not in the bag coleman told supporters at a picnic in 
front royal were coming around the corner the undecided 
are going our way overwhelmingly 
wilder was in the southwestern corner of the state where he told 
voters of the regions crucial role in his upset victory in the 
1985 race for lieutenant governor

millions of chinese battered by inflation and 
bored by their work are taking on second jobs an authoritative 
weekly said monday 
the beijing review said many of the moonlighters are simply not 
showing up at their regular work where job security is guaranteed 
so they can devote all their energy to their other jobs 
around 30 percent of workers in the southern city of canton have 
second jobs while the moonlighting rate in the northeast city of 
tianjin has gone from 2 percent in 1982 to 20 percent last year it 
said 
shanghai has more than 1 million workers with outside 
employment 16 percent of the workforce in the coastal city of 
wenzhou known for its booming private enterprise 70 percent hold 
down at least two jobs 
the weekly said chinas irrational wage system where street 
peddlers are likely to earn far more than universitytrained 
workers is one reason for the increase in sunday engineers 
the state statistical bureau estimates that 139 million 
technical personnel saddled with low wages in their overstaffed 
underfinanced work units have found parttime work many in 
flourishing private or locally run enterprises 
rapid inflation running at near 20 percent has forced many to 
seek outside sources of income the weekly said 
half the moonlighters in beijing did their second jobs during 
normal work hours and continued to receive free medical treatment 
labor protection and welfare services it said some took extended 
sick leave while others offered no explanation for their absence 
staterun enterprises almost never fire employees because of 
poor performance and many show little concern over absenteeism 
because of their surplus worker problems 
the weekly said there is some concern moonlighters are taking 
advantage of lax management to engage in illegal activities that 
damage the interests of the state

to the beating of drums and cries of god 
is great jordans islamic fundamentalists are advancing toward a 
strong showing in the kingdoms first general election in two 
decades 
no other faction rivals the size and organization of the moslem 
brotherhood groups campaign that strength has raised hopes among 
its supporters and caused concern for king hussein and secular 
jordanians 
many analysts believe the brotherhoods 26 candidates and their 
allies could win 12 to 20 of the 80 seats in the parliamentary 
voting on wednesday enough to have a significant effect on 
legislation 
we will erase all laws which allow adultery and vices and 
place hurdles in the way of islamic jihad spiritual struggle and 
the word of god sheik hammam saeed a senior brotherhood leader 
told hundreds of supporters gathered at a recent rally 
we will work hand in hand god willing to make this country 
an islamic country in all means and to make islam the source of all 
its laws he said 
the election was called following april riots in southern jordan 
protesting price increases and austerity measures 
it is the first nationwide parliamentary ballot since 1967 and 
the most open since 1956 
the parliament elected in 1967 was suspended in 1974 and revived 
a decade later with a few elections to fill gaps caused by death 
it was generally compliant to government will despite a few vocal 
critics politicians have expressed hope that the new parliament 
will take a stronger role 
political parties have been banned since a leftist coup attempt 
in 1957 the government announced oct 17 it wont enforce that ban 
for this election opening the door to greater democracy and looser 
government control 
the fundamentalists apparent strength has alarmed some secular 
jordanians even the king last month urged his countrymen not to 
mix religion with politics and avoid extremism 
he denounced efforts by some religious figures to reduce the 
role of women in the workplace saying such interpretations are 
counter to islam 
the strongest attack came this week when sultan hatab editor of 
the governmentowned sawt alshaab daily said some who veil 
themselves in religion and trade in it want to burn our 
tongues brains existence and our wish for freedom 
more than 500 people who gathered to hear saeed and other 
fundamentalists jammed a parking lot beneath green banners 
proclaiming islam is the solution in between speakers 
drummers beat a fast rhythm common to brotherhood rallies 
men were separated from a large group of veiled women many in 
the crowd bowed to pray in unison a scene reminiscent of a mosque 
service 
my god i see that ayatollah khomeini has returned 
exclaimed a secular bystander rattled by the scene in a middle 
class neighborhood where women commonly wear western garb and large 
public gatherings are rare 
but the brotherhoods creed probably has more in common with 
saudi arabias strict religious code than with the iranian 
revolution led by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
irans moslems are mostly shiites while those in jordan and 
saudi arabia belong to the mainstream sunni sect the difference is 
as profound as that between fundamentalist american protestants and 
eastern orthodox christians 
in jordan we want islam to govern our judicial and social 
life and we are not calling for an islamic revolution like 
khomeini said ghaleb abuabood a brotherhood candidate in amman 
khomeinis movement was associated with violence he said in 
an interview we reject violence except in israel to liberate the 
moslems land including its capital jerusalem 
the party rejects compromises which would accept israels 
existence as a state 
engineers association president laith shubeilat the most 
persistent government critic in the previous parliament said he 
opposes the brotherhood call for an islamic government at this 
time because other reforms should take place first 
its true that we call for islam to be the source of our laws 
and a guide to our daily life affairs but the islamic laws should 
be applied in such a way to fit with the needs of modern times 
shubeilat said

as a long winter of discontent approaches soviets 
are preparing for a more sober celebration of the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution that brought a troubled brand of socialism to their land 
lenins portrait in red and white is hanging once again on kgb 
headquarters at dzerzhinsky square shopworn decorations and giant 
red banners adorn the major streets in preparation for tuesdays 
72nd anniversary when military hardware will clank and rumble 
through red square 
but it is clear that few from president mikhail s gorbachev on 
down are interested in repeating the show of bravado that was 
standard on revolution day just a couple of years ago 
and there are signs that restive minorities and disgruntled 
workers in whose name lenin seized power can find little to 
celebrate 
a local chapter of the peoples front movement in the baltic 
republic latvia has declared the great october socialist 
revolution as it is called here not a revolution at all but a 
government coup that cut short the process of democratization 
that started after the february 1917 revolution 
communist party officials in the latvian capital of riga said 
efforts to belittle the revolution could destabilize the republic 
which along with neighbors lithuania and estonia is pushing fast 
and hard for autonomy 
workers building a new subway in the ural mountains industrial 
center of sverdlovsk rejected the city governments plans to 
organize brigades of shock workers to finish the first tunnel by 
the holiday such gargantuan efforts have been a part of soviet 
life for decades but this time the newspaper izvestia said the 
workers did not want to become a part of another whitewash and 
the city had to back down the new completion date is in the third 
quarter of 1990 
the kuznets basin of siberia has almost ground to a halt due 
to a lack of gasoline shops in the coalmining area that in july 
erupted in strikes over poor living and working conditions are 
nearly empty and there isnt enough gas for plows to remove the 
first snow from the streets tass said a shipment of fuel was 
dispatched from irkutsk 730 miles to the east but on siberias 
roads it will take five days to get there it should arrive tuesday 
cold rain and heavy clouds pressed down on moscow in the days 
preceding the holiday and even the prospect of four days in a row 
off from work didnt appear to help the mood soviets worked 
saturday instead of monday with sunday through wednesday off 
this year a crumbling distribution system and spasmodic coal 
strikes are making supplies of food consumer goods and even heat 
and electricity a worry 
in vorkuta in the soviet arctic where coal miners walked off 
their jobs again oct 25 a strike spokesman said police asked the 
workers whether they planned any disruption of the celebration 
there we respect the holiday but if we go to the parade well 
go with our own slogans said spokesman vladimir deneka in a 
telephone interview 
soviet officials already have made clear the revolution day 
celebration in moscow will be toned down 
official slogans have been a part of the festivities for years 
but the number of them has fallen steadily under gorbachev in 1986 
there were 50 this year there are 16 
for the past two years the bolshevik slogan workers of the 
world unite has been dropped and there is scant mention of 
lenin the slogans instead urge soviets to get on with the business 
of restructuring the economy and society 
one senior western diplomat who has watched many revolution day 
celebrations said the 1989 slogans are far less militant than a few 
years ago 
this years parade will be smaller than in previous years said 
col gen nikolai kalinin head of the moscow military district 
kalinin who until recently was the head of soviet airborne forces 
told tass that 220 military vehicles and 8197 soldiers will file 
past lenins mausoleum many of the soldiers in the parade will be 
afghanistan war veterans 
activists have appealed at meetings in the last week for people 
to join an alternate parade column they say will be forming in 
northwest moscow 
gorbachev has reduced the adulation of party and government 
leaders that stuck in official celebrations from stalins time 
through the era of leonid i brezhnev from 196482 
but the soviet leader still believes that his people have kept 
their faith in soviet socialism are beginning to transform it and 
do have something to celebrate 
in a meeting with officials of the staterun media in october 
gorbachev said it was time for the press and for soviets generally 
to get over their preoccupation with finding fault 
the english have a proverb it is better to light one candle 
than to curse the darkness all your life gorbachev said 
people already are lighting the candles and we cannot ignore

the first plane in a hightech customs service 
radar fleet has been plagued by electronic and mechanical problems 
that seriously compromise its ability to find and track 
drugsmuggling aircraft according to agency documents 
one coast guard officer who went along on an early mission 
summed up a lot of gee whiz gadgets and color displays but a 
lot of the basic requirements for useful detection and tracking are 
absent 
deficiencies have included an unreliable computer system that 
has trouble locating and tracking smugglers faulty onboard 
communications for the crew and a problem with a spinning metal 
radar dome according to the documents most of them written by 
crew members 
some initial reports critical of the performance of the first 
27 million p3 airborne early warning aew aircraft were ordered 
rewritten by an agency supervisor to stress success and not 
failures according to the documents and customs sources 
some of the same problems have afflicted a second p3 delivered 
last april at a cost of 306 million according to the documents 
and sources congress has approved 35 million for a third p3 all 
the planes are based at customs surveillance support center at 
corpus christi texas 
the p3 has been used for years to detect enemy submarines but 
the new electronics have been custom designed for the drug war 
officials at the customs service and the manufacturer lockheed 
aeronautical systems co but both say the plane works well 
overall though they concede some problems exist 
it works and it works great said peter kendig acting 
director of the surveillance support center he said there are a 
few glitches in the system that tracks the speed and course of 
potential targets and in a separate system for fixing the location 
of other planes but added they are being resolved 
he said the p3 aews were mainly responsible for detections 
leading to 36 arrests from jan 1 to aug 10 this year seizures of 
37000 pounds of marijuana and 8300 pounds of cocaine as well as 
vessels aircraft and vehicles 
john mcginnis director of lockheeds airborne early warning 
program said the firm is making improvements in the tracker and in 
other areas because of anomalous behavior that we could not 
prevent the plane is functioning but there are problems with it 
and we are correcting it the airplane and the tracker are very 
capable and doing their job he said adding the firm hopes to 
have the difficulties fixed by the first of next year 
the plane is not designed to intercept suspected smuggler 
aircraft or ships instead it monitors a wide expanse of airspace 
and open seas and when a suspicious craft is sighted other 
customs service planes are summoned for pursuit 
the p3 aews can be crucial to the nations drug interdiction 
effort because 51 percent of the 112000 kilograms of cocaine 
seized during 1988 came by air including 45 percent in private 
planes according to the federal governments multiagency el paso 
intelligence center 
according to the customs documents problems with the 
electronics cropped up almost immediately after lockheed delivered 
the first fourengine turboprop to the corpus christi center in 
june 1988 
one customs source said the planes course altitude and speed 
readings have been so unreliable that crewmen worry that 
interceptors they send after a drug plane could end up colliding 
with the target 
you cant use the system for interception and thats what this 
magic is all about said a crew member who would speak only on 
condition of anonymity 
both of the p3 planes have kept flying while efforts continue 
to fix the problems 
according to documents and interviews with knowledgeable agency 
sources the problems on the first p3 aew include 
the multicolored multigraphic computer screens had trouble 
tracking target planes for speed altitude direction and distance 
some single targets were displayed as multiple images targets were 
lost when the p3s computer system crashed ships registered 
on the computer as planes moving at hundreds of knots thousands of 
feet in the air 
it was discovered in november 1988 that some bolts attaching 
the heavy metal radar dome to the plane were overtorqued and had 
sheared off customs supervisors said the rotodome was not in 
danger of separating from the aircraft but one memo suggested the 
dome would become a neat frisbee when it would come off from 
25000 feet 
radar specialists on board were unable to monitor pilots 
transmissions a handicap that would according to a memo 
hinder safety of flight and impede crew coordination a memo 
warned of the potential for a total communications failure 
one supervisor at corpus christi ordered two crewmen to alter 
highly critical reports of the first p3s performance during a 
then topsecret mission operation barrier in late july and early 
august 1988 this was the first operational test of the new p3 
to allow production as is will provide the customs service 
with an undeveloped asset that requires additional personnel to 
operate it as well as producing a high stress environment to do so 
from concluded one memo that was later rewritten 
a number of documents about the p3s were colorful semiofficial 
inhouse customs memos called eagle droppings those stupid 
ghost tracks theyre like herpes you cant get rid of them one 
such memo said on nov 18 1988 referring to false readings on 
suspected targets 
identification of the authors of most of the documents was 
obscured by sources who made the material available 
after operation barrier was completed in early august 1988 four 
reports were written two highly critical then two more favorable 
versions 
one of the originals dated aug 2 said deficiencies in the 
tracking program required use of antiquated raw radar to 
verify the validity of the computer displays and to provide 
accurate intercept data 
the same author rewrote his report after being told to 
according to sources and called the operation a complete 
success however yet another memo on may 2 1989 said in 
reference to the newly arrived second p3 aew what has been done 
to the tracker not a damn thing 
despite the difficulties kendig at the corpus christi 
surveillance center called the aircraft a costeffective piece 
of equipment giving taxpayers one of best bangs for the buck in 
government today 
he said incorrect altitude readings and displays of ships as 
planes are characteristic of the radar system and the 
military has the same problems

swiss president jeanpascal delamuraz and the 
international committee of the red cross renewed calls monday for 
the release of two red cross relief workers kidnapped a month ago 
in southern lebanon 
the families of emilio erriquez and emanuel christen both swiss 
nationals warned the greatest threat to the hostages was that they 
might be forgotten 
a red cross spokeswoman said the oct 6 kidnapping had deprived 
81 civil war victims of rehabilitation treatment by forcing the 
closure of its orthopedic center in sidon where the two men helped 
fit artificial limbs 
delamuraz repeated his governments condemnation of this 
inhuman act he called on all parties in lebanon to respect 
international humanitarian law and allow the red cross to continue 
its work helping lebanese and palestinian people in the country 
we are all concerned by this act of violence and are all 
affected by events in lebanon delamuraz said on swiss radio 
appealing for an end to this ordeal the red cross said all 
lebanese parties the plo and other palestinian organizations in 
lebanon had condemned this outrageous and unjustifiable act 
no group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping the plo 
and sidon police contend that emanuel and erriquez are held by 
fatah revolutionary council a breakaway guerrilla group led by 
palestinian terrorist mastermind abu nidal the group has denied 
the accusation 
another red cross delegate peter winkler was kidnapped a year 
ago and released after one month in captivity death threats after 
winkler was freed prompted the red cross to pull out from lebanon 
it returned several weeks later after lebanese factions guaranteed 
there would be no more attacks on the neutral humanitarian 
organization 
eighteen westerners are missing in lebanon the longest held is 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press who was kidnapped march 16 1985

nicaraguan rebels said today they 
will meet representatives of the nicaraguan government in new york 
this week for their first direct talks in more than a year 
the meetings will take place thursday and friday at the united 
nations 
nicaraguas president daniel ortega proposed a meeting when he 
canceled a 19month ceasefire with the usbacked contras on 
wednesday he suggested the meeting be held this week the contras 
proposed thursday and friday 
contra military leader enrique bermudez told the associated 
press we have accepted the new proposal for dialogue from 
ortega 
we will make another effort to end the war and bloodshed in 
nicaragua we will make another effort to have the nicaraguan 
electoral process be fulfilled feb 25 1990 he said 
bermudez said the rebel delegation comprised of himself and 
four rebel commanders will travel thursday from tegucigalpa to new 
york 
in new york a senior un official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said all issues will be on the agenda including the 
disbanding of the contras security guarantees for rebels returning 
to nicaragua and political reform in nicaragua 
the last time the contras and sandinistas held direct talks was 
in june 1988 those talks broke down when nicaragua refused to 
agree to sweeping contra demands for reform including an end to 
government control of the army and police 
under a central american peace plan signed last year the 
contras are to be disbanded by dec 5 
so far few have shown any inclination to lay down their weapons 
and return home although some have returned to nicaragua with 
their weapons 
ortega said infiltrating contras have killed dozens of people in 
the country and are trying to disrupt the campaign for national 
elections to be held feb 25 he cited that as the reason for 
calling off the ceasefire 
the contras denied ortegas allegations 
the state department has said about 2000 contras have 
infiltrated nicaragua in recent weeks from honduras about 10000

some researchers say changes in atmospheric 
pressure and the tidal pull of the sun and moon may have triggered 
californias disastrous earthquake and many scientists call the 
theory plausible but still unproven 
a few studies have suggested quakes happen more often during 
very high ocean tides when solar and lunar gravity also tug at 
solid ground and when shifting masses of heavier air create 
certain highpressure systems and related winds that press down on 
and rub against the ground 
the government warned oct 12 of the highest pacific tides in 
years during the week of the oct 17 quake on the san andreas 
fault the jolt measured 71 on the richter scale killed at least 
66 people in the san francisco bay area and happened during 
breezy warm and dry conditions dubbed earthquake weather in 
california folklore 
quakes arent caused by such weather but might be triggered by 
the same atmospheric pressure conditions that create warm winds 
said meteorologist jerome namias of the scripps institution of 
oceanography in la jolla 
abnormal pressures and wind systems operating on the fault 
could encourage slipping motion along the san andreas which if 
other conditions were right would then trigger this quake said 
namias who headed the national weather services extended forecast 
division for 30 years its conceivable the high tide added to 
this condition 
i would say it is at least 90 percent likely there was some 
tidal influence on the timing of this quake said astronomer 
stephen kilston of lockheed palo alto research laboratory 
but many seismologists remain skeptical 
the idea of triggering earthquakes by tidal or atmospheric 
forces is at least physically plausible said seismologist lucile 
jones of the us geological survey the problem is that none of 
the studies have been very convincing 
jones and others said statistical analyses failed to convince 
them correlations between quakes and tidal or atmospheric forces 
are more than coincidence 
just like a poker player can think his royal flushes are 
caused by his rabbits foot some people find what they think are 
patterns in the random distribution of earthquakes she said 
namias said his unfinished preliminary study shows that during 
autumns since 1947 quakes were more frequent when high pressure 
hovers above western canada 
the study covers only southern california but namias said 
amazingly high pressure was centered over canada during the 
recent quake when winds rotating clockwise brought warm southeast 
winds to northern california 
a 1983 study found southern california quakes of magnitude6 and 
larger were most likely when tidal forces are strongest near full 
or new moons within a couple of hours of sunrise or sunset and 
within two years of when the moon is farthest north of earth a 
point reached every 186 years 
each of those conditions can pull faults apart to trigger 
quakes suggested the study published in nature by kilston and ucla 
geophysicist leon knopoff 
three days before the oct 17 quake the moon was full and was 
closer to earth than it had been in three years kilston said the 
quake happened an hour before sunset two days later the moon was 
at its northernmost point in its monthly cycle 
tidal forces are stronger than atmospheric forces but no one 
has been able to show tidal gravity actually created stress on a 
fault during an earthquake said bruce bolt a seismologist at the 
university of california berkeley 
bolt said he doubts atmospheric forces extend deep enough 
underground to trigger fault movement 
tidal and atmospheric stresses are not trivial its 
reasonable they might be able to set off a fault thats ready to go 
anyway said don anderson director of the california institute 
of technologys seismological laboratory 
im prepared to accept it if somebody makes a good case but i 
havent seen a good case yet 
advocates of the tidal and atmospheric theories dont claim such 
forces cause quakes only that they might be the last straws needed 
to set off a quake on a section of fault already about to snap 
under accumulated stress caused by movement of giant plates of rock 
that make up earths crust 
namias published a study last year showing summertime quakes in 
southern california happened more often when low pressure covered 
the west and high pressure hovered over the eastern pacific he 
speculated winds flowing from high to low pressure might trigger 
quakes by piling seawater against the coast 
kilston said killer quakes that rocked california in 1857 1933 
1952 and 1987 all happened within two years of the peak of the 
186year lunar cycle and near full or new moons and sunrises or 
sunsets 
jones said such timing is coincidental a much more thorough 
geological survey study found no link between tides and quakes she 
said

an insurance company has agreed to pay former uss 
iowa sailor kendall truitt 100000 in the death of a crewmate whom 
the navy blames for the shipboard explosion that killed 47 
truitts attorney said today 
the policy taken out a year ago by clayton hartwig with truitt 
as the beneficiary played a part in the initial navy investigation 
of the april 19 disaster truitt was eventually cleared but the 
navy continues to say that it is likely that hartwig set off the 
explosion on purpose to commit suicide 
today amex assurance co of san rafael calif reached an 
agreement with truitt and the hartwig family to pay the 100000 
said truitts attorney ellis rubin 
we have settled the claim and they are going to pay the full 
policy rubin said some of the money rubin refused to say how 
much will be given to the hartwig family 
rubin said the payment was one more piece of evidence showing 
hartwig did not blow up the gun turrett to kill himself as the 
navy believes if the insurance company thought he had committed 
suicide they would not have paid he said 
hartwig named truitt as the beneficiary of a 50000 policy 
which had a clause doubling the benefit for accidental death 
initial leaks from the navy investigation suggested that truitt 
and hartwig had a homosexual relationship that had gone sour and 
said truitt was a target of the probe because of the insurance 
claim 
truitt who is married strongly denied any sexual relationship 
with hartwig or any involvement in the fatal blast the navys 
official report cleared truitt in the case 
rubin said truitt currently stationed at mayport naval station 
near jacksonville is to testify wednesday in washington before a 
congressional committee investigating the explosion and would have 
no comment before then 
hartwigs family had initially protested payment of truitts 
claim that prompted truitt to sue amex assurance a division of 
american express in us district court in miami

the roman catholic nun missing more than 
24 hours in guatemala last week said she was kidnapped tortured 
and sexually abused by three men in a building where other people 
were also apparently being abused 
diana ortiz returned here sunday and is resting quietly in a 
convent in an undisclosed location said the two nuns who brought 
her back to this country sisters darleen chmielewski and mary 
elizabeth ballard 
the kidnapping could have been an act of vengeance directed at 
the church or it might have been an act of personal vengeance for 
some real or imagined slight ballard said 
chmielewski and ballard said ortiz 31 wanted to make her story 
public to draw attention to conditions in the central american 
country where they said a repressive military regime backs a 
puppet elected government and terrorism is a fact of daily life 
ortiz a native of grants nm is a member of the ursuline 
sisters of mount st joseph a religious community based near 
owensboro ky 
after teaching kindergarten at two schools in kentucky she 
moved to guatemala to do the same kind of work in the village of 
san miguel acatan 
she was not involved in any kind of political activity the 
sisters said 
but for some reason around the first of this year ortiz 
started receiving anonymous threatening letters telling her to 
leave the country in july a man she didnt know accosted her and 
repeated the threat 
early thursday morning according to her written account the 
same man and another approached her showed her a pistol and 
threatened to harm her friends if she didnt come quietly with them 
to answer some questions 
she was taken by bus and car to a large building under threat 
of harm if she cried out where they were met by a third man 
dressed as a police officer ortiz said she could hear men moaning 
and a woman screaming in pain 
ortiz said she was struck in the face and abused sexually she 
said the three men showed her photographs taken in san miguel 
asked her to identify people pictured and burned her after each 
answer she gave 
finally another man came in and ordered the abuse to stop 
calling the other three idiots and saying she is a north 
american let her alone its already on the news on television 
she said this fourth man took her to guatemala city about an 
hours trip by car he asked her to pardon them because they had 
mistaken her for someone else but also acknowledged that they had 
sent her the anonymous letters

rudolph giuliani trying to overcome a wide gap 
in the polls with only one day to go says david dinkins finances 
should be investigated no matter who wins the mayoral race 
i think it is now quite clear that he does not have the 
honesty and integrity that commends him to the voters giuliani 
said sunday in the second of two televised debates 
the former us attorney was asked if he as mayor would order 
an investigation into dinkins finances theres no question that 
david dinkins has to be investigated he replied 
today he added through a spokesman it is not the function of 
the mayor to investigate of course that will be up to federal and 
state authorities 
dinkins bristled at what he called giulianis distortions and 
complaints reiterating that he has put to rest questions about 
his failure to file income tax returns 20 years ago and about a 
stock transfer to his son 
told of giulianis pledge to investigate him if elected dinkins 
said i suppose he just cant get the prosecutor out of himself 
he seems not to realize that hes running for mayor 
dinkins would be the first black mayor of new york if elected 
tuesday he beat the incumbent edward i koch in the september 
democratic primary 
the giuliani campaign made fresh allegations sunday that dinkins 
has concealed information about his finances 
dinkins who is manhattans borough president acknowledged that 
he did not report on financial disclosure forms that a local 
jewelry manufacturer paid for most of a trip to france he and his 
wife took in 1988 but he said it was all a mistake and that the 
man does not do business with the city 
city officials are required to report all gifts valued at 500 
or more dinkins promised to file amended forms today to include 
the trip as a gift 
the latest poll showed dinkins leading giuliani by 51 percent to 
35 percent the poll of 2006 registered voters was conducted 
friday and saturday for wnywtv it had a margin of error of 2 
percentage points 
giuliani opened sundays debate on wnbctv by hitting hard at 
dinkins personal finances he charged that dinkins failed to make 
good on a promise to reveal records showing he transferred stock in 
a cable tv company to his son 
referring to dinkins charge from the first debate saturday 
night that new yorkers need a mayor not a prosecutor giuliani 
said i think the people of this town want a mayor who has 
nothing to fear from a prosecutor

a united nations envoy said monday he is 
hopeful a breakthrough is possible in the deadlocked peace talks 
between iran and iraq 
jan eliasson swedens ambassador to the united nations arrived 
in baghdad sunday night from tehran on the third part of a new 
diplomatic mission seeking to revive the stalled negotiations 
he said he had fruitful discussions with iranian leaders on 
his threeday visit to tehran 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus quoted the tehran times newspaper monday as saying it was 
doubtful eliasson would be able to break the deadlock it added 
however that hopes for a lasting peace cannot be ruled out 
altogether 
eliasson representing un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar spent four days in baghdad last week at the start of his 
mission which is expected to last another two weeks 
he said his talks in baghdad and tehran were productive and 
interesting but as im in the middle of the process i cant go 
into details now 
eliasson was to meet iraqi foreign minister tareq aziz who 
heads the iraqi negotiating team at the peace talks that began aug 
25 1988 five days after a unsponsored ceasefire in the 
eightyear war between iran and iraq 
eliasson was expected to stay in baghdad for two days before 
returning to tehran 
eliasson said he met iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati and other officials but he 
declined to elaborate 
un officials have said eliasson is not carrying any specific 
proposals to break the impasse 
western diplomats said he was trying to convince iranian and 
iraqi leaders to start an exchange of more than 100000 prisoners 
of war held by both sides and to convince the iraqis to withdraw 
from iranian border territory they captured at the end of the war 
neither side has given any sign that their positions have 
changed since the last round of talks collapsed in april 
iran claims iraq holds 1080 square miles un observers 
estimate iraq holds 386 square miles 
the un ceasefire resolution accepted by both sides calls on 
them to withdraw all forces to prewar borders and exchange 
prisoners of war 
iran has said there can be no progress in the negotiations until 
iraq withdraws baghdad accuses tehran of blocking the pow exchange 
and refusing facetoface talks 
iraq has insisted iran allow the shattalarab waterway the 
southern boundary between the two countries to be dredged and 
reopened after its enforced closure that began in september 1980 
iran refuses the 120mile waterway formed by the confluence of 
the euphrates and tigris rivers was iraqs main outlet to the 
persian gulf before the war 
since the ceasefire the iraqis have been seeking to open other 
waterways in the south to provide access to the gulf from the port 
of basra

a newly published longlost short story by robert 
louis stevenson is a whimsical tale of an english gentleman way 
down on his luck who marries a wealthy young woman and must obey 
her every order 
the story the enchantress is published for the first time 
in the fall edition of georgia review the literary magazine of the 
university of georgia david mann a professor of the miami 
university of ohio who found the manuscript among uncataloged 
papers at yale university notes in the introduction he coauthored 
that the story departs from stevensons tendency to focus on male 
characters 
the 27page manuscript was handwritten in pencil apparently in 
1889 while stevenson was on the schooner equator from hawaii to 
samoa where he spent the last years of his life after leaving 
scotland because of his failing health he died in samoa in 1894 
it is believed to be the last unaccountedfor complete stevenson 
story it followed his bestknown works treasure island 
kidnapped and a childs garden of verses 
the newly discovered text initially titled a singular 
marriage was suppressed for years by stevensons stepson lloyd 
osborne he apparently felt the description of the female 
character miss croft too closely resembled his mother fanny 
it was sold for the first time in 1914 the year fanny died and 
changed hands among collectors until it was bought at auction in 
1923 and dropped from sight 
in the firstperson story the hero a mr hatfield is lounging 
outside a french casino broke from gambling and wondering where 
hell find his next meal 
he considers several options and decides on panhandling his 
first and last target is the lovely miss croft a wealthy 
orphan under the nominal control of a guardian who is himself 
something of a gambler and not a very good one 
in cumbersome victorian english hatfield puts the bite on miss 
croft who identifies him as a gentleman she gives him 1000 
francs a bundle in those days turns up the charm and makes a 
proposition 
they are to meet as if by accident in paris take the same train 
to calais and the same boat back to england 
you are a gentleman put your hand in mine and promise you 
will obey me implicitly she said 
the enchantress goes on to live up to her name 
you have picked up a tool miss croft hatfield says what 
do you propose to do with it you have bought a slave i hope you 
like him 
miss croft proposes marriage on these terms if hatfield 
refuses she will set him up in a comfortable business and never 
see him again if he accepts he is to have a stipend of 300 pounds 
sterling a year paid quarterly less than he would get if he 
refused and she gives the orders 
she asks hatfield whether you prefer to be my husband or my 
pensioner 
they are married in a simple ceremony in scotland only after 
hatfield now lovestruck tries to forego the stipend it is her 
lawyer assures him a package deal no money no enchantress 
after the ceremony she says goodbye on a street corner 
reminding him of his promise to obey and tells him to return to his 
hotel room 
two days later a letter from her lawyer arrives saying it would 
be better if he never saw miss croft again and that she had left 
the country 
it turns out that miss croft had just turned 21 but could not 
get control of her inheritance from the guardian until she married 
thinking her guardian not to be a sound businessman she took the 
obvious course and married

tests to see whether doctors can help him without surgery 
the tests scheduled to end tuesday at veterans administration 
hospital also could lead to an operation known as a cochlear 
implantation 
wallace 70 has relied on the telephone in recent years to keep 
in touch with people but his increasing loss of hearing has 
interfered with that said his chief aide elvin stanton 
wallace recently has had to write notes to converse hearing 
aids havent helped 
put a hearing aid on and all i hear is loud talking but i 
cant understand wallace told the birmingham postherald in an 
interview earlier this year 
we are hoping we can help him said dr jerry alpiner chief 
of audiology at the va hospital and help him without resorting 
to the implant but we wont rule that out either 
alpiner said patients should not expect too much from a cochlear 
implantation in which hearing is stimulated by tiny electrodes 
hooked to a miniature microphone in the inner ear

east germans crossed the border 
by the carload in a cold light rain monday including a young 
couple who came directly from their wedding still wearing formal 
attire 
west germans who watched the stream of cars entering west 
germany from czechoslovkia predicted many refugees would return 
home if communist east germany introduced enough reforms 
the waiting line of vehicles was 400 yards long at the 
schirnding crossing in northeastern bavaria 
a lot of them will go back if there are true democratic 
changes that create real trust in the government said music 
teacher franz meixner from wuerzburg in central bavaria i 
estimate it could be twothirds 
meixner who is 60 and left east berlin for the west in 1948 
said his sympathy went out to the newcomers 
my neighbors say why are they coming here he said 
especially the young west germans claim the refugees are taking 
away jobs and apartments i tell my neighbors they should go over 
there and see how they like it 
last month east germany announced an amnesty that appears to 
allow the return of any of the tens of thousands who have fled 
without exit visas 
adn the official east german news agency said late monday more 
than 23000 citizens had left through czechoslovakia in the 
previous three days they join more than 150000 who have emigrated 
legally escaped or failed to return from approved trips abroad 
this year 
west german officials have had to requisition temporary shelter 
and demands have arisen that the flow of refugees be ended 
chancellor helmut kohl said political and economic reform is needed 
in east germany to keep its people home 
gabi engmann standing in the rain at the schirnding crossing 
said she also believed many refugees would return if reforms came 
to pass 
in west germany they will certainly find there is a real 
housing shortage said the 52yearold hairdresser from wunsiedel 
kohls government has have promised a major building program to 
ease the shortage and is recommending the use of vacant offices as 
apartments 
manfred mueller 59 of nearby hof believed the pull on 
refugees would be strong if conditions improved in east germany 
just consider how much they left behind friends relatives and 
almost all their belongings 
government officials estimated late last month that about 
onethird of east germans who had arrived since september still 
were unemployed 
ethnic germans also arew arriving from elsewhere 
red cross officials say they expect up to 400000 from the 
soviet union and other east european countries this year 
ardtv said the east germans were arriving with huge hopes 
it showed the couple crossing the border in their wedding finery 
sylvio lube 21 rode his motorcycle through cold rain rain to 
schirnding from koenigswusterhausen just south of east berlin 
when you have a goal you can get used to the cold the 
shivering factory worker said after the 180mile ride 
he said he left his 21yearold wife janette and their two 
small children but im hoping to get them out later all i had 
was this motorcycle to leave with we dont even own a car

leaders of the main black 
labor federation monday called for a beer boycott by consumers and 
tavern owners to support workers on a fourweek strike against the 
countrys beer monopoly 
the boycott will not end until the demands of the workers are 
met said a statement issued by johannesburgarea officials of 
the congress of south african trade unions which claims 1 million 
members 
about 6000 employees of privately owned south african breweries 
went on strike to press for a wage increase of 38 percent the 
company has refused to revise its offer of a 16 percent raise and 
says it will agree to mediation on other contract matters only if 
the wage dispute is left off the agenda 
throughout the strike the company has accused the food and 
allied workers union of sanctioning violence against employees who 
continued to work one workerss house was burned down and armed 
guards were placed aboard some delivery trucks after a driver was 
killed in durban 
the trade union congress in its boycott call urged all our 
people to conduct this campaign in a peaceful and disciplined 
method 
anticipating the possibility of a boycott the company last week 
expressed concern that it would be enforced through coercion 
people are being asked to lose their jobs and their 
livelihoods in solidarity with peple who are refusing one of the 
highest wage packages in the country the company said 
the companys wage offer would raise monthly pay for its 
lowestpaid workers to about 400 that is more than twice the 
minimum wage for members of the national union of mineworkers the 
largest black union 
blacks consume about 80 percent of south africas beer and the 
national association of black tavern owners has agreed to support 
the boycott however the main association of black liquor store 
outlets has declined to do so saying their customers would simply 
turn to whiteowned stores 
south african breweries produces all four leading beer brands in 
south africa which imports relatively small quantities of beer 
from abroad the strike has affected seven of the companys 11 
breweries but production has continued and no reports of severe 
shortages have surfaced yet as summer approaches 
there have been no contract negotations since the strike began 
although the union last week suggested the two sides agree to 
mediation

20th centurys titan of the keyboard whose passing created a void 
that can never be filled 
the russianborn virtuoso who brought controlled thunder to 
the piano and was a last link to the 19th century masters died 
sunday at 85 in his upper east side home funeral services were set 
for friday at the famous la scala opera house in milan italy 
horowitz left his native russia in 1925 and came to the united 
states in 1928 playing his first american concert seven days later 
he was an instant success 
when he played hed turn on the current and it would hit sort 
of like a shockwave said morton gould president of the american 
society of composers authors and publishers his performance had 
that unique electricity that was magical 
he touched every musician who ever heard him said pianist 
murray perahia who was at the home when horowitz died he knew 
all the repertory and could play pieces he hadnt done in 20 
years 
horowitz had been in good health and as recently as last week 
was recording in his living room said his manager peter gelb 
less than three weeks ago hundreds of admirers filled a record 
store for an albumsigning session 
his last performances were in 1987 in berlin hamburg west 
germany and amsterdam netherlands gelb said the year before he 
had returned to moscow for the first time in 61 years for an 
emotional concert shown on american television 
his final american performances were in the fall of 1986 gelb 
said when he played at new yorks lincoln center and the reopening 
of the refurbished carnegie hall 
his awards included the medal of freedom the nations highest 
civilian award in 1986 the legion of honor from france and italys 
order of merit he also was the recipient of more than 20 grammy 
awards 
he is survived by his wife of 56 years wanda daughter of the 
late conductor arturo toscanini visitation was set for tuesday 
afternoon in new york and then the body would be flown to italy 
for the service at la scala a spokeswoman for gelb said today he 
will be buried in the toscanini family plot in milan gelb said 
in a letter of condolence to mrs horowitz composerconductor 
leonard bernstein called the temperamental pianist a super 
musician with all the mortal fallibilities such geniuses have 
referring to horowitzs occasional long withdrawals from 
performance bernstein wrote that mrs horowitz cared for him and 
returned him to us time and again refreshed renewed and ever 
greater 
the greatest legend of the piano in the 20th century is dead 
and his death leaves a vacuum which probably can never be filled 
lamented sir georg solti the chicago symphonys music director 
pianist emanuel ax said an audience could feel horowitz energy 
when he performed 
there was the sense of an unbelievable energy being harnessed 
and the feeling that if he ever let it go it would burn up the 
hall ax said 
pianist andre watts said it would be hard to come up with an 
equivalent there isnt another horowitz thank god for 
recordings 
watts also said that horowitz during a performance was like a 
demon barely under control out there on the stage 
president carter in 1978 called horowitz a national treasure 
horowitz played the white house three times first at herbert 
hoovers request second at carters and the third for 
thenpresident reagan 
roman popadiuk deputy white house press secretary said in a 
statement 
we are saddened at the loss of this worldrenowned musician 
we extend our sympathies to his family his musical legacy will 
continue to live on 
horowitz whose sartorial trademark was a bow tie was known for 
his intense electric performances his technique and skill his 
rich interpretations speed and a power described as controlled 
thunder 
in addition to his playing audiences were charmed by 
eccentricities his impish smiles and twinkling eyes he traveled 
with his steinway grand piano 
he called playing the piano as the coordination of mind heart 
and finger with emotion the key 
the brain is the control of emotion there has to be something 
to be controlled the heart is the guide the brain is the control 
what comes out had to have both he once said 
he often interrupted his career for long periods 1936 to 1938 
from 1953 to 1965 from 1968 to 1974 and from 1983 to 1985 
he continued to make records during the second retirement and 
served as mentor to five concert pianists who later would speak of 
the complex relationship that grew between them and their volatile 
teacher 
the demon inside me that urged him to do better and a 
desire to perform in public again brought him back to the stage 
when he was 61 with what critics said was a new maturity and a 
wider range 
the pace of his concerts slowed as he grew older but his 
reputation was undiminished 
no matter how difficult and complicated the piece horowitz 
would make it sound easy the new york times harold c schonberg 
once wrote 
horowitz was born vladimir gorowicz on oct 1 1904 on kievs 
music street his father simeon was a prosperous engineer 
impoverished by the russian revolution his mother sophie bodik 
was an amateur pianist who inspired such a love of music in her 
three children that daughter regina also became a concert pianist 
and son georg a violin teacher 
horowitz was given piano lessons at age 6 within three years 
he shocked his parents by learning all the rachmaninoff pieces in 
the family library and all the piano scores of wagners operas he 
attended the kiev conservatory where from age 12 to 16 he studied 
piano and composition under felix blumenfeld 
he made his concert debut at 19 seeking to earn money for his 
family 
horowitz left the soviet union on a sixmonth visa to study in 
the west instead of studying he began a twoyear european tour 
that won him acclaim it was during that tour when he played in 
berlin that he changed his name to horowitz 
in 1933 he was chosen as solo for toscaninis last in a series 
of beethoven concerts toscanini also introduced horowitz to his 
daughter and they were soon married 
horowitz who became a us citizen that year was a longtime 
critic of the soviet system i dont like the russian approach 
to music to art to anything and repeatedly said he would 
never return 
but he did return in 1986 
the soviets obviously had not forgotten him determined fans 
rushed police and stormed his moscow concert and open rehearsal it 
was the most talkedabout musical event in the soviet union in 
years 
horowitz only rival for acclaim and popularity was artur 
rubinstein who died in 1982 rubinstein conceded that horowitz was 
the better pianist but not the better musician 
i am a 19thcentury romantic horowitz once said i am the 
last

the communist party central committee holding 
its first plenary session since it purged reform leader zhao ziyang 
in june convenes this week to tighten the lock on the nations 
economic and political policies 
the plenum is expected to endorse a threeyear program 
advocated by hardline premier li peng reasserting central 
controls over the economy it may also fill vacancies in the 
partys decisionmaking politburo with supporters of the 
conservative line 
as is usually the case there has been no official announcement 
on the plenum but east european sources said it would begin monday 
and run for two or three days 
party leaders were reported to have met in a secret last week to 
map out the decisions to be made at the 5th plenary session of the 
13th central committee 
the plenum consisting of 175 central committee members and 108 
alternates will focus on the economic prospectus that many fear 
could be a setback for chinas 10year course of marketoriented 
reforms 
premier li and planning chief yao yilin are believed to be 
pushing for retrenchment policies that will revive the primacy of 
central planning restore the leadership of party functionaries in 
factories and economic planning departments and limit the growth 
of collective and private enterprise 
the plan is expected to cast aside price reforms and other 
structural changes while the government strives to slow down 
economic growth control inflation and bring centralized order into 
the economy in the next three years 
there have been indications though of resistance to the 
conservative line from proreform economists and officials from 
coastal provinces whose regions have flourished under 
decentralization and introduction of marketstyle economies 
the plenum was originally expected to convene in october but 
apparently was delayed because of differences over how far to push 
economic retrenchment 
differences may also remain over two other key issues the 
handling of disgraced former party chief zhao ziyang and the 
retirement of senior leader deng xiaoping 
at the june 2324 plenum zhao was purged from all his party 
posts and accused of abetting the prodemocracy demonstrations that 
were crushed in beijing by military force on june 34 
he has been under virtual house arrest since then and chinese 
leaders have suggested he could be put on trial for crimes against 
the state 
recent statements however indicate the plenum wont bring 
criminal charges against the former protege of deng it is also not 
clear whether the plenum will single out other zhao supporters for 
censure or punishment 
the plenum may also put off a decision on dengs retirement from 
his last official post as chairman of the central military 
commission deng is 85 
the post is one of the most powerful in chinas political 
hierarchy and the likely candidate is zhaos successor new party 
general secretary jiang zemin deng has anointed the 63yearold 
exshanghai party boss as his heirapparent and jiang needs the 
military ties to bolster his weak credentials as a national leader 
however president yang shangkun one of the masterminds of the 
june military crackdown also is bidding to head the military 
commission yang 82 is permanent vice chairman of the military 
commission 
but there is reported concern that yang is moving to establish a 
family dynasty within the military yangs younger brother yang 
baibing heads the army general political department his 
soninlaw chi haotian is chief of staff and his nephew yang 
jianhua is commander of the 27th army that spearheaded the bloody 
attack on beijing in june 
deng remains chinas strongest man despite his retirement from 
most of his official duties his departure from the military 
commission would not change that although the choice of his 
successor could influence the outcome of the power struggle 
expected to occur after dengs death 
the plenum may name new members of the party politburo which is 
down to 14 members after the loss of three reformists 
former party chief hu yaobang who was fired from his job but 
remained on the politburo after 198687 student demonstrations 
died in april sparking the the sevenweek prodemocracy movement 
zhao was removed from the politburo in june along with hu qili 
another leading advocated of reform

united states and china to restore good relations despite beijings 
military crackdown on prodemocracy forces 
despite nixons appeal the white house indicated it was not 
ready to change its approach which includes suspension of all 
highlevel official contacts 
nixon spent two hours at the white house on sunday evening 
reporting on his trip to china and meetings with senior leaders 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said monday

cia state department and national security council to camp david 
on saturday for the first in a series of briefings for his summit 
in december with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
it was a staff session primarily to assess the situation in 
the soviet union and to consider many of the political and economic 
issues that are now facing president gorbachev fitzwater said 
he said the meeting was not designed to produce new initiatives 
toward the soviet union and was the first of many presummit 
sessions 
theyre simply to give him a full explanation and opinion 
package from all sides of all issues before he goes so hes 
thoroughly acquainted with soviet actions soviet history issues 
of interest to the united states fitzwater said 
bush also discussed policy toward the soviet union over lunch 
monday with zbigniew brzezinski who was the national security 
adviser to president carter 
fitzwater said other meetings will include experts from outside 
government 
nixons trip to china put a fresh spotlight on the tensions 
between washington and beijing since junes bloody repression of 
the prodemocracy movement in china 
despite nixons call for restoration of relations fitzwater 
indicated the united states was taking a more cautious approach 
we do see some changes in china in terms of them reaching out 
to other parts of the world but at this point we have not 
determined that the time is right to make very dramatic changes 
he said 
fitzwater added the issue that would change our position are 
changes and actions in china 
asked if bush and nixon disagreed over strategy toward china 
fitzwater said i wouldnt want to suggest agreement or 
disagreement or suggest anything of the kind simply we just 
arent willing to describe the former presidents remarks he can 
do that fine 
the press spokesman said our general policy has not changed 
we do want to preserve the relationship and that as events 
proceed we will continue to consider possible actions that would 
change our relationship 
nixon traveling as a private citizen at the invitation of the

formula of 1972 the year of nixons historic dooropening visit to

president jimmy carter who told a group of reporters in 
washington that he believes the sanctions imposed on china are just 
about right 
noting chinas extreme sensitivity to interference by 
foreigners carter said i think all of us should help 
reintegrate china in the world community without relinquishing our 
commitment to basic human rights

the supreme court was told monday that 
establishing a constitutional right to take peyote in religious 
ceremonies would allow use of a dangerous hallucinogenic drug and 
could lead to broader drug use 
it can cause psychotic reactions in a small number of users 
oregon attorney general david frohnmayer said about peyote it is 
very risky 
however craig j dorsay argued that the survival of the native 
american church would be threatened if oregon officials are allowed 
to deny unemployment compensation to two men fired for using peyote 
at religious ceremonies 
dorsay who represents the two fired workers said small amounts 
of peyote had been used in religious ceremonies for hundreds of 
years with practically no evidence of harm alcohol generally is 
more dangerous to indians he said 
frohnmayer said that if the drug is permitted in church 
ceremonies it will be a wedge for drug use by other religious 
groups citing a pending state case involving the use of marijuana 
when asked by justice antonin scalia if states may ban snake 
handling as a religious practice dorsay said i dont think 
theres a dispute that rattlesnakes can cause harm peyote misuse 
is dangerous not its controlled use in religious ceremonies 
the justices heard 60 minutes of arguments and are expected to 
announce a ruling by july after mondays court session members of 
the native american church conducted a religious ceremony on the 
grounds of the capitol across the street from the court 
peyote was not part of the ceremony leaders burned leaves and 
bits of cedar and prayed for the future of the church 
the case is before the nations highest court for the second 
time the justices last year sent it back to the oregon supreme 
court to determine whether the religious use of peyote was a crime 
in that state 
the state court declined to answer that question and once again 
ruled that oregon may not deny unemployment benefits for use of 
peyote in a religious ceremony 
the fired workers galen w black and alfred l smith were 
counselors with the douglas county ore council on alcohol and 
drug abuse prevention and treatment 
after each took small amounts of peyote as part of a church 
sacrament they were fired for violating company policy 
peyote a cactus button containing the hallucinogen 
mescaline is an illegal drug under oregon law 
but high court members said monday that state officials 
apparently dont try to ban peyote use on indian reservations 
isnt it likely there will continue to be exemptions from 
criminal laws for peyote use regardless of how the court rules 
justice john paul stevens suggested 
the opposing lawyers disputed whether the amounts taken by black 
and smith at the church services could cause dangerous 
hallucinations 
smith a klamath indian is an alcoholic who has not used 
alcohol since 1957 he counseled alcoholics for the county agency 
black is not an indian he worked for the agency counseling drug 
users while he was recovering from drug and alcohol abuse 
the rehabilitation program has changed its policy agreeing not 
to fire employees for the sacramental use of peyote 
the case is employment division vs smith 881213

leaders of a 23year guerrilla war 
against south african rule appealed for reconciliation monday on 
the eve of the election that will bring independence to namibia 
after more than a century of foreign rule 
i call on all namibians to forget the past and unite 
together to overthrow the yoke of colonialism said andimba toivo 
ja toivo secretary general of the southwest africa peoples 
organization 
swapo is favored to outpoll nine other parties in a fiveday 
united nationssupervised election starting tuesday for 72 seats in 
an assembly that will draft a constitution for independent namibia 
south african president fw de klerk urged namibians to cast 
your vote in the interest of peace and prosperity 
the strife and bitterness the mistrust and misunderstandings 
of the past must be put behind us he said 
an airplane chartered by swapos main rival the democratic 
turnhalle alliance to broadcast political messages was forced down 
by gunfire monday but otherwise authorities reported calm 
throughout the arid sparsely populated territory 
police said the singleengine plane crashlanded and caught fire 
after being hit by bullets over the northern region of kavango the 
two men aboard the plane were not seriously hurt and a hunt for 
the attackers was launched police said 
fred eckhard chief spokesman for the un monitoring force 
said officials were nervous because there is a deepseated mutual 
distrust on the part of supporters of different parties 
the peace is a fragile peace eckhard said 
posters and tv advertisements financed by un and territorial 
officials have been stressing that ballots will be secret and 
urging the 701453 registered voters to vote without fear 
swapo is the overwhelming frontrunner and the key question is 
whether it will win twothirds of the votes which would allow it 
to draft a constitution without compromising with other parties 
the day has finally arrived when nambians will vote for 
freedom said swapo president sam nujoma who spent 30 years in 
exile 
both nujoma and de klerk said they were prepared to accept the 
results of the election regardless of the outcome as long as the 
uns chief representative martti ahtisaari certified that the 
voting was free and fair 
nujoma said namibian patriots of other parties would be 
invited to join a swapoled government but he ruled out a role for 
dirk mudge a white moderate who is the bestknown leader of the 
democratic turnhalle alliance 
the alliance is a multiracial coalition which participated in a 
south africaninstalled transitional government 
nambia was colonized by germany in 1884 and captured by south 
africa in 1915 south africa agreed last year to grant independence 
as part of a regional treaty that also calls for the phased 
withdrawal of cuban troops from angola namibias northern neighbor 
last week south african foreign minister pik botha raised the 
possibility of delaying the elections when he alleged that swapo 
guerrillas had mobilized along the angolanamibian border for a 
treatybreaking incursion into the territory botha later admitted 
his charge was based on false radio messages and said prospects for 
free and fair elections were good 
some opposition politicians and newspapers in south africa have 
demanded bothas resignation and there have been calls for an 
investigation of the possibility that he was duped by rightwing 
elements in the military who sought to undermine the namibian 
elections 
un election officials said votes will be cast at 358 polling 
stations including 143 mobile booths sent to remote areas final 
results are expected by the end of next week 
the voting will be monitored by 1695 un supervisers along 
with observers from at least 25 foreign countries and 
representatives of the namibian political parties 
the un force will remain in namibia until independence 
expected early next year but eckhard said other un agencies 
would take over trying to track down more than 300 missing 
namibians who allegedly were detained by swapo at prison camps in 
angola and zambia 
at the united nations on monday secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar noted that there have been 120000 gun permits issued 
and said he was concerned about a possible outbreak of violence 
after the election 
while at this time there have been marked improvements in 
the security situation on the eve of the election i remain 
vigilant to the possibility of a deterioration in the field of law 
and order he said

gov george deukmejian today signed a 
12bill earthquake relief package including a temporary sales tax 
hike to raise 800 million 
were going to do whatever is necessary to restore the lives 
and the homes of the people who were victims of this quake 
deukmejian said as he began signing the bills 
as mayor art agnos and a dozen legislators looked on deukmejian 
signed the relief package at 1145 am after riding a ferry boat 
across the san francisco bay from oakland 
although state lawmakers approved the temporary sales tax 
increase for earthquake relief the package was nearly derailed by 
partisan bickering 
legislators completed a hectic threeday special session over 
the weekend but only after rejecting claims that the sales tax 
hike was insufficient or premature 
the oct 17 quake killed at least 66 injured 3000 and did an 
estimated 7 billion damage in northern california the levy 
intended to raise 800 million would take effect dec 1 
i congratulate the legislature on its quick action on the 
earthquake relief package to assist the earthquake victims in 
rebuilding their lives businesses and communities deukmejian 
said 
state and federal aid the republican governor said should 
provide the necessary resources in order to restore some semblance 
of normalcy in the bay area 
some legislators of both parties criticized the plan which 
raises the sales tax to as much as 7 cents on the dollar depending 
on local rates deukmejian also plans to tap the state reserve for 
200 million 
some lawmakers insisted the cost of the earthquake repairs will 
be much higher than the total 425 billion in approved federal aid 
and state funds 
its going to be closer to 10 billion believe me said 
sen nicholas petris a democrat who urged a halfcent sales tax 
increase this is no time to be pandering to the pockets of the 
people 
the tax hike opposed by most republicans in the assembly 
passed the lower house saturday with two votes to spare it passed 
the senate by 342 
why would anyone want to take advantage of this disaster to 
raise taxes asked assemblyman pat nolan a conservative 
republican who tried to block the measure 
in other quake developments 
engineers plan to create earthquake conditions on a section of 
oaklands interstate 880 with hydraulic jacks and a massive 
spinning device in an experiment to help freeway designers learn to 
protect highways from quakes 
a section near the stretch of doubledecked freeway that 
collapsed in the quake will be deliberately felled in the test 
sometime before christmas said james e roberts chief of the 
structural division of the state department of transportation most 
of the quakes victims were crushed between the freeways decks 
a mild aftershock struck the san francisco bay area sunday 
morning but authorities said there were no reports of damage or 
injuries the aftershock on the san andreas fault and centered 8 
miles east of santa cruz some 60 miles south of san francisco 
registered 40 on the richter scale said pat jorgenson a 
spokeswoman for the us geological survey 
hispanic leaders and rep leon panetta dcalif complained 
that the federal emergency management agency has responded 
inadequately to the needs of spanishspeaking residents left 
homeless by the quake at the public meeting saturday in santa 
cruz fema official bob stevens responded that the agency ran out 
of spanishlanguage applications while helping puerto rico 
residents after hurricane hugo 
the national football league on sunday announced a 1 million 
donation to the earthquake relief effort on behalf of the 28 teams 
owners san francisco 49ers owner edward j debartolo jr will add 
a 250000 contribution on behalf of his family the nfl said

l douglas wilder of virginia and david dinkins of new york 
campaigned to the finish line monday in drives to shatter race 
barriers one aiming to become americas first black elected 
governor and the other the first black mayor of the nations 
largest city 
democratic rep james florio and underdog gop rep james courter 
sought lastminute support in new jerseys gubernatorial contest 
the other highprofile race in tuesdays offyear elections that 
will be closely watched for signs of changing voter sentiment on 
abortion 
ballots were also studded with hundreds of mayoral races 
contests for other city and county offices and referendums 
j marshall coleman discounting polls that showed him trailing 
wilder in virginia told a rally the undecideds are breaking our 
way were absolutely on the eve of a great victory 
but wilder the lieutenant governor and grandson of freed 
slaves countered that chances were exceedingly good he would 
win and lead a statewide democratic sweep of three top offices 
there was no letup in republican rudolph giulianis attacks on 
manhattan borough president dinkins who has admitted failing to 
file income tax returns for four years two decades ago and has 
faced questions about a stock transfer to his son 
david dinkins has a history of getting away with things that 
others dont get away with i dont know why said giuliani a 
former us attorney and underdog in the new york mayoral race 
he is less than candid he hides he evades 
dinkins replied that his republican rival entered the race like 
a knight in shining armor on a white charger i suggest that the 
armor is a bit tarnished and that charger is no longer white 
elsewhere on the ballot 11 democrats went through their final 
campaign paces in houston where they were vying to fill the 
unexpired term of the late democratic rep mickey leland 
new york aside big city election campaigns were winding up in 
detroit houston and miami where incumbents coleman young kathy 
whitmire and xavier suarez sought new terms 
clevelands unusually nasty mayoral campaign neared an end 
pitting city council president george forbes against state sen 
michael r white 
voters in 10 states will decide 56 referendums on tuesday 
among them was michigan deciding the fate of two competing 
plans to raise the state sales tax for education one called for a 
halfpenny increase and the other a twocent rise 
in others a proposal to raise 115 million for a new stadium 
for the san francisco giants faced a tough fight in light of huge 
costs from earthquake damage while residents of greensboro nc 
where cigarette manufacturing is big business were deciding 
whether to limit public smoking 
democrats were hoping for a threerace sweep in virginia new 
jersey and new york city to buoy the party in advance of 1990 
elections that will fill 34 senate seats 36 governorships and 435 
house seats 
president bush campaigned for republican candidates in all three 
races 
republicans said the results would prove of little use in 
handicapping next years campaign but all three races 
particularly virginia were being watched closely for signs of 
shifting views on abortion 
wilder has made colemans opposition to abortion a cornerstone 
of his campaign challenging a decade of political wisdom that said 
prochoice candidates should avoid the issue 
prochoice and righttolife groups also poured thousands of 
dollars into television commercials for wilder and coleman 
giuliani and courter both modified their opposition to abortion 
during the campaign the first since the supreme court ruling last 
summer permitting states to impose greater restrictions 
ironically perhaps abortion largely overshadowed race in the 
campaign in virginia once the capital of the confederacy coleman 
broached the subject indirectly late last week when he said wilder 
was benefiting from a double standard in press coverage 
florio loser in two previous gubernatorial campaigns spent the 
final hours saying he was guarding against overconfidence but also 
appealing for election of enough democrats to give his party a 
majority in the state assembly the gop holds a twoseat majority 
courter scheduled several stops during the final day of his 
campaign culminating with a favorite son rally at home in 
warren county 
wilder and coleman both spent their final day of campaigning in 
the company of popular virginians 
coleman made his rounds with sen john warner at his side and 
stressed his law enforcement experience as the states former 
attorney general and his opposition to higher taxes 
wilder was accompanied by gov gerald baliles and sen charles 
robb a former governor to accentuate his claim to being the heir 
to eight successive years of democratic government

voters monday faced the possibility of 
going to the polls for the third time this year after elections 
failed to give any party a clear governing mandate 
according to the constitution president christos sartzetakis 
must call elections within 30 days if political leaders fail to 
form a viable government that can win a parliamentary vote of 
confidence 
constantine mitsotakis conservative new democracy party won 
sundays election but fell three seats short of an absolute 
majority of the 300member unicameral parliament 
the panhellenic socialist movement or pasok led by former 
premier andreas papandreou came in second with 128 places and the 
coaliton of the left and progress led by communist leader harilaos 
florakis took 21 seats 
the remaining three seats went to independents including a 
leftist a greek moslem and an environmentalist for the first time 
in the nations political history 
in the previous parliament elected in june new democracy 
controlled 145 seats pasok 125 places and the coalition 28 with 
two seats going to independents new democracy and the coalition 
governed together for three months following those elections with 
the sole intention of investigating scandals involving the 
papandreou government 
the political impasse froze decisions on how to solve the 
countrys economic crisis and negotiations on the continued 
presence of us bases in greece 
a greekus defense accord expired last year and negotiations 
on renewing it were suspended in june if no agreement is reached 
with a new government the united states has until may 1990 to 
close the four major military installations 
new democracy party officials said mitsotakis 71 would confer 
with sartzetakis at the presidential palace on tuesday where he 
would seek a mandate to form a government if he failed to do so 
then papandreou 70 would be given his chance followed by florakis 
the chances for the conservatives to succeed appeared slim since 
pasok and the coalition said that differences with new democracy in 
ideology and foreign and domestic policy issues could not be 
bridged 
leaders of the coalition rejected papandreous bid to form a 
government after the june 18 elections ended in a hung parliament 
the athens stock exchange reacted sharply to the election 
results its general index which gives an overall picture of the 
daily value of the shares traded was down 89 percent for the day 
the sharp drop in share values reflected the anxiety felt by 
many business leaders because of greeces worsening economy which 
cannot be revived without unpopular measures 
when the socialists lost the june vote ending eight years in 
office they had built up a 58 billion public debt which included 
20 billion owed abroad 
mitsotakis campaigned on a program of less government 
interference in the economy and closer ties to the united states 
papandreou pledged to double farmers pensions and defend the 
welfare state if elected

most senior citizens would see their total 
health insurance costs rise if congress repealed medicares 
catastrophic care program because private medigap premiums 
would go up a congressman said monday 
rep fortney pete stark dcalif released a government 
survey of 20 private insurers that estimated the average medigap 
premium would rise an extra 154 percent next year if the 
catastrophic package were repealed medigap policies are the 
supplemental private insurance that people buy to fill gaps in 
their medicare coverage 
stark chairman of the house ways and means subcommittee on 
health said that for at least 20 million people the increases in 
medigap premiums would exceed the amount they would save in reduced 
medicare fees if the catastrophic package were scrapped 
the survey by the general accounting office predicted the 
average monthly medigap premium would rise from 5871 this year to 
6010 in 1990 because of rising health care costs if the 
catastrophic package were repealed the average monthly premium 
would rise to 6935 according to the survey 
these medigap increases will hit those least able to afford it 
those who are the poor and have modest income stark said 
the evidence continues to mount that repeal has a price a big 
price to those 24 million seniors who have medigap policies 
stark has been a big defender of the catastrophic program which 
offers expanded medicare coverage against the high costs of serious 
illness he acknowledged that congress is on the verge of rolling 
back all or most of the program 
the catastrophic package has drawn complaints from senior 
citizens who argue its costs exceed its benefits the program is 
financed by higher medicare premiums on all but the poorest 
beneficiaries and a surtax that affects the 40 percent of elderly 
americans who pay more than 150 a year in income tax the surtax 
has been the main focus of the opposition 
the health insurance association of america last week estimated 
medigap prices are likely to rise 7 percent to 12 percent in 1990 
due to rising health costs but it said the increases can be 
expected to total 15 percent to 20 percent under a senatepassed 
plan to cut back part of the catastrophic package or 20 percent to 
25 percent if congress repeals the whole program

the senate on monday passed a bill to 
legalize abortions in this overhwelmingly roman catholic nation 
after members of the governing party sided with the opposition to 
support the measure 
the bill approved 10273 by the senate still must be approved 
by the parliaments 212seat chamber of representatives before it 
can become law no date was set for debate to begin and it could 
be months before the bill makes it through the various committees 
to the full chamber 
under current belgian law women who have abortions and doctors 
who perform them face prison terms of up to 10 years in jail the 
law has not been strongly enforced in recent years and public 
opinion polls show most belgians favor the right to abortion 
efforts to legalize the operation began in earnest in 1973 
since then 15 abortion bills have failed to win parliamentary 
approval 
the bill approved monday would allow abortions to be performed 
during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if a pregnant women was 
judged by her doctor to be in a state of distress 
the vote capped a twoweek debate in the 183member senate and 
ignored an oct 31 ruling by the council of state a legal panel 
that acts as a constitutional court that the abortion bill 
violates the penal code 
the council of state said state of distress was a subjective 
notion without legal meaning its views are not binding but they 
rarely are ignored 
the issue has split the centerleft government of prime minister 
wilfried martens whose christian democrats oppose abortion 
socialist members of the party favor the right to abortion 
the governments theoretical majority in the senate is 133 but 
socialist senators who can muster 65 votes were joined by most 
opposition members in favor of the bill their christian democratic 
partners could only get the support of a few opposition members 
seven senators abstained 
in the chamber of representatives those in favor of the right 
to abortion control about 62 percent of the seats 
it is estimated that 15000 illegal abortions take place in 
belgium each year hospitals and clinics list the operations as 
womb surgery to enable women to get reimbursed through social 
security

come tuesday look for ralph cox on the 
second floor of the spencer county courthouse screaming out a 
window to an excitable electionday crowd 
for 25 years cox has carried on a tradition dating to the early 
years of the century by shouting election results from a courthouse 
landing precinct by precinct 
sometimes i use a bullhorn when i can borrow one from the 
elementary school said the modernday crier 
cox 69 a retired school bus driver farmer and funeral home 
worker said it was his roaring voice that got him the nopay 
job 25 years ago 
the practice apparently stems from a provision in state law that 
calls for election results to be announced distinctly and 
audibly 
during elections cox waits in the county clerks office until 
several precincts are in then grabs a handful of tally sheets and 
heads for the secondfloor of the courthouse 
there with a crowd often in the hundreds on the courthouse lawn 
and beyond he shouts the names of the leaders 
people cheer and boo depending on how things are going for 
their favorite candidates in this county about 40 miles south of 
louisville 
several hundred people are expected tuesday mainly to hear the 
results of a heated judgeexecutives race

a top aide to ethiopian leader mengistu haile 
mariam pledged monday to let his countrys 16000 jews emigrate 
freely but refused to say whether israel promised to provide 
military assistance in return 
kassa kebede also said he had no knowledge of israeli military 
advisers reportedly working at an ethiopian air force base 
kebede mengistus political aide said ethiopias renewal of 
diplomatic relations with israel announced friday had nothing 
to do with the emigration rights of ethiopian jews 
an israeli foreign ministry official speaking on condition of 
anonymity confirmed the agreement on the resumption of ties 
included no linkage to the emigration question 
kebede said his government was willing to let the jews go 
there are ethiopian jews who would want to come and join their 
families in israel they are most welcome it is a basic human 
right that has to be respected he said 
there are about 16500 ethiopian jews in israel about 8000 of 
them were brought to israel in a dramatic usassisted operation 
moses airlift from november 1984 through january 1985 to join 
earlier emigres the airlift was halted after news of it leaked out 
to the embarrassment of addis ababas marxist government 
the government of ethiopia was disappointed with the operation 
moses not because ethiopian jews came to israel but because of the 
publicity which was associated with that operation kebede said 
some 16000 jews remain in ethiopia and immigrant groups here 
say as many as 18000 people want to flee the african nation which 
has suffered from drought and civil war 
large numbers of ethiopian jews have continued to emigrate to 
israel in the past two years kebede said declining to provide a 
figure 
foreign reports said ethiopian jews are receiving exit visas at 
the swedish embassy in addis ababa 
kebede dismissed israeli hopes of a renewed airlift and said 
emigration would continue in its present form 
speaking at a news conference with israels deputy foreign 
minister benjamin netanyahu kebede said ethiopias decision to 
renew relations followed informal contacts since 1973 
ethiopia and israel exchanged consulates in 1956 raising these 
to embassy level in 1962 after the 1973 middle east war ethiopia 
and 27 other african nations broke ties with israel in response to 
a call from the organization of african unity 
israel now has relations with 11 african nations netanyahu said 
the new york times on sunday quoted foreign diplomats in addis 
ababa as saying mengistu was seeking israeli military assistance in 
his struggle against erithrean moslem and tigrean rebels after the 
soviet union his main weapons supplier so far demanded a national 
reconciliation 
it also quoted the diplomats as saying israeli military advisers 
have been present for some time now at an ethiopian air force base 
i am not a military man and i do not know of any israeli 
military advisers in ethiopia kebede said 
kebede who has studied sociology and economy at jerusalems 
hebrew university in 196065 and speaks fluent hebrew declined to 
say whether israel has promised military aid 
first come the relations then we will discuss the products of 
these relations he said we are not resuming relations because 
we want something from israel the resumption of relations means 
resumption of interdependence

the famed la scala opera company called its 
recent tour of the soviet union a bureaucratic inferno of 
bribery and corruption and urged the italian government monday to 
lodge an official protest 
alberto rispoli secretarygeneral of la scala said it was a 
miracle the company was able to stage all its performances during 
the oct 2nov 4 tour in moscow and leningrad 
la scala officials said they had to pay bribes and offer gifts 
to ensure the shows could go on 
every day we had to deliver something under the table for 
being allowed to work rispoli said 
theater superintendent carlo maria badini said he has asked the 
italian government to file a protest with the soviets 
he emphasized however that the incidents would not hamper 
relations with the soviets and that president mikhail s gorbachev 
will be welcome to visit la scala during his nov 29dec 1 trip to 
italy 
gorbachev who is scheduled to travel to milan to meet business 
leaders had expressed a desire to attend the opera the regular 
season opens dec 7 but there have been reports that gorbachev 
could attend a rehearsal of verdis vespri siciliani 
gorbachev an avid opera fan attended a performance of la scala 
company at moscows bolshoi theater last month 
sergio escobar badinis assistant said the performances went 
on only through daily payoffs and gifts to corrupt officials 
this was the only way for getting what had been provided by the 
original contract 
we were in the hands of a criminal organization escobar 
added it was a bureaucratic inferno 
trucks disappeared during unloading or loading operations 
said rispoli every day we had to deliver something under the 
table for being allowed to work we even considered the possibility 
of giving up and returning home we succeeded in going on stage 
every time it was a miracle 
the la scala officials did not go into details of the alleged 
payments 
badini said the italian company probably was the victim of an 
ongoing dispute between gosconcert the state company that controls 
and manages cultural performances in the soviet union and the 
bolshoi where la scala performed most of its works 
we were caught in the middle of a chaotic situation because 
the forces opposing changes pursued by gorbachev still are very 
powerful in the world of art as well at the highest political 
levels badini was quoted as saying by milans daily corriere 
della sera

an explosion that killed at least 19 workers 
at phillips petroleum cos petrochemical complex near houston was 
a disaster waiting to happen a union official told a house 
committee monday 
officials of the oil chemical and atomic workers international 
union blamed the oct 23 explosion in part on phillips practice of 
using subcontractor maintenance crews in the huge complex on the 
houston ship channel in pasadena 
we believe the evidence will show that this catastrophe was a 
disaster waiting to happen said union vice president robert e 
wages 
wages said that subcontract workers earn about 65 percent of 
union wages 
tom lantos dcalif chairman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on employment and housing questioned 
phillips officials repeatedly about the wisdom of using contract 
labor 
we are dealing with complexes of enormous potential danger 
and instead of trying to build a stable workforce under one 
management providing them with uniform procedures of training 
evacuation safety etc youre sort of pulling in people through 
contracting outfits at a dollar savings but potentially at a very 
high cost in human lives lantos said 
youre not dealing here with a catering operation we are 
dealing with lifethreatening materials in enormous quantities 
glenn a cox president and chief operating officer of the 
bartlesville oklabased company said the facts of the accident 
speak very clearly to the question of how phillips staffs its 
plants 
one of the key questions we have to address is how in fact 
work is assigned who does work to make certain there is not a 
compromise in safety in these facilities cox said 
in addition to 19 confirmed dead four people are missing and 
six remain hospitalized more than 100 others were injured in the

million were stolen from the riviera home of pablo picassos 
granddaughter in what police called one of the biggest art thefts 
ever

stolen sunday morning from marina picassos villa in cannes

auguste rodin and seven paintings by picasso 
maurice rheims a picasso expert who was appointed by the 
government to help divide up the multibilliondollar picasso estate 
after the painters death in 1973 knew the collection and said he 
thought the value estimate was low 
i dont know what the thieves will do with the paintings 
rheims said they all have been inventoried catalogued and 
photographed many times over no serious art dealer or collector 
would touch them 
an official at the picasso museum in paris said the collection 
was shown in 1980 in west germany and italy and described it as 
impressive 
if anyone tries to sell them theyre crazy the official 
said speaking on condition of anonymity they would all be 
known 
ms picasso who inherited the works from her grandfather 
returned to cannes on monday but declined to speak to reporters who 
had gathered at the threestory villa 
police said they believed a single thief who was familiar with 
the house entered it without using force investigators said a 
sophisticated burglar alarm did not function and none of the five 
guard dogs was disturbed 
ms picasso is the daughter of paul picasso and his first wife 
emilienne paul who was estranged from his father at the time of 
his death was picassos only child by his first wife the

a paramilitary border policeman who claimed he 
had been beaten and stabbed by palestinians confessed monday to 
slashing himself with his own knife a police spokeswoman said 
also monday soldiers shot and killed a palestinian activist as 
he tried to flee to jordan the army said 
yihye amar 18 a new recruit in the paramilitary border police 
slashed his arms in a lavatory in tel avivs central bus station 
sunday after he realized he would be late returning to his military 
base said billi dahlberg a spokeswoman for the border police 
amar a member of the druse sect was returning from leave in 
his village in northern israel dahlberg said 
she said amar covered with blood cried out for help saying he 
had been attacked by palestinians 
he told police as he was being taken to a hospital that he had 
been attacked by a bearded arab wearing a keffiyah and an 
accomplice the keffiyah is widely regarded as a symbol of the 
palestinian uprising 
he claimed he was rescued by an army officer who chased away the 
arabs before they stole his gun dahlberg said 
she said police investigators became suspicious when they were 
unable to find the officer or any other witnesses who saw the 
attackers flee from the bathroom into the crowded bus station 
when confronted by police amar confessed he had slashed himself 
and fabricated the story 
dahlberg said the border police plans to take the necessary 
steps against the policeman 
the border police are a paramilitary police force that is 
primarily responsible for patrolling the occupied territories the 
force contains a disproportionate number of recruits from the druse 
sect and other minorities 
in the continuing violence in the occupied territories soldiers 
shot and killed a palestinian as he tried to fle with another arab 
across the israeli border into jordan the army said 
an army spokesman said soldiers on patrol spotted two arabs 
moving towards the border north of the settlement of mehola 40 
miles northeast of jerusalem and opened fire fatally wounding one 
of the palestinians 
the army identified the dead arab as wail mahmad daoud haj 
hassan 20 of the west bank town of qalqilya he had been wanted 
for two years by security forces on suspicion of firebombing 
israeli cars and violently interrogating arabs he suspected of 
cooperating with israel according to the army 
at least 141 arabs accused of collaborating with israeli 
authorities have been killed by their fellow palestinians since the 
uprising began almost 23 months ago 
an army spokesman said it is possible that his accomplice 
succeeded in crossing the border 
his death raises to 611 the number of palestinians shot and 
killed by israeli troops or civilians in the uprising against 
israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip forty israelis 
also have died in the violence

a solidarity candidate was elected mayor in 
polands secondlargest city monday the first time the independent 
movement has taken control of a municipal government away from the

waldemar bohdanowicz defeated four other noncommunist 
candidates in a secret ballot by the municipal peoples council 
ending a fivemonth impasse 
with prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a solidarity journalist 
leading the first noncommunist government in the east bloc and the 
communist partys influence waning in factories provincial and 
municipal governments have remained the last bastion of communist 
control 
but that too will be challenged next year when fully democratic 
elections for local councils are planned partially free voting in 
june parliamentary elections led to defeat for communist candidates 
and overwhelming victories for those backed by solidarity 
lodz a textile manufacturing city of 850000 people about 80 
miles southwest of warsaw has been without a mayor since may 29 
when the previous communist city president was ousted in a 
noconfidence vote following complaints of poor management 
an oct 11 bid to elect a replacement failed when the 
communistdominated council refused to elect either of the two 
solidarityaligned candidates put forth by mazowiecki the prime 
minister earlier had declined to nominate either of two candidates 
proposed by the communists 
but after an oct 23 meeting among representatives of the 
communists solidarity and other political groups it was decided 
to entrust the choice to mazowiecki who approved five nominees 
none from the party 
bohdanowicz one of the two rejected oct 11 got through 
monday receiving 110 out of 168 valid votes according to the pap 
news agency 
the prime minister must approve candidates for mayors before 
they can be elected by the municipal councils 
the mazowiecki government which assumed power in august is 
preparing to reform the system allowing communities to select 
their own representatives without interference from warsaw 
bohdanowicz 48 has been a solidarity activist since the 
independent movement was founded in 1980 
he said he is proposing cooperation to everyone who desires 
the good of lodz

be contained by the local administration supported by the federal 
government the diplomat said

saying i have ordered the sri lankan army and police to move 
into the ampara district and maintain law and order and this is 
being done right now he toured the ampara district monday and

militant separatist group accepted the indianbrokered 1987 peace 
pact and controls the government in ampara

a halfmillion east germans thronged the streets 
of leipzig in a hard cold rain monday night to demand free 
elections and unlimited freedom to travel abroad 
more than 135000 people rallied in other cities including 
schwerin halle cottbus dresden and karlmarxstadt the news 
agency reported 
while east germans at home protested mass flight continued the 
official news agency adn said 23200 citizens had gone to west 
germany since the suspension of exit rules saturday 
lutheran church sources said some marchers in leipzig shouted 
the wall must go demanding demolition of the berlin wall 
symbol of east german repression for three decades 
adn said banners demanding free elections and travel law 
without restrictions waved above the crowd and others challenged 
communist party supremacy 
it said several hundred thousand people took part in the 
biggest rally so far in leipzig where some of the largest protests 
of the prodemocracy campaign have been held 
michael turek a lutheran pastor in the southern industrial city 
of 650000 said by telephone about 500000 people marched a rally 
saturday in east berlin where the crowd was estimated at 1 
million was the largest protest in the communist nations 40year 
history 
members of new forum the largest proreform group addressed 
the crowd in leipzig adn said 
protests have become monday night events in leipzig crowds at 
the last two were estimated at 300000 
dresdens march was authorized by authorities and led by mayor 
wolfgang berghofer and the reformminded local party chief hans 
modrow adn said it was the first officially approved demonstration 
in the city 
earlier monday the government published a new draft law that is 
expected to take effect before christmas and will permit travel 
abroad for up to 30 days a year 
flight through czechoslovakia continued and people who stayed 
behind said they were unimpressed by reforms introduced by egon 
krenz the president and communist party chief who last month 
replaced his hardline mentor erich honecker 
church sources said some marchers in leipzig shouted egon 
who elected you 
this year about 175000 east germans more than 1 percent of 
the population have moved to west germany by emigrating legally 
escaping or failing to return from approved trips abroad west 
germany gives them automatic citizenship and help in starting over 
although the new law would allow travel abroad east germans 
pointed out it retains old provisions giving authorities the right 
to refuse passports for vague reasons 
it also does not address the problem of financing such travel 
the east german mark is not convertible and lack of foreign 
currency could make a legal trip impossible 
who is going to pay for all this who has that much money 
said a cook in a restaurant on the unter den linden boulevard of 
east berlin 
east germans poured into czechoslovakia after their government 
lifted a monthold ban on travel to the neighboring warsaw pact 
ally still the only nation east germans can visit without official 
permission 
by the time the ban was removed 5000 east germans had gathered 
at the west german embassy in prague special trains took the east 
germans from the embassy to the west german border and thousands of 
others drove through czechoslovakia in personal cars 
a line of cars 400 yards long waited at the schirnding crossing 
into northeastern bavaria to leave czechoslovakia refugees were 
required only to show their east german identity cards 
the unexpected decision to let the refugees out through 
czechoslovakia created the first direct route to the west since the 
berlin wall was built in august 1961 authorities have said the 
route will remain open until the travel law takes effect 
many east germans including opposition leaders reacted coolly 
to the draft law 
sebastian pflugbeil a founder of new forum said travel is 
not the primary problem in east germany too many have left the 
country already 
he said on the west berlin radio station rias the leadership 
must make other steps to prove it is earnest in its reform efforts 
and to win the trust of the people the tension between the people 
and the party has never been so great as today 
interior minister friedrich dickel said sunday the law would be 
discussed publicly until nov 30 then go to parliament 
freedom of travel has been a major demand at prodemocracy 
rallies krenz who became communist party leader oct 18 has 
promised sweeping political and economic reforms in addition to 
freer travel 
passport applications would be handled in 30 days under the new 
law with urgent cases settled in three days or less 
fleeing the republic no longer would be criminal dickel 
indicated only those caught trying to cross the berlin wall or 
fortified borders with west germany would be punished 
no mention is made in the law of how much hard currency an east 
german could take abroad the limit is 15 marks 8 at the official 
rate and officials have said shortages could be an obstacle

legislation awaiting final congressional 
approval will complete a near doubling in the number of federal 
prosecutors since last year to help fight such major crimes as drug 
trafficking and fraud 
appropriation legislation for the 1990 fiscal year will add 918 
new federal prosecutors to the justice department payroll 
barring unexpected developments the appropriation bills are 
expected to be approved by congress and sent to president bush for 
his signature both bill have cleared conference committee and are 
awaiting final approval 
last year congress appropriated money to hire 440 new federal 
prosecutors as part of sweeping antidrug legislation 
the twoyear expansion increases the number of federal 
prosecutors from 1400 to 2758 
justice department spokesman david runkel cautioned that the 
increase may be pared by the automatic sequestration cuts under the 
grammrudman budget balancing law 
that could result in a 7 percent cut in the number of new 
assistant us attorney positions actually financed by congress 
said a justice department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
of the new positions 118 will be assigned to help reduce the 
backlog of savings and loan fraud cases piling up in the wake of 
the scandals in the nations thrift institutions 
the extra positions were requested earlier this year by bush as 
part of the sampl bailout legislation congress also appropriated 25 
million to hire an additional 100 fbi agents to investigate the 
cases 
runkel said the justice department is considering a proposal to 
open up more sampl task forces modeled after the one in dallas that 
has obtained 55 criminal indictments and netted 40 convictions 
no final decisions have been made but additional prosecutors 
will be assigned to states where there are a large number of fraud 
cases runkel identified the states as arizona california 
colorado florida illinois and minnesota

phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr won 
a twoweek delay monday on having to testify before the house 
banking committee about the collapse of his lincoln savings and 
loan association of irvine calif 
at keatings request the panel agreed to delay until nov 21 
his appearance to answer questions about why regulators allowed 
lincoln to keep operating losing billions of dollars in federally 
insured deposits in the process for two years after federal 
examiners recommended closing it 
keating originally was scheduled to testify tuesday before the 
panel along with edwin gray who until june 1987 was chairman of 
the federal home loan bank board in charge of regulating thrifts 
gray who is still scheduled to testify tuesday has said in the 
past that top regulators were reluctant to move against lincoln 
because of keatings political influence with several key senators 
and house members 
although the banking committee authorized a subpoena of keating 
on oct 12 it was not formally served until monday said leonard 
bickwit an attorney representing one of keatings companies 
there was never any attempt to avoid service bickwit said 
and mr keating was available for service for a number of days 
after the subpoenaes were authorized 
bickwit however said keating had only recently hired an 
attorney to represent him personally and that the new attorney 
wanted two more weeks to become more familiar with the issues 
bank board officials in california formally recommended on may 
1 1987 that the government seize lincoln because of its mounting 
losses some of those same officials had been summoned to 
washington twice in the previous month to meet with five senators 
whom keating and his associates had given a total of more than 13 
million in campaign contributions 
lincoln a 29branch sampl subsidiary of american continental 
corp that is chaired by keating was seized by the bank board last 
april nearly two years after federal examiners first recommended 
taking it over 
officials expect lincolns collapse eventually will cost 
taxpayers up to 2 billion that would make it the single most 
expensive failure of more than 300 sampls taken over by the 
government in the past two years 
in three previous hearings the banking committee has attempted 
to focus blame for the magnitude of lincolns losses on m danny 
wall formerly the bank boards chairman and now director of is 
successor agency the office of thrift supervison in the treasury 
department

former president jimmy carter challenged 
president bush on monday to respond decisively to the rise of 
democratic movements in eastern europe we have got to get our 
act together carter said 
carter told an audience here that there is substantial proof 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev is producing irreversible change 
in the soviet union and eastern europe and said the response of the 
bush administration doesnt match what gorbachev is doing 
in a strongly worded criticism of a kind he has rarely made 
since leaving office in 1981 carter said that only the united 
states can provide a response worthy of the changes gorbachev has 
wrought 
the spokesman for the western world has got to be the 
president of the united states carter said i think we need to 
be able to respond to gorbachev because he is winning a tremendous 
propaganda victory in all of the many countries i have visited 
we have got to get our act together 
carter who is in washington for a reunion of the people who 
staffed his presidential campaigns and administration was joined 
at a seminar by former vice president walter f mondale who said 
the slowness of the bush administration to respond to events is 
being felt among those in eastern europe struggling for democracy 
now is the time to strike mondale said i think the 
circumstances are such that we need a much more rapid us policy 
responsse 
the people of poland speak to us of the joy of democracy and 
freedom we come back with the language of bookkeeppers and 
bureaucrats 
carter and mondale commented as they took part in a seminar 
dedicated to the ways and means of waging peace 
the former president also challenged bush to more closely engage 
the united states in the pursuit of peace in the middle east 
saying the president must make it clear he intends to pursue a 
peace agreement with all of its will and vigor and will not 
withdraw until it is achieved 
using the resources of the carter presidential center in 
atlanta carter has been engaged in monitoring the electoral 
process in nicaragua he said his purpose is to make it extremely 
difficult impossible for either party to withdraw from the 
election when one side or the other discoveres it is likely to 
lose 
carter also he said he believes recent attacks by contra rebels 
across the honduran border into nicaragua have been aimed at 
disrupting the process of registering voters 
carter said he believes daniel ortega nicaraguas marxist 
president made a tragic and deplorable mistake last week when 
he announced he was cancelling an 18month ceasefire with the 
rebels 
but he said he does not believe ortegas action is going to 
interfere with the holding of an election 
although he criticized bushs policies carter had earlier 
voiced nothing but praise for the cooperation given the carter 
center since the bush administration took office 
the former president speaking at georgetown university said 
the centers activities had little support from the white house 
while ronald reagan was president 
since george bush has been in office we have had an almost 
perfect relationship he said 
at that event attended by friends and political associates as 
well as georgetown students carter appeared loose relaxed and by 
turns serious and funny as he described his work at the carter 
center to promote global health housing human rights and peace 
carter said that under his direction the carter center has 
dedicated itself to filling vacuums untouched by other 
international efforts 
his wife rosalynn said that the center in atlanta now has a 
budget of 17 million a year and that an endowment of 50 million 
is sought for a permanent fund to pay for maintenance upkeep and 
repairs 
on sunday some 2000 people who worked in carters presidential 
campaigns staffed the white house and worked for his 
administration gathered in a hotel ballroom to cheer him once again 
on monday at georgetown carter and his wife gave a smaller 
audience a reunion report on what they have been doing lately 
they have been doing a lot at the carter center they said from 
fighting a vicious african parasite called the guinea worm to 
organizing a drive to inoculate the worlds children against polio 
to finding textbooks for the warravaged schools of uganda to 
organizing peace talks in ethiopias 28year civil war 
mrs carter said she and her husband discovered after they left 
the white house in defeat that they had not walked away empty 
handed 
what weve learned is that we still have resources she 
said because jimmy was president we can call on anybody in the 
world and ask for their influence and they help

the security council debated on monday 
whether to send a factfinding mission to observe israels 
crackdown on the palestinian uprising 
a resolution before the council also demands that israel return 
confiscated property or compensate beit sahour a palestinian 
village of about 10000 in the occupied west bank that refused to 
pay taxes to israeli authorities 
the town just southeast of bethlehem is predominantly 
christian 
israel began tax raids on beit sahour on sept 20 troops 
confiscated at least 15 million worth of machinery cars 
refrigerators household goods and personal effects to be sold at 
auction 
kuwaiti ambassador mohammed abdulhasan said in introducing the 
resolution the people in beit sahour raise the same banner 
raised by the young revolutionaries in boston during the fight 
for independence no taxation without representation 
a vote was expected later this week 
israeli ambassador johanan bein dwelt on palestinian violence in 
his address describing in detail the ax murders or stabbings of 
five palestinians in october the victims were mutilated some in 
front of family members or while praying in a mosque 
these are only five gruesome examples of the violent murders 
perpetrated by plo hit squads five out of 23 similar murders 
committed in october in one month only for failing to toe the 
line said bein 
indeed the rate of plo attacks against palestinians increased 
sharply following the promulgation of israels peace initiative in 
april 1989 he said reporting that it increased sevenfold 
stung by international criticism israel last week lifted its 
roadblocks around beit sahour 
taxation without liberation is tyranny declared zudhi labib 
terzi the palestine liberation organizations permanent observer 
terzi asked secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to 
dispatch un observers to the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
home to about 17 million palestinians

reports of fraudulent soviet exit permits have 
prompted the state department to restrict access to a european 
route used by tens of thousands of soviet jews to come to the 
united states officials said monday 
a pattern of fraud emerged last month apparently involving some 
individuals in the soviet agency that issues the permits officials 
said adding that the going rate was 5000 rubles or about 3200 
apiece 
officials didnt say how many exit permits were illegal but 
that a pattern had been established that would increase unless the 
united states acted 
permits had to be dated before oct 1 for soviet jews to obtain 
us visas in rome or vienna and the applicants had to also have 
israeli visas otherwise prospective emigrants are processed 
through the us embassy in moscow 
soviet jews who reach vienna or rome are considered to be in 
the pipeline and are virtually certain to be accepted unless 
there are security or other problems those who apply at the us 
embassy however are up against us quotas 
the new restriction announced by spokesman richard boucher 
required emigrants to obtain their israeli visas by monday a 
notice of the change was posted wednesday at the us embassy and 
at the dutch embassy where israeli visas are obtained 
as a result of the change soviet jews may remain at home rather 
than waiting in rome or vienna until their entry to the united 
states is approved however getting to america could be more 
difficult 
jews who leave the soviet union after monday on israeli visas 
will be presumed to have chosen to emigrate to israel us 
officials said 
israeli visas long have been the best device for jews to leave 
the soviet union whether they intended to go the israel the united 
states or elsewhere however under president mikhail gorbachevs 
reforms applying directly for admission to the united states may 
offer an equal opportunity to leave

the wallenberg brothers who headed 
swedens largest commercial bank during world war ii helped nazi 
germany dispose of gold and jewels stripped from murdered jews 
according to a book published monday 
dutch authors gerard aalders and cees wiebes in their book 
the art of cloaking said the wallenberg brothers also acted as 
front men to disguise foreign subsidiaries of german companies 
associated with adolf hitlers regime 
editorials in swedish newspapers marking the 40th anniversary of 
the wars outbreak have renewed the debate over the role neutral 
sweden played in the war 
marcus and jacob wallenberg as heads of stockholms enskilda 
bank were one of swedens richest and most influential dynasties 
the bank founded by the family in 1856 played a central role in 
swedens industrialization and development before and after world 
war ii 
aalders and wiebes claim the enskilda was among swedish and 
swiss banks that bought gold stocks jewelry and art collections 
stolen from jews and other victims imprisoned and killed in nazi 
concentration camps 
their book says marcus wallenberg told a british diplomat in 
1946 that his bank bought confiscated property from the nazis and 
the diplomat reported that information in a confidential cable to 
washington some of the stolen items were found after the war in 
spain austria switzerland latin america and other countries 
the authors said they traced accounts that the wallenbergs 
helped establish covers for subsidiaries of bosch ig farben krupp 
and other german corporations to avoid having their assets 
confiscated by allied governments 
they wrote that under a secret agreement the german corporations 
would have the right to repurchase the companies once the war was 
over 
the authors said one such company was the american bosch corp 
which they said conducted research for the us defense deparatment 
and sent information back to berlin 
swedish neutrality made all this possible aalders wrote 
peder bonde a nephew of the brothers told swedish radio the 
family had no reason to be ashamed of the wallenbergs wartime 
business dealings 
they did business with businessmen who wanted to protect their 
own property they were not nazis said bonde 
he said he found it hard to believe that their transactions 
could have taken place without the governments knowledge 
aalders said the practices used to help german firms during 
world war ii are being employed today to circumvent embargos 
against south africa 
the authors speculated that the links the wallenberg brothers 
had with the nazis might help explain why their relative swedish 
diplomat raoul wallenberg was seized by soviet forces when they 
captured budapest hungary in 1945 
raoul wallenberg whose father was the bankers cousin was 
credited with providing documents that saved tens of thousands of 
hungarian jews from being sent to nazi death camps he was taken to 
the soviet union and the soviets have said he died in prison in 
1947 former prison inmates have said they saw raoul wallenberg 
after 1947 
per anger who served with raoul wallenberg at the budapest 
legation called the authors theory fantastic speculation 
raoul didnt belong to the inner circle of the bank anger 
said in a newspaper interview

the pentagon is planning to buy more 
offtheshelf commercial products at a potential savings in the 
save hundreds of millions of dollars sen carl levin dmich 
said monday 
the plan offers the hope the defense department will wean itself 
from excessive use of custommade merchandise levin said as he 
released a senate subcommittee report on the subject 
we expect there will be a significant reduction in taxpayer 
money that is spent on these products that should be bought 
commercially but are being designed from scratch levin told a 
news conference 
the pengaton has a shopping list of about 50000 items it 
regularly purchases only 3 percent of which are commercially 
available he said 
that is a terrible track record levin said vowing to push 
the armed services to double or triple the percentage annually 
until roughly half of its purchases are offtheshelf 
pentagon spokesman glenn flood said he had not seen the report 
and could not comment on it the 31point plan is still being put 
together he said 
weve been looking at this area for a long time now flood 
said its a slow process it cant be done overnight 
the pentagon has increased the number of specialists looking for 
ways to boost use of commercial products from two to six in the 
wake of hearings by the subcommittee on oversight of government 
management levin said 
levin chairman of the panel said the hearings produced 
embarrassing evidence of overreliance on products developed 
specifically for military use including foods such as 
chocolatechip cookies and applesauce 
additionally he said the hearings showed that military 
specifications for products it buys are so complex that many 
contractors are discouraged from submitting bids that reduces 
competition and inflates costs he said 
pentagon tests are much too rigid they are arcane ancient 
he said pounding his fist on a foothigh stack of papers on his 
desk the stack of documents were those through which a contractor 
must wade to submit a bid for selling the pentagon an oscilloscope 
a device that measures variations in electrical currents 
the 1990 defense spending bill approved by a housesenate 
conference committee last week directs the pentagon to increase 
offtheshelf purchases

the senate opened debate monday on the 
compromise plan to raise the hourly minimum wage to 425 with a 
leading republican conceding the measure would pass easily but 
warning it would cost jobs and fuel inflation 
every good and material that is sold in america is going to go 
up in cost said sen orrin hatch rutah i think that means 
were going to have some very difficult economic times in the 
future i hope im wrong 
sen edward m kennedy dmass criticized hatchs arguments 
and called the planned increase from 335 to 425 by april 1991 
a very small adjustment that will leave minimumwage earners 
well behind inflation since the last increase in 1981 
we have really i think failed in our compact with those 
americans who are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder 
kennedy said 
never in the half century of the minimum wage has this long a 
period elapsed without an increase and may we do everything in our 
power to make sure that the working poor never have to wait that 
long again 
the housepassed proposal which also would create a subminimum 
training wage for teenagers is the product of a deal struck a 
week ago between president bush and congress majority democrats 
kennedy and hatch were the only senators to speak on the issue 
monday and whether a final vote will come tuesday appeared to 
hinge on whether republicans and democrats reached agreement on a 
plan to raise the governments debt ceiling 
several republicans are mulling amendments that could delay a 
final vote on the minimumwage bill indefinitely but an agreement 
on the debt limit likely would lead to an agreement on a timetable 
for debate on the wage bill as well

the soviet coal minister met monday with striking 
miners in the arctic but failed to persuade them to end their 
walkout which officials say threatens winter fuel supplies 
mikhail i shchadov met for three hours with strikers from 11 
mines in the pechora basin but did not adequately assure them 
their working social and living conditions would improve said 
alexander petrovsky who attended the session 
miners were promised improved living and working conditions in 
july after a nationwide strike 
workers in the largest mine of the pechora basin went on strike 
oct 25 to protest government delays in fulfilling the promises 
they were joined last week by miners at 10 other shafts and 
only two mines in the region continued working with more than 
15000 miners on strike the official news agency tass reported 
monday that four mines were operating 
shchadov told miners part of the july decree pledging 
improvements was being implemented on schedule and that the rest 
was awaiting action by the soviet legislature according to 
petrovsky who spoke by telephone and described himself as a worker 
from vorkuta 
petrovsky and strike committee member nikolai a teryokhin who 
was interviewed in moscow said miners were not satisfied with 
shchadovs report and would continue the walkout 
on sunday premier nikolai i ryzhkov said the situation in the 
coal industry creates an inadmissible situation in ensuring vital 
supplies for our people for the work of basic and other sectors of 
the national economy 
ryzhkov in remarks distributed by tass asked the strikers to 
show reason and a sense of civic duty 
but the miners remain unsatisfied 
we share the concern of the chairman of the ussr council 
of ministers ni ryzhkov over the current situation in the coal 
industry strike committee leader v kopasov told tass but the 
miners dont believe that their demands will be met they need 
clear guarantees 
kopasov said shchadov did not have the authority to make such 
guarantees and that the miners want to speak only to a government 
commission 
the vorkuta miners meanwhile appealed to the aflcio trade 
union group in the united states to send a delegation to meet with 
them and offer material and technical support according to a 
statement released by teryokhin a similar appeal was made to 
british miners 
the strike violates a law passed by the soviet legislature last 
month banning walkouts in such vital sectors as energy and defense 
a local court has ruled the strike illegal but has not moved to 
halt it 
government officials are scheduled to meet with miners nov 17 
to review how well the government has kept its promises

an ohio congressman on monday made public part 
of what he said was an insurance investigators report alleging 
west german intelligence tipped the cia to a possible bomb aboard 
pan am flight 103 
the plane blew up last december over lockerbie scotland 
killing 259 people us officials have denied having any such 
advance information 
rep james traficant was accompanied at a news conference by 
former cia officer victor marchetti from whom he said he got the 
report marchetti left the agency in 1969 and later wrote a 
critical book the cia and the cult of intelligence 
the excerpts released by traficant describe a west german 
intelligence agent watching baggage handlers an hour before the 
flight left frankfurt singling out one suspicious suitcase and 
deciding something was very wrong 
west german intelligence passed on the concern to a cia unit in 
frankfurt which relayed it to an unidentified control says 
the excerpt from the insurance investigators report control 
replied dont worry about it dont stop it let it go the 
excerpt says 
cia spokesman mark mansfield who last week called the report 
nonsense said monday its still nonsense 
pan am which has been sued for more than 300 million said in 
court documents filed last week that it is trying to show the 
united states got warnings from west german and israeli 
intelligence 
administration officials on monday denied that they were tipped 
off by any foreign intelligence agency about the bombing of the pan 
am flight 
rosemary wolfe of alexandria va whose stepdaughter miriam was 
among the victims on flight 103 said she didnt know whether to 
believe the allegations but i think were getting closer to the 
answers 
at his news conference traficant handed out five of 27 pages of 
a report which he said shows connections between the bombing and a 
transatlantic heroin shipment hostage rescue efforts terrorists 
and spies 
the other 22 pages were withheld pending a meeting with pan ams 
lawyers traficant said 
the ohio democrat first made his allegations friday saying then 
that the report concluded the cia was covering up a drug run 
protecting the terrorists frankfurttonew york heroin route in 
exchange for contacts that might lead to the release of american 
hostages

the catholic church is mounting an offensive 
against legalized abortion in the wake of a supreme court ruling 
allowing states more freedom in setting limits on the practice 
dont forget the baby thats all the catholic church is 
saying to america archbishop john may president of the national 
conference of catholic bishops said monday in a speech opening the 
conferences fall meeting 
leaders of the 53 millionmember church are scheduled to vote 
tuesday on a policy statement on abortion calling on catholics to 
give urgent attention and priority to this issue to counteract 
efforts by abortion rights advocates galvanized by the court ruling 
in the missouri case 
abortion rights advocates said the bishops new activism was 
expected in light of the court ruling and the recent 
backstepping by some politicians challenged by prochoice 
groups 
i think this meeting marks their reemergence as a political 
force on this issue said frances kissling president of 
catholics for a free choice theyre ready to go 
at the opening session of the fourday meeting representatives 
of the us church and the vatican celebrated the bicentennial of 
the us hierarchy by noting how the church was shaped by the 
american principles of religious liberty and democracy the rev 
john carroll was appointed the first us bishop on nov 6 1789 
cardinal agostino casaroli who is vatican secretary of state 
and papal legate to the bicentennial warned the bishops not to be 
discouraged from entering into public policy debates 
the religious freedom so forcibly affirmed by your founding 
fathers was not intended to exclude religion from society from 
public life and public morality that would truly be freedom in 
reverse casaroli said 
in his speech may said americans need to hear the churchs 
voice on issues ranging from the middle east to poverty but 
abortion is the issue where clearcut moral principle stands tall 
above all else 
in a letter to the bishops pope john paul ii said catholics 
have played a significant role in upholding the moral principles 
of justice freedom and respect for human dignity 
the pope however never directly addressed the abortion issue 
but instead asked the bishops to uphold the dignity and rights of 
the human person from conception to natural death 
comparing abortion to dropping a child in the baltimore harbor 
may said there is no difference between a child a few months after 
birth and a child in the womb 
the church therefore has no option it must speak out to 
protect that child said may adding that the catholic church 
promises to care for any pregnant woman 
kissling said mays remarks a are really simply cruel and 
unusual punishment to the catholic and noncatholic women who 
decide to have abortions 
the resolution on abortion from the bishops committee for 
prolife activities said the supreme court decision in webster v 
reproductive health services was encouraging the decision upheld 
missouris law banning abortions in public hospitals and stopped 
public employees from counseling women about abortions the law 
also required doctors performing abortions to first test any fetus 
over 20 weeks old to determine if it could live outside the womb 
but the supreme courts ruling also has caused abortion rights 
advocates to threaten retaliation against politicians who do not 
support permisive abortion 
in calling upon catholics to redouble their efforts the 
committee said at this particular time abortion has become the 
fundamental human rights issue for all men and women of good will 
in other business monday the bishops decided to develop a 
pastoral letter on stewardship in order to find ways to reach 
deeper into the pockets of catholics in the pews to meet the 
churchs financial needs 
bishop warren l boudreaux of the diocese of houmathibodaux in 
lousiana said red is fine liturgical color but is not good news at 
the end of a financial statement 
we are called to bring the good news lets do it he told 
the bishops 
the conference president was asked to appoint a committee to 
develop the pastoral letter by the june 1991 meeting of the 
bishops conference 
in addition to the abortion issue the bishops on tuesday are 
scheduled to elect a new conference president and vote on a 
proposal prompted by the severe clergy shortage from the 
bishops committee on the liturgy on an order for sunday 
celebrations in the absence of a priest 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati conference vice 
president is expected to be elevated to the presidency while nine 
other archbishops vie for the vice presidency

leaders of nicaraguan rebels have agreed 
to meet sandinista government representatives this week for the 
first direct peace talks in more than a year un officials said 
monday 
when president daniel ortega canceled a 19monthold truce last 
week he also proposed a meeting at un headquarters nadia 
younes a un spokeswoman said the two sides had agreed to meet 
thursday and friday 
nicaraguas un mission said victor hugo tinoco deputy foreign 
minister probably would lead the government delegation 
a senior un official said privately all issues will be on the 
table including the voluntary disbanding of the rebels known as 
contras security guarantees for those repatriated from rebel bases 
in neighboring honduras and political reform in nicaragua 
in honduras contra military leader enrique bermudez told the 
associated press we have accepted the new proposal for dialogue 
from ortega and said he would lead a fiveman rebel delegation 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo roman catholic primate of 
nicaragua has agreed to attend as an observer he has been a 
gobetween for the sandinistas and contras in the past 
also present will be the international commission for 
verification and support consisting of one official each from the 
united nations and organization of american states the commission 
was established under the central american peace plan of aug 7 to 
help the contras disarm and resettle in nicaragua with their 
families 
the contras are expected to insist on resuming the ceasefire 
they also want a general amnesty and guarantees that they can visit 
nicaragua to verify that reforms have been made and it is safe for 
them to return 
the peace plan says the contras must be disbanded by dec 5 but 
also that their repatriation be voluntary 
so far the rebels have shown no inclination to lay down their 
weapons and return home although some have gone back to nicaragua 
with their weapons 
ortega said the infiltrating contras had killed dozens of people 
and were trying to disrupt the campaign for national elections to 
be held feb 25 
according to the state department about 2000 contras have 
returned to nicaragua from honduras making a total of 4000 in 
nicaragua and about 10000 remaining in honduras 
carlos lopez contreras the honduran foreign minister said 
friday the rebels are a nicaraguan problem and his government 
will not participate in the meetings at un headquarters 
the last direct talks between the contras and sandinistas in 
june 1988 failed when the government rejected contra demands for 
reform that included an end to sandinista control of the army and 
police 
in managua on monday the defense ministry presented two men 
identified as contra commanders and 13 other rebels to journalists 
and said they had accepted amnesty 
orlando barrera and carlos martinez the commanders said they 
were ordered to tell people to vote for the united nicaraguan 
opposition the main opposition to the sandinistas in the february 
elections 
we told people that if they didnt vote for uno they would 
have problems and that meant we were going to kidnap them 
afterward barrera said the opposition party denies links to the 
contras 
santos guzman a 15yearold rebel said we put down our 
weapons because we had no ammunition no food we just walked and 
when we encountered the army we ran

students at macmurray college marched 
across campus monday to show unity against racism after a campaign 
of anonymous threats and racial slurs against blacks hit the small 
private school 
we must come together sophomore ricky bragg told about 350 
students faculty and residents who marched to the college chapel 
there is no way this can be a white problem or a black problem 
or a jewish problem this is macmurrays problem said bragg who 
is black 
the studentorganized march came four days after handwritten 
letters containing racial slurs and threats were found in campus 
mailboxes of the 35 to 40 black students at the 620student 
liberalarts school and in the box of the colleges only black 
staff member 
the letters were addressed to students by name and campus 
mailbox number and contained slurs directed at the person 
according to students who saw the letters 
investigators were trying to develop leads from fingerprints on 
the letters but hadnt identified any suspects said tom weeks 
police chief in jacksonville in westcentral illinois 30 miles 
west of springfield 
right now it looks like its at a dead end he said 
since the letters were discovered the schools administration 
has sponsored a series of meetings to talk about racial tensions on 
campus 
this is a marvelous educational opportunity for our 
students said college president edward mitchell theyre 
dealing with a reallife problem in that way it differs from all 
the other problems we have in college where you have a right

problem that somethings broken and it needs to be fixed 
before the rally cathleen hopkins a senior who is black said 
the administration had put too much stress on blacks and whites 
talking to each other in the wake of the incident 
its past the communication stage she said what are you 
going to do is what we want to know 
but mitchell said way to deal with racial problems will evolve 
from the meetings one of the things i tried not to do was to 
define the problem and the solution because then it would be my 
problem and my solution he said

the 50 billion that congress appropriated 
this summer to rescue the savings and loan industry will be 
depleted in the next 14 months officials in charge of the bailout 
said monday 
daniel p kearney president of the federal resolution trust 
corp oversight board told a house task force on the bailout that 
the 50 billion will be exhausted by the end of december 1990 
officials had warned earlier the government might have to borrow 
another 50 billion to 100 billion of shortterm working 
capital beyond the 50 billion approved by congress in august to 
cover the deposit losses of failed thrift institutions as they are 
closed or sold to new investors 
but kearneys assessment on how fast money is being spent on 
some 290 failed thrifts passing through the governments hands 
shocked lawmakers who were repeatedly told by the bush 
administration that 50 billion was all that would be needed 
its mindboggling to think that were going to have another 
blank check here said rep tom mcmillan dmd 
kearney said the oversight board composed of treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan and housing and urban development secretary jack kemp 
should have a plan ready within the next two weeks on how to raise 
the additional cash 
administration officials maintain that the 50 billion 
authorized through the bailout legislation may cover the net loss 
to taxpayers once all the loans properties and other assets of the 
seized thrifts are sold but they acknowledge that could be several 
years away 
meanwhile kearney and other officials said the administration 
wants to shore up the working capital needed to cover despositors 
insured losses through shortterm borrowings as the assets are 
sold the working capital that was borrowed would be repaid 
but to prevent the shortterm borrowings from ballooning annual 
federal deficits the administration has proposed setting up an 
offbudget resolution funding bank to issue the new debt 
democrats insist that any additional borrowing above the initial 
50 billion come directly through the treasury a move that would 
swell the fiscal 1991 and 1992 deficits and force either spending 
cuts elsewhere or a tax increase 
assistant comptroller general richard l fogel said both 
congress and the administration need to engage in a much more 
honest dialogue this time about what its going to take 
as a watchdog in congress general accounting office fogel said 
the administration should come back to congress even though it 
might not be what you want to here and say they need more money 
thats not likely said bert ely a private sampl analyst in 
alexandria va who has persistently criticized congress and the 
reagan and bush administrations handling of the thrift crisis 
ely said no one in congress or the administration wants to have 
to write another sampl bailout law that includes billions of dollars 
in more government spending before the 1992 election 
the administration is effectively telling congress dont 
push us too hard on this working capital thing or we will be back 
up here he said

a presidential candidate on monday 
accused president jose sarney of trying to manipulate next weeks 
election the first free presidential balloting since 1960 
frontrunner fernando collor de mello claimed sarney has a 
sinister plan to manipulate the nov 15 election by backing the 
lastminute candidacy of silvio santos head of brazils 
secondlargest television network 
im talking to you jose sarney im talking to an 
irresponsible dishonest and weak man collor de mello said in 
his spot on a 70minute television campaign program which all five 
networks are required to run twice a day 
collor de mello leader of the centerright national 
reconstruction party called sarney incapable incompetent and 
corrupt 
sarney declared he would respond to collor de mellos 
accusations with an address on national television 
santos candidacy also was denounced by other leaders among the 
22 presidential candidates 
in a televised debate sunday night leonel brizola of the 
centerleft democratic labor party called santos a testtube 
candidate of the sarney administration 
luis inacio lula da silva of the leftist workers party compared 
the santos candidacy to a coup detat against the electoral 
process 
both sarney and santos conservative candidate of the new 
brazilian municipalist party deny allegations that they are 
engaged in a joint political effort 
sarney who by law cannot run for reelection opposes collor de 
mello and polls have shown that santos late entry in the race 
caused a sharp reduction in collor de mellos lead 
santos presented his candidacy officially to the superior 
electoral court on saturday and it is being challenged 
a law decreed in 1970 when brazil was under a military 
dictatorship that directors of governmentlicensed businesses 
such as television stations and networks must resign from such 
positions at least three months before elections if they are 
candidates 
santos lawyers say although he is the main stockholder in the 
sbt network he is not an active director and the law should not 
apply to him 
jose francsco rezek president of the sevenmember electoral 
court said the tribunal would rule on the legality of santos 
candidacy by friday 
rezek noted the 1970 law was adopted during military rule and 
said the main issue for the electoral court will be to determine 
which points of that law have survived under brazils new 
constitution written in 1988 
santos is not among the 22 candidates listed on the ballots 
which have gone out to brazils 250000 polling stations to vote 
for santos brazilians will have to draw an x through the box 
next to the name of armando correa the municipalist party 
candidate who withdrew to be replaced by santos 
if no candidate gets a majority a runoff will be held between 
the two top votegetters

to guarantee the physical security of trade unionists following 
persistent reports of violent attacks on trade union premises and

that would make him the nations first elected black governor 
rallied supporters monday with a warning against overconfidence 
because of his lead in polls 
wilders opponent former attorney general j marshall coleman 
dismissed the polls putting him behind saying his organization 
showed enough support to win on tuesday and that undecided voters 
were moving his way 
as the candidates made flying tours to hit virginias major tv 
markets on the eve of the election campaign workers staffed 
telephone banks to urge supporters to vote weather could be a 
factor with forecasters predicting clouds and possibly rain but 
temperatures in the 60s

stump with gov gerald l baliles and former gov charles s robb 
now a us senator also along were his two running mates 
businessman donald s beyer jr for lieutenant governor and 
incumbent attorney general mary sue terry 
baliles cannot seek a second consecutive term under the state 
constitution 
at a morning stop in roanoke wilder said he felt exceedingly 
good about the chances for a democratic sweep of the states top 
three offices 
but he also played down a richmond timesdispatch poll sunday 
showing him 9 percent ahead of coleman his republican opponent 
with 19 percent undecided 
the only polls that count are the polls taken tomorrow when 
all the polls are closed wilder said 
turnout is very important he said every democratic 
election here has to depend on turnout and hopefully it will be 
there tomorrow 
he urged his followers not only to cast their ballots but to ask 
others to vote and drive people to the polls 
lets be certain that we get out and as chuck would say haul 
and call wilder told the enthusiastic crowd

only in perception he said

told about two dozen supporters at a richmond airport rally that he 
has the most effective grassroots organization in state history and 
that his workers were out to energize the precinct organization 
he said his campaign has identified 650000 republican or 
republicanleaning voters and those people will be called and 
urged to vote 
were absolutely on the eve of a great victory said 
coleman who also was joined in richmond by the gop candidate for 
attorney general state sen joseph b benedetti the gop candidate

the candidates vying to succeed edward i koch 
as mayor made a final pitch monday with rudolph giuliani calling 
the election a referendum on integrity because of questions 
about frontrunner david dinkins finances 
tuesdays election will give the city either its first 
republican mayor since john lindsay in 1965 giuliani or its first 
black mayor ever dinkins who defeated koch in the democratic 
primary 
dinkins leads by about 15 percentage points in polls despite 
revelations about the democrats personal and campaign finances 
that giuliani said cast doubt on dinkins honesty and character 
so many serious questions have been raised about my opponent 
that this election has become a referendum on integrity giuliani 
said during a busy day of campaigning 
david dinkins has a history of getting away with things that 
others dont get away with giuliani added 
dinkins made several appearances shrugging off giulianis 
charges as signs of desperation dinkins repeated his themes of 
unity and vowed not to allow the city to become a republican 
beachhead a term used by president bush 
of course im pleased at the progress were making he told 
reporters adding i wont be happy until the last ballot is 
counted tomorrow assuming of course it results in a victory for 
our side 
dinkins accused giuliani the former federal prosecutor in 
manhattan of making loose allegations and running a negative 
campaign 
he said giuliani entered the mayoral race like a knight in 
shining armor on a white charger i suggest that the armor is a bit 
tarnished and that charger is no longer white 
dinkins campaign has been dogged in recent weeks by accusations 
of financial transgressions including the sale of cabletelevision 
stock he once valued at 1 million to his son for 58000 his 
failure to file tax returns for four years 20 years ago and the 
payment of 9500 to an exconvict to get out the vote in the 
primary 
the latest allegation was that dinkins failed to list on 
financial disclosure or tax forms that a friend paid in part for a 
trip to france last year dinkins said monday that he was trying to 
determine if the gift exceeded a 500 minimum that would require 
its listing 
later dinkins said part of the air fare was paid by the friend 
through a hotel bonus program similar to a frequentflier program 
and had no cash value dinkins said it is not clear whether such a 
gift must be listed on financial disclosure forms but said he 
would amend his statement 
he is less than candid he hides he evades giuliani 
charged you finally confront him with it he hides he evades 
this had to be dragged out of david dinkins 
giuliani also has accused dinkins of accepting cruises from 
unions but dinkins the manhattan borough president said they 
were related to city business 
trust is a very important word in government giuliani said 
its at the heart of american democracy its at the core of this 
election we must be able to trust our mayor 
the candidates met in two televised debates over the weekend 
with dinkins saying voters dont want a prosecutor they want a 
mayor giuliani said they want a mayor who has nothing to fear 
from a prosecutor

lawsuit last week said humperdinck attorney robert rotstein 
rotstein said humperdinck would appeal 
humperdinck 53 has tested negative for the virus that causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome rotstein said 
mike walker a national enquirer editor said monday that the 
lantana flabased newspaper stood behind the article which he 
said was based on a court filing and was therefore not libelous 
in our dec 27 1988 issue we published a story describing 
how the mother of engelberts illegitimate child charged in a legal 
proceeding that the singer had the aids virus walker said we 
reported the allegation in an accurate and truthful manner and now 
we feel vindicated by the judges verdict

engelbert has aids virus was totally accurate the enquirer

the us supreme courts decision monday 
that a rhode island woman cannot let her boyfriend stay overnight 
while her children are in the house has sexist overtones the 
american civil liberties union said 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that carla 
parrillos rights were not violated by a judges order forbidding 
her from having overnight male guests while her children are home 
i would be surprised if judges were as willing to serve as 
moral guardians of a family where a man is involved said steven 
brown executive director of the rhode island aclu chapter 
ms parrillo and her husband justin jr were divorced in may 
1986 after seven years of marriage the johnston woman was given 
custody of her children and her husband was given visitation rights 
ms parrillo said her exhusband began to harass her when he 
learned she was dating joseph dipippo she asked for a court order 
limiting parrillos visitation rights requiring him to see the 
children then aged 8 10 and 13 at specific times away from the 
home 
parrillo countered by asking the court to bar ms parrillo from 
having overnight male guests and family court judge william 
goldberg in november 1986 barred ms parrillo from allowing any 
unrelated males to stay overnight when the children are home 
permitting dipippo to stay overnight with ms parrillo is not 
a suitable arrangement for the children to be put into said 
goldberg who has since retired 
attorneys for ms parrillo said goldbergs order was based on a 
presumption without any evidence that allowing dipippo to stay 
overnight would cause the children psychological harm 
neither side called experts to testify about the psychological 
effect of the visits on the children the children told goldberg in 
a private meeting that they all got along well with dipippo 
although the eldest child a boy said there were times he did not 
like the man 
goldberg also noted that if ms parrillo married dipippo the 
issue would become moot although ms parrillo 33 had told the 
court she did not plan to marry in the near future 
ms parrillo could not be reached for comment monday her 
telephone number is not listed and her aclu attorney patricia 
hurst said she had not spoken with her client 
earlier this year when the state supreme court upheld 
goldbergs order ms parrill said she was no longer dating dipippo 
but had a new boyfriend whom she intended to invite for overnight 
visits even if it meant risking jail 
thomas desimone an attorney for parrillo said monday that he 
was not surprised by the ruling 
i didnt think that there was a federal question involved 
he said 
brown said he felt the high court chose not to review the case 
because there are not similar cases elsewhere and it was simply a 
strange little case from rhode island that didnt deserve the full 
courts attention 
the case is parrillo vs parrillo 8975

the government solicitorgeneral said monday there 
is nothing to suggest in a british policemans report on the prison 
death of rudolf hess in 1987 that adolf hitlers world war ii 
deputy was murdered 
detective chief superintendent howard jones the policeman 
heading an official inquiry into hess death in berlins spandau 
prison sad earlier this year that discrepancies in evidence 
merited a full criminal investigation 
but sir nicholas lyell told the house of commons on monday 
inquiries carried out by jones have produced no cogent evidence 
to suggest that rudolf hess was murdered nor in the view of the 
director of public prosecutions is there any basis for further 
investigation 
hess died on aug 17 1987 at age 93 the governments of the 
united states and americas three wartime allies britain france 
and the soviet union ruled formally that hess committed suicide by 
hanging himself from a window latch 
his body was found in a garden hut in the grounds of the prison 
where he had been the sole inmate since 1966 family members among 
others expressed doubts that hess killed himself 
legislator rhodri morgan of the opposition labor party who 
prompted the solicitorgenerals statement by asking what action 
was to be taken on jones report told the commons the government 
ruling was deeply disappointing for anybody interested in the 
truth 
hess was captured after flying to scotland in 1941 in a 
selfproclaimed bid to end the war he was convicted in 1945 as a 
war criminal and sentenced to life imprisonment

a federal judge ruled monday that 
immigration court proceedings must be translated in full for 
nonenglish speakers facing deportation and exclusion hearings 
us district judge william gray ruled that the current policy 
which provides only for translation of questions to nonenglish 
speakers and their responses violates statutory and constitutional 
rights 
sandra pettit of the legal aid foundation said the ruling will 
give those facing such hearings the ability to understand and 
participate 
the proceeding wont be something that is just done to them 
she said 
gray rejected a request by government lawyers that the ruling be 
put on hold while they appealed ms pettit said 
ms pettit represents two refugee rights groups el rescate and 
the central american refugee center and five individuals three of 
whom speak spanish and two farsi the main language in iran 
all five were involved in immigration proceedings and in march 
1988 filed suit claiming that immigration court proceedings were 
incompletely and poorly translated 
the suit was filed against the executive office of immigration 
review the branch of the justice department that oversees 
immigration courts as well as others including us attorney 
general dick thornburgh 
gray granted a summary judgment on their claim that the 
translations were incomplete a second claim that court 
interpreters are poorly trained and unqualified likely will go to 
trial early next year ms pettit said

richard maltby jr and david shire spin highly 
personal stories through song 
they did it in the offbroadway revue starting here starting 
now in 1977 and in the musical baby a modest broadway 
success nearly six years ago 
now another collection of their musical tales is on display in 
closer than ever a pintsized but emotionally potent revue 
that opened monday at offbroadways cherry lane theatre 
their terrific songs come from a grab bag of sources some were 
dropped from baby before it opened in new york others appeared 
in a topical revue urban blight done at the manhattan theatre 
club and several were created specifically for this new show 
what maltby and shire chronicle in their nearly two dozen 
numbers is choice and change people coming to terms with their 
choices and changes involving husbands wives lovers children 
parents and most importantly themselves 
if that makes the show sound gloomy and a bit pompous it isnt 
closer than ever is an exhilarating musical revue that 
reaffirms ones belief that the american musical theater isnt dead 
yet 
shires music sounds contemporary but it is more than a 
collection of pop melodies maltbys lyrics are intelligent and 
often witty yet never intricate for the sake of being tricky 
together they turn what could be just songs into one of the finest 
scores of the year 
three numbers anchor the show in one of the good guys a 
married man wonders what it would have been like if he had cheated 
on his wife and not done the right thing in the devastating 
life story a woman looks back on the choices she made about 
marriage and career and in the highly emotional if i sing a 
son thanks his father for introducing him to music 
several very funny songs spice up the production in the bear 
the tiger the hamster and the mole the mating habits of man are 
compared unfavorably to the mating habits of animals and 
another wedding song may be the first wedding salute to second 
marriages 
the performers brent barrett sally mayes richard muenz and 
particularly lynne wintersteller are enormously appealing they 
are the kind of singers who should be in broadway shows every 
season if broadway were still producing musicals like this 
the quartet gets yeoman support from pianist and musical 
director patrick scott brady maltby who directed the show with 
steven scott smith moves the cast briskly through their numbers 
and the pace rarely falters 
the setting a takeoff of a painting by belgian surrealist rene 
magritte features a blue sky clouds and an open door framed by 
musical notation its a tantalizing bit of imagery that suggests 
lifes possibilities closer than ever doesnt make those 
choices seem unlimited but it suggests that most of the fun and 
some of the pain is in the trying

the united states joined south pacific 
nations on monday in denouncing drift net fishing as a 
potentially devastating technology that kills marine mammals 
sea birds and fish 
japan taiwan and south korea have made extensive use of the 
nets in the pacific ocean to catch squid 
drift nets can be 30 miles wide and a us delegate ambassador 
jonathan moore said they catch every living thing with which 
they come in contact with the exception of fish small enough to 
pass through the mesh size 
moore told a general assembly committee the united states will 
join 11 other nations in sponsoring a resolution that would ban 
large drift nets 
the measure would abolish drift net fishing immediately in the 
south pacific and phase it out worldwide by june 30 1992 
moore said the united states does not object to developing 
nations using small drift nets that allow fish to multiply and 
renew the stock 
but he said the use of vast drift nets is an inherently 
indiscriminate and potentially devastating technology 
he told the committee such nets violate the principle of 
sustainable development by harvesting and killing fish and marine 
life faster than they can reproduce 
sponsoring the resolution on drift net fishing along with the 
united states are new zealand australia canada fiji mauritania 
papua new guinea the solomon islands vanuatu zaire colombia and 
sweden 
it does not single out any nation for criticism but expresses 
concern about the indiscriminate nature of drift net fishing and 
sets out proposals for international management and the eventual 
ban of the nets 
prime minister geoffrey palmer of new zealand told the general 
assembly last month that drift nets are walls of death and that 
their use has depleted salmon stocks in the north pacific 
in seattle six western states and the province of british 
columbia issued a proclamation at a news conference urging their 
federal governments to act to reduce drift net fishing in the north 
pacific 
the proclamation was issued by the states of alaska washington 
oregon idaho california and hawaii and by british columbia and 
was announced during the meeting in seattle of the international 
north pacific fisheries commission

about 1 million rural factories one of the great 
success stories of chinas past decade of reforms have shut down 
this year because of government austerity policies 
hundreds of thousands of other rural enterprises either stopped 
production or shifted to making other goods since the year began 
the official xinhua news agency said tuesday quoting agriculture 
ministry officials 
the china daily said in a related report that the number of 
private business people in china fell from 145 million at the end 
of 1988 to 123 million now as a result of the economic slowdown 
and beijings determination to tighten controls over the private 
sector 
xinhua did not say how many people lost their jobs as a result 
and the government has not addressed the issue of rising rural 
unemployment 
government officials have said unemployment will double from 2 
percent on jan 1 1989 to 4 percent on dec 31 but those figures 
refer only to urban workers laidoff rural workers can return to 
farming the government says 
fastgrowing rural enterprises and private business have made 
major contributions in the past decade by providing services and 
goods the inefficient staterun economy cant handle and by 
providing millions of jobs for surplus farm workers 
at the end of 1988 china had 188 million rural enterprises 
employing nearly 100 million people total output value last year 
was 175 billion up about 40 percent from 1987 exceeding the 
nations agricultural output value and accounting for a quarter of 
that of the entire country 
rural enterprises however have been a loser in the yearold 
austerity program under which the government has cut credit and 
given priority to staterun enterprises in alloting scarce energy 
and raw material resources 
the government has called for largescale readjustment of rural 
factories citing widespread problems in poor management 
duplication of production waste of energy and materials severe 
pollution and poor quality products 
the agriculture ministry said no new rural enterprises will be 
allowed to open over the next two or three years except those 
producing goods for exports those supplying energy or materials 
industries or big industries those producing daily goods in short 
supply or those making agricultural equipment 
the china daily said that despite the sharp drop in private 
entrepreneurs the government stands by its policy of encouraging 
supervised growth of the private sector and allowing some people to

as a new round of highlevel economic talks 
opened monday japan criticized wall streets flurry of corporate 
takeovers as an example of us shortterm business strategy 
harmful to the economy and to americas own competitive interests 
the us side replied that certain takeovers perhaps have gone 
too far but maintained that leveraged buyouts play an important 
role in recycling assets a us official said 
japan took the offensive at the opening of the twoday round of 
structural talks the two countries have agreed to hold every two 
months in a new search for solutions to their multibilliondollar 
trade imbalance 
as host of the meeting the united states takes its turn as 
critic on tuesday planning to highlight japanese infrastructure 
defects anticompetitive pricing and distribution practices that 
discriminate against imports and penalize japanese consumers said 
senior us administration officials who briefed reporters on 
condition of anonymity 
the session will end with release of a joint study by the two 
governments showing that consumers in tokyo and osaka must pay 
substantially more for the same goods than those in new york and 
chicago the officials said prices of 140 items made in japan the 
united states and third countries were checked 
president bush announced the sii or structural impediment 
initiative talks in may saying they should be a twoway street 
they started in tokyo in september and aim to produce by early 
1990 a preliminary report and by july a final report on structural 
and lifestyle problems contributing to the 50 billion annual us 
trade deficit with japan 
the ideal result a us official said would be the emergence 
of some new patterns of behavior in both our countries so that 
the us is much more competitive and so that on the japanese 
side their economy is much more open 
the japanese side has been criticizing us emphasis on 
shortterm profits as an example of corporate behavior that hurts 
us competitiveness and staying power in the complicated japanese 
market 
according to a us official the japanese voiced concern monday 
that leveraged buyout activity in the united states in a way 
reflects the short timeframe with which business managers view 
their ongoing businesses and the decisionmaking process they 
see it in many ways as being counterproductive to the longterm 
health of the economy and to business 
the us reply he added was that we view the issue with a 
tinge of concern because certain cases have perhaps gone too 
far but not overly concerned because we see a very important 
and viable place in the economy for leveraged buyouts in the sense 
that they recycle mature assets they represent a recapitalization 
of mature industries 
i think they understood the arguments of the us side and 
the issue will be discussed further the official said 
the us officials said specific issues to be raised tuesday 
include an inadequate japanese infrastructure for importing and 
distributing foreignmanufactured products such as airports air 
and sea cargo facilities and superhighways and the lack of 
investment in medical facilities sewer systems and parks 
most of the us recommendations already have been made by 
forwardlooking japanese organizations so the talks are really a 
winwin game rather than a zerosum game the officials said

lech walesa will not lay a wreath in ottawa on 
armistice day as he had requested but the argument raged monday 
about who was to blame 
the canadian labor congress said walesa who founded polands 
independent trade union solidarity in 1980 and won the nobel peace 
prize in 1983 was shut out by prime minister brian mulroney 
mulroneys office denied the charge and the foreign office said 
the union federation decided friday that walesa would skip the 
ceremonies at the cenotaph or national monument to the dead in 
ottawa 
walesa is to arrive friday in montreal for a fourday private 
visit to canada arranged by the labor federation walesa asked the 
congress some time ago to arrange for him to lay a wreath saturday 
in the federal capital of ottawa because nov 11 is polands 
independence day 
he had been tentatively scheduled to be in ottawa saturday for 
the televised national observance of remembrance day as nov 11 is 
known in canada and return to ottawa two days later for meetings 
with mulroney and other dignitaries 
now his schedule is to go to toronto late friday and on saturday 
place a wreath at the cenotaph in toronto 
derik hodgson a labor congress spokesman said monday the 
foreign office vetoed plans for walesa to lay a wreath in ottawa on 
behalf of the federations 2 million members and we were told 
the order came from the prime ministers office 
they said it would be a breach of protocol that it would be 
embarrassing to the prime minister if walesa participated before he 
officially meets with mulroney 
hodgson said meetings with foreign office officials were held 
over a period of weeks and labor congress officials were told 
repeatedly it was the prime ministers office that did not want 
walesa included in the national observances in ottawa 
i would hate to think it was because our prime minister was 
vain and didnt want to share the stage with someone so well 
known hodgson added 
mulroney will lay a wreath at the ceremonies on behalf of the 
government of canada 
a different version was given by gilbert lavoie the prime 
ministers press secretary he said walesa was scheduled to meet 
with mulroney on monday 
then last week the labor group asked if walesa could instead 
meet mulroney on saturday to accommodate a planned visit by walesa 
to niagara falls ont on monday lavoie said 
we said no said lavoie you dont change the prime 
ministers schedule at the last minute because youre planning a 
meeting in niagara falls 
rejane dodd of the foreign office said of the conflicting 
accounts im telling you what ive been told i find it strange 
its totally different i doubt very much our people would give me 
wrong information 
hodgson claimed murray fairweather director of the ussr and 
eastern europe division at the foreign office threatened to cancel 
walesas trip if the labor congress pressed the matter 
ms dodd said anybody is free to come to canada i dont 
think you can cancel a visit like this

twenty years ago when abdulla salman was 
a boy learning the sea as many as 1500 dhows plied the waters 
around bahrain today only about 300 of the traditional craft 
remain 
not too many bahrainis like the sea so much anymore said 
salman whose fleet of five dhows makes him at age 30 one of 
bahrains hardiest survivors in a vanishing breed 
the 8year iraniraq war in the persian gulf cut off bahrains 
sea trade with iran that and the opening of a causeway linking 
bahrain an island with saudi arabia in 1986 dealt severe blows 
to dhow operators already affected by modernization of shipping and 
the virtual end of the pearling that once flourished here 
however nobody expects that the dhow still built to a 
centuriesold design will become extinct bahrains government is 
working to keep them afloat but records at the port authority show 
an 80 percent decline over the past 20 years 
abdulla salman learned seamanship from his father who once 
worked on big cargo dhows called booms sailing to india and 
africa and later ran ferries between bahrains islands 
salman the younger uses three of his dhows for commercial 
fishing and hires out the others for picnics dinner cruises and 
excursions 
the charter trade has picked up since the end of iraniraq war 
15 months ago 
among salmans best customers now are us sailors who even 
after weeks at sea are eager to go fishing and teach salman what 
he calls interesting american expressions 
the circumstances are less bright for abdul ameer alqaisi one 
of bahrains last remaining master dhow builders 
after 30 years working at the craft handed down through six 
generations of his family alqaisi struggles to make ends meet by 
doing repairs and maintenance he built his last dhow four years 
ago and sold it at a loss he said 
only one of his six sons has shown even passing interest in 
continuing the family tradition 
this generation goes to school then finds other jobs he 
said our people have been shipbuilders for generations now 
once a father dies the children dont take over 
as far back as 2500 bc bahrain then called dilmun was a 
center for trade with mesopotamia the ancient name for what is now 
iraq at the head of the persian gulf 
sumerian tablets tell of ships arriving from dilmun with wood 
copper and precious stones 
a traditional dhow is distinguishable by its lateen sails or 
raised deck at the stern 
the big cargo dhows called booms are thought to be the original 
design but the most common type of dhow in the persian gulf today 
is the banoosh a smaller vessel used for fishing cargo 
passengers and pleasure trips 
another is the jalibut a sturdy but less graceful craft whose 
name may be derived from the british jolly boat 
the sailing dhows have all but disappeared as engine power 
replaced the lateen sails used since the 4th century many modern 
dhows have no masts 
dhows however do have some things in common the keel is 
almost always a single squaredoff log of teak 
another common feature is the absence of shelter or cabin space 
fishermen and cargo handlers work eat sleep and pray on the 
decks regardless of weather 
the only comforts may be the captains woodslat bed on the 
quarterdeck and a toilet a large box slung over the stern 
bahraini dhow builders are noted for their workmanship and 
some shunning modern methods still work from memory with a 
yardstick to measure and handmade tools to drill gouge saw 
pound and plane as a result no two dhows are ever identical 
alqaisi is among the traditionalists drilling holes with his 
bowdrill or mijdah and sewing the planks together with hemp 
rather than using nails or bolts 
bahrains government which compensated some dhow owners for 
lost business after the causeway to saudi arabia opened has 
recently acquired a dhow for tourist excursions and is studying 
ideas for reviving the pearling industry 
alqaisi hopes the government will find a way to encourage young 
people to stay in the trade 
dhow builders he said dont really want to sit around and be 
photographed by tourists we want to do the work as before father 
to son

sitting on his favorite multicolored 
rug in the shaded courtyard of his carpet factory aji badghisi 
remembers the good times when business was brisk and traders came 
from afar seeking his rare designs and wools 
now after more than a decade of war badghisis carpet factory 
is crumbling around him 
his male employees have gone to war or fled afghanistan young 
boys and girls no more than 13 years old work in their place 
costs have skyrocketed with the current inflation cash that 
took him through two months before the war began in 1979 lasts only 
two weeks now his weaving machines have shrunk from 200 to 20 
still ewaz badghisi ltd survives it is the last carpet 
factory in kabul a city that once had scores 
what can we do said badghisi a small man with two gold 
teeth and the hands of a craftsman this is the life of my family 
of generations we know no other business 
switching jobs wouldnt do 
the war between the government and the moslem guerrillas has 
made afghanistans poor economy even poorer exports have dwindled 
to almost nothing and the civilian economy is completely dependent 
on the soviet union 
carpets used to provided millions of dollars in revenue about 
40 percent of afghanistans export earnings now the industry is 
losing out to carpet weavers in iran pakistan turkey and china 
carpet weaving in southwest asia began thousands of years ago by 
nomadic tribes that inhabited the valley on both sides of the amu 
darya river dividing what is now the soviet union and afghanistan 
rugs were traditionally knotted by women young girls acquired 
the skill at home as they prepared their dowry of carpets quilts 
cushions and wall hangings 
the flourishing silk route connecting europe to india and 
china turned carpet weaving into a major industry and had a strong 
influence on the rugs made in afghanistan buddhist and christian 
motifs still show up in the patterns even though islam was adopted 
as the main religion of the afghan tribes in the 9th and 10th 
centuries 
various parts of afghanistan became famous for their carpets 
the mauri style said to be one of the worlds finest hails 
from the northwestern province of badghis the home province of the 
badghisi family made from lustrous wool of the kandahari sheep a 
mauri carpet can have up to 60000 knots in a square yard 
the baluch style from western afghanistan is used in moslem 
prayer rugs with its restrained treeoflife and mosque motifs 
even after the communist takeover of afghanistan in 1978 carpet 
weaving remained primarily a village industry government attempts 
to organize staterun concerns resulted in lowquality goods 
badghisi ltd survives because the familys native village is 
under government control and is near the soviet border the company 
organizes several journeys to the village each year to bring 
carpets to herat where they can be shipped to kabul and then 
exported to western europe japan and the united states 
lately the trip from the village to kabul has become more 
expensive gasoline is rare and becoming even rarer because the 
rebels are shutting the roads in the north 
in addition wool from the kandahari sheep has almost quadrupled 
in cost 
no one is herding sheep anymore badghisi said they are 
all either dead fighting or refugees 
production at the factory has also fallen sharply 
twelve years ago we had 1000 workers here he said now 
weve got 100 and they are just children 
in one workshop a group of boys were bent over a loom slowly 
knotting wool strands into a pattern of elephants and horses 
i want to go to school but theres no school said 
12yearold mohammad amin i want to fly my kite too but my 
family needs money 
mohammad earns about 2000 afghanis 5 a month enough to buy 
about 15 pounds of flour when its available in the markets 
badghisi sighs and runs his hands over the wildly colored 
carpet his favorite perch in the factorys courtyard 
we are all waiting for the war to end he said the young 
need to play and we need to make business

first by land now by sea president bush has 
delivered a pair of summit surprises that countered critics of a 
foreign policy they term timid and he calls prudent each time he 
said the complaints didnt bother him because he knew exactly what 
he was doing all along 
its happened twice within six months in may with his proposal 
to slash conventional arms in europe and now with his shipboard 
conference planned for december with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
each time bush said that prolonged public criticism didnt faze 
him because he knew what he wanted to do and how to do it at one 
point the president even claimed he was immune to political 
criticism 
if so hes the first 
the two summit maneuvers one west one east display the powers 
a president wields in matters diplomatic although events can 
overrule him jimmy carter in town for a weekend reunion of his 
administration can attest to that 10 years after the iranian 
embassy hostage seizure that dominated his final year and 
undermined his 1980 campaign 
indeed bush has his own experience with presidential limits in 
his attempt to force manuel noriega out of power in panama 
but in eastwest diplomacy hes succeeded in writing the agenda 
so far and democratic critics are relatively quiet if not 
satisfied 
in the first months of the bush administration there were 
widespread complaints at home and among us allies abroad at 
administration silence while gorbachev was scoring public opinion 
points in western europe with a series of arms control promises and 
offers bush had ordered a review of us foreign and defense 
policies and he waited it out without countering the soviet 
leaders peace offensive 
then at the nato summit in brussels he proposed swift and 
drastic cuts in soviet and us conventional weapons in europe 
gorbachev had proposed reductions too over five or six years 
bush wanted a deal negotiated in six months or a year with the 
actual reductions to follow in 1992 or 1993 
his time frame is slipping although bush said last week that 
the conventional arms negotiations are going reasonably well 
we have to keep driving to be sure that we can keep moving 
forward to meet a rather ambitious time frame he said 
back when he announced the conventional arms proposals there 
was a toldyouso air to his comments about the critics i know 
that some voices were raised in congress that we were going too 
slow he said on may 29 but we knew exactly what we were doing 
all along thats almost exactly what he said on oct 31 
announcing the meeting with gorbachev 
in may and again in october bush said he had come under fire 
for being reluctant to move that people kept saying do something 
but that he insisted on taking his time and acting prudently 
after brussels and his midsummer trip to poland and hungary 
criticism of the bush pace picked up again senate democratic 
leader george mitchell said the administration seemed more 
comfortable with the certainties of the cold war than with the 
challenges of change in the governments and economies of the 
oncesolid communist bloc 
bush had said his goal was to overcome the division of europe 
and forge a new unity based on western values the goal was 
applauded but as events moved that way some democrats said bush 
wasnt doing enough to support change 
they were dissatisfied with the economic aid package he 
recommended for poland and hungary and congress doubled it they 
thought he should be more assertive in dealing with gorbachev and 
there were suggestions all summer that he ought to meet with the 
soviet leader in september the two governments agreed to a summit 
meeting on strategic arms control in the united states next spring 
or summer 
the critics still deemed the president too passive then he 
sprang his second surprise an informal preview meeting with 
gorbachev dec 2 and 3 aboard ships off malta bush said hed 
planned it since the middle of the summer but kept it secret from 
all but the top echelons of the administration until the 
simultaneous halloween announcements at the white house and the 
kremlin 
weve known what we were doing bush said weve been on 
this track for some time ive elected to remain very quiet in the 
face of a good deal of sentiment that we were missing an 
opportunity and that hasnt perturbed me 
some have suggested that i am they use a different word for 
it but a little too much on the cautious side i think there is 
reason to be cautious and ive said that over and over again 
substitute the word prudent if you want 
bush said he hadnt needed a lot of advice even from inside his 
own administration in planning the meeting i knew exactly what 
i wanted to do and i knew how i wanted to go about doing it he 
said 
twice

hassan humayed and his 10 children were 
sleeping on his rooftop one hot night when a katyusha rocket hissed 
over and ricocheted off the concrete roof through a stone wall 
without exploding 
the people who launch the rockets dont hurt the enemy 
humayed fumed they hurt us 
the people who fired the rocket were palestinian guerrillas in a 
mountain above town it was aimed at israel 1 miles west of 
humayeds house on the northern end of the border a second missile 
exploded harmlessly in an israeli field 
a few days later humayed said israeli troops fired a flare 
onto the jordanian side of the yarmouk river apparently to burn 
brush guerrillas could use for cover but instead the resulting 
fire burned 60 of his familys orange trees 
the missiles and several recent guerrilla attacks on israel have 
interrupted years of relative calm along jordans 300mile border 
prompting veiled israeli threats of retaliation if they continue 
the palestinian attacks pose a security problem for israel but 
for jordanians the issue has wider strategic implications 
survival against a more powerful foe 
a senior military official who cannot be identified because of 
jordanian army regulations said the jordanians are doing their 
best to stop the palestinian attacks 
twelve members of the syrianbased popular front for the 
liberation of palestine were arrested after the rocket attack 
military officials said the guerrillas who fired the katyushas 
crossed from syria which takes a militant stand against israel and 
sponsors hardline guerrilla factions 
at the same time the guerrillas are hostile to efforts by 
jordan and yasser arafats mainstream palestine liberation 
organization to reach a diplomatic settlement with israel 
we dont believe this sort of action will solve the 
palestinian problem the jordanian military official said if 
the israelis retaliate it might hurt our citizens 
he suggested syrianbacked radical palestinians were trying to 
undermine arafats peace initiative 
jordanians are alarmed by rightwing israeli calls to establish 
a palestinian state in jordan or for israel to take control of 
jordanian territory under what they consider to be biblical 
precedent 
we take every word said by the israeli leaders seriously 
because weve learned they mean it the senior officer said 
aqaba jordans only port along with its most important 
farmlands water systems and potash industry are within israeli 
artillery range 
all of jordans urban centers are only a few minutes flying 
time from israeli air bases 
israeli jets regularly fly into jordanian airspace diplomats 
said but the military official noted nobody has reported to me 
that the israelis are trying to be aggressive against jordanian 
soldiers 
jordanian and israeli policemen still meet on the king 
husseinallenby bridge on the jordan river to coordinate the flow 
of tour buses that cross under the scrutiny of machinegunners in 
blockhouses 
along much of the border israeli and jordanian outposts are 
only a few hundred yards apart 
soldiers at a northern post overlooking the golan heights 
village of hammah can hear laughter and music from an israeli 
amusement park nearby 
but the thunder of artillery from israeli gunnery ranges the 
supersonic booms of israeli warplanes and occasional explosions in 
border minefields sometimes triggered by wild pigs bear witness 
that this is still a war zone

farmers growing cotton 
avocados and dates in this commune carry rifles and twoway radios 
when they go down to the jordan river to tend their crops 
after 20 years of calm alng the 300mile israelijordanian 
border recent attacks from inside jordan have raised tensions 
were not retreating or panicking said zvi zexer 65 a 
high school teacher on the commune of 650 people 75 miles north of 
jerusalem the events of today are nothing compared to the past 
eight members of the kibbutz one of 73 such communal 
settlements along the frontier were killed by shells mines and 
crossborder raids by palestinian guerrillas in the 196770 war of 
attrition 
according to army figures 165 soldiers and 32 civilians died in 
5270 terrorist incidents in that period 
in the latest attacks the heaviest since the 1960s three 
israeli soldiers have been killed a halfdozen wounded and one 
kidnapped and held briefly in seven crossborder attacks this year 
the israelis say in one incident rockets were fired into israel 
sgt maj tomer patrolling the dusty border in a jeep armed 
with a machine gun recalled that in one attack two israeli 
soldiers were wounded near this kibbutz sept 16 by someone who 
appeared to them to be a jordanian soldier although jordan says 
its soldiers are not involved in attacks on israel 
it was daylight about 6 am on the sabbath tomer said 
he was hiding in the date palms he jumped up and fired 15 
rounds semiautomatic the attacker got away 
israeli officials see the attacks as a sign that the 
22monthold palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank 
and the gaza strip is spilling over into jordan 
many of the 17 million palestinians in the occupied territories 
have relatives in jordan 
col gidi commander of a unit stationed along the border said 
the palestine liberation organization appeared to be behind some of 
the attacks 
several attacks have been claimed by radical syrianbased 
palestinian factions the plo says it now wants a peaceful 
settlement with israel 
there are many palestinians in the jordanian army gidi 
said they have connections with palestinians here maybe theyre 
trying to show their families they want to help and identify with 
the uprising 
some israelis view the attacks as a sign that jordans 
74000man army which has prevented most such attacks in the past 
has become less disciplined in the wake of aprils antigovernment 
riots in jordan 
col renaan gissin deputy spokesman for the israeli army noted 
that if the guerrillas feel theres some laxity in the discipline 
in the jordanian army or some weakening in jordanian resolve of 
course theyll try to infiltrate from this area

pamphlets written by extreme leftists criticizing senior leader 
deng xiaoping as a capitalist and by reformists calling him 
senile have appeared mysteriously in the mail of chinese and 
foreigners in several cities 
students in southwestern sichuan province were stopped by 
soldiers from marching to dengs home village and desecrating his

she has received anonymous threats 
taken individually small events but together they signal that 
the political tensions that produced the huge studentled marches 
of april and may and climaxed in junes bloody crackdown have not

even as the communist party celebrates 40 years in power a 
moment of eventual reckoning between it and chinas 11 billion 
people seems inevitable 
people are waiting for deng to die just as they waited for 
the emperors to die said a western scholar speaking on

the chinese have a saying three men can create a tiger 
one man can say he saw a tiger and no one will believe him 
but if three men say they saw it people will believe explained 
wei yang a college student in this arid capital of gansu province 
two days journey by train from beijing 
wei like others spoke on condition he be given a pseudonym 
he worries that with time and repetition people will begin to 
believe the governments version of a tiger its charge that 
counterrevolutionaries were behind the popular studentled 
democracy movement and that they and hoodlums caused more damage 
with rocks and bottles than soldiers did with tanks and guns 
in beijing the center of the storm where more than one out of 
every 10 residents joined in the movement in some form few people 
believe in the tiger despite months of intense education by the 
government 
to them the students remain heroes who dared to say what no one 
else did that the peoples democratic dictatorship was only a 
dictatorship 
generally beijing residents no more represent china than new 
yorkers speak for all americans but two weeks of travel through 
provincial capitals found the same cynicism and anger in 
conversations with dozens of students teachers and urban workers 
only in the villages about the only places where students and 
sympathizers did not march for reform do ordinary people say with 
apparent sincerity that the government was right to set the army on 
protesters in beijing but they are ignorant of many details even 
the governments admission that hundreds died 
asked how the army ended the protests zhou zhenchuan a factory 
manager in peaceful village near lanzhou replied they used tear 
gas told that soldiers also fired guns he said in disbelief 
i never heard that 
if ignorance has ensured peace in the countryside fear serves 
the same purpose in the cities 
although the government stopped announcing arrests of suspected 
dissidents in july after more than 2000 were publicized chinese 
and western sources in lanzhou and three other provincial capitals 
zhengzhou xian and chengdu said a new wave of interrogations 
and arrests began in september when colleges reopened no reliable 
figures were available 
special investigation teams have been formed on each campus 
theyre going through the libraries on campus and taking books 
off the shelves and locking them up said a foreign teacher who 
insisted on not being identified even by the city where she lives 
old files are being reopened she said and past writings and 
comments are being examined for signs of capitalist or western 
sympathies as authorities seek not only to round up those connected 
with the protests but to stamp out liberal thought 
police patrols of campuses have been increased at one school 
police stop at night at the room of a former student leader to ask 
are you there 
some professors who sympathized with or advised the students 
have been banned from teaching and remain in limbo in their campus 
housing not daring to meet with friends for fear of harming them 
by association 
wei said that after the lone big character poster went up at 
lanzhou university signed the china democratic league lanzhou 
branch officials brought in handwriting experts to examine it 
within days seven students were arrested 
we dont know if our dorms are bugged he said one night 
a group of students debated among themselves one group argued for 
putting down the turmoil another opposed it the next day a 
teacher said you students should talk less about it

impact of a government policy trickles down a new policy often has 
taken its place a government worker said 
but when beijing students began a hunger strike in may to press 
their cause more than 10000 lanzhou students and older 
intellectuals marched to show support

when the army attacked the beijing students on june 34 lanzhou 
students flocked to the railway station and tore up the tracks to 
keep local soldiers from being sent to the capital they blocked 
city roads and bridges too shutting down the city for nearly a 
week in hopes that the chaos would topple premier li peng and 
others who ordered the army attack 
gansu gov jia zhijie mobilized thousands of police to remove 
the blockades and round up protesters when a rat runs across the 
street everybody cries kill it he said grimly 
lanzhou is far from the most remote place where people 
protested the government says 80 cities were affected but the 
number seems much larger 
domestic radio in may reported marches in a dozen cities and 
towns in the southwestern province of sichuan alone including some 
places so small they could not be found in an atlas a recent 
traveler to a dozen semirural county towns was told in each that 
protests were held there in the spring 
during the height of the movement hundreds of thousands of 
students traveled between beijing and other cities sharing 
information and funds although their illegal unions have been 
disbanded ties of sympathy remain 
asked if he believed the protests were counterrevolutionary 
one student in xian declared we have brains we also are 
students students all over the country are in unison 
several months into the new school year this unison seems 
unlikely to translate into action anytime soon 
under the most intense and widereaching government attack in 
years on dissent and anything else that offends the leaders most 
people students included have subsided into silent 
introspection 
there are reports that gambling and drinking are on the increase 
among students at one technical school students were found 
gambling at mahjongg an ancient tile game and were given 
demerits a fellow student said 
the students are depressed they dont cooperate they dont 
biaotai make the ritual declaration of their political loyalty 
or if they do its just perfunctory said wang shuying a 
provincial government employee privately confirming what teachers 
and students have said 
the political education has no impact people are trying to 
leave those who before were willing to wait for their work units 
to send them abroad are trying now to pay their own way 
wang who does not speak a foreign language has no hope of 
leaving he wavers between bitter envy of the students arrogance 
and a shared hatred for the party 
wang dan and the others their lives were easy she said 
referring to a top beijing student leader now under arrest 
thats why they dared speak they had no political experience 
she has spent most of her more than 30 years under the inherited 
stigma of her parents 1957 label as rightists 
speaking out does no good she said anger in her voice 
you cant change anything you can only make it harder for 
yourself later on the arm cannot be stronger than the leg the 
leg in china is the communist party 
chinese intellectuals are weak she adds yes i count 
myself among them theres something lacking in our character why 
have all modern chinese leaders been peasants look at mao 
tsetung deng xiaoping 
wei shares some of wangs doubts 
we talked about democracy but no one really knew what it 
is he said i only know what it is not how does it work we 
need to find out more about it 
when like thousands of students he traveled to beijing in may 
to join the sitin in tiananmen square he found the movement 
presided over by a few students who were inaccessible behind 
cordons of pickets just like party leaders 
some people say that in 30 years when this generation comes to 
power we will overthrow the system he said but others say we 
will only change the name of the party from communist and nothing 
will really change just like the communists replaced the emperors 
but became new emperors 
deng xiaoping was suppressed once and now he suppresses 
others some say wuer kaixi a student leader who fled to the 
united states will be the next deng xiaoping 
in the end wang said it may not matter whether the 
intellectuals choose socialism or capitalism democracy or 
authoritarianism rising unemployment and the gap in living 
standards between cities and villages may trigger mass anger that 
will put chinas future once again in the hands of peasants 
motivated not by democracy but by their pocketbooks 
chengdus experience may be telling many of those who clashed 
with police there in early june setting buses on fire and throwing 
bricks and stones were peasants come from the countryside to look 
for work both of the two men executed in chengdu were peasants 
one was 61 the other was 19

the penalty was heavy but some still look back with nostalgia 
on the heady days of spring 
students from the communications university went around 
collecting money to give the students in beijing a xian factory 
worker recalled waiting wearily at midnight for a late train 
people didnt think i have 10 bucks ill give the students 5 
they gave whatever money they had 
as in beijing most of the scars of xians protests have been 
scrubbed or painted over a young office worker stood in the rain 
in xincheng square where xian students held a monthlong sitin in 
the spring and looked about as if searching for the vanished 
banners and tents 
it looked just like tiananmen square he said they had a 
broadcast station over here and another at the bell tower the 
students closed off the street but i got in and took some 
photographs 
he keeps the negatives hidden unprinted waiting for a more 
tolerant time 
wei too has hidden photographs and memories 
everyone thinks beijing people are great i had no place to 
stay and a man offered to take me in my friend was walking down 
the street in beijing and a man stopped him and said are you a 
student the man took him to a restaurant and gave him a big 
dinner 
i am proud i went i dont know what will happen in the 
future but it was history and i saw it

years later albert einstein would say it was 
the great mistake of my life fifty years ago einstein signed 
a letter urging president franklin d roosevelt to get the united 
states government involved in nuclear research but there was good 
reason nazi germany already had begun its hunt for the atomic 
bomb the second of two articles 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in 1939 much of the us army such as it was trained with 
makebelieve cannon made of twobyfours trucks labeled tank 
rifles that were actually broomsticks 
on jan 4 of that year president franklin d roosevelt 
astonished congress by asking to increase the military budget by an 
unheard of 2 billion war loomed in europe a new oldsmobile cost 
777 who of the survivors of the great depression could afford 
one much less tanks and bombers 
into this nailbiting world on jan 16 1939 sailed the 
swedishamerican liner drottingholm on board this unheralded 
arrival in new york was danish physicist niels bohr he bore 
momentous news to the esoteric world of physics the atom had 
been split in nazi germany 
by nightfall the word reached the weekly meeting of the 
princeton university physics faculty it became galvanized like a 
stirredup ant heap 
eugene wigner hadnt been there he was in the university 
infirmary with jaundice but he had heard he told his friend leo 
szilard who was making a bedside visit that was like telling the 
town gossip your juiciest tidbit 
szilard and wigner were jewish physicists along with their 
hungarian countryman edward teller they had decided to put an 
ocean between themselves and adolf hitler in time they would 
become known as the hungarian conspiracy for their 
lapeltugging insistence that their new homeland heed the atom 
szilard a stubby fountain of overflowing ideas had once tried 
to patent atomic energy after reading a futuristic novel by hg 
wells prophesying nuclear war at the princeton infirmary all the 
things which hg wells predicted appeared suddenly real to me 
szilard remembered 
he rushed back to columbia university and asked dr isidor rabi 
to query the quiet methodical italian enrico fermi recent winner 
of a nobel prize whether a split uranium atom could produce a 
chain reaction key to a bomb 
nuts fermi replied there was only a remote 
possibility perhaps 10 percent 
ten percent is not a remote possibility if it means we may die 
of it said rabi 
the news spread rapidly far beyond the princetonnew york axis 
in paris pierre curie confirmed the german experiment french 
scientists took out a patent on atomic energy including one for a 
bomb the dutch bought 50 tons of uranium from the belgian congo 
the worlds richest source clever these physicists said the 
dutch finance minister the german army ordnance department began 
investigating the uranium problem 
on march 16 fermi and george pegram a physicist and dean of 
graduate faculties at columbia visited the navy department in 
washington they explained how uranium could possibly liberate a 
million times as much energy per pound as any known explosive 
the navy interested in the phenomenon for submarine propulsion 
asked them to stay in touch it advanced them 2000 not quite 
three oldsmobiles for further research 
william arnold an american biologist was studying under bohr 
in copenhagen where the splitting of a uranium atom by germans otto 
hahn and fritz strassmani in december had been duplicated two weeks 
later he recalled the name for division of bacteria binary 
fission he named atomsplitting nuclear fission 
by whatever name the hungarian conspiracy and szilard in 
particular were chilled at the thought of nazism unlocking the atom 
first fission was no longer just a scientific holy grail mankind 
could be at stake the us government must do something but the 
immodest szilard had the modesty to appreciate that an unknown 
hungarian lacked the megatonnage to press urgency on washington 
who did 
albert einstein 
the german emigre with the hurricaneblown hairstyle was 
probably the worlds bestknown scientist and szilard knew he was 
an acquaintance of queen elizabeth of belgium and its congo 
uranium szilard phoned princeton where einstein was with the 
institute for advanced study einstein was summering at a dr 
moores cottage in peconic long island on july 16 szilard who 
didnt drive set off with wigner who did to find the reclusive 
einstein 
we asked a number of people but no one knew where dr moores 
cabin was szilard recalled we were on the point of giving up 
when i saw a boy of about 7 or 8 years of age standing on the curb 
i leaned out the window and asked say do you by any chance know 
where professor einstein lives the boy knew and offered to take 
us there 
an atomic bomb i never thought of that said einstein who 
had just come in from sailing and was clad only in shorts in the 
heat i did not in fact foresee that atomic energy would be 
released in my lifetime i only believed that it was theoretically 
possible the deviser of the core formula of the atomic bomb the 
fateful e equals mc2 had had his mind on other cosmic matters 
einstein preferred contacting a belgian cabinet member he knew 
rather than the queen as a courtesy szilard said they should 
mark in the state department if state didnt respond in two weeks 
einstein would send his letter to belgium over sandwiches 
sporadically produced by the household the scientists agreed they 
probably knew more about atoms than statecraft 
szilard said he would consult with friends more experienced in 
practical things back in new york on july 19 he contacted one 
such dr gustav stolper a refugee and former member of the german 
reichstag stolper advised szilard to meet with dr alexander 
sachs a financier biologist and economist who had worked for 
three years in roosevelts new deal and was a friend 
sachs was 46 russianborn americaneducated in a variety of 
areas a bystander fascinated with current atomic research a dead 
ringer for comedian ed wynn and a man who prided himself on a 
talent for prehistory being in on the birth pangs of things in 
their infancy the best thing to do he counseled szilard was 
contact his friend fdr if szilard preferred someone other than 
himself as a middleman sachs suggested karl compton president of 
mit bernard baruch the financier or charles lindbergh the hero 
pilot and vocal antiwar isolationist 
szilard drove back to peconic to discuss a draft letter to 
roosevelt this time teller drove i entered history as szilards 
chauffeur said the man who would become known as the father of 
the hbomb the abomb was to have no designated father szilard 
was certainly the matchmaker

<TEXT>
in early august einstein sent back to szilard the signed two 
versions of the letter szilard had drafted one short one long 
i wondered how many words we could expect the president to 
read the matchmaker recalled how many words did the fission 
of uranium rate 
einstein warned the impetuous szilard against being too 
clever szilard replied were surely not trying to be too 
clever and will be quite satisfied if only we dont look stupid 
einstein was to say that the letter was the great mistake of 
my life but there was some justification the danger that the 
germans would make bombs einstein was aware that cf 
weizsacker son of the german undersecretary of state was working 
at the kaiser wilhelm institute where hahn strassmann had split 
their atom he did not know that the month after signing the 
letters hitlers war office officially took over the kwi and began 
its hunt for an atomic bomb 
the show was going before that letter was even written said 
dr vannevar bush the us wartime science leader 
on aug 14 szilard wrote lindbergh enclosing einsteins letter 
and suggesting he contact roosevelt that now famous letter was 
pure szilard in its assurance that the impossible was possible 
now it appears almost certain that vast amounts of energy 
could be achieved in the immediate future restraint elsewhere 
sounds more like einstein this new phenomenon a chain reaction 
would also lead to the construction of bombs and it is conceivable 
though much less certain that extremely powerful bombs of a new 
type may thus be constructed 
lindy never answered einsteins dear herr lindbergh letter 
on sept 27 less than a month after germany began world war ii by 
invading poland szilard wrote einstein lindbergh is not our 
man 
sachs seemed no better on oct 3 szilard wrote einstein that 
sachs was still sitting on the letter and possibly sachs 
was useless 
not so sachs understood atoms and he understood washington 
our system is such that national public figures are 
sotospeak punchdrunk with printers ink there was no point 
in transmitting material which would be passed on to someone lower 
down i could only do it if i could see roosevelt for a long 
stretch of time and read the material so it came in by way of the 
ear and not as soft mascara on the eye 
on oct 11 1939 sachs finally got his appointment 
alex what are you up to the president askeds sachs had 
discussed nuclear energy with roosevelt earlier in the year 
nothing came of it the navy had relayed its doubts to the white 
house based on pegrams and fermis uncertainty that a chain 
reaction was possible 
this time sachs played the president in accord with the old 
recipe for boars head soup first catch your boar 
he opened with a parable from history a lure to catch a 
classicist president napoleon had once scoffed at an offer from 
robert fulton to use steamboats to invade britain moral leaders 
reject technology at their own peril 
determining that no scientist could sell atomic energy to 
him sachs instead paraphrased einsteins letter in his own 800 
words he concluded by quoting a lecture in 1938 by british 
scientist francis aston comparing the cave mans probable rejection 
of fire as dangerous to his descendants reaction to nuclear energy 
for the same reason 
personally aston had said i think there is no doubt 
that one day man will release and control the atoms almost 
infinite power we cannot prevent him from doing so and can only 
hope that he will not use it exclusively in blowing up his 
nextdoor neighbor 
alex said roosevelt what you are after is to see that 
the nazis dont blow us up 
precisely 
roosevelt turned to his secretary brig gen edwin m pa 
watson pa this requires action then sachs and fdr had a 
snifter of brandy napoleon brandy 
while the national academy of sciences had existed since 1863 
relations between government and science had never been easy even 
in wartime government was a collective enterprise science was the 
lonely figure in a lab with a few assistants after oct 11 1939 
however science and government became inextricably wedded 
particularly by the shotgun wedding exigencies of world war ii 
following his meeting with sachs roosevelt directed dr lyman 
j briggs head of the national bureau of standards to form a 
committee to investigate the potential of fission szilard teller 
and wigner were at the first meeting in washington on oct 21 lt 
col keith f adamson an army ordnance expert said it took two 
years to develop new weapons morale not weapons won wars he 
said 
the army had a standing prize for anyone who could kill with a 
death ray a goat tethered at the armys proving ground in aberdeen 
md he added nobody has claimed the prize yet 
wigner the most tactful of the hugarian conspiracy interjected 
that this was very interesting if morale not weapons won wars 
perhaps one should take a second look at the budget of the army 
and maybe the budget should be cut 
all right all right youll get the money adamson shot 
back 
it was only 6000 and slow in coming at columbia fermi began 
using the money to start building a pile of sooty slippery 
graphite blocks hopefully the first reactor he enlisted the 
muscle of the columbia football team for heavy lifting 
off in the future were pearl harbor fermis historic chain 
reaction in chicago in december 1942 the manhattan project that 
culminated mans long curiosity about atoms and hiroshima and 
nagasaki which raised questions beyond sciences abililty to 
answer in a lab as to where the quest into the invisible world of 
matter had led 
fermi as he had so often in this long pursuit of the atoms 
secret foreshadowed what was to come while the doings of szilard 
and einstein and sachs in the year 1939 were still only question 
marks and little ones at that not long after einsteins letter 
had been delivered the italian scientist was standing high up in 
columbias pupin hall contemplating manhattans skyline 
a little bomb like that and it would all disappear he said 
to himself

had any good pig snouts lately for food writers 
jane and michael stern life is a neverending search along the 
front lines of american gastronomy their reports from the diners 
clam shacks and barbecue pits of the nation celebrate regional fare 
and capture the flavor of a vanishing america 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to get on jane and michael sterns 
wavelength think macaroni and cheese instead of squid ink pasta 
jello not aspic and smores instead of sorbets forget haute 
cuisine think home cookin 
imagine crisscrossing the country from clam shack to catfish 
parlor to barbecue pit picture a neverending search for the 
perfect pig snout sandwich campk bbq st louis or the ideal sugar 
cream pie groves restaurant bloomington ind 
the sterns do this for a living filing dispatches from places 
like mary bobos boardinghouse lynchburg tenn and maurices 
piggy park west columbia sc 
the view from the front lines of american gastronomy is pretty 
much unobstructed i cant think of a single food writer who 
travels except to places like san francisco or new york or on 
junkets with other food writers to other major cities says jane 
nobody else just gets in their car and goes to these stinkpot 
little towns and asks whats for dinner 
it could be tripe soup in philadelphia country ham and redeye 
gravy in nashville rocky mountain oysters in denver cioppino in 
eureka calif 
and save room for dessert indian pudding in new england banana 
pudding in virginia bread pudding in louisiana persimmon pudding 
in illinois the pie pan of beans at lamberts in sikeston 
mo comes with dessert a king edward cigar and a stick of big 
red chewing gum 
unlike most food critics anonymous eaters who slip in and out 
of restaurants incognito the sterns arent at all shy there they 
are about to dig into breakfast on their latest book a taste 
of america a compilation of their weekly column published in 200 
newspapers 
in most of the restaurants we go to when people see us taking 
notes they just assume were from the health department jane 
says 
besides which theres little danger of being recognized at 
say ruth amp jimmies sporting goods and cafe in abbeville miss 
where diners can stock up on live bait before chowing down on fried 
okra 
likewise in the green cinderblock house in sevierville tenn 
where customers pay 5 to troop into gladys breedens kitchen grab 
plates from her cupboard and pile them high with whatever she felt 
like cooking that day 
make no mistake though jane says we wouldnt hang out in 
any old greasy spoon the central charm of a place like gladys is 
that the food is really good 
let other critics fill up on salsa seviche and chocolate mousse 
cake michael stern prefers a really great tuna casserole the 
kind with crumbled potato chips on top jane is partial to that old 
blueplate special the hot turkey sandwich a la wonder bread 
should crushed potato chips seem a trifle passe in this era of 
sundried tomatoes and balsamic vinegar that doesnt bother the 
sterns were very obstinate people says michael we like 
going against the grain 
consider square meals their 1984 cookbook at the height of 
nouvelle cuisine it celebrated the miracle of dry onion soup 
casseroles glamour with a can opener and jello the 
chefs magic powder 
we got annoyed reading articles claiming that the day of the 
meatloaf had passed jane says we realized that food was 
getting ridiculous food writers were so out of touch 
not to mention that nouvelle got on her nerves those tiny 
little portions the rare fish the baby vegetables the 
preciousness of it all 
ironically square meals an affectionate look at americas 
culinary past proved to be ahead of its time it ushered in the 
comfort food era just as roadfood their 1978 guide to 
roadside cuisine presaged a new interest in regional american 
cuisine 
not just food but food in its cultural context is what 
interests the sterns whose accounts whet appetites for the flavor 
of a disappearing america 
theyre stories about people and places department store lunch 
rooms and southern boardinghouses of outmoded ways of fixing 
outdated dishes of the joy of finding blueribbon pies lurking 
behind the rustedshut door to a combination gas stationrestaurant 
that appears to be closed but isnt 
places like the ticktock room or this is it cafe really give 
you a real taste of the region of the people of the heritage of 
the place jane says if you ate at lutece or le cirque youd 
get a taste of france in new york city 
that may be interesting to many other writers but it doesnt 
have the cultural evocativeness and richness that the gladys 
breedens of the world have 
evocative is the word in a taste of america a seattle 
cinnamon roll is a vast spiral of pastry with clods of raisins 
and veins of dark sugar gunk packed into its warm furrows the 
crust of a new haven white clam pizza is a sumptuous mottled ring 
of pliant bready pillowettes 
the problem with being a food writer is its an oxymoron 
says jane food is so interesting the writing gets eclipsed 
people love our books because we can tell them where to go for a 
good inexpensive meal but were also good writers 
the sterns also cover nonfood topics for the new yorker and 
their literary credits include such varied works as elvis 
world a 1987 new york times best seller trucker a portrait 
of the last american cowboy and amazing america a guide to 
such littleknown tourist attractions as the worlds largest or 
second largest ball of twine 
the common thread that runs through our work is that we write 
about things other critics and writers ignore jane says we 
dont write about what life should be we write about what is 
were two east coast ivy league uppermiddleclass 
intellectuals in love with the wrong side of culture she says 
her pensive expression giving way to a devilish grin it gives 
priggish people the shivers

jane the only child of a former concert pianist and a hungarian 
leather salesman grew up in manhattan where i didnt see one 
shred of normal family life when she was 10 her parents hired a 
housekeeper from alabama one of the great southern cooks shed 
make things like cocacolabasted ham and i thought this was great 
new york jewish food it wasnt until i moved away that i realized 
id been wrong 
michael cut his teeth on elaborate jello creations from his 
mothers kitchen in an affluent chicago suburb which accounts for 
his love affair with the chefs magic powder his good grades were 
marred by what passed for a rebellious streak in 1950s winnetka he 
was thrown off the crossing guard squad for beaning a kid with an 
eclair later as a teenager he joined a gang of marauding 
suburban youth we raised heck 
they met at that mecca of radicalism and counterculture yale 
jane still buries her face in a pillow when michael gleefully 
describes her opening line 21 years ago are you a scorpio 
their courtship consisted largely of movies so many that 
michael dropped out of graduate school to fit them all in he later 
got a masters in film at columbia university janes in fine 
arts is from yale 
when the time came to launch their careers i couldnt figure 
out how to do galleries and michael couldnt figure out how to go 
to hollywood and make movies they opted to stay in connecticut 
and play volleyball 
while michael taught at a community college jane drove back and 
forth from their rented house in guilford to new haven to read the 
bulletin board at yales job placement office en route she 
stopped for coffee at a truck stop where i got more and more 
intrigued by the truckers to the point where id take michael with 
me 
for most people the turning point in life is a meaningful job 
offer a relationship with an influential mentor or a decision to 
pursue a longheld dream for the sterns it was a routine browse 
in the 39cent record bin at mammoth mart where they came upon red 
simpsons album hello im a truck 
we realized there was a whole subculture the last cowboys 
says jane but we still didnt know what to do about it 
eventually a friend suggested they write a book eureka with a 
2500 advance from mcgrawhill the sterns headed off on the trail 
of the trucker their photo essay book came out three years later 
as luck would have it trucker ushered in the cb radio craze 
they moved right on to roadfood book no 2 
wed always been eaters says michael while researching 
the trucker book we found all this regional american food we 
realized it was all word ofmouth that there was no catalog or 
listing of great road food places 
they set off in june 1976 with a game plan nothing short of 
brilliant eat in every diner in america then write about the good 
ones 
eight months later they got to new jersey 
time for a new plan 
they began honing their road food radar the ability to separate 
the memorable from the mundane we began looking for sheriffs 
cars or pictures of pigs or cows on roofs that shows 
personality michael says 
we said no to big mondo plastic places with mansard roofs to 
corporate chains with huge laminated menus what intrigued us were 
places that gave evidence of one persons genius old places wacky 
places places with handwritten menus or big round tables where 
everyone knew each other 
they scanned yellow pages eschewing big ads for tiny ones they 
studied billboards shunning any place that said bus tours 
welcome they learned to taste rather than gorge so they could 
check out 10 restaurants in a day 
the more they traveled the more they took note of regional 
specialties the sour cream raisin pie of east iowa a dairyland 
dense pack topped with swirling meringue the indian pudding of 
new england a dark duff with centuries of character in every 
roughgrained spoonful the red beans and rice of new orleans 
each bean a small pillow of creamy silk 
such local dishes have become the sterns breadandbutter 
prompting country journal to dub them the heroes of real american 
food the late james beard called goodfood a book of the 
people and for the people 
after 14 books and countless articles all written jointly and 
with a compatibility rare among collaborators its hard to tell 
who did what anymore jane says we both take credit for the 
good parts 
their biggest difference may be their taste in food we rarely 
eat the same thing for dinner jane says lately all her dinners 
have consisted of the same lowcal dish turkey burgers on pita 
bread penance for past research michael an exercise addict 
diets constantly 
after 15 years on the road they still love to travel though 
their trips tend to be shorter their tolerance for cheap motels 
lower theyre also more selective about where and what they will 
eat 
they concede that the climate surrounding american cuisine is 
becoming more hospitable but still nobody is writing about 
pretzel salad michael says its amazing how much attention 
and care is paid to subtleties in regions of italy and china but 
not here 
jane blames the traditional purpose of food writers to help 
people climb out of the lower middle class and into the upper 
middle class to help people impress others the same thing is true 
of decorator books no one says go out and buy a barcalounger 
there are no barcaloungers at the sterns no velvet paintings 
pink flamingos or any of the other artifacts chronicled in their 
forthcoming epic the encyclopedia of bad taste given their 
passion for cultural oddities their home seems incongruous like 
finding a cache of velveeta in julia childs cupboard 
but wait what have we here 
inside that grand mahogany bookcase are mask and flippers 
the autobiography of lloyd bridges and come in gasman the 
history of the american gas industry the autobiography and 
american industry sections flank the constipation collection the 
culture of the abdomen just to the left of neuroses are your 
glands on friendly terms and poultry the squab register 
just like a social register jane says helpfully except 
its for squabs

party town nearly 30 years ago with connie francis beachblanket 
anthem where the boys are 
with ms francis well into middle age and her version of 
lauderdale little more than a memory reformminded officials and 
outspoken citizens have taken aim at the remaining risque 
diversions saying its time fort lauderdale grew up too 
its not a morality issue its an image issue said city 
commissioner sheila harrigan on oct 3 before the fivemember board 
unanimously passed an ordinance banning liquor from clubs with nude 
entertainment 
the controversial effort to restrict the citys seven adult 
nightclubs is but the latest crusade to tame fort lauderdale into a 
more familyoriented environment and reduce crime 
one reason is that the winter trek of northern tourists more and 
more ends at the wholesome walt disney world in orlando 
its true that disney and the other theme parks are 
competition but were trying to tie into that market says 
francine mason of the greater fort lauderdale convention and 
visitors bureau disney after all doesnt have a beach 
the long stretch of sand was the scene of the first skirmishes 
between those partying college students and police beginning in 
the mid1980s an intense police crackdown ran out spring break an 
annual bacchanal that drew up to 350000 college students to the 
subtropical sun of fort lauderdale 
with spring breakers exiled to daytona beach south padre island 
in texas and other spots fort lauderdale officials have turned 
their attention to the citys seamier side 
gone are the adult bookstores and peep shows pushed across the 
city limits ordinances have been passed to curb radio noise and 
cruising in cars along the beach strip where police vehicles with 
pulsing blue lights are stationed like beacons warning lawbreakers 
to steer clear 
you cannot by legislation make people morally pure and 
holy says the rev james kennedy pastor of fort lauderdales 
coral ridge presbyterian church but government can control the 
baser instincts of man rape and murder are immoral so we have laws 
against them 
were slowly cleansing the city of its notclean elements 
says mayor robert cox 
but critics of the crusade are easy to find 
many merchants along the beach strip a tawdry collection of 
tshirt shops hotels and harddrinking bars have vowed to battle 
a proposal to raze their property for redevelopment as an upscale 
complex of boutiques and cafes similar to the gentrification of 
miami beach about 20 miles south 
the city also has hired consultants and launched an 
international publicrelations campaign boasting plans to upgrade 
its downtown with projects such as a 526 million performing arts 
center and a 29 million science complex officials are considering 
a proposal to add a 64story skyscraper to its growing skyline 
signs are everywhere proclaiming fort lauderdales goal of being 
the best city of its size by 1994 
image thats all i hear is image says dante scola owner 
of the playmate lounge a nude dance club the image i have is of 
a city thats trying to change itself by making a lot of rules 
all of a sudden lauderdale got religion says eric murray 
sitting on a stool at r donuts a coffee shop with topless 
waitresses this town built itself on being a party place you 
take the fun out of lauderdale and youre left with nothing 
even tourism experts have been slow to tout the new fort 
lauderdale 
i wouldnt see fort lauderdale as your typical family 
destination says bill carlson marketing research director for 
holiday corp which owns the holiday inn and embassy suites hotel 
chains when i think of fort lauderdale i think college students 
and spring break 
it seems like the place to go for a good time says julie 
northcutt spokeswoman for the atlanta convention and visitors 
bureau all i know is my father always called it fort 
liquordale 
television cameras also have put the citys serious crime and 
drug problems on display earlier this year the syndicated police 
show cops followed broward county sheriffs deputies though the 
mean streets rarely seen by tourists 
in april city officials withdrew permits for a film documentary 
about a young runaway in fort lauderdale after reviewing the script 
ms mason however notes that a record 35 million vistors came 
to broward county last year with a substantial increase in the 
number of foreign tourists 
they dont have a negative image about fort lauderdale because 
they have never heard of spring break she says 
the contentious nude bar issue could be the turning point in the 
evolution of fort lauderdale 
opponents say the ordinance may set the tone for further 
restrictions on establishments offering latenight hours or 
spectacles such as wet tshirt contests 
mj peter club management which operates two fort lauderdale 
clubs and others from the east coast to honolulu is challenging 
the ordinance as a violation of the clubs first amendment rights 
city officials note the ordinance is fashioned after a daytona 
beach measure which was upheld by the florida supreme court 
theres a lot of case law involving this issue and it seems 
were on solid legal ground says commissioner doug danziger an 
insurance agent and coral ridge church member who introduced the 
antinude bar ordinance he was one of two commissioners to report 
receiving threats during the fourmonth controversy 
even if the court challenge fails the nude bars have threatened 
to counterattack with sleaze peter told commissioners he has 
leases to 18 sites including one next to danzigers office and 
would open steamy alcoholfree sex clubs to make up for lost liquor 
revenue 
its a matter of economics peter said you are creating a 
nightmare for fort lauderdale i will do what i have to to stay 
alive

sister katherine bliss on channel 4 anchoring the news then lili 
goes to work at channel 5 to do the same thing a hot tv rivalry 
no say the sisters we pick each other up said one 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as the news anchor of one midday kansas 
city television news show wraps up her broadcast her sister faces 
the cameras on a rival station 
but lili bliss who anchors the noon news on kctv says she 
doesnt consider her sister a rival even though katherine bliss 
anchors the 1130 am news show on wdaftv 
we want us both to be rated number one she says 
the blisses are believed to be the only sisters in the nation 
who come within 30 minutes of being headtohead rivals on local 
network affiliates 
katherine bliss 28 is finishing her first year at channel 4 
and lili bliss 30 has spent six years with channel 5 
the sisters say they talk almost every day and share ideas about 
their work but both understand their job is to get the most 
interesting guests for their midday interviews 
instead of feeling competitive lili says its a wonderful 
support to have if you have a bad show or a bad day theres 
always someone in the business who understands we pick each other 
up 
its really nice to be able to call up and say boy youll 
never guess what happened today says katherine who is known to 
family and friends as kitty 
the sisters like working in their hometown together outside of 
an occasional mistaken identity they say there are no drawbacks 
to the competition 
while both women have anchor and interview duties lili books 
her own guests because of her 630 am anchor duties katherine 
works closely with producers to arrange her interviews lili wakes 
up watching her sister each morning 
while their lives have taken similar professional paths their 
personal lives are different lili and her lawyer husband have a 
2yearold son curtis and another child due in november 
lili had coanchored the noon and 5 pm newscasts on kctv until 
march but she cut her hours to spend more time with her growing 
family 
katherine is single and jokes that her social life suffers 
because her only free time is in the afternoon 
when the 4 am alarm goes off i groan katherine says 
but then i think well jane pauley has already been up for a 
couple of hours 
dominating 60 minutes of airtime has changed the familys 
viewing habits the sisters say their family watches a lot of 
television their father takes some ribbing but he wont leave his 
office tv for lunch until both midday shows are over 
after growing up together with two older sisters lili and 
katherine can size each other up easily 
lili is very motivated if one dream doesnt work out she 
always has another katherine says and shes very much in 
control of every situtation she has a much calmer response to this 
business 
lili describes her younger sister as very outgoing very 
friendly very relaxed meeting people with a great sense of humor 
im really proud of kitty and what shes done in tv 
lili earned an economics degree from stanford and completed the 
10week summer program at stanfords mass media institute her 
first job was at kolrtv in springfield mo she joined kctv in 
1983 
katherine got a communications degree from tulane then returned 
to kansas city and worked in advertising with lilis 
encouragement in 1983 she also attended the stanford institute 
while there she drove to reno nev to submit her audition 
tape the first two stations turned her down but the news 
director at kcrl offered her a 4anhour job if shed change her 
first name the station was worried that in nevada kitty bliss 
might sound like the wrong kind of working girl 
katherine called lili for advice she was emphatic use your 
real name and take the job 
after nine months in reno katherine spent two years in tulsa 
okla as reporter and weekend anchor at ktul and another two 
years as weekend anchor at ktvi in st louis before she joined wdaf 
a year ago 
she might have sought work in kansas city earlier but feared 
that no station would be interested knowing she was lili bliss 
sister 
wdaf news director joyce reed says she looked at katherine as an 
individual first she is such an energetic enthusiastic 
journalist she says there was no question that she would fit 
well into our organization 
the family ties dont bother reed 
it hasnt made any difference she says katherine has a 
different style viewers accept her as an individual moreover 
reed says ratings have doubled since katherine joined forces with 
weatherman dave dusik on the morning show 
stan carmack lilis channel 5 cohost is equally enthusiastic 
about his partner of six years 
in a business where what we call twinkies are running 
rampant here is a lady who has a professional attitude and is a 
fine journalist 
we have different ideas about how the show should be put 
together and sometimes the discussions get intense but 90 percent 
of the time were pretty much in accord about what goes on and how 
it should go he says and he sees no drawback to the filial 
competition 
its a competitive situation but they are family and they are 
very close we have never encountered any problems with the 
situation 
and there is no end in sight to the blissful competition with 
both sisters saying they are where they want to work 
with satellite hookups i can go anywhere or get an interview 
from anywhere lili said 
ive done my moving agrees katherine

they usually begin confronting the law on their 
own behalf but they often end up taking care of other cases for 
fellow prisoners overwhelmed by the legal apparatus joyce dixson 
is a dramatic case in point shes one of the jailhouse lawyers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
inmates follow joyce dixson everywhere 
to the bathroom to the dining hall to her cell 
her legal knowledge has her in such demand that she feels there 
are too few hours in the day to get everything done even as she 
serves life in prison without chance of parole shes paying for 
her education dearly 
an attractive 38yearold mother of two she has spent the last 
14 years behind bars for shooting her pimp her own case seems 
hopeless so she works for her fellow inmates 
but it was the sense of having been wrongly used that drove her 
to study law 
she has appealed several times winning three times in the 
michigan court of appeals on different issues but the appeals were 
overturned in state and federal courts and the us supreme court 
she says refused to rule on it 
as a child in saginaw mich she would watch her future pass 
i used to sit on my porch when i was a little girl and watch 
him go by with a cadillac full of girls that was the exciting 
glamorous life the heroes of the neighborhood were those people 
with money and big cars 
i graduated from high school and i had good jobs i worked at 
gmac at the bank at krogers but as long as i was home in the 
neighborhood whatever i got was never enough my mother was on 
welfare i got caught up in his sweet talk i can show you a 
better way 
i was off and running and i didnt even know where i was 
going its so easy to be manipulated when you want to believe what 
you hear 
she worked for the pimp as a prostitute for three or four years 
she didnt work the streets he hooked her up directly with men he 
knew wanted a pretty woman to waste their money on 
i could not take it anymore it got to the point where i said 
joyce are you going to be a burned out whore and a dope fiend the 
rest of your life or are you going to get out you have to make a 
decision at the time that seemed like the only one to make 
i had been in his house for three days and i wanted to go 
home i was full of cocaine and he just kept feeding me more 
cocaine i was paranoid and he wouldnt let me out he had another 
woman there the cocaine told me i had to get out he was talking 
to a friend on the phone and i just shot him and left 
looking back dixson says i knew somebody was going to shoot 
him some day im just sorry it was me people try to make it sound 
like he was a poor helpless man and what i did was such a 
horrendous thing but i know im not that kind of person for that 
20 to 30 seconds they have completely judged me as a coldblooded 
murderer and im not that 
dixson is much like other jailhouse lawyers their interest 
in law is sparked by hope of their own vindication but they derive 
hope and meaning and often a few bucks from helping their 
colleagues get released or have their sentences reduced 
by the time indigent inmates realize theyve lost their right to 
courtappointed attorneys they have nobody to turn to on appeal 
besides the people who have taken it upon themselves to learn law 
many women inmates are involved in custody and divorce battles 
and male prisoners more and more are seeking visitation rights with 
children on the outside 
a simple letter from the courts is so hard for some of them to 
read a lot of them are embarrassed says anita alcorta another 
jailhouse lawyer in the florencecrane womens facility in 
coldwater she learned english as a second language as well as the 
intricacies of law 
dixson says im one of only three prisoners in the state to 
be accepted at the university of michigan all that wouldnt have 
happened if i had stayed out there 
yet trust in jailhouse lawyers can lead to disappointment and 
retaliation says james jourdan 43 who is serving eight years in 
the state prison of southern michigan for shoplifting 
ninetyfive percent of the jailhouse lawyers are not by any 
stretch of the imagination competent to represent someone a lot of 
people are pretending to know the law to take from the less 
fortunate says jourdan who claims to have about 40 cases 
pending before courts 
some have been stabbed for not representing other prisoners 
too well here the remedy is quick justice 
about 59 percent of the 2666 cases filed in the michigan 
supreme court last year were criminal cases and about half of 
those were filed without an attorney says corbin davis clerk of 
the high court

it can get expensive for the state i win 97 percent of all of 
them says state attorney general frank kelley who spends 72 
percent of his 23 million budget defending the state against 
prisoner claims 
the 18 lawyers in his corrections division are more than those 
assigned to the criminal or environmental divisions 
some of the suits are just plain nuisances 
take the case of the crushed twinkies when an inmate purchased 
the creamfilled cakes the worker who packed his purchase put them 
at the bottom of the bag the inmate sued the state for refusing to 
give him replacement twinkies the litigation cost the state a few 
thousand dollars 
others that fall in the frivolous category involve a refused 
demand for a haircut an orange that an inmate was prohibited from 
taking from the cafeteria he claimed he was refused medical 
attention for want of the vitamin c and a sex offender who wanted 
to see the personnel files of female prison guards under the 
freedom of information act 
more notorious was a man undergoing a sex change at the time of 
his imprisonment who is suing the state for refusing him the sex 
hormones to continue his transformation 
paralegal classes are offered periodically at all community 
colleges that offer prison courses many inmates teach themselves 
or absorb legal knowledge from other inmates who frequent prison 
libraries 
yet dixson says a prisoner in court without attorney 
representation often is looked down upon 
in prison inmate paralegals can write briefs and file appeals 
but they cant leave prison to represent someone other than 
themselves in court they must put up with slow mail to research 
materials to appeal a case 
regardless of the barriers some jailhouse lawyers are excellent 
attorneys says george krause a retired attorney who teaches 
inmates at two ionia facilities through montcalm county community 
college 
some of them are better than the lawyers they had before they 
got put in there he says 
dixson claims her attorney was a longtime friend of the man she 
shot and a customer as well she says she didnt know that until 
she was in the county jail but courts ruled it did not prejudice 
her case 
thats one of the reasons i learned so much about the law when 
i got in here 
some knowledgeable inmates work for prison legal services inc 
of michigan a nonprofit corporation required by court order and 
housed at the jackson prison the staff is comprised of 14 prison 
paralegals and two civilian attorneys including director sandra 
girard 
the unit assists prisoners in preparing pleadings except for 
cases filed against the department 
william g ramsey regarded by his cohorts as among the best 
jailhouse lawyers specializes in murder cases because it helps him 
to prepare for his own appeal to be filed this month he has 
written arguments in numerous cases that have been reversed 
one involved a motorcycle gang member convicted of killing two 
women who wandered into its club another involved a man accused of 
beheading another person 
hes opposed to most civil suits filed in prison prison is a 
cancer and you cant cure it by suing it 
most inmate lawyers deny taking money for their services because 
its forbidden but it does happen everything from cigarettes to 
cash and marijuana passing hands 
despite frustration in their own cases the jailhouse lawyers 
plow forward to help those who need it there is some altruism 
it was meant for me to help certain people that cant help 
themselves says victoria hollis a 40yearold illinois native 
who lived in benton harbor mich a year before killing her 
husband i have a gift where i can understand and i can do the 
legal work i have to share it and help whoever i can get out of 
here 
for joyce dixson there is a kind of vindication in her work 
yet she remains haunted by what happened and by the man she killed 
he was a big fish in a little pond he was the biggest drug 
dealer he was the biggest pimp he was very careful about how he 
did things lets just say he was not a nice man 
i was out there on those streets and i never should have been 
i got caught up out there 
im sorry hes dead because im here and ive missed so much 
of my childrens lives her sons 21 and 19 were raised by her 
mother but im whole im not a dope fiend im not used up and 
im getting an education

daniel manvilles distinction in the legal 
community stems from something he did long before he was admitted 
to the state bar of michigan he served time for manslaughter 
over the years manvilles reputation has grown in a way state 
officials would just as soon forget his devotion to suing the 
state on behalf of inmates and prison guards 
and the detroit lawyer would like to start a law firm comprised 
solely of exoffenders 
when i left prison i really had a jump hey i was white and 
by then i had two bachelors degrees says manville who hires 
excons as paralegals in his office 
it wasnt easy for me but compared with other people i guess 
it was i felt that something had to be done ive always been 
someone who got involved in causes 
isnt there a rule against allowing felons to become lawyers 
as a constitutional matter theres no offense a person can 
commit that would forever preclude them from practicing law says 
dennis path chief investigator of the michigan bar 
the question we have to ask is are they rehabilitated were 
concerned about present good moral character manville demonstrated 
he was likely to serve the public in a fair open honest manner 
hes made all the right moves 
manvilles conviction arose from a december 1972 drugrelated 
slaying then a student at the flint branch of the university of 
michigan manville his brother and another student traveled to 
mount pleasant to settle a score with a rival they believed had 
stolen money and drugs from them manville used chloroform to knock 
out two men and one of them died 
manville a natty dresser of 42 with a neatly trimmed beard was 
allowed to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter instead of the 
murder charges on which he was indicted 
during his more than three years and four months in the state 
prison of southern michigan at jackson manville completed his 
college degree and earned a second a fascination with the legal 
profession led him to become a prolific jailhouse lawyer 
he obtained books that explained legal research and criminal law 
in a nutshell he experimented with other inmates cases his own 
was futile because he pleaded guilty 
theres a lot of demand he says but prisoners have a 
very short attention span one day theyre screaming to sue and the 
next they forget all about it 
after his 1976 parole manvilles activities included working 
for the head start program for the disadvantaged in lansing 
interning at a chicago program to combat racial bias writing a 
couple of books and then earning a masters degree in criminal 
justice in 1979 he enrolled in the nowdefunct antioch law school 
in washington dc 
manvilles attorneys stating his case for the admissions review 
boards for the bars in michigan and in washington dc were 
unable to cite another case in which someone became a lawyer after 
killing someone 
manville waited several years before the panels approved him in 
the interim he worked for the american civil liberties unions 
national prison project 
its not easy im not encouraging every exoffender to do 
it says manville who lives in downtown detroit because he likes 
to be in the thick of city activity he carries a load of about 70 
cases and is chairman of the bars prisons and corrections 
committee he recently was asked to make a presentation to a 
legislative committee 
state officials can name only four exfelons who are practicing 
law in michigan two of whom prefer to keep their past in the past 
the fourth georgia manzie was admitted to the michigan bar this 
year and said she wants to save her story for a book

gerald mcraney thought it was time to get 
into uniform after seven years as laidback detective rick simon on 
simon amp simon 
id wanted to do a show about somebody in the service to show 
the human side says mcraney who stars in the new cbs comedy 
major dad 
id gotten fed up with people in the service being portrayed 
as bumbling fools or rambos i have a lot of friends and relatives 
in the service theyre just ordinary people i wanted to do a 
sitcom i couldnt face the rigorous schedule of doing another hour 
show 
mcraney plays marine maj john d macgillis in major dad 
which opens cbs monday night comedy block his new bride delta 
burkeis one of the stars of designing women which follows 
later in the evening 
unlike rick simon macgillis is ramrod straight neat from his 
pressed uniform to his polished boots and has his receding hair cut 
so short he almost looks bald 
macgillis a conservative career officer marries a liberal 
newspaper reporter who is a widow with three daughters the 
longtime bachelor a man long used to an environment of men 
suddenly finds himself surrounded by women the majors wife 
polly is played by shanna reed 
polly may be liberal but shes steeped in a lot of 
oldfashioned ideals mcraney says rearing her children has 
top priority with her but the shows about more than just a 
nuclear family most of the stories take place in the home 
you knew that ozzie nelson was a band leader from the radio 
show but on television you never knew what he did for a living 
here you see mac at work some of it takes place at his office 
and the marine corps is a family too 
macgillis is a hardnose which is the nature of the business 
but hes also very good at what he does mcraney portrays him as a 
man whos dedicated and cares about his job and the people he works 
with he sees the major as a man whose skills would allow him to 
take a much higherpaying civilian job he remains in the marine 
corps out of patriotism and a sense of duty 
on simon amp simon televised by cbs from 198188 mcraney 
played the offbeat casually dressed half of the brotherdetective 
team in fact rick simon almost reached the point of being lazy 
he rode around in an old pickup truck and lived on a houseboat 
aj simon played by jameson parker was conservative cleancut 
and aggressive 
i have mixed emotions about simon amp simon ending he says 
its time was due but i miss working with the people well most 
of the crews on major dad i miss working with jameson im 
thinking of having him come in the show as my liberal 
brotherinlaw maybe an attorney for the aclu 
mcraney says if he had to define himself he would say hes a 
conservative im a registered democrat he says but im a 
conservative in that i believe in conserving ideals and values that 
have proven correct some people say thats rigid but theres a 
big difference 
mcraney was born in mississippi and began working as an actor in 
new orleans before moving to los angeles his first job here was on 
an episode of night gallery after that came roles on the 
rockford files and gunsmoke before landing a starring role on 
simon amp simon 
he met delta burke when he did a guest role on an episode of 
designing women he played dash goff one of the former 
husbands of her character suzanne sugarbaker 
i dont see how i could go back on designing women again 
with both of us working he says i told them the only way i 
could go back as dash with this marine haircut was that i could 
explain hes taking chemotherapy 
besides delta and i have been busy getting married and 
honeymooning we bought a place in pasadena were still thinking 
about buying a house in the south since were both from the south 
they are developing a television movie called love and 
curses in which they would play a couple in the manner of the 
thin man 
the idea for major dad came up when mcraney was still on 
simon amp simon 
we went through a lot of proposals mcraney says he was 
going to be the widowed father of three we decided that was a 
bummer then we decided he should marry a widow of three thats 
less depressing he was always in the marine corps we thought of 
making him a drill instructor i thought he should be an officer 
because a di is too much of a stereotype you know the image of 
barking at the children we picked the rank of major because of my 
age which is 42

julius rudel a conductor of classical music who 
is making his broadway debut jumped at the chance to conduct 3 
penny opera 
rudel who headed the new york city opera for 22 years and this 
fall divides his time between broadway and the metropolitan opera 
wasnt looking for new worlds to conquer when he accepted the job 
he did it he says because i think kurt weill is one of the 
most important 20th century composers i felt it was very important 
to make the right approach to this german theater music of the 
1920s the style which is not as well known here when i was asked 
whether i would do it i really jumped at it 
the style is elusive and prone to abuses you cant perform it 
like you do american jazz weill was such a careful composer he 
wrote things down exactly you cant do it with the freedom you can 
use in his later american music this is slightly squarish german 
jazz of the 20s 
it doesnt have the rubato tempo fluctuations feeling when 
you hear sinatra he goes around bending a phrase and comes out 
right at the end thats not quite the style that applies to the 
german compositions of weill 
the current production of 3 penny opera starring sting is 
playing at the luntfontanne theater 
weill who wrote 3 penny in 1928 left germany in 1933 for 
paris and moved to new york two years later when he was 35 his 
composing took on a french style in paris and an american style in 
new york 3 penny opera remains his mostplayed work 
it has done an incredible victory march through the world 
rudel says 
rudel began his studies at the vienna academy of music moved 
from his native city to new york when he was 19 and finished at the 
mannes college of music 
the conductor has had in his manhattan livingroom a jan de ruth 
painting from 3 penny opera since the early days of the 1950s 
offbroadway production which starred lotte lenya 
in 3 penny nine musicians are onstage above and behind the 
actors with six more in the wings the composers orchestrations 
are used actors get their musical cues from rudel via 
closedcircuit television 
rudel says that this production tries to go back to the 
creators original intent were doing all the music some of it 
was not even done at the premiere one person refused to sing one 
of the songs thought it was too dirty theres a takeoff of an 
aria thats funny and wonderful that weill never orchestrated 
lotte lenya as lucy couldnt handle it 
and theres some additional music during scene changes which 
rudel is proud of providing weill had indicated that he wanted 
certain continuity music almost thematic he says that was 
his answer to wagner without the pomposity ive done all the 
continuity all taken from his own music i didnt compose anything 
there were some marginal notes on the page proof of the first 
libretto about using the mack the knife song as a waltz but the 
music doesnt exist for that i went through the parts of the 
original either they improvised or they didnt play it 
i have written it out a mack the knife waltz happens 
whenever he escapes then when he is brought to jail for the final 
time it is heard as a dirge there is indication for that too 
in 1928 the opening musical notes were played by an 
organgrinder on a hurdygurdy rudel has recreated that by having 
a synthesizer in the wings send the music into an onstage 
hurdygurdy those are the creative things that give me special

as in other parts of the world the years 
of cold war confrontation between the united states and the soviet 
union appear to be ending in africa 
no more do the superpowers contest vigorously and openly for 
supremacy in the strategic horn of africa which controls eastern 
access to the red sea 
less and less can client states and insurgencies count on an 
abundant flow of money arms and other support from the worlds two 
mightiest nations 
washington and moscow have worked in tandem to try to end a 
civil war in angola and bring independence to namibia and their 
official utterances on apartheid in south africa sound remarkably 
alike 
but while the growing rapprochement between the old adversaries 
bodes well for some african countries it does not signal automatic 
peace and prosperity for the vast continent as a whole 
africans are perfectly capable of spilling each others blood 
without help said a western diplomat based in relatively 
tranquil kenya 
even if one could stamp out the effects of war mismanagement 
and corruption overnight the economies of most african countries 
would still take years and years to recover 
the vast majority of those economies have slipped backward 
throughout the 1980s a decade of healthy growth in much of the 
rest of the world 
because they were never highly advanced in the first place even 
the unlikely prospect of full fast economic recovery would leave 
most african countries far behind the developed nations 
and even as the united states and the soviet union appear to be 
rethinking the cost and need for strategic advantage in africa the 
potential for conflict remains high between and within many of the 
continents nations 
just a few months ago peace seemed to be blooming like a desert 
rose in africa nourished by a gentle rain of good works from 
moscow and washington 
a ceasefire was negotiated between warring factions in angola 
a bitter costly conflict in mozambique appeared headed for the 
conference table a new military regime seized power in sudan with 
a promise to end that countrys civil war and the ethiopian 
government sat down with eritrean rebels in a bid to end what at 28 
years is the continents oldest armed dispute 
in recent weeks however those visions of peace have faded like 
a saharan mirage 
despite admonishments from moscow and washington fierce new 
fighting erupted in angola between the sovietbacked government and 
rebels supported by the united states 
preliminary peace talks between church leaders representing 
mozambiques marxist government and rightwing renamo guerrillas 
came to naught 
ethiopias marxist government publicly urged to seek peace and 
threatened with an arms cutoff by moscow came under new 
threatening attack by tigrean rebels even as it sought terms with 
the secessionist eritreans 
civil war in sudan is flaring anew with little hope of quick 
resolution 
new conflicts unrelated to the superpowers also have erupted 
intercommunal violence between arabs in mauritania and blacks in 
senegal took hundreds of lives in those neighboring west african 
countries which continue to hurl insults and threats at each other 
rival clans seeking power in somalia which forms the very tip 
of east africas strategic horn are killing each other in disputes 
that date back to ancient clashes over water holes and grazing 
territories 
still there are a few bright spots and some hopeful signs 
namibia appears well on the path to independence in a 
usbrokered scheme that also brought the shortlived ceasefire 
in angola 
most diplomats feel the renewed fighting in angola will end 
soon with washington pressuring jonas savimbi who leads the rebel 
national union for the total independence of angola to return to 
the bargaining table with president eduardo dos santos 
lasting peace in angola could bring a real measure of prosperity 
to the former portuguese colony an abundantly fertile land rich in 
oil gas diamonds iron ore and other minerals 
few african countries are as potentially wealthy as angola poor 
to begin with and suffering variously or collectively from years of 
colonial neglect intertribal conflicts falling world prices for 
their basic exports wars and famines many have compounded their 
problems through mismanagement 
in the years after world war ii when most of africa began 
shaking off the colonial yoke country after country turned to 
marxistleninist theory for economic guidance in almost every 
case that guidance led to ruin 
today even such avowedly marxist states as angola mozambique 
tanzania and zimbabwe are turning toward freemarket policies 
adopting stringent economic controls and lining up for loans from 
those twin bastions of capitalism the world bank and the 
international monetary fund 
investors however are not exactly stumbling over each other in 
a chase for african profits thats especially true in the majority 
of countries without proven deposits of oil or minerals 
even stable countries like kenya which rejected the socialist 
path when it gained independence from britain 26 years ago are 
having trouble attracting major foreign investments 
in general terms the continent lacks infrastructure and a 
welleducated work force said the nairobibased western 
diplomat african countries find themselves competing for 
investment dollars with the likes of taiwan korea singapore and 
the other emerging nations of asia and they are woefully behind in 
what they can offer in return 
nor can africas nations look to much increased aid in trying to 
build the schools highways and reliable power and communications 
systems they need to successfully compete in an increasingly 
complex world 
faced with budget constraints the united states gave all of the 
nations of subsahara africa 743 million last year or an average 
of about 20 million each thats less than congress approved for 
the contra rebels in nicaragua 
the soviet union having serious economic troubles of its own 
gave virtually nothing beyond military supplies to a few client 
states 
the 12 nations of the european economic community japan and 
other donors provided about 13 billion much of which went for 
such bare essentials as food and improved water supplies most 
economists do not believe the overall aid figures will increase 
significantly through the 1990s 
john barratt director of the independent south african 
institute of international affairs in johannesburg sums up the 
effect of superpower rapprochement on africa in these words 
in spite of the new and hopeful international mood including 
in our region of africa one has to recognize that not one of the 
regional conflicts in different parts of the world has yet been 
resolved euphoria is therefore premature

except on rare occasions tibet is closed to 
foreign reporters but the writer who is based in beijing 
traveled there recently with a tour group 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
an elderly monk slips out of earshot of the 
chinese soldiers nearby and whispers to a western tour group 
chinese soldiers killed many people and arrested many always 
remember tibet 
as the group proceeds on its sightseeing an 88yearold tibetan 
approaches and says many people are in prison 
please help us he says tell the people of your countries 
to help us bring the dalai lama back 
the dalai lama the tibetans spiritual leader fled into exile 
with tens of thousands of others after an antichinese uprising was 
crushed in 1959 
last march the chinese authorities declared martial law after 
another antichinese outburst and lhasa today is a city controlled 
by chinese arms and divided by suspicion and hatred 
the antagonisms are clearly evident even to the tourists who 
come to see the exquisite buddhist monasteries and temples and the 
rugged mountains set against the cobaltblue himalayan sky 
a driver told by a soldier that the chinese had banned 
unauthorized vehicles from entering a monastery compound shouts 
back what do you mean chinese this is tibet 
a 72yearold farmwoman her white hair braided down her back 
says that before the chinese came in 1950 we were free and happy 
now we are not happy we hear bad things about the government 
asked about the dalai lama the woman cries and says i pray 
each day for his return 
western and tibetan sources said people gathered in the central 
square in midoctober after word reached them that the dalai lam 
had won the 1989 nobel peace prize they celebrated with the ritual 
throwing of tsampa a tibetan food made of flour and roasted 
barley 
the next day police apparently fearing trouble banned foreign 
tourists from the square but they made no arrests as they did in 
september when several nuns were detained for calling for tibetan 
independence during a religious festival 
lhasa a city of 160000 at an altitude of 11772 feet has been 
under martial law since march 8 when troops were called in to 
quell the fourth major proindependence antichinese uprising 
since autumn 1987 
an estimated 20 to 30 people were killed in the march rioting 
and hundreds are believed to have been arrested 
the military has a far more dominant presence in lhasa than in 
beijing chinas capital which has been under martial law since 
may 20 because of the prodemocracy demonstrations 
tourists coming to lhasa see the effects of martial law as soon 
as they arrive 
at the airport armed guards check the travel permits of all 
foreigners this tour group saw soldiers all along the airport 
road including one taking shots at birds with his ak47 rifle 
silver metal sentry boxes with armed soldiers have been set up 
on streets leading to lhasas central square the barkhor the 
flashpoint of previous demonstrations soldiers were on guard at 
all lanes leading off the barkhor bazaar which circles the jokhang 
temple tibets holiest place of worship 
one group of a dozen soldiers drilled in the square outside the 
jokhang temple on several instances crouching in formation and 
aiming their rifles in the direction of the shrine where 
worshippers prostrate themselves and hawkers sell photographs of 
the dalai lama 
buddhist monks the leaders of the proindependence uprisings 
are kept under close surveillance military checkpoints stop all 
people coming in and out of the main monasteries a monk at the 
sera monastery said its monks couldnt leave the compound for three 
months after the march demonstrations 
at the drepung monastery a monk said the monks there celebrated 
the awarding of the nobel peace prize to the dalai lama by reading 
scriptures because they couldnt go to the city 
were surrounded by military he said weve been fighting 
the chinese for two years now but we are afraid they have weapons 
we dont 
monks who had been imprisoned for rioting said they had been 
kicked beaten and hit with electric prods 
a monk at the jokhang temple said its monks also had to undergo 
long hours of political sessions in which officials read documents 
and warned them against further demonstrating 
its terrible its not interesting he said 
the numbers of tibetan religious pilgrims and foreign tourists 
are both down because of restrictions on entering lhasa foreign 
tourists who can now visit lhasa in organized groups of three or 
more are not allowed to enter residential neighborhoods or go out 
on the streets without a guide 
tourists arriving at the airport are handed a notice in 
ungrammatical english warning that they shall not spread the 
words which is harmful to our national dignity sovereignty 
territorial integrity or interference in our internal affairs 
shall not distribute the books periodicals pictures audio and 
video products and other propaganda articles which is harmful to 
the country 
the holiday inn lhasa hotel is only about 10 percent occupied 
these days and many small hotels catering to young backpackers 
who have disappeared with the ban on individual travel have shut 
down 
tourism which brought 43000 people to the remote mountain 
region in 1987 had been seen by the chinese as one way to lift 
tibet out of poverty and thus reduce antichinese sentiments 
the chinese communists in beijing which claims tibet has been 
an inalienable part of china for 700 years sent the army into 
tibet in 1950 and made it part of china 
tibetan resentment against rule by the chinese han majority 
heightened during mao tsetungs 196676 cultural revolution when 
radical red guards rampaged through buddhist temples destroying 
scriptures and religious statues and throwing monks into prison 
religious believers were persecuted and the tibetan language and 
customs suppressed 
in the past decade chinese authorities have tried to make 
amends by restoring temples and encouraging the keeping of local 
traditions compared to tibets former feudal society real strides 
have been made in transportation health and literacy 
almost all countries of the world recognize chinese sovereignty 
over tibet even the dalai lama in a proposal made last year but 
rejected by beijing said china could station troops in tibet and 
oversee its foreign affairs in exchange for autonomy 
but it is evident that almost all tibetans oppose the chinese 
regardless of improvements in their living conditions 
tibetans resent what they perceive as chinese corruption as 
well as the lack of good jobs for tibetans and the encroachment of 
han or chinese residents in lhasa foreign residents of lhasa 
say up to 70 percent of lhasas population is now han according 
to foreign and tibetan sources 
getting ahead all depends on how you can speak chinese said 
a tibetan intellectual we are angry but theres nothing we can 
do about it

out here in the provinces living is a 
bit easier as moammar gadhafis libya drifts slowly toward 
liberalism 
controls are looser in business human rights even television 
dallas is shown nightly on the nonpropaganda station 
the government is backing away from some of gadhafis more 
radical positions such as his burning of books in english and 
french to underscore his call for sole use of arabic 
the governnment also allows some public dissent although 
security men still monitor meetings 
but there are contradictions 
for instance private business and industry discouraged until 
mid1987 now are allowed provided capitalist exploitation is 
avoided and nobody works for anybody else 
partners not wageearners is a slogan taken from the 
philosophy gadhafi enunciated in his third universal theory known 
as the green book the theory which is promoted as an alternative 
to capitalism and socialism holds that people should rule 
themselves without formal government 
but the partners rule is easily worked around said one 
benghazi shopkeeper named ahmed people write that their 
employees are partners and they get the permit for production or 
industry 
while private enterprise no longer is taboo stores still must 
buy their supplies from the government in order to restrict the use 
of foreign currency 
however that has brought about a flourishing black market much 
of it centered in this mediterranean port of 600000 people 360 
miles east of the capital tripoli 
typically the deals involve libyan and egyptian 
blackmarketeers and start 135 miles farther east at mersa matruh 
in egypt a brisk exchange has developed there egyptians seeking 
work in libya buy libyan dinars with otherwise nonconvertible 
egyptian pounds and libyan sellers use the pounds for egyptian 
goods to smuggle home 
benghazis small stores and grocery markets sell a lot of 
foreign goods from british chocolates to turkish and egyptian 
clothing smuggled from ships or across the egyptian border 310 
miles to the east 
some benghazi stores remain closed although fewer than in the 
early 1980s when gadhafi tried to close down small enterprises in 
their place he built multistory government supermarkets that 
became notorious for their lack of merchandise 
shelves are lessoften bare now but goods are mostly mediocre 
these shoes wont do complained one customer mohammed 
looking at a row of footwear from eastern europe they wont last 
my son a day 
mohammed as did other people interviewed did not want to be 
fully identified 
like all libyan children mohammeds son attends an 
arabiclanguage public school he will learn english only in the 
last two years of high school but if he goes on to a university to 
become an engineer or a doctor he will find his classes will be 
taught in english 
baqer a secondyear engineering student said this makes it 
very difficult for us were suddenly faced with words and terms 
weve never heard of 
arabicization has virtually obliterated public evidence of 
foreign culture in benghazi only a few airline offices and a 
single art gallery have names in english on the front 
crime and punishment also are looked at in a different light in 
todays libya 
gadhafi the leader of the revolution made a big show in 
march 1988 of driving a bulldozer into the walls of a tripoli 
prison to free 400 convicts 
i am not a jailer he proclaimed 
everybody would go free he said except prisoners accused of 
conspiring with foreign governments 
at the same time gadhafi reined in his enforcers the 
revolutionary committees telling them to stop making people 
disappear and that only police with warrants can make arrests 
things are loosening up said grocer youssef in his 
sidestreet store as long as we keep away from discussing 
politics were ok 
the londonbased human rights agency amnesty international noted 
improvements after gadhafis 1988 moves but it said early this 
year that about 90 moslem fundamentalists whom gadhafi has accused 
of working for the us central intelligence agency were rounded 
up and have been held incommunicado since 
libyan opposition figures say that the number is much higher and 
that gadhafi held more than 100 political prisoners even after his 
bulldozer episode 
aly abdelsalam a revolutionary committee member who works in 
benghazis green book center insists there has been no change in 
the committees duties 
im happy to devote my life and soul to the ideals of moammar 
gadhafi he said 
such are the sentiments libyans hear on the governments 
television channel which competes with the station that runs 
dallas the governments tv menu features news in arabic 
national songs educational material and frequent reminders of 
gadhafis revolutionary achievements 
one which touched benghazians closely is a tape extolling the 
7000 units project huge apartment buildings scattered about 
the city 
the completed apartments remained empty for months enmeshed in 
red tape until this past september when potential tenants crashed 
down the doors and occupied them residents say police began 
roughing up the squatters and shooting at their cars until gadhafi 
ordered them left alone 
while the governments tv fare wins the hearts and minds of 
bureaucrats it doesnt seem likely to win over many libyans 
shopkeeper yasser said he hopes dallas and the british 
nature films and grade b detective series shown on the channel 
arent taken off 
theyre the only things worth watching he said 
an information ministry official maintained that dallas is 
screened for the tens of thousands of foreigners in libya 
most are east european businessmen or south koreans and thais 
working on construction projects like ghadafis great manmade 
river 
at a time of greatly reduced income from oil basically libyas 
only source of hard currency gadhafi has had to cut back on many 
projects 
not so on the river his 24 billion pet proclaimed as the 
eighth wonder and miracle of the 20th century 
as designed the artificial river will spring from a huge lake 
or aquifer beneath the desert in southern libya 
entering pipes from 270 wells the water will flow into an 
enormous reservoir at an oasis ajdabiya 100 miles south of 
benghazi from there pipelines will distribute the water to the 
watershort coast far to the north where most of libyas 4 million 
people live 
the aquifer is so big we believe its sufficient for more 
than a thousand years at the present rate of consumption said 
the project chief mohammed elmangoush 
on sept 11 the first gush of water into the pipes leading to 
ajdabiyas reservoir was celebrated with folk dancing and patriotic 
songs on nationwide television 
libyans rejoiced as the water reached ajdabiya 
this shows that the project is a success remarked a 
benghazi shopkeeper who said he dislikes most of gadhafis 
policies the water actually came in all the way from the 
aquifer 
but what he and other television viewers were not told is that 
according to engineers at the oasis the water was not from the new 
system but from old wells presumably to coincide with the 
celebrations of the 20th anniversary of gadhafis revolution

the little mermaid 
 
every once in a while a movie so special so lovely so 
exciting funny charming entertaining and heartwarming spins out 
from hollywoods celluloid web its a moment to cherish a moment 
to embrace 
the little mermaid is worth embracing dozens of times its 
a rhapsody of animated excellence a symphony that never loses its 
polish or grace 
based on the hans christian andersen story the musical is the 
first animated feature based on a fairy tale from walt disney 
pictures since sleeping beauty reached theaters on jan 29 
1959 
composer alan menken and lyricist howard ashman who combined on 
little shop of horrors provide versatile enjoyable tunes from 
ballads to calypsos 
no one does it like disney and disney truly does it best the 
drawings and backgrounds are richly textured and brilliantly 
colored and tinted animation techniques incorporate the smallest 
and most insignificant nuance and detail breathing life to both 
the sea world creatures and the humans above 
the disney characters move not with the plodding awkwardness of 
cartoon creatures but with all the alacrity of live actors when 
the mermaid ariel moves through the sea there is an actual sense 
of water motion of flotation her ruby hair fans out as she bobs 
in place her tail eases through currents and actually propels 
sebastian the crab skitters sideways on tiny claws and shoots 
through the water with tiny legs moving like crazy 
a storm at sea moves with the slashing ferocity of a reallife 
squall evening is misty and gray the amber glow of lanterns 
illuminates the deck and crew at night diamondlike fireworks 
sparkle in the midnight blue sky 
the disney animators led by mark henn glen keane duncan 
marjoribanks ruben aquino andreas deja and matthew ocallaghan 
really did their homework and understand the physics of swimming 
floating flying 
the team of more than 400 artists and technicians spent more 
than three years on the project with 150000 painted cels and 
1100 backgrounds utilizing more than 1000 colors in the end 
they produced 7000 feet of handdrawn film 
the little mermaid tackles the tough balance between parents 
and children and a teenagers coming of age ariel is a headstrong 
16yearold who loves adventure and longs to be a part of the human 
world she spends her days combing the bottom of the sea with her 
chubby fish pal flounder searching for small treasures from 
shipwrecks a fork or a pipe mean more to her than costly baubles 
one evening she goes to the surface despite her fathers 
repeated warnings climbs the hull of a schooner sees the 
handsome prince eric and immediately falls in love 
but whats a poor mermaid to do he cant live underwater with 
her and she cant live in his world without legs 
after a severe reprimand from her father king triton ariel 
strikes a bargain with the evil sea witch ursula agreeing to give 
up her beautiful voice so she can have legs for three days but if 
the prince doesnt kiss her within that time shell become a 
mermaid once again and be ursulas lackey forever 
the andersen story has a grim ending but the disney world is a 
happy one and lessons can be learned with a little sugar just as 
well as with vinegar 
the movie is peppered with humor and sea world asides dont 
be such a guppy ariel admonishes flounder when he tells her hes 
afraid of sharks 
the voice talent includes stage actress jodi benson smile 
welcome to the club as ariel rene auberjonois coco 
big river as louis the temperamental cook pat carroll as

the bear 
 
jeanjacques annaud is one of those rare filmmakers who refuse 
to accept any limitations of the storytelling potential of the 
screen in quest for fire he created a convincing picture of 
prehistoric man employing no understandable dialogue in the 
name of the rose he converted umbert ecos novel into a darkly 
colored murder mystery of the medieval church 
annauds the bear stars a 9foot oneton kodiak bear and an 
irresistible fluffbundle of a cub their grunts whimpers and 
bellows occupy 90 percent of the soundtrack the rest is the spare 
dialogue of the bear hunters the film is a magnificent achievement 
that will have delighted moviegoers wondering how on earth did 
they do that 
how annaud and his inspired crew did it seems to have been a 
combination of eternal patience and blind luck with a dash of jim 
hensons animatronics for scenes in which the animals are 
injured whatever the film magicians did the performances by bart 
and douce the two stars should be studied at the actors studio 
based on the grizzly king james oliver curwoods 1916 
novel the bear is set in british columbia it was shot in the 
austrian and italian dolomites a mother and her cub ignore bee 
stings to paw for honeycomb at the base of a mountainside tree the 
mother causes a rock slide and is crushed to death 
the cub does not mourn for long there are too many delights and 
challenges to be found in the mountain meadows 
bear hunters invade the sylvan paradise one of them wounds a 
giant grizzly that manages to elude the hunters chase crippled 
and in agony the grizzly at first repels the friendly advances of 
the cub they become companions an unlikely occurrence in nature 
the hunters return with tracking dogs and another chase begins 
the bears seem doomed but curwood was not a writer to sadden his 
readers 
annaud lets the animals tell the story along with philippe 
sardes splendid music in the first 20 minutes only one sentence 
is uttered the bears expressive faces and their elegant movement 
tell you everything you need to know 
the bear is a thrilling movie one that seems suitable for 
the entire family though the rating is pg probably because of the 
relentless intensity tristar is releasing the film which was 
written by gerard brach running time 93 minutes

the bridge a tribute to neil young caroline 
 
the bridge a tribute record with 11 largely obscure artists 
covering neil young songs is nearly as eclectic as well young 
himself 
the project is dedicated to physically challenged children 
everywhere and proceeds go to the bridge school in california 
thats been a cause for young the father of two handicapped 
children for a number of years 
dont mistake this for we are the world the music is 
challenging and at times amateurish but its true to the spirit 
of neil young a man who follows his muse even if it takes him the 
wrong way down a oneway street 
actually for a compilation album the music isnt as diverse as 
even youngs last decade of work young has traveled through 
electronic music rockabilly blues rock and country on a tour 
that gave his former record company fits 
nicolette larson who covered youngs gentle lotta love for 
a hit in the late 1970s might faint if she heard dinosaur jrs 
hardcore punk version this is the most drastic reworking on the 
bridge 
the pixies and sonic youth an atonal twosome who are heroes at 
college radio give intriguing readings of winterlong and 
computer age respectively the pixies like young have a 
knack for sounding pretty just when you think theyre losing 
control 
victoria williams and the williams brothers record a sweet 
homey version of dont let it bring you down in their basement 
williams voice sounds eerily like youngs nick caves 
helpless has an expansive air similar to talking heads the 
big country 
probably the only dud here is psychic tvs deadening sixminute 
version of only love can break your heart 
whats most heartening about this project aside from the 
obvious benefit to handicapped children is that each artist put a 
lot of thought into their work and managed to retain their 
originality in covering someone elses songs

a pajamaclad paul newman stood silently 
in the doorway of a living room with a pistol in his right hand 
glaring at a young couple making love on the floor 
the young man his clothing askew hurriedly disentangled 
himself from the woman and fled the woman fumbled with her skirt 
and blouse and stood up newman showing fury on his face slapped 
her 
cut said director james ivory he ordered the scene shot 
again telling the academy awardwinning actor that he had 
telegraphed the slap and that it should appear more spontaneous 
newman and kyra sedgwick kansas tai pan got ready to 
shoot another take as they continued filming mr and mrs 
bridge based on two novels by evan s connell the movie 
chronicles the lives of a middleclass american family from 1919 to 
1944 detailing ordinary everyday events 
the movie is being shot by merchant ivory productions a room 
with a view the bostonians this fall in kansas city 
mr bridge is an uppermiddle class attorney and his first 
concern is that his family be well taken care of he was familiar 
with the depression and doesnt want his family deprived said 
connell who wrote mrs bridge in 1959 and mr bridge 10 
years later 
even though the movie is a period piece it will be relevant to 
todays audiences he said details of life change but 
everybodys looking for the essence of life rather than the 
superficialities of it 
newman and his wife joanne woodward star as mr and mrs 
bridge sedgwick is one of their daughters bridge is a rigid man 
who is driven to provide a good life for his family 
for people going to see nightmare on elm street and 
batman this film aint for them producer ismail merchant 
said this is going to be a sophisticated film 
the 8 million movie is the highest yet for a merchant ivory 
production partly because extensive set renovations are needed for 
a film that spans 25 years the house being used for much of the 
filming has been refurnished and repainted and new wallpaper has 
been put up so it will look like a home in the late 1930s the 
decor of the house in a wealthy neighborhood with expansive lawns 
and ivycovered walls will be changed again as the story moves 
into another decade 
scenes also will be shot in the aztec room a lounge in the 
shuttered president hotel that is being made to look like it was 
decades ago in the plaza a trendy shopping district and 
elsewhere 
don kling a spokesman for the missouri film commission said 
the bridge production was expected to spend 45 million in kansas 
city for hotel rooms food and other goods and services 
movies are rarely shot in kansas city and the arrival of the 
cast and crew has given the city a touch of hollywood fever 
while newman and sedgwick prepared for the sixth or seventh take 
of their scene one recent day about 50 office workers stood in the 
street outside the house during their lunch breaks gazing at the 
spacious twostory home some peered through binoculars others had 
cameras cocked and ready 
four women stood near a mobile home used by newman and woodward 
as a dressing room poised to unfurl a computergenerated banner 
that said stop paul come say hello please 
but locals have not been dogging the stars who would not give 
interviews while filming newman brushed off a reporters request 
for an interview saying he needed time to thoughtfully answer 
questions 
when the shoot inside the house ended fans were rewarded as 
newman still dressed in stripped blue and white pajamas strolled 
across the front lawn of the house the crowd burst into 
spontaneous applause and flashbulbs popped newman looked over 
stopped and made a sweeping bow 
thom marshall who gave up his job as a bartender at a nearby 
restaurant to work as a production assistant intern hustled 
forward to keep the crowd back 
i wanted to break into the motion picture business somehow 
and in kansas city this seemed like the only way to start he 
said so here i am getting paid nothing doing a lot and loving 
it 
helen ostenberg a kansas city attorney also got a job on the 
set and is now working nights at her practice during the day she 
drives for newman and woodward who could resist a chance like 
this 
those who were not lucky enough to have snared a job on the set 
can listen to the newman watches on local radio stations in 
which listeners who have sighted the star phone in his whereabouts 
merchant said shooting should be completed in kansas city this 
month and some scenes will be shot in new york the film is 
tentatively scheduled for release next august

paul warhola swats at bees and plays with pet 
chickens at his 38acre farm as he paints pictures of bean cans and 
ketchup bottles 
its a long way from the new york art world of his late brother 
andy warhol and warhola insists hes not trying to capitalize on 
the success of his late brother the american master of pop art 
im painting for my own selfsatisfaction because i like it 
warhola said im not trying to profit or ride on andys 
coattails i dont want to copy 
yet warholas heinz vegetarian baked beans and heinz ketchup 
bottles painted on stark white canvas easily bring to mind the 
campbells soup can image warhol made into a pricey museum piece 
more than two years after he died at age 58 following gall 
bladder surgery warhols works are hotter than ever and the ghost 
of the pop icon seems to be everywhere his shot red marilyn 
fetched 4 million at christies earlier this year and the 
publication of his infamous dishy diaries have tongues wagging 
around the world 
last year sothebys sold 253 million of items from the warhol 
estate including cookie jars in the shape of pigs and puppies and 
early 19th century baltimore furniture warhol was on the cover of 
newsweek abcs 2020 did a feature on him and business week 
and forbes wrote about the 10day auction of the media superstar 
who wedded fine art to popular culture after all silkscreened 
brillo boxes and campbells soup cans werent exactly considered 
art before warhol 
warholas paintings may never hang in museums but that doesnt 
bother him 
i didnt want to do anything like the campbells soup can 
that was andys trademark warhola said its a lot of fun if 
i can sell a few fine if i cant so what 
warhola already has a collector a friend in the metals 
recycling business who paid 350 apiece for three paintings one of 
them signed andy warhols brother several other people have 
agreed to pay 1000 for ketchup paintings warhola said 
they didnt get any of andys so they figure the closest they 
can get would be getting one of mine warhola said 
warhola said he never understood why warhol born andrew 
warhola tried to shroud his past in mystery rarely referring to 
his years growing up in pittsburghs soho district and other parts 
of town 
warhola 67 was the oldest of the three sons of czech 
immigrants warhola said that when they were growing up he gave 
his brother tips on art and bought him paintbynumber sets and 
movie magazines 
on cold winter nights with no radio and little to do he recalls 
sitting in the kitchen near the coal stove tracing the sunday 
comics and drawing 
andy wasnt much involved in sports what do you do in the 
winter time you sit at the table you draw pictures he said 
later warhola said he paid his brother 2 a day to help him 
sell fruit in the citys warehouse strip district warhol was a 
student at the carnegie institute of technology and art clashed 
with enterprise 
what did andy do warhola said he brings his sketch pad 
along id be shouting cantaloupes peaches apple corn and 
meanwhile andys sketching 
after graduating warhol left pittsburgh for new york city 
changed his name and rarely returned to pittsburgh 
warhola always wanted to dabble in art but raising seven 
children and running a scrap metal yard in pittsburgh left little 
time for hobbies 
now he has retired and tends his farm doting on 100 pet 
chickens 75 ducks geese and 14 cats kept in the barn max the 
rooster a favorite roams around the overgrown vegetable and 
flower garden 
i like this old country life up here i lead a simple life i 
dont want nothing fancy he said andy always liked glamorous 
things 
wearing paintsplattered whiteoveralls and a baseball cap he 
paints at a picnic table in his backyard which is strewn with 
benches statues and a set of faded carousel horses 
he has pressed his beloved chickens into service putting 
watercolor paint on their feet and letting them walk on canvas he 
calls the experimental works chicken scratch 
its fun he said i tried one with some smaller ducks 
but they just make a mess of it 
he hopes to paint landscapes and sculpt brass fixtures door 
knobs and other treasures culled from his junkyard over the years 
i can play around with junk he said art is just 
creativity theres a million and one things you can do

some myths about kate bush 
the fouryear wait for her new album sensual world was by 
choice 
bush a perfectionist in the studio says no she did take a 
brief rest after issuing the popular greatest hits package the 
whole story but said creating suitable material caused the 
delay she also changed labels from emi to cbs 
she doesnt like to perform live 
not so the singer insists this most visual of artists loves 
the stage but worries about maintaining the intensity night after 
night of material such as get out of my house and sat in your 
lap thats why she hasnt toured in 10 years 
her favorite author is emily bronte 
wrong again yes the title and story of wuthering heights 
a no 1 single in england in 1978 were taken straight from the 
novel but no bush didnt like the book and in fact hadnt even 
seen the movie 
it is true however that the british star has a few things to 
say about love and a few more about the well sensual world 
all that is no surprise to anyone whose ears have rung from her 
operatic passion on wuthering heights or has gazed at those 
penetrating brown eyes which glow from her album covers 
so bush fans wont be surprised that the title song of her new 
record more than lives up to its name 
a better story is how it came to be recorded originally having 
composed an appropriately seductive track bush thought of james 
joyces erotic classic ulysses and thought she had found the 
ideal lyrics 
the lyrics were taken straight from molly blooms soliloquy 
the 31yearold singersongwriter said in a telephone interview 
from london the words were so rich so intimate it was like 
magic the way they fitted 
unfortunately the joyce estate had no interest in hearing the 
authors words set to music if bush wanted to invoke ulysses 
shed have to start from scratch she did cooing mmh yes and 
murmering images of seedcakes and arrows of love while 
uilleann pipes and an irish bagpipe moaned in the background 
i was disappointed bush admitted and it was very 
difficult i wanted to keep the original sense but obviously i am 
not joyce but with the rhythms i had it began to turn into what 
the molly bloom character is about i was stepping out of the song 
into the beauty nature 
she calls her dreamlike songs short stories and brings to 
them a fiction writers fascination with legend and reality that 
means imagining heists with bogart and cagney summoning the spirit 
of houdini and springing from the head of zeus 
on heads were dancing a young girl meets a charming 
stranger at a dance in 1939 and discovers she is conversing with 
hitler 
i was thinking of the devil incarnate the ultimate evil 
she said it was inspired by a friend of mine who had been to 
this dinner and sat next to this guy and found him absolutely 
fascinating intelligent and welleducated 
he asked the next day who was that and was told it was 
atomic bomb developer j robert oppenheimer my friend went back 
in horror he said he would have behaved completely differently if 
he had realized who it was 
obsession like cathy for heathcliff drove bush to make music 
she played piano for hours as a child and was 15 when a friend 
introduced her to pink floyd guitarist david gilmour 
he was looking for different acts and my friend said to him 
come and have a listen they came down and worked on a few songs 
with me i couldnt afford anything like paying for a studio so 
dave put up the money we put three tracks down two of those 
tracks went on the first album the kick inside 
go to a record store and youll find her albums in the pop 
or rock section between buffalo springfield and the byrds but 
neither of those 1960s groups had a singer with a fouroctave 
soprano or called a song suspended in gaffa or ever used the 
digeridu or bouzouki 
bush was inspired by british art rockers peter gabriel and bryan 
ferry rather than country and rhythm n blues instead of getting 
her kicks from electric guitar bush fell in love with the 
fairlight synthesizer which she began using on her third album 
never for ever 
i took one look at it and said this is what ive been 
looking for all my life i couldnt believe the fairlight its 
called a synthesizer but many of its sounds are of natural source 
to be able to play with strings waterfalls anything you want 
its wonderful 
it was just like opening this great door for me a complete 
revolution it meant i no longer felt a need to write on the piano 
and fill it out with synthesizers 
bush talks of colors moods theres the anger of between a 
man and a woman the loss of innocence of the fog the dry 
wit of running up that hill a deal with god 
she also writes of lying awake at night worrying about love in 
the man with the child in his eyes and being brought to tears 
by a bad dream in cloudbusting 
all of us tend to live in our heads in cloudbusting the 
idea was of starting this song with a person waking up from this 
dream i wake up crying its like setting a scene that 
immediately suggests to you that this person is no longer with 
someone they dearly love she said 
it puts a pungent note on the song life is loss isnt it 
its learning to cope with loss i think in a lot of ways thats 
what all of us have to cope with

author john jakes had a good feeling 
while working on his newest book and hes not at all surprised 
that hes struck it rich with california gold 
the 658page historical novel which tells the story of a young 
man who goes to california to make his fortune in the postgold 
rush era has been on best seller lists for weeks 
ive got very loyal readers out there jakes said while 
relaxing at his home in greenwich 
since 1974 those readers have helped jakes rack up 12 
consecutive best sellers eight of those volumes were part of his 
kent family chronicles those were followed by the north and 
south trilogy all three of which were no 1 best sellers 
i thought this book went together well i had a good time 
writing it jakes said 
ten years ago he decided to write something about california 
but he had to wait until his others books were completed when he 
finally found the time to write the book it took him about two 
years to research california history and one year to write and 
edit the novel 
when i started making notes back then i was concentrating 
on the early period of the ranchos the spanishmexican landowners 
and the americans who came over the mountains and by ship the 
whole focus eventually changed jakes recalled 
its always an evolutionary process the 57yearold author 
added 
five days a week sometimes six from 8 am until late 
afternoon jakes labored over the novel working from a general 
outline he wrote about 10 pages a day gradually weaving his 
fictional characters into the historical events that occurred in 
california between 1886 and 1921 
the hero of the book is mack chance who leaves behind the 
pennsylvania coal mines and walks to california mack struggles 
with women a devious partner mother nature and corrupt tycoons in 
making his own fortune the gold that he finds in california is 
oil oranges and land 
i decided i wanted the proverbial rags to riches story first 
of all who likes a riches to rags story but also i thought 
someone who was well off would be able to get involved in a lot of 
things much more so than if they were just a shop keeper jakes 
said with that in mind i began reading in specific areas in 
california history like the oil business 
macks character is not based on a single historical figure 
rather he evolved partly out of reading and partly out of 
imagination jakes said 
i like him jakes said i cant stick with a leading 
character without having some affection for him 
the book also seems to have struck a positive chord among book 
critics its been praised for being historically accurate and 
entertaining although theres been some criticism of the book for 
being light reading 
jakes is well aware of the critics who say that his books 
arent great literature but he doesnt see that as a problem and 
accepts the criticism as a price of fame 
ive had a great deal of success the last 15 years and when 
you get extremely successful its tough to get good marks you 
really are a target sitting out there i find that it takes an 
awfully generous reviewer to look at successful writers 
subjectively 
im the first to admit that im not what you would call a 
literary writer he said i take my work very seriously but i 
dont take myself seriously i do the best i can as professional 
craftsman i try to be very accessible because i dont like obscure 
work so i dont try to build in any literary values other than 
the good solid values of telling an interesting story with 
characters that people care about he said 
with the book doing well and a series of promotional appearances 
done jakes plans to take some time off from writing he spends his 
winters in hilton head sc and this year he will also be working 
on a play he wrote based on charles dickens a christmas carol 
the play will be staged in alabama 
eventually though jakes will get back to his writing hes 
been writing full or part time since he was a graduate student 
including the 17 years in which he worked in advertising in 
addition to his recent historical novels hes written about 200 
short stories and science fiction pieces 
jakes said some of his longtime fans want him to try his hand 
again at science fiction but jakes said his next novel will 
definitely be another historical one although it may be different 
from his current books hed like to have part of his next book set 
in europe as well as in the united states 
i always have an interesting time with one of my books 
because i learn a lot jakes said its like going to graduate 
school and having someone giving you money to do it i guess im 
just a frustrated graduate school nerd

way down south where the mississippi mud 
would mire reindeer papa noel paddles his own pirogue down a river 
made bright by blazing bonfires 
at least thats one of the stories told to explain why for more 
than a century cajuns in towns between new orleans and baton rouge 
have lined the levee with tall fires on christmas eve 
the pyres mostly 25foot towers made from driftwood and stuffed 
with bamboo stretch for miles along the levee attracting tourists 
and townfolk who gather around for music food fireworks and a 
unique party 
some say the tradition goes back 240 years but no one knows for 
sure when it started or why 
its been a hundred different reasons which one is the truth 
we dont know said nolan j oubre jr fire chief in gramercy 
who has become a sort of de facto chairman for the celebration 
they claim it was to light the way by santa claus when he came 
in by boat years ago before they had roads or railroads 
another reason was to light the way to go to midnight mass 
thats why they were on the levee years ago the only part of 
towns we had was on the river 
another reason was to be noisy at midnight they used to light 
them at midnight years ago and put the bamboo cane reed in it so 
it would pop like firecrackers 
some reasons sound more likely than others oubre said one 
which he acknowledged probably was spurious is that they were 
bone fires lit by indians at midnight on christmas eve to burn 
the remains of their dead 
whatever the reason about 100 bonfires up to 25 feet high will 
line the river this christmas as they have for longer than anyone 
can remember some people say the tradition goes back 240 years 
all i can tell you is that its over a hundred years said 
oubre its just an old tradition that we kept up our parents 
and our grandparents 
recent years have seen restrictions put on the fires because of 
worry that competition to build the biggest bonfires was putting 
too big a strain on the long mound built to protect the river 
parishes from flooding 
until the 1980s the bonfires were all teepeeshaped oubre said 
gramercys bonfires tended to top out at about 45 to 50 feet but 
he remembered one in the st john the baptist parish town of 
reserve that towered 100 feet from the battue behind the levee 
in the early 1980s towns in st james and st john parishes 
decided that bonfires should be no taller than 20 or 25 feet with 
bases 12 feet square the fire department and sometimes one other 
government body is allowed a base up to 12 by 24 feet 
we have been in the past few years building them as much as 
42 feet said oubre nobody objected so we just kept on 
under the rules only the fire department is allowed to build 
something other than a teepeeshaped fire but oubre said he 
doesnt enforce that rule either he only cares about two things 
is the base within the required limits and should the logs 
tumble will they fall toward the river rather than the road 
last year i think one of them built a chimney with santa claus 
going down it he said they stayed within the 12 by 12 
another group built a log cabin as long as it burns safely and 
is constructed properly

american indian tribes in michigan 
celebrate what they call the first thanksgiving this year 
indian leaders say elementary school children may not be getting 
the truth when theyre taught that the first thanksgiving took 
place amicably between colonial settlers and brightly feathered 
indians 
we as a native people waste good energy trying to tell the 
real story we have trouble getting past the mythology said bill 
church executive director of the nokomis learning center an 
indian cultural center near lansing 
children are taught a lot of imagery church says our 
indian groups see that the nonnative colonist had little knowledge 
about using the land and had to depend on indian agricultural 
knowledge to survive 
the imagery and hard feelings were to be set aside during the 
thanksgiving feast scheduled nov 8 at the nokomis center chiefs 
and other tribal leaders mainly from midmichigan comprised most 
of the 100 people at the dinner said church an ottawa indian 
a few nonindians most of them with the state indian affairs 
commission which church headed for four years before becoming 
executive director of the nokomis center also were invited he 
said 
the indians supplied the food church says to begin a true 
thanksgiving tradition 
were not saying the original thanksgiving didnt happen but 
it didnt happen in the way it was put in books he said 
church said thanksgiving should be celebrated at the end of the 
harvest which is earlier in the fall when thanksgiving was made 
into a holiday a slowmoving congress didnt officially pass it 
until november he said 
and there wont be a turkey 
we wish we could have a wild turkey but its not 
turkeyhunting season church said 
venison and possibly other wild game fish wild rice baked 
bread and indian corn will be served indian corn usually hangs in 
doorways during halloween but prepared properly it is a delicious 
meal church said 
the thanksgiving feast is meant to introduce tribal leaders to 
the nokomis center which will provide educational programs about 
indian cultural contributions church said gov james blanchard 
and other officials probably wont see the center until 
construction is completed next spring he said 
at this point were keeping it inhouse he said you 
probably wont see high government officials the center has 
taken so long to come together that i want people of that caliber 
to see it when its done

thanksgiving is a typically american holiday but how do 
newcomers from countries that dont celebrate the event deal with 
it 
an anthropology professor says that even though presentday 
refugees and immigrants dont commemorate thanksgiving they 
readily assimilate the occasion into their own culture 
i can see a real continuation of the spirit of thankfulness 
because many of them also had rough voyages and are very thankful 
they are here says patricia maloof adjunct anthropology 
professor at the catholic university of america in washington dc 
vietnamese families for example may observe the day by having 
turkey along with more traditional pork or duck dishes she says 
they recognize it as part of the american lifestyle and adjust 
and adapt it to suit their situation here she says its more 
of a quiet lowkey celebration with families getting together to 
reminisce and be thankful for the blessings of being here

to most new yorkers and many americans the 
christmas tree in new yorks rockefeller center is the tree 
as this years giant evergreen from rockland county new york 
lights up with 18000 colored bulbs in midtown manhattan it 
joins a long line of memorable trees that began with a simple tree 
put up by construction workmen grateful for work during the 
depression 
a 1931 photo shows several dozen men grouped near the tree 
festooned with droopy streamers set up in the rubble of the 
demolished brownstones which stood on the site of todays 
rockefeller center under the tree an earthly version of santa 
claus is pictured handing out the best thing to come in time for 
christmas during the early 1930s paychecks 
two years later the tree returned more formally set up in front 
of the newly completed rca building the flagship skyscraper of the 
new center since then the tree tradition at the rockefeller 
center has continued unbroken if occasionally altered and is now 
a prime tourist magnet during the holiday season 
its arrival hoisting decoration and official lighting at the 
centers skating rink is something of a ritual in itself heralded 
by press releases news reports and televised entertainment then 
right after new years the whole show comes down and disappears 
overnight 
like so many new yorkers themselves the trees originally came 
from out of town the tallest in 1948 was a 90foot norway spruce 
from mt kisco ny other new york trees have come from yaphank 
lake ronkonkoma smithtown hurley saranac lake suffern spring 
valley rockland county valley cottage and nanuet new jersey has 
contributed trees from allamuchy morristown belvidere tenafly 
montclair far hills and raritan township trees have come from 
island pond coventry holland east montpelier and danville 
vermont greenville and dixfield maine lehighton harveyville and 
harford pa whitefield nh podunk mass and the petawawa 
forest of canada 
decorations have reflected the times during world war ii the 
tree was decked with red and white plastic globes and stars instead 
of lights because of wartime restrictions on electricity the 
lights returned in 1945 similarly the number of lights was 
reduced in response to the energy crisis in 1973 with colored 
reflective disks added to compensate

christmas trees are beautiful traditional and 
heartwarming they also can make you sick 
so says dr timothy sullivan who heads the allergy and 
immunology division at the university of texas southwestern medical 
center at dallas 
people with preexisting allergic conditions or respiratory 
difficulty should be aware that if their symptoms worsen during the 
holiday season their tree might be the cause 
sullivan cautions those allergic to mold to be especially wary 
of trees from commercial tree lots which he says are breeding 
grounds for mold he adds that some trees grown for commercial sale 
are chemically treated and can trigger allergic reactions 
on the other hand cutting down a live tree has its problems 
too according to sullivan one of the most common and attractive 
trees in the united states is the mountain cedar which he says 
causes more respiratory allergy among more people than any other 
source except ragweed 
and in winter male mountain cedars pollinate so that if one is 
used for christmas it can release pollen in the house to identify 
female trees look for those that produce small blue berries the 
male trees have a characteristic brownish or golden color during 
pollination 
sullivan currently is conducting research about the mountain 
cedar to determine the genetic makeup of people predisposed to the 
allergy to develop a vaccine

take toys seriously as you shop for the holidays 
to make safe and appropriate selections keep in mind this 
checklist offered by the toy manufacturers of america an industry 
trade association 
use the age group label as a guide and look for other safety 
messages printed on the packaging 
think about other children who may have access to the toy in 
your home a toy intended for an older child may be dangerous in 
the hands of a younger sibling so consider supervision and storage 
when buying toys for children under three avoid those with 
small parts that can be swallowed or with sharp points or edges 
that could be hazardous 
stuffed animals and dolls should have sturdy wellsewn seams 
and attached items like eyes and noses should be securely fastened 
so they cannot be bitten or pulled off 
rubber toys such as rattles squeakers or teething rings 
should be too large to fit in an infants mouth even when 
compressed 
electric toys with heating elements should be chosen only for 
children over 8 and then only when there will be adult supervision 
toy arrows and darts should have blunt tips made of rubber 
flexible plastic or cork make sure the tips are securely attached 
to their shafts 
if the toy is painted look for the words nontoxic on the 
package or label fabrics should be labeled flame retardant or 
flame resistant and stuffed and cloth toys should be marked 
machinesurface washable electrical toys should have the 
underwriters laboratories ul approved tag 
choose a toy chest that has a removable lid or a lid with 
springloaded support that will hold it securely open the chest 
should have smooth finished edges holes for ventilation and 
hingeline clearance to prevent pinched fingers 
the tma also notes that plastic wrappings from toys and other 
products should be discarded immediately adults should check toys 
periodically and encourage safe play habits such as following 
recommended instructions and secure storage toys appropriate to an 
older child but potentially hazardous to a younger sibling in the 
house should be stored out of reach of the younger child games or 
toys with small pieces are especially hazardous to small children 
who tend to put things into their mouths 
establish a toy storage habit with your children and explain to 
them how accidents can happen with unattended toys large toys like 
wagons or bikes should be protected from the elements and not left 
where they can become fire or safety hazards encourage children to 
inspect toys for needed repairs or replacements 
to maintain crib safety the crib gym meant to be a grasping 
exerciser for your baby should be removed once he reaches 5 months 
or begins to push up on his hands and knees crib toys should never 
be hung or attached with anything that might entangle the infant 
replace the plastic side railing on the crib if it becomes worn and 
brittle from the babys teething

americans spend some 1275 billion for toys each year with 
about 60 percent of the total rung up during the christmas and 
hanukkah holiday seasons according to the toy manufacturers of 
america 
shopping early in the season and early in the day is one way 
to avoid crowded stores and determine product availability 
suggests stephen schwartz president of playskool toys 
schwartz advises going to the store with a list of toys to buy 
and checking the age coding on all toys prior to purchase 
other suggestions include 
check for small or sharp parts that may harm a child 
compare all similar products to determine the best quality 
product and compare points of difference between them 
try to buy toys that will last over time 
if you have any questions about the toy or where to buy it 
call the manufacturer directly 
wrap the toys as you buy them to make sure curious children 
dont peek at the presents 
when buying infant toys keep in mind research has indicated 
babies respond more to bright contrasting colors rather than soft 
pastels

gifts you design and make yourself are often the most welcome at 
holiday time they can be done with inexpensive materials available 
at neighborhood shops some examples 
hair ornaments buy plain combs barrettes or hairbands at 
discount drug or dimestores and decorate them either by gluing or 
simple sewing 
beads faux gems ribbons or fabrics can be found at notions 
shops or sometimes stowed away in dresser drawers costume 
jewelry you no longer wear can be taken apart and recycled for new 
ornaments many notions shops stock ribbons with metallic threads 
or embroidery for dressy versions you usually can find plaid 
stripe print or moire taffetas or satins you also may find 
readymade satin rosettes or embroidery patches some with adhesive 
backings these shops also may have plastic or metal beads 
if you prefer the glue technique pick a heavy type like elmers 
tacky glue which sets quickly will hold fairly heavy objects and 
dries to an invisible finish fabrics can be attached with elmers 
craft bond ii which doesnt bleed through gluing is the only 
medium that will attach glitter particles satisfactorily 
sewing fabrics beads or other decorations to hair ornaments can 
be managed with rudimentary needle skills 
you need to fit ribbon or fabric to a barrette or hairband to 
serve as a base if youre using beads or sequins sew them on 
first then secure the decorated base to the ornament sewing 
securely at both ends for a barrette or covering completely for a 
headband for a bow ornament fake the knot by lapping a layer of 
ribbon or fabric over the base tacking it into place and covering 
the knot with a separate strip of fabric or ribbon combs are 
the simplest since all you need to do is tie a bow about the right 
size and sew it to the head of the comb at both ends and at the 
center 
painted sweatshirts and sneakers you or your child can make 
oneofakind message sweatshirts or decorated sneakers by painting 
on designs yourself 
a line of fabric paints from tulip are nontoxic and water 
soluble before drying so theyre safe and easy for youngsters to 
handle 
tulip advises a cardboard lining under a sweatshirt to provide a 
firm surface to trace on and provide support for the fabric during 
paintingchalk on the design first bold simple designs are most 
effective 
large areas should be brushed on but details like dots or 
details can be added with tulips slick paint pen the companys 
white puffy paint adds texture and tulip glitter makes the design 
sparkle other textures available in craft discount and toy 
stores include pearl paint tulip dye and designer metallics 
the painted articles should dry overnight then will be ready 
for wear theyre colorfast and machine washable in the delicate 
cycle

books are good gifts even for newborns according to peggy 
kohlepp associate manager of tulane universitys bookstore 
by reading aloud to babies parents give them a variety and 
richness of language says kohlepp 
and pat schindler director of tulanes newcomb childrens 
center in new orleans says blocks dolls trains and paints 
usually make better childrens gifts than gimmick toys and video 
games 
television toys soon lose their luster she says suggesting 
that instead parents should buy toys that stress imagination and 
creativity the more i work with children the more i realize 
that parents transmit their values even through the toys they buy 
at the university of massachusetts at amherst jack lochhead 
agrees that some of the worst toys for children are the expensive 
gimmicky spectator type such as talking dolls and bears 
because they do things as the child watches passively such toys 
squelch the childs imagination and limit play explains lochhead 
a cognitivelearning expert and director of the universitys 
scientific reasoning research institute 
he says the best toys are lowcost lowtech toys that offer 
imaginative play such as unpainted wooden blocks that help teach 
geometric patterns and mathematical concepts

lastminute holiday shopper dreading the ordeal want to 
choose buy and get out 
chances are youre a male 
by observing and surveying patrons at two midwestern gift stores 
over three holiday seasons a marketing professor has found that 
men generally greet holiday shopping with desperation abruptness 
lateness and discomfort 
mary ann mcgrath assistant professor of marketing at loyola 
university of chicago found that the closer it gets to christmas 
the more male customers there are and she says they tended 
toward large rapid spontaneous and often random purchase 
he came into the store 15 minutes before closing time she 
says of one customer and quickly chose a bracelet and a necklace 
for his wife then as they were being wrapped he also purchased 
an african beaded necklace that one of the saleswomen was wearing 
one male shopper in the survey said in my youth i used to 
try to be creative and buy things i liked it was a disaster now 
i just ask for a list and shes happy 
women responding to the survey said they saw mens buying habits 
as quick overgenerous but inappropriate and not as 
intuitive or thoughtful as women 
but one woman said men make a lot of mistakes but when they 
hit it right they do so with panache 
the most treasured gifts that respondents listed mcgrath says 
were those that were of sentimental value and personal gifts that 
were associated with the giver 
although one woman said that her most treasured gifts were the 
most expensive ones most women indicated that a gift is most 
valued if they know that someone has really thought of them when 
choosing it 
mcgraths research was done with john sherry of northwestern 
university

fat doesnt have to be part of the fun during the holidays says 
weight watchers magazine 
there are ways to resist temptations to overindulge the 
magazine says and offers this advice 
plan ahead have a snack before going to a gettogether so you 
wont be starving when you get there 
practice moderation make room in your days menu for a 
reasonable helping of your favorite foods but dont abandon your 
diet guidelines completely 
just say no thanks think about ways to turn down food 
without sounding hostile sanctimonious or rude 
avoid highrisk situations stay away from the allyoucan eat 
buffet let your guests take home the leftovers 
dont drink too much alcohol has a highcalorie content and 
can destroy your resolve to resist other temptations 
the holidays are often most difficult for people with eating 
disorders and their families says dr charles a murkofsy 
director of the eating disorders program at gracie square hospital 
in new york 
a person with an eating disorder will often bully the family 
into having turkey without all the trimmings or refuse to 
participate in the holiday meal at all he says 
families he suggests should give recognition to the eating 
disorder instead of denying its existence and make mutually 
agreeable compromises on food choices 
he says the most common eating disorders are anorexia nervosa a 
selfinduced starvation and bulimia a cycle of binging and 
purging

camcorder users filming holiday festivities should vary their

the interest level high 
but dont overdo it or audiences may get dizzy cautions the 
8mm video council a new yorkbased industry trade group 
know when to stop shooting when filming childrens parties the 
organization also says though it doesnt seem long one to two 
minutes per activity is plenty and will make for better viewing

other suggestions 
keep the camera stationary and let the people create the 
action in your video 
dont backlight your subject backlighting will make your 
subjects features completely unrecognizable 
when videotaping indoors consider supplementary lights to 
accentuate color 
never aim the camcorder directly at the sun or a bright light 
or you risk causing permanent damage 
press the white balance button before shooting in a new 
setting this will automatically compensate for any discrepancies 
in lighting 
make use of your camcorders high fidelity sound capabilities 
but unless youre narrating let your subjects to do the talking

yes virginia there was an editorial about the credibility of 
santa claus appearing more than 100 years ago in the new york sun 
it was written by francis pharcellus church an assistant to the 
papers editor 
a true christmas classic it has outlived its writer the 
recipient and the newspaper that gave it life its most famous 
phrases are often recalled and sometimes parodied 
we take pleasure in answering at once and thus prominently the 
communication below expressing at the same time our great 
gratification that its faithful author is numbered among the 
friends of the sun 
dear editor 
i am 8 years old some of my little friends say there is no 
santa claus papa says if you see it in the sun its so 
please tell me the truth is there a santa claus 
virginia hanlon 
115 west 95th street 
virginia your little friends are wrong they have been 
affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age they do not believe 
except what they see they think that nothing can be which is not 
comprehensible by their little minds all minds virginia whether 
they be mens or childrens are little in this great universe of 
ours man is a mere insect an ant in his intellect as compared 
with the boundless world around him as measured by the 
intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge 
yes virginia there is a santa claus he exists as certainly 
as love and generosity and devotion exist and you know that they 
abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy alas how 
dreary would be the world if there were no santa claus it would be 
as dreary as if there were no virginias there would no childlike 
faith then no poetry no romance to make tolerable this existence 
we should have no enjoyment except in sense and sight the eternal 
light with which childhood fills the world would be extinguished 
not believe in santa claus you might as well not believe in 
fairies you might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the 
chimneys on christmas eve to catch santa claus but even if they 
did not see santa claus coming down what would that prove nobody 
sees santa claus but that is no sign that there is no santa claus 
the most real things in the world are those that neither children 
nor men can see did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn of 
course not but thats no proof that they are not there nobody can 
conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable 
in the world 
you tear apart the babys rattle and see what makes the noise 
inside but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the 
strongest man not even the united strength of all the strongest 
men that ever lived could tear apart only faith fancy poetry 
love romance can push aside that curtain and view and picture the 
supernal beauty and glory beyond is it all real ah virginia in 
all this world there is nothing else real and abiding 
no santa claus thank god he lives and he lives forever a 
thousand years from now virginia nay ten times ten thousand 
years from now he will continue to make glad the heart of 
childhood

the surprising economic strength to begin the fourth quarter

after a decade of warnings and threats that 
americans were sitting atop a powder keg because of overspending 
and debts and trade deficits and waste the forecasts have turned 
remarkably benign 
alan greenspan thinks a recession can be avoided and inflation 
reduced to zero in a few years and michael boskin sees growth of 
at least 2 percent well into 1990 along with falling inflation and 
low unemployment 
these are people with top credentials and responsibilities 
greenspan being chairman of the federal reserve and boskin 
chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers but if 
they set the pace they have plenty of followers 
in fact it is rather unusual to hear economists not mention the 
word recession except to say it isnt likely in 1990 there are 
exceptions of course but not nearly in such numbers as in other 
years 
it is typical for example for forecasters of the next year to 
employ caveats just in case and the most common of these is to 
warn that chances of inflation or recession will grow as the year 
wears on 
it is a wise practice because nobody really can see that far 
ahead given the economys propensity to be rattled by wars 
financial debacles politics trade restraints and cartels to say 
nothing about erratic weather 
those warnings are not nearly as prominent this year the 
forecast by the conference boards panel of senior financial 
executives released today is an example of the new genre it 
contains no recession or inflation warning 
instead the panel says the us economy will avoid recession 
worsening interest rates and rising inflation not just next year 
but in the year 1991 as well only one member of the panel 
expressed fear of a recession in that time 
the good news from the panel is that we will not suffer a 
recession during the next two years said vincent massaro an 
economist with the board which describes itself as a private 
nonprofit nonpartisan researcher 
such a forecast coming after seven years of economic expansion 
one of the longest ever is remarkable it is especially so to any 
american who has listened to an entire decade of warnings about 
economic disasters to come 
the feeling of conviction is even reinforced by massaros 
observation that while the panels forecast was made prior to the 
latest stock market plunge it is doubtful panelists would alter 
their views if they were polled today 
the american public seems to share the confidence since 
socalled consumer confidence surveys indicate a continuation of 
intentions to shop boosted in part by a low level of unemployment 
and a high sense of job security 
another report from the conference board this one on consumer 
confidence is particularly interesting because of its timing 
returns from consumers were obtained before during and after the 
latest stock market plunge 
certainly you might think a sharp break in the stock market 
one of those awful omens that americans lived with every year of 
the 1980s would have undermined confidence not at all 
the sharp stock market decline in late october appears to have 
had little or no effect on consumers said fabian linden 
director of the boards consumer research center 
are americans really that confident have they really adapted 
that well to crises can an economy that already has grown for 
seven straight years continue to do so over the next two 
the norecession feeling seems to pervade the thinking of a very 
wide range of americans including academics consumers business 
people and political and monetary leaders 
and after a decade of economic warnings and threats it is 
difficult to assimilate and almost impossible to evaluate

doug hammond talks on a new threeyear contract collapsed when 
union negotiators rejected the last company offer saturday 
mckean and baker said at separate news conferences sunday that 
they didnt expect any new talks this week hammond agreed saying 
he would remain in daily contact with both sides to determine when 
to try to resume the talks 
a previous attempt by hammond to get negotiations going during 
the strike failed after three hours on oct 18 
the last boeing strike lasted 45 days in 1977 
mckean said the new offer addressed employees concerns by 
boosting lumpsum bonuses cutting mandatory overtime and 
increasing retirement benefits although the total money was the 
same as in a threeyear offer rejected by union members in an 85 
percent strike vote oct 3 a day before the walkout 
were waiting for the union to bring their members to the 
kingdome and vote on this proposal mckean said company 
officials were totally confident it would be approved he said 
the union has monitored membership sentiment throughout the 
strike by weekly surveys baker said rejecting any chance of a 
vote on the offer 
putting it to a vote would only mean more anger he said 
meanwhile boeing has been negotiating under a news blackout 
since tuesday with its secondlargest union the seattle 
professional engineering employees association which represents 
about 28000 engineers and technical workers that contract expires 
dec 1 with both sides saying a strike is unlikely 
baker said reductions in the costofliving provisions of the 
latest offer to the machinists amounted to 17 cents to 27 cents an 
hour depending on overtime and pay level 
really its a takeaway baker said its actually less 
than the offer we rejected oct 3 
mckean said about 10 percent of those represented by the 
machinists are crossing picket lines ranging from 4 percent in the 
puget sound area where union membership is mandatory to 34 
percent in wichita kan where membership is voluntary under state 
law 
union leaders have maintained the figures are far lower 
this is the strongest strike ive ever seen baker said 
the machinists represent about 57800 workers including 43300 
in the local district lodge 12000 in wichita 1700 in portland 
ore and a few hundred at scattered sites in california hawaii 
utah wyoming montana north dakota and other states 
the offer would have cut mandatory overtime from 200 to 144 
hours per quarter and assured workers at least every third weekend 
off the previous offer called for 160 hours of mandatory overtime 
and a maximum of three weekends in a row 
the oct 3 offer included annual pay raises of 4 percent 3 
percent and 3 percent with bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in 
the first year and 3 percent in the second 
boeing spokesman paul binder said the new offer contained the 
same wage increases with bonuses of 10 percent 4 percent and 4 
percent the additional bonus money was offset by lower 
costofliving provisions and company contributions to some 
insurance payments 
retirement benefits would have been increased across the board 
while other benefits would remain the same as in the previous 
offer binder said boeing also would have paid health premiums for 
november which striking workers now must pay or go without 
coverage

some of the tape recordings made by undercover 
fbi agents investigating the futures industry are of such poor 
quality they could be of little use to prosecutors a newspaper 
says 
the chicago suntimes also reported sunday that one recording 
could support defense allegations that federal agents were guilty 
of entrapment in their investigation of trading practices at the 
chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
federal grand juries have indicted 46 traders and one clerk of 
which 14 have entered guilty pleas trials for some of the others 
could begin next month 
the suntimes said it reviewed fbi tape recordings from one of 
four trading pits involved in the investigation and found some 
audio tapes difficult to understand it said some voices were hard 
to identify and the nature of some transactions were unclear 
bob long a spokesman for the federal bureau of investigation 
office in chicago declined to comment on the quality of the tapes 
despite the poor quality one 20minute cassette reveals 
apparent rule violations when trading continued after the closing 
bell the newspaper said 
the tapes contain the voice of a man identified as one of four 
undercover fbi agents in the trading pits apparently discussing a 
scheme to prearrange trades 
at one point the voice tells a trader to make certain 
transactions saying if he wants to make money he should do what 
the voice instructs 
defense attorneys say such instructions amount to entrapment 
but federal authorities contend honest traders would have resisted 
such overtures 
a federal judge has ruled that the recordings made by fbi 
agents wearing hidden microphones in the trading pits can be 
admitted as evidence despite allegations of entrapment and defense 
attorneys efforts to block the use of the tapes 
prosecutors are expected to call on the fbi agents to identify 
voices and transactions recorded on the tapes but defense 
attorneys likely will challenge the agents memories

the supreme court today removed the last major 
hurdle to carrying out a 25 billion settlement for victims of the 
dalkon shield birthcontrol device 
the court over one dissenting vote rejected a challenge by 
some 650 of the thousands of women likely to share in a trust fund 
established by ah robins co manufacturer of the intrauterine 
device 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case but 
four votes are needed to grant such review 
marketed in the early 1970s the device allegedly caused 
infertility spontaneous abortions pelvic inflammation or in some 
cases death 
dalkon shield sales ended in 1974 but the product was not 
actually recalled until 1984 ah robins based in richmond va 
created the trust fund as part of its 1985 reorganization under 
federal bankruptcy law 
the reorganization was sparked by thousands of lawsuits by women 
who had used the device 
the challenge acted on today contended that the settlement 
wrongly bars future lawsuits against ah robins officials and 
others and that 25 billion may not be enough money to compensate 
all victims 
lawyers representing about 18000 women who are to share in the 
settlement urged the justices to reject the challenge 
greater than the risk of a shortfall is the immediate risk a 
near certainty that if the plan of reorganization is disapproved 
or even delayed the plan will collapse those lawyers said 
the justices today also turned down an appeal challenging that 
portion of the settlement barring individual lawsuits against ah 
robins insurer aetna casualty and surety co 
sharon lutz a detroit lawyer representing some women who sued 
over alleged dalkon shield injuries said compensation checks 
probably will not be received by anyone for at least several 
months 
it likely will be the end of february or the first of march 
before individual women start getting paid ms lutz said 
she said a committee appointed by us district judge robert 
merhige may already have attached dollar figures to individual 
claims but those assessments have not been released to lawyers for 
the women we hope those figures will be made available to us 
soon ms lutz said 
under the bankruptcy reorganization plan american home products 
corp a new yorkbased business has agreed to buy ah robins and 
fund the trust 
ah robins stockholders will receive 700 million worth of 
american home stock making the acquisition price 32 billion 
but american home products conditional commitment to purchase 
ah robins extends only to dec 31 
it seems unlikely that the purchaser will tolerate the further 
delays and uncertainties of supreme court review lawyers for 
the 18000 women said the robins plan likely wil be mooted 
before this court has opportunity to consider its merits 
lawyers for the women challenging the settlement say an 
injunction against future lawsuits against such robins officials as 
e claiborne robins sr and e claiborne robins jr whose families 
own 42 percent of the companys stock is not warranted 
the appeal also contended that the fund may well be inadequate 
to pay the dalkon shield victims in full 
compensation to individual women would be based on the extent of 
their injuries allegedly caused by using the device 
rodney klein a sacramento calif lawyer who represents some 
of the victims said in a recent interview that women who alleged 
they were made sterile by using the device collected up to 150000 
each in settlements reached before ah robins declared bankruptcy 
this supreme court case is the last hurdle for women who have 
waited so long to collect klein said last week if the court 
denies review the full process of compensation can begin 
lawyers for the 18000 women who urged rejection of the 
settlement challenge said that of the 195000 women with claims 
some 81000 voluntarily have accepted settlement payments of up to 
725 each others have been dropped from the case 
less than 95000 claims will remain for analysis of medical 
records to determine what smaller portion will merit significant 
compensation the justices were told 
more than 94 percent of the women who sued ah robins voted in 
favor of the reorganization plan and settlement confirmed by us 
district judge robert merhige jr and upheld by the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals last june 
the cases are menardsanford vs ah robins 89441 and 
anderson vs aetna 89442

the lead lawyer in an appeal of a proposed 
settlement for victims of the dalkon shield said today that he 
wont ask for a rehearing after the supreme court rejected a 
challenge of a trust fund established by the manufacturer of the 
birthcontrol device 
it always was an uphill battle said alan b morrison of 
the public citizen litigation group in washington dc and head 
lawyer for the 650 claimants challenging the 25 billion 
settlement 
we fought we did what our clients wanted us to do and we have 
no regrets said morrison 
the group had the option of asking the high court for a 
rehearing in the case 
the challenge acted on today contended that the settlement 
wrongly bars future lawsuits against ah robins co officials and 
others and that 25 billion may not be enough money to compensate 
all victims 
roscoe e puckett jr spokesman for the richmondbased company 
said if the group does not seek a rehearing the matter could be 
resolved soon 
the company is very pleased that the way finally has been 
cleared for consummation of its reorganization plan puckett said 
today the road has been much longer and more difficult than we 
envisioned but it has led to a fair and efficient procedure for 
resolving dalkon shield claims which has been our objective 
now the company looks forward to continuing its growth as a 
subsidiary of american home products corp 
if as morrison said the claimants do not request a rehearing 
the plan is scheduled to become final dec 2 puckett said 
linda hightower director of the dalkon shield victims 
association in atlanta welcomed the decision 
i am so happy ms hightower said 
she said she did not want to take a chance on losing the money 
the group already had 
if we had lost that money it would have taken us anywhere 
from one to five years to get back to the point where we are 
she said

they get lost from time to time but there are 
enduring marketplace verities beneath all the new theories 
concepts forecasts interpretations innovations and fads people 
are exposed to 
sometimes you have to dig very deep for them arduously 
stripping away layer upon layer of trash but if you persist you 
will find them and sometimes you need not dig at all because the 
truth erupts through the pile 
it is true for instance that long hours hard work high 
quality and good service are among the primary requirements of a 
successful new business could anything so simple and obvious be 
overlooked 
apparently it could scores of books are published each year 
with intricate theories on how to succeed researchers constantly 
study the subject and consultants earn money peddling intricate 
esoteric theories 
seeking to find what makes for success in a new business a 
national business organization spent three years studying nearly 
3000 companies it concluded long hours hard work and good 
service 
why are such truths forgotten perhaps because simple as they 
are they are difficult to live up to wouldbe business people 
search for short cuts others spotting a demand for short cuts 
move in to satisfy the demand 
the stock market has more theories than stocks but few of the 
theories persist 
what does endure is value real value a history of earnings 
increases the likelihood of more to come good products good 
management and fair price might be forgotten from time to time 
but in the long run it wins out 
one study after another year after year show that those who 
stick with value in good times and bad are more likely to come out 
ahead than those who fall for the popular notions and latest rages 
it is true that free economies are cyclical it has been 
demonstrated since statistics were first kept and it will likely 
continue to be so 
it is true that a very strong economy is one that could destroy 
itself the simple explanation being that no economy can run very 
long at full capacity without risking inflation 
it is true that no economic forecaster is able to accurately 
foresee the economy more than a few months in advance and that 
those who claim to be able to do so tend to make subtle adjustments 
to adapt to reality 
it is true that a little inflation is a dangerous thing because 
even three percent inflation will cut the dollar in half in 24 
years and it often true that a zeroinflation economy is an 
economy that could pitch into recession 
it is true that there are exceptions to the riskreward ratio 
that big rewards are possible with little risk and that great 
risks might produce small rewards but in time the ratio holds 
true whatever they say about junk onds 
it is often forgotten but not for long that education brains 
persistence thrift and many of the other old virtues pay off in 
the long run no matter how often that lesson is forgotten or 
scorned or buried under the latest notions 
amid the clutter there is truth

the house banking committee today postponed 
for two weeks compelling thrift executive charles h keating jr to 
testify on the collapse of his lincoln savings and loan association 
of irvine calif 
attorneys for the phoenix millionaire were served with a 
subpoena today ordering keating to appearing before the banking 
committee on nov 21 said julie black a spokeswoman for the panel 
keating originally was scheduled to testify before the committee 
on tuesday but his attorneys over the weekend requested and 
received more time for him to prepare ms black said the 
committee voted four weeks ago to subpoena keating 
the panel still plans to hear testimony tuesday from edwin gray 
former chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
lincoln a 29branch sampl subsidiary of american continental 
corp that is chaired by keating was seized by the bank board last 
april two years after federal examiners discovered that it was 
insolvent and recommended its closure 
officials expect the collapse of lincoln eventually will cost 
taxpayers up to 2 billion to cover its losses of federally insured 
deposits through unsound lending practices 
the banking committee is investigating why m danny wall 
director of the office of thrift supervision formerly known as 
the federal home loan bank board rejected a 1987 recommendation 
from his agencys san francisco office that lincoln be shut down 
gray in letters and interviews has said top bank board 
officials did not act earlier to cut lincolns losses because of 
political intervention from several senators and house members who 
had accepted more than 1 million in campaign contributions from 
keating

the us postal service said monday it has 
awarded a contract to a miami company to install credit 
cardoperated fax machines at selected post offices in the 
northeast 
under a oneyear pilot project hotelecopy inc will install 
facsimile machines in 54 post offices in new york city boston and 
providence ri it also will pay the us postal service 150 a 
month rent per location plus a percentage of revenue 
if successful fax machines eventually will be expanded to some 
8000 post offices nationwide said assistant postmaster general 
gordon c morison head of the postal services philatelic and 
retail services department 
we are now looking at our lobbies to help provide onestop 
shopping morison said he said the service should appeal to 
medium and small businesses which do not have facsimile machines 
as well as to the general public 
mci communications corp will provide the telephone connections 
said edd helms president of hotelecopy which has fax machines 
installed in more than 2000 locations around the country 
including hotels and other public places 
hotelecopy also is vying for us postal service contracts in 
four other regions of the united states where the selfservice 
machines will be tested in an additional 209 post offices starting 
early next year hotelecopy declined to specify the percentage of 
revenue that would be paid to the postal service because of its 
competitive bidding 
most of the machines will be located in post office lobbies that 
are accessible 24 hours a day morison said 
customers will be charged 1275 for approximately three minutes 
of use or the equivalent of about seven pages of copy helms said 
the machines will accept most major credit cards he said 
morison said a year would provide time to determine the market 
and the demand for facsimile services he said postal officials are 
not worried that the new fax machines will cut into overnight or 
other services currently provided by the us postal service 
yes there probably will be some diversion morison said 
but we expect that eventually it will generate even more mail 
morison said the us postal service handles approximately 500 
million pieces of mail daily 
with that kind of volume any kind of impact would be very 
minute he said 
morison said the fax machines would be similar to photocopy 
machines which have adorned many post office lobbies for years 
and as simple to use however unlike photocopy machines that are 
monitored by postal employees the fax machines will be operated 
and maintained exclusively by the contractor he said 
the first machine will be installed in the main post office in 
manhattan on tuesday

corn and soybean future prices were lower and 
wheat prices higher in light trading monday on the chicago board of 
trade 
the decline in corn and soybean prices generally reflected the 
selloff on the new york stock exchange with the dow jones 
industrial average off more than 40 points at the time trading 
ended on the board of trade said rich feltes an analyst with 
refco inc in chicago 
corn and soybean prices were also affected by reports that the 
upcoming agriculture department crop report due out thursday 
will show an increase in the size of the corn and soybean crop 
wheat prices were up marginally at the close largely on

coniston partners wants to ruffle the feathers of 
ual corp and force a payday for investors but its unclear 
whether its efforts to shake up united airlines parent will fly 
with shareholders and fractious unions analysts said monday 
coniston a new york investment group has made money from 
united before when it helped force the airlines former parent 
allegis corp to restructure in 1987 
this time coniston has formed a group named condor partners 
comprised of the coniston investors who are interested in 
chicagobased ual 
things may be more complicated the second time around in the 
wake of a failed 675 billion buyout attempt by a pilotmanagement 
group and with uniteds three largest unions seeking new contracts 
at this point all they coniston are is a 10 percent 
shareholder thats got a wish list said stephen dexter an 
airline analyst with kemper financial services inc part of the 
wish list is some sort of transaction that would involve probably 
an immediate payout to shareholders 
on friday coniston said it had accumulated a 97 percent stake 
in ual and wanted to trim uals board of directors from 16 to five 
members three of whom would be coniston principals 
if the group wins over shareholders to the plan it would be 
able to steer the company townd payoff dexter said but it does weaken 
the 
airline 
to raise the money for such a transaction ual would likely have 
to sell its planes and lease them back or borrow the money 
either option would handicap united the nations secondlargest 
airline in a fiercely competitive industry 
stock speculators who may have suffered big losses when the 
pilotmanagement proposal fell through on oct 13 would jump for 
any deal dexter predicted 
the arbitrageurs would immediately support any effort by 
coniston or anyone else to get the value of this stock back up no 
matter what it is he said 
longterm ual shareholders may be more cautious said louis a 
marckesano an analyst with janney montgomery scott inc in 
philadelphia 
i think theyre going to want to see more definite signs of 
whats behind the strategy of coniston partners he said they 
coniston havent defined what they want to do specifically enough 
to make people just jump on the bandwagon

continental airlines more than doubled its 
earnings for the third quarter partly because of the sale of some 
assets the airline announced monday 
for the three months ending sept 30 continental had net income 
of 435 million on revenue of 134 billion compared with net 
income of 152 million on revenue of 126 billion in the same 
quarter in 1988 
continental does not report earnings on a pershare basis 
because it is a whollyowned subsidiary of texas air corp in late 
august texas air chairman frank lorenzo said he was considering a 
sale of all or part of continental because its business was being 
hurt by the longrunning strike against eastern airlines the other 
big texas air subsidiary 
continentals income for the quarter includes a onetime gain of 
113 million mainly from sales of unspecified assets including 
some slots at airports said continental spokesman art kent who 
declined to be more specific 
mickey foret who was named president of houstonbased 
continental last week said in a statement the thirdquarter 
performance continues the pattern of strong financial improvement 
at continental from the difficult merger environment of the last 
two years 
our customers tell us they are pleased by what they see and 
that reaction to our service is being increasingly reflected 
directly on the bottom line he said 
texas air usually announces its financial statements to include 
both continental and sister carrier eastern but kent said texas 
air decided to release continentals earnings separately because it 
was so pleased with the results 
earnings statements from texas air and eastern which is in 
chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization are expected in several days 
he said 
for the first nine months of 1989 continental posted net income 
of 591 million on revenue of 39 billion compared with a net 
loss of 2163 million on revenue of 36 billion for the same 
period in 1988 
foret was named president when joseph corr resigned after less 
than 10 months on the job while remaining as texas air chairman 
lorenzo was named continentals chairman and chief executive 
officer positions which corr also held 
foret is the seventh continental president in as many years

closed down 11 cents at 2010 a 42gallon barrel the january 
contract ended at 1979 a barrel 8 cents lower

gallon while wholesale unleaded gasoline for december gained 033 
cent to 5246 cents a gallon contracts for later delivery also

concern about escalating production by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries recent estimates have put opec 
output at 225 million barrels a day or more in october and some 
analysts predict that prices could begin to suffer as supply 
outstrips demand on world markets

lawyers for dalkon shield victims said 
monday that there would be no further challenge to a 25 billion 
trust fund established by the manufacturer of the birthcontrol 
device after the us supreme court rejected their appeals 
the group which represented about 650 of the more than 300000 
women likely to share in the trust has 25 days to ask the high 
court for a rehearing but alan b morrison lead lawyer for the 
claimants said it would be futile 
it always was an uphill battle we fought we did what our 
clients wanted us to do and we have no regrets said morrison of 
the public citizen litigation group in washington dc 
the group had contended that the trust settlement wrongly barred 
future lawsuits against officials of ah robins co maker of the 
dalkon shield intrauterine device and that the 25 billion may 
not be enough money to compensate all victims 
but the supreme court rejected that challenge monday with one 
dissenting vote 
roscoe e puckett jr a spokesman for richmondbased robins 
said if the group does not seek a rehearing it will be over 
puckett said the company could soon complete its federal 
bankruptcy reorganization and planned merger with american home 
products corp a new yorkbased consumer products company the 
merger is scheduled to become finalized by next month 
some of the dalkon shield victims also expressed relief with the 
supreme courts decision 
i never saw the possibility of getting any more money than we 
already had and i really hated to take a chance on losing that 
money said linda hightower director of the dalkon shield 
victims association in atlanta 
if we had lost that money it would have taken us anywhere 
from one to five years to get back to the point to where we are 
michael sheppard director of the trusts claims resolution 
facility said the trust will receive the money by middecember he 
said the trust has set the end of february as a target date to send 
a packet of information and a questionnaire to people with 
outstanding claims 
well start paying as soon as those packets come back with the 
full questionaire filled out and the necessary medical records 
sheppard said well probably be paying some claims in march 
marketed in the early 1970s the dalkon shield allegedly caused 
infertility spontaneous abortions pelvic inflammation or in some 
cases death 
sheppard said 42 percent of the claims already have been paid 
through the first of four options available to claimants under 
that option women who suffered minor injuries from the dalkon 
shield receive 725 a husband or child injured as a result of the 
birth control device can receive 300 and those whose claims 
involve conflicting information can receive 125 
no claims have been paid under the other options 
option two is for people whose injuries require a limited review 
of medical records option three is for more seriously injured 
claimants whose injuries will require a full review of medical 
records sheppard said 
under option four claimants who believe their injuries will get 
worse or who believe an injury has not manifested itself can defer 
a review of medical records he said 
many of these women have been waiting for years for resolution 
of their claims sheppard said this is a major step forward

japanese companies are building plants in this 
country to ride us coattails into european markets in the next 
decade texas oilman t boone pickens said monday 
pickens also told a news conference at the national press club 
that legislation may be needed to restrict japanese investment in 
this country until the japanese open up their financial markets 
i think youre going to have to do something about closing 
these markets until you can get some adjustment from the 
japanese said pickens who later testified before a senate 
subcommittee on usjapanese trade relations 
at the news conference pickens said the japanese want their 
americanmade products to be considered american after 
intereuropean trade barriers come down after 1992 
it is expected that noneuropean countries will have a tougher 
time selling their goods there however 
the japanese are very astute pickens told a news conference 
the japanese are building plants in the united states to coattail 
the united states into european markets in 1992 
he added that the japanese will have a hard time selling in 
european markets and this way they can move into those markets as 
americanmade 
pickens also said his problems with koito manufacturing co a 
japanese auto headlight maker is symbolic of the current trade 
relations between the united states and japan 
pickens known for his often hostile raids on us companies 
has been battling with the management of koito for representation 
on its board 
he complained that despite a 26 percent stake in the company he 
has been denied a seat on the board even though toyota the 
japanese carmaker has three seats with only a 19 percent share of 
the company 
pickens maintained that koito is really a subsidiary of toyota 
he repeated his assertion that his purchase of koito stock was 
purely for investment 
we would never do anything to damage the company said 
pickens denying that he planned a green mail campaign in 
which a corporate raider buys a companys stock in hopes the 
company will buy the shares back at a higher price than is 
generally available to other shareholders

steel and defense contractor ltv corp reported 
monday its profit for the third quarter jumped significantly 
because of a 134 billion charge against earnings last year 
though its operating income declined 
ltv which is operating under bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors said its net income was 857 million or 68 cents per 
share in the quarter ended sept 30 compared with a loss of 124 
billion or 1203 per share in the same quarter last year 
revenue declined from 171 billion in last years third quarter 
to 151 billion primarily due to the exclusion of revenue from 
the companys steel bar division which is being sold 
last years results included a 134 billion charge to cover 
future pension obligations the charge is related to the companys 
chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
operating income dropped from 776 million last year to 374 
million as aircraft products posted a 271 million loss and steel 
profits fell from 809 million to 606 million 
ltvs steel business was stable but produced results that 
were lower than in 1988 said chairman raymond a hay our 
aerospace and defense units continued to incur increased costs 
associated with fixedprice contracts but we have taken steps

congressional inaction on a bill raising the 
federal debt ceiling forced the treasury to postpone its weekly 
bill auction monday and threatened the government with its first 
default in history 
the treasury had planned to offer 16 billion in three and 
sixmonth bills monday but postponed the sale because congress 
has not completed action on legislation to increase the statutory 
debt limit 
the treasury lost further borrowing authority oct 31 when the 
debt limit reverted from 287 trillion to 2 trillion because it 
already has reached the lower limit the government faces default 
on some of its debt as early as thursday 
congressional leaders spent much of monday behind closed doors 
looking to break the stalemate that has blocked passage of the 
higher debt ceiling and a big deficitreduction bill 
we have decided to concentrate on extension of the debt 
ceiling while we are looking at other issues house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash told reporters he said leaders are 
hoping to pass a new debt ceiling in time for president bush to 
sign it on wednesday 
foley indicated that one major issue to be resolved is whether 
legislation repealing or scaling back catatstrophic health coverage 
for retirees should be attached to the debtceiling bill or 
considered as part of the deficitreduction package 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said last week that if 
congress fails to increase the limit by tuesday the government 
will run out of cash and default on nov 9 when about 138 
billion in treasury bills mature 
each day that congress fails to act however will cause 
additional disruption in our borrowing schedule possibly resulting 
in higher interest costs to the taxpayer brady said in a speech 
to maryland bankers 
to avoid these potential costs and the prospect of default 
immediate congressional action is imperative 
the house has passed a 31 trillion debt ceiling but action 
has been stalled in the senate by republican demands that it be 
accompanied by enactment of a capital gains tax cut a top priority 
for president bush 
the white house abandoned that effort thursday and democratic 
and gop senate leaders were discussing legislation monday to 
increase the limit however any bill approved by the senate likely 
would differ from the house version and efforts to reach a 
compromise would require additional time 
michael basham deputy assistant treasury secretary told 
reporters last week that plans for 40 billion in additional 
borrowing this week probably would have to be postponed if congress 
doesnt complete action on a new debt limit by tuesday 
these auctions include 10 billion in threeyear notes tuesday 
10 billion in 10year notes wednesday and 10 billion in 30year 
bonds thursday in addition the treasury plans to sell 10 billion 
in 36day cash management bills thursday 
lack of congressional action forced the treasury last wednesday 
to suspend new sales of us savings bonds and of special 
securities for state and local governments 
the special securities are temporary investment vehicles for 
money those governments raise in the bond market if the securities 
are not available state and local governments could be forced to 
cancel planned bond sales leading to disruption of the municipal 
bond market

the supreme court on monday removed the last 
legal obstacle to carrying out a 25 billion settlement for 
victims of the dalkon shield birthcontrol device 
but compensatory payments may not begin until next spring and 
no one could say definitively how many of the nearly 100000 women 
with active claims will receive substantial payments 
the justices over one dissenting vote rejected a challenge by 
some 650 women to the settlement reached out with ah robins co 
manufacturer of the intrauterine device 
marketed in the early 1970s the dalkon shield allegedly caused 
infertility spontaneous abortions pelvic inflammation or in some 
cases death 
sharon lutz a detroit lawyer representing 18000 of the women 
who had sued robins and who had urged the court to uphold the 
settlement said payments might start by late february or early 
march 
its been a long long struggle for a terrible terrible 
tragedy she said but todays great news marks the beginning 
of the end 
baltimore lawyer michael pretl who also represented women who 
alleged injuries said payments may be delayed for several months 
beyond the february target date 
i dont think its realistic to expect well have money 
flowing before next spring pretl said predicting that 
individual women with serious injuries will receive payments 
ranging from 25000 to 250000 
pretl said that many thousands of women with active claims may 
get relatively little money for varying reasons for example they 
may have used more than one brand of device he said 
and most women who will receive substantial awards likely will 
have to pay onethird to their lawyers 
sales of the dalkon shield ended in 1974 but the product was not 
actually recalled until 1984 ah robins based in richmond va 
created the 25 billion trust fund as part of its 1985 
reorganization under federal bankruptcy law 
the bankruptcy was sparked by thousands of lawsuits by women who 
had used the device 
some 9000 cases were settled before the bankruptcy declaration 
the range of payments made under those settlements are serving as a 
model for a fourmember committee that will decide the size of 
individual awards 
appointed by us district judge robert merhige of richmond the 
committee is chaired by georgine vairo of the fordham university 
law school in new york 
the challenge acted on monday contended that the settlement 
wrongly bars future lawsuits against ah robins officials and 
others and that 25 billion may not be enough money to compensate 
all victims 
only justice byron r white voted to grant full review to those 
arguments 
under the bankruptcy reorganization plan american home products 
corp a new yorkbased business has agreed to buy ah robins and 
fund the trust that takeover is expected to become final dec 2 
ah robins stockholders will receive 700 million worth of 
american home stock making the acquisition price 32 billion 
ah robins spokesman roscoe e puckett jr said the company 
is very pleased that the way finally has been cleared for 
consummation of its reorganization plan 
in all more than 300000 women filed claims against ah 
robins about 15000 in lawsuits about a dozen women saw their 
cases go to trial and won multimilliondollar awards the highest 
being 92 mllion such trials were barred after the bankruptcy 
reorganization 
bradley post who won the record 92 million judgment in 
wichita kan said about 100000 claims were eliminated without 
payment for one reason or another and as many as 80000 settled 
with payments of 300 to 750 
but pretl said women who believe they suffered injury by using a 
dalkon shield who have not yet sued or been included in the case 
may still have legal recourse 
i would encourage people to continue to come forward if they 
still have serious claims he said adding that such women may 
share in a supplemental trust fund established by ah robins 
insurer aetna casualty and surety co 
in other action monday the court 
agreed to decide in a case from illinois whether lawsuits 
charging employers with violating a key federal antibias law must 
be filed in federal not state courts 
said it will decide in an idaho case whether money given 
directly to mormon missionaries by church members is a deductible 
donation under federal tax law 
turned down the appeal of a rhode island woman threatened with 
jail if she lets her boyfriend stay overnight while her children 
are in the house 
agreed to decide in a new york case whether a motorist who 
pleads guilty to drunken driving and related traffic offenses in a 
fatal car crash later may be prosecuted for homicide and assault 
rejected the appeal of a woman who says she is hank williams 
srs daughter and should share in the late country music legends

ryder system inc common stock rose more than 5 
percent in a down market monday amid speculation that the 
transportation services company might be the target of a takeover 
by itel corp a chicagobased transportation concern 
takeover rumors came after itel filed notice that it plans to 
acquire at least 15 million in ryder common stock the stock rose 
125 to close at 2275 
analysts said the stocks rise was fueled by itels planned 
purchase and occurred in a market in which the dow jones industrial 
average closed down 47 points 
its not extraordinary but its a pretty big jump in one day 
given that the market is down significantly said bob bernstein 
an analyst with edward d jones in st louis 
ryders board believes it is in the miamibased companys best 
longterm interest to continue as an independent company said m 
anthony burns ryders chairman president and chief executive 
officer 
itel spokeswoman gloria waber said she had no comment on the 
filing and ryder had nothing to add to a short news release issued 
monday containing burns statement 
but analysts said itels intended purchase of about 700000 of 
ryders 76 million outstanding shares could boost the stock price 
and renew takeover talk 
its not buying the whole company by any means but their 
investment indicates interest and at a reasonable price 
bernstein said 
the move by itel which has rail and shipping interests could 
be a precursor to additional itel purchases of ryder stock and make 
other investors take notice he said 
itels stock closed down 37 cents a share at 2125 on the new 
york stock exchange 
ryders relatively low stock price may be driving itels 
interest said analyst andrew geller of provident national bank in 
philadelphia 
whenever it gets down to this level this talk comes up 
more he said but its been talked about as a takeover 
candidate for the last couple of years 
ryder rents and leases trucks and vans to the commercial and 
consumer markets and provides aircraft maintenance and insurance 
management services it earned 79 million in the year ended sept 
30 on revenue of 51 billion

warehousing it also owns minority interests in santa fe pacific

end to the machinists union strike against boeing co contract 
talks collapsed over the weekend and no movement was evident monday

workers to vote on the contract offer boeing spokesman harold

from it 
federal mediator douglas hammond said no new talks were 
scheduled and he didnt anticipate any this week union spokesman

the companys offer rejected by union members oct 3 included 
annual pay raises of 4 percent 3 percent and 3 percent with 
bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 percent 
in the second 
the revised offer on the table saturday contained the same wage 
increases with bonuses of 10 percent 4 percent and 4 percent the 
additional bonus money was offset by lower costofliving 
provisions and lower company contributions to some insurance 
payments 
retirement benefits would have been increased across the board 
in the revised offer while other benefits would remain the same as 
in the previous offer boeing also would have paid health premiums 
for november which striking workers now must pay or go without 
coverage

144 hours per quarter and assured workers at least every third 
weekend off the previous offer called for 160 hours of mandatory 
overtime and a maximum of three weekends in a row
