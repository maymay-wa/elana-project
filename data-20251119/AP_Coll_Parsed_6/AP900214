drexel burnham lambert incs parent company 
filed for bankruptcy court protection late tuesday signaling the 
demise of the wall street firm that came to symbolize quick riches 
and scandal in the 1980s 
drexel burnham lambert group incs board of directors 
authorized the move to seek protection from creditors under chapter 
11 of the federal bankruptcy code the drexel burnham lambert inc 
brokerdealer subsidiary and drexel government securities inc were 
not included in the filing 
the step climaxed one of the most tumultuous periods in wall 
street history for the cocksure investment house which pioneered 
the use of risky highinterest junk bonds to finance billions 
of dollars worth of corporate takeovers under nowindicted 
executive michael milken 
it also could have broad effects far from wall street on 
companies that have invested in drexels junk bonds pension funds 
that hold the securities and businesses attempting to pay off junk 
debt 
drexel was crippled by the governments insider trading 
investigation in which it pleaded guilty to six felonies and paid 
650 million to settle fraud charges milkens subsequent departure 
amid criminal allegations against him and the collapse of the 
junkbond market which drexel still dominates contributed to the 
firms troubles 
this means the end of drexel burnham as a viable entity 
said a former executive at drexel which used its junk bond 
business to catapult from a thirdtier brokerage to the nations 
fifthlargest in under a decade 
drexel burnham lambert group inc said tuesday it had defaulted 
on about 100 million in loans and a lack of cash threatened other 
defaults drexel was turned down for bank financing it sought to 
avert the filing 
drexel said in a statement that the petition for reorganization 
cites liabilities exceeding 3 billion and assets exceeding 36 
billion the bankruptcy filing was made late tuesday at the home of 
a us bankruptcy court clerk outside new york the firm said 
chief executive frederick joseph told employees tuesday morning 
the parent company and certain subsidiaries would file for chapter 
11 which would protect drexel from creditors claims while it 
attempted to deal with its shattered finances 
workers later were told they would be paid thursday but drexel 
could guarantee nothing more 
few on wall street believe drexel will survive many stock and 
bond traders refused outright to do business with drexel on 
tuesday and stock exchange specialists said drexel brokers were 
openly soliciting jobs on the new york stock exchange floor during 
the day 
the firm began liquidating its positions in billions of dollars 
worth of government bonds mortgagebacked securities and other 
financial instruments negotiated to transfer customer accounts to 
smith barney harris upham amp co withdrew as a market maker in 
more than 200 overthecounter stocks and put entire business 
units up for sale 
wall street professionals said shock waves from drexels 
disclosure were muted because its crippling financial problems had 
been anticipated and the decline of its junk bond business known 
for months 
also drexel said monday it was seeking an investor or merger 
partner to help prevent its collapse 
wary of the broader impact of drexels possible collapse the 
securities and exchange commission federal reserve board and nyse 
coordinated plans on how to prevent a financial panic over the 
firms troubles 
the sec said it had moved to protect the assets of the 
brokerdealer subsidiary by barring it from transferring net 
capital to the parent without specific approval the federal 
reserve bank of new york said it would monitor drexels decision to 
liquidate its government securities positions 
drexels downfall may have been sudden but so was its rise 
during the bullish 1980s 
the highflying firm made gargantuan profits in its heyday 
close to 1 billion before taxes in 1986 and paid its employees 
accordingly milken personally made more than 1 billion from 
198387 
its attitude toward financing was embodied by brash letters 
telling clients it was highly confident it could raise hundreds 
of millions of dollars during corporate takeover battles and by 
its annual junkbond conference known as the predators ball 
but the luster began fading in 1986 when the sec arrested 
drexel investment banker dennis levine on insidertrading charges 
in a highly publicized investigation that later snared drexel 
other employees and an investment firm it did business with 
princetonnewport partners 
in late 1988 drexel agreed to plead guilty to criminal activity 
rather than face a crippling racketeering indictment milken was 
indicted last year on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering and 
forced to leave the firm 
some wall street professionals not all drexel supporters 
contend the critical factors that crippled drexel were the criminal 
settlement and the departure of milken who almost singlehandedly 
managed the 200 billion junk bond market 
theyre going bankrupt not because of economics but because of 
politics a milken associate said they made a deal 
ultimately a deal they werent able to survive 
drexel also agreed to unprecedented government supervision in 
settling civil securities fraud charges and paid more than 40 
million to settle claims with states although it still faces civil 
litigation nationwide 
in a costcutting restructuring following its settlements 
drexel quit the retail brokerage business and cut its work force to 
5300 from a peak of 10700 the firm had a net loss of about 40 
million last year

leftist guerrillas kidnapped two 
americans tuesday to protest president bushs visit for a drug 
summit and said they would put their captives on trial police 
said one was later released 
also tuesday antibush demonstrators took to the streets in 
cartagena where about 1000 leftist union members marched and in 
the capital bogota where police fired tear gas at rockthrowing 
students as about 100 marched downtown no injuries were reported 
on tuesday night members of the powerful medellin drug cartel 
said in a statement that they will give up their three largest 
cocaine laboratories with a combined monthly production capacity of 
21 tons 
a caracol radio network report said the extraditables told a 
group of journalists in medellin where the laboratories and 
chemicals are located but as of early wednesday none of the 
facilities was reported found 
the americans abducted in medellin were identified as david 
kent a 40yearold teacher from indianapolis and james archer 
donnelly a 65yearold businessman from detroit who was kidnapped 
his colombian wife police said 
donnelly and his wife were released unhurt at 1030 am said 
lt eusabio guerrero a police spokesman from medellin they were 
released about three hours after their kidnapping said an official 
at the school where kent teaches 
the official at the governmentfunded colombo american 
institute speaking on condition of anonymity said donnelly was 
told by his captors that they were leftist guerrillas and had taken 
the action to protest bushs visit thursday for a fournation drug 
summit 
the kidnappings were certain to fuel concerns already high 
over bushs security during the summit two us ships are 
patrolling off the colombian coast the uss nassau an 820foot 
amphibious assault ship that carries helicopters and an 1700man 
marine landing team and the uss sampson a 437foot destroyer 
according to the pentagon 
in washington the state department confirmed the kidnappings 
but said donnelly was kidnapped monday night it had no immediate 
confirmation on his reported release 
the colombian radio network caracol said its medellin station 
received a telephone call from an anonymous man claiming to be a 
spokesman for leftist guerrillas who claimed responsibility for 
the abductions 
the caller said the men would be put on trial and would be 
released in five days caracol said he did not explain why there 
would be a trial or why the men would be released 
police said kent he has lived in medellin for several years 
donnelly runs a company called exco that manufactures hydraulic 
equipment the police spokesman said on condition of anonymity he 
said he had no further details on the men 
the spokesman said the kidnappers were from the national 
liberation army a leftist guerrilla group known by its initials 
in spanish as the eln 
there was no way to confirm if the kidnapppers really are 
leftist guerrillas drug traffickers have been found in the past 
posing as leftist insurgents 
colombian police who have fought nearly a sixmonth war with 
drug traffickers said monday night they had seized more than three 
tons of dynamite and almost 5 million in raids on traffickers 
hideouts 
the dynamite was seized near medellin in raids on two 
trafficking hideouts the director of colombias national police 
gen miguel gomez told the news conference 
since the government declared war on traffickers aug 18 the 
drug lords have committed 262 terrorist acts mostly bombings that 
have killed 209 people 
the bombings include the downing of a colombian airliner in 
which 107 people were killed 
in the past month the traffickers have claimed in communiques 
that they want a truce with the government and are willing to 
dismantle their drug business if the government will stop 
extraditing them to the united states 
fourteen suspected traffickers have been extradited to the 
united states in the last five months 
us ambassador to colombia thomas mcnamara speaking at a news 
conference tuesday in cartagena would not comment on possible 
negotiations with the traffickers he said such talks proposed by 
the traffickers are an internal matter for the colombian 
government 
president virgilio barco has said repeatedly he will never 
negotiate with the drug lords 
during his news conference mcnamara bristled at repeated 
questions over bushs security 
speaking of the colombian government he said i think what 
they resent is the fact that they seem not to be able to get 
you to come off the security aspect and to address the real 
substance of the summit 
but us officials have decided there is so much danger that 
bush must fly into barranquilla 85 miles away then helicopter 
into a heavily guarded navy base and spend only six hours in 
cartagena 
there has been little violence by traffickers in cartagena but 
it has been enough not only to alarm bushs aides but to turn away 
thousands of american tourists who usually come each winter 
a bomb exploded oct 26 killing two tourists in their hotel 
room 
eight years ago two men posing as hotel workers forced two us 
drug agents out of the cartagena hilton at gunpoint took them into 
the countryside shot them and left them for dead the agents 
survived

the history of salmonfishing in the 
stormy north pacific is filled with tales of brave fishermen riding 
the wild seas but its future is being shaped in calmer waters 
thousands of salmon in this sheltered arm of puget sound are 
captives in sunken pens the size of basketball courts crowded fin 
to fin they swim endless laps gobbling feed pellets and being 
fattened toward the day theyll be scooped up and whisked to market 
yet while the crenulated coastline and pristine waters that 
stretch from washingtons puget sound to southeastern alaska might 
be ideal for fish farming the political climate is not so 
welcoming 
in alaska where commercial fishermen are a powerful lobby 
bumper stickers in fishing towns proclaim real fish dont eat 
pellets and the legislature is considering a permanent ban on 
fish farms when a twoyear moratorium expires in july 
in washington state salmon farmers have the official blessing 
of the legislature but that has helped little in the face of 
challenges from fishermen and environmental groups which have 
defeated several proposed farms 
the fish waste produced by a twoacre salmon farm is equivalent 
to the sewage produced by a town of 5000 people claims a 
washington citizens group called the marine environmental 
consortium 
environmentalists also fear introduced species such as atlantic 
salmon favored because they fetch a higher price and are more 
docile than pacific salmon will corrupt the local gene pool and 
spread disease wealthy owners of shoreside homes meanwhile dont 
want fish farms spoiling their views 
promoters call fish farming an efficient way to help meet the 
worlds growing appetite for fish not only does it provide a 
yearround supply of fresh salmon to supplement the seasonal wild 
catch they say it also creates jobs free of the hazards of 
commercial fishing one of the nations most dangerous occupations 
they also contend salmonfarming provides an economic incentive 
to preserve clean water 
were the best environmentalists of all because were 
dependent on it said jerry polley site manager for global aqua 
the nations largest salmon farm if somethings wrong with the 
water quality were going to be the first to complain 
production of farmed salmon here and abroad has boomed in five 
years flooding markets traditionally held by wild salmon and 
driving down prices 
for the first couple of years as more salmon was around on a 
yearround basis the farmed fish seemed to help the wild market 
said commercial fisherman randy babich now its a battle at the 
retail counter 
fish farming or aquaculture is hardly a new concept for 
years farmers have raised oysters in the northwest rainbow trout 
in idaho and catfish in the southeast but techniques have 
developed more slowly in domesticating salmon the mainstay of 
fisheries off oregon washington british columbia and alaska 
for years it was practiced only by the norwegians forced into 
salmon farming by their declining wild fish populations but 
interest has spread quickly since 1985 after norway refined 
methods to raise salmon cheaply enough to compete with the wild 
catch 
in 1983 world production of farmed salmon was 23500 metric 
tons just 3 percent of the 670000ton wild salmon catch by last 
year farmed salmon production had soared to an estimated 202000 
tons or 30 percent of the relatively constant wild catch 
norway still leads the pack producing about 75 percent of the 
worlds farmed salmon but other places including scotland chile 
canada and iceland are catching up the united states with 50 
fish farms in washington state and maine lags far behind 
producing 1 percent of the total 
many of the us salmon farms are run by norwegian companies 
including global aquas fouracre operation in rich passage 10 
miles west of seattle 
global aquas farm is fairly typical a huge raft anchored 
offshore holds 40 pens each lined with a net holding up to 15 tons 
of fish which range from fingersize smolts to fatbellied salmon 
2 feet long 
a halfdozen workers tend the pens from metal walkways filling 
automatic feeders and mending nets at harvest workers herd fish 
into one end of the pens scoop them out with an oversize dipnet 
and load them onto a boat the salmon are still kicking when they 
reach a seattle processing plant 30 minutes away 
in the three years it takes to raise salmon to harvest farmers 
contend with prowling otters hungry sea lions and diseases that 
can wipe out whole farms if left unchecked 
aquaculturists say their operations will never be a major blot 
on the coastline 
it would take just 40 acres of farms to produce all of the 
salmon that was imported into the united states in 1988 said 
chris gibson of sea farm washington in port angeles the industry 
does not need a lot of space 
it may need even less space in coming months worldwide growth 
of salmon farming and recent overproduction in norway have glutted 
the market with fish prices have plunged and many farms are 
selling below cost just to keep cash flowing 
in british columbia lax regulation and a surge of norwegian 
investment capital helped the number of fish farms soar from five 
to 135 in the last six years but now many are in trouble nineteen 
have filed for receivership in the past year and small businesses 
are being bought out by large investors better able to outlast the 
lull in prices 
aquaculture boosters profess confidence in their longterm place 
in the salmon trade 
declining stocks of wild salmon already have forced northwest 
fishermen to rely more heavily on fish that are started in 
shoreside hatcheries and released to sea about 23 percent of 
alaskas wild catch now comes from hatcheries while some 
salmon populations off washingtons coast are 60 percent 
hatcheryreared 
were not going to reestablish the wild resource you just 
dont have the habitat for them to come back to said john pitts 
who promotes aquaculture for the washington department of 
agriculture future generations will become more dependent on 
aquaculture 
perhaps but as long as any wild salmon remain some 
independentminded fishermen will take their chances on the high 
seas rather than turn in their rain slickers for bags of fish chow 
its the cromagnon in us said randy babich fishing is 
one of the last huntinggathering professions in the world tossing 
feed into a pond just doesnt provide the same adventure

what does it take to become a princess it takes 
class lots of them nearly every day 
during the next month 13 carefully selected tutors will try to 
instill a royal aura in kiko kawashima a college student who will 
wed emperor akihitos younger son in june 
with a notebook clutched to her chest and her hair pulled back 
in a ponytail miss kawashima arrived at the palace tuesday morning 
in a black chauffeurdriven limousine to begin her princess 
studies 
the first class on the agenda was religious rites and coronation 
ceremonies the teacher was torahiko nagazumi a former chamberlain 
and classmate of the late emperor hirohito 
miss kawashimas curriculum worked out by the imperial 
household agency will cover eight topics classical poetry 
calligraphy japanese history palace rituals laws related to the 
imperial family the imperial system the constitution and 
religious ceremonies 
the quiet 23yearold who already has won over the nation with 
her shy smile is to attend 28 hours of classes spread out over the 
next month many japanese women also attend classes before getting 
married but for most flower arrangement cooking and the tea 
ceremony are the popular subjects 
the palace timed the classes to coincide with spring vacation at 
the prestigious gakushuin university where miss kawashima is a 
graduate student of psychology and where her father teaches 
economics 
the briefness of her royal studies empress michikos lasted 
nearly twice as long reflects the omission of english since she 
learned that language while living in the united states as a child 
and as the wife of prince aya who is second in line to the 
throne less will be required of her than of the woman who marries 
ayas elder brother crown prince naruhito 
the government plans to spend roughly 1 million on the june 29 
wedding for miss kawashima and aya who is 24 
naruhito has said he would like to marry by the age of 30 but 
he will reach that landmark later this month and is having trouble 
finding a suitable mate 
a recent article in a conservative weekly magazine shukan 
shincho expressed fear that because of miss kawashimas lack of 
noble background 28 hours will not be enough time to prepare her 
for the highly organized and traditionbound life of a princess 
tabloids meanwhile have warned miss kawashima to be wary of 
members of the old nobility who reportedly have made life in the 
palace difficult for empress michiko michiko the magazines 
report is seen as an outsider because she was the first commoner 
to marry into the royal family 
miss kawashima will be the second 
but a palace source said changes in the curriculum were made to 
suit the times 
the substitution of constitutional studies for etiquette has 
been heralded by japans media as a reflection of a promise emperor 
akihito to uphold the often controversial document akihito made 
the promise shortly after succeeding hirohito who died last year 
under the constitution written mainly by usled occupation 
authorities after world war ii japans monarch is a symbol 
with little more than a ceremonial role 
rightwing extremists who revere the monarch as a living god 
have demanded that the constitution be rewritten to restore prewar 
clauses that referred to the emperor as divine 
leftists insist that the postwar basic law should have abolished 
the monarchy altogether

un food relief operations in northern ethiopia 
have been suspended due to the fighting between eritrean rebels and 
government forces around the strategic port of massawa an official 
said 
rebels of the eritrean peoples liberation front last week 
claimed to have captured control of massawa the larger of two 
ports on ethiopias red sea coast 
relief organizations ship most of their food aid to massawa for 
eventual distribution by land to northern ethiopia where an 
estimated 4 million people are afflicted by drought mostly in the 
warravaged provinces of eritrea and tigre 
we dont know what will happen in the long term said paul 
mitchell of the romebased world food program that would only be 
speculation 
he said wfp headquarters has been unable to make contact with 
its 200 staff members in eritrea in the past few days 
he said about 50000 tons of food is currently stored in massawa 
awaiting distribution about 20000 tons came from the world food 
program and the rest from various donors and government 
organizations 
getting food supplies to drought victims was a problem even 
before the new round of fighting began in massawa mitchell said 
it wasnt possible to reach all the people affected but we 
did reach some he said but now this situation has caused for 
the moment even a suspension of that 
fessahazion petros representative of the eritrean rebels in 
rome said the group had attacked the port because ethiopia uses it 
to ship arms to government troops in the area 
he said the rebels who have been fighting for independence for 
their former italian colony since 1962 could distribute the relief 
supplies themselves 
if the food aid has not been destroyed in the fighting i 
think our combatants can distribute it to the population petros 
said

like an important head of 
state nelson mandela has been surrounded by dozens of beefy 
bodyguards in smart suits and sunglasses since he emerged from 
prison 
the african national congress has taken responsibility for 
mandelas safety publicly rejecting government offers of 
assistance anc activists have been mobilized to provide security 
for mandela despite short notice and little if any formal training 
when mandela addressed a wildly cheering crowd of about 120000 
people on his return tuesday to his home town of soweto he was 
guarded by about 30 big powerfullooking guards as mandela called 
for a new south africa the guards intently watched the crowd with 
binoculars for any threat 
the only sign of government security tuesday for mandela was a 
group of black municipal police on motorcycles who escorted his 
motorcade black green and gold anc flags fluttered on the police 
motorcycles 
it is an ironic turnabout for the man who until sunday was 
watched over by prison guards mandela was released after 27 years 
in some of south africas toughest jails for fighting the 
whiteminority government 
mandela faces serious threats both from white rightwing 
extremists and from rival black groups unhappy about his more 
moderate politics according to government security officials 
white extremists have been making threats against mandela for 
years and his safety is a major concern now that he is free said 
the officials who spoke on condition they not be identified 
some 2000 militants of the neonazi afrikaner resistance 
movement armed with guns whips and knives marched through 
pretoria saturday yelling hang mandela 
we are going to kill mandela and all his kind said one man 
brandishing a leather whip 
some leftwing black groups are reported to be unhappy with 
mandelas desire to end white rule peacefully through negotiation 
and south african intelligence has detected possible threats to his 
life the government officials said 
anc officials refuse to discuss arrangements for mandelas 
security saying that would compromise his safety they also 
declined to say where the phalanx of bodyguards came from and 
whether or not they are armed 
but security appears to be a major problem in the scenes of wild 
jubilation that greet mandela wherever he goes crowd control 
arrangements often break down and one person was killed and scores 
injured sunday in fighting in cape town as mandela made his first 
speech after leaving prison 
it has been a real nightmare said a marshall trying to 
control the crowd tuesday in soweto 
about 1000 marshals young men who belong to groups that 
support the anc controlled the crowd tuesday and also were 
involved in security marshals frisked people and searched vehicles 
coming into the stadium 
once marshal displayed a pistol and two knives he had taken from 
spectators 
mandela announced plans tuesday to visit colleagues in zambia 
and sweden as soon as possible there was no word on who will 
provide security when mandela leaves south africa

a woman who pleaded guilty to beating her 
22monthold son to death because of his constant crying received a 
life prison sentence and a stinging lecture from the judge 
perhaps the greatest blessing is that you will not be able to 
bear more children circuit judge lynn tepper told mary lee 
collins after her plea monday to a firstdegree murder charge in 
the death of her son joshua 
tepper said she reviewed photographs of joshuas emaciated and 
battered body and told ms collins she thought a jury would likely 
have recommended the death penalty had the case gone to trial 
ms collins will instead spend at least 25 years behind bars 
before becoming eligible for parole 
later in a jailhouse interview ms collins maintained she is 
not the babykiller she is made out to be 
i dont want people thinking of me as a monster that killed 
her son she said thats not who i am i love my kids i 
dont want anybody to think im saying oh i never hurt my kid 
i was mother teresa im not 
when she was arrested for killing joshua she already was on 
probation for abusing him his death put the state department of 
health and rehabilitative services under fire for sending joshua 
back to his mother less than a month before he died 
the case was the first of a series in which children died of 
abuse despite being under the supervision of agency caseworkers 
the cases include the muchpublicized pottytraining death of 
2yearold bradley mcgee of lakeland last july his parents face 
firstdegree murder charges 
joshua died from a massive head injury nov 25 1988 just hours 
after ms collins gave birth to a third boy 
the 22yearold zephyrhills woman told police she kicked joshua 
two days before he died 
she told police she had had enough of his constant crying 
ms collins also received 15 years for child abuse and five 
years for probation violation to be served at the same time

angry teachers boycotted classrooms by the 
thousands across the state tuesday and staged a mass nighttime 
rally in which they jeered gov booth gardner when he rejected 
their call for higher salaries 
this is not the session to talk about additional salaries 
the democratic governor told teachers who packed the rotunda of the 
state capitol 
about 13000 teachers walked off their jobs in 35 of the states 
296 school districts giving an estimated 200000 students a play 
day the washington education association said 
teachers are getting a 10 percent pay boost over two years but 
insist that 225 million of a 611 million budget surplus should be 
used to double the increase new state tax revenue estimates to be 
released wednesday are expected to boost the surplus by more than 
100 million 
teachers and supporters staged rallies in seattle everett 
spokane vancouver tricities yakima and elsewhere around the 
state they included another 8000 teachers who worked all day 
in most districts the walkout was cleared with administrators 
in advance and the day will be made up at the end of the school 
year but in other schools some teachers walked off the job and 
left their classrooms to substitutes 
ill be docked 200 but i dont care said randy walden a 
social studies teacher at rogers high school in puyallup who 
traveled to olympia for the rally we felt so strongly we walked 
out 
were tired of promises said another teacher jeff page who 
teaches at lake stevens high school north of seattle ive been 
teaching 12 years and they keep saying well do better when times 
are better well booth has the money and were still last in 
line 
in washington basic education is fully funded at the state 
level and teachers are paid according to a state salary schedule 
local property taxes may be used only to pay teachers for extra 
duties 
the average teacher is paid about 31000 a year plus a 
supplemental contract of about 2000 and benefits worth about 
9100 according to the state budget office 
senate budget chairman dan mcdonald a republican said it would 
be too dangerous to use onetime windfall revenue as the basis of a 
longterm financial obligation 
gardner wants to use about onethird of the surplus as a 
reserve onethird for childrens programs and onethird for 
unexpected agency budget increases

an italian announcing plans to publish a japanese 
translation of salman rushdies novel the satanic verses was 
attacked by an angry moslem while giving a news conference police 
said 
adnan rashid a 30yearold pakistani was arrested after trying 
to hit publisher gianni palma with a microphone at the foreign 
correspondents club on tuesday a police official said 
palma ducked and assailant was subdued by security officers and 
journalists covering the news conference the official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said another 
pakistani also was arrested after a scuffle broke out nearby 
after that scuffle an ambulance was called to treat a slightly 
injured woman said press club manager nobuyoshi yamada 
raaes siddiqui vice president of the association of pakistanis 
in japan said the trouble broke out just before the conference was 
to end 
we tried to protest to him that the book blasphemes islam and 
told him not to challenge 1 billion moslems around the world 
siddiqui said i told him that if he publishes the book the 1 
billion moslems will not allow him to live 
the book is to go on sale this week 
many moslems consider the books depictions of the prophet 
mohamed and his wives blasphemous and a year ago the late iranian 
leader ayatollah khomeini called on moslems to kill rushdie 
rushdie a naturalized british citizen has been in hiding since

glenn close played a scheming marquise 
in dangerous liaisons and a dangerously scorned lady in fatal 
attraction but she was the soul of humility during a lampooning 
by harvard students 
surrounded by men dressed in drag ms close paraded through 
harvard square tuesday in the back seat of a 1947 lincoln 
continental convertible as the universitys hasty pudding 
theatricals made her their 40th woman of the year 
at the hasty pudding theater theatricals president michael 
starr and vice president jon blackstone began their roast of ms 
closes career which has included five academy award nominations 
we tried to call you you werent there blackstone said 
quoting ms close as the character she portrayed in the 1988 film 
fatal attraction 
we hate that blackstone and starr said in unison 
after all were not going to be ignored glenn said 
blackstone appropriating another line from closes role in the 
film 
the pair also gave a review of ms closes career including 
recorded quotes from her appearance in the 1970s broadway hit 
barnum 
blackstone disappeared briefly backstage to get what he said 
would be a sampling of the traditional pudding recipe but when he 
lifted the top from a steaming pot some rabbit ears popped out 
another gag from fatal attraction 
when it came time for her to honor tradition by delivering a 
fiveminute comedic monologue ms close began beating blackstone 
and starr with a bouquet of flowers 
we were joking the students said 
youve made a joke about just about everything i could 
possibly joke about said ms close 
later she said im just thrilled to be here to be part of 
this wonderful event and very very honored that you considered my 
work worthy of woman of the year i actually take it quite 
seriously 
past winners include kathleen turner lucille ball cher mamie 
eisenhower and bette midler

other films was to be honored as man of the year on feb 20

beer cans and liquor bottles soon will bear a 
more readable health warning label directed at drivers and pregnant 
women 
the warning has been required since last november but the 
initial regulations by the treasury departments bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms were criticized for allowing use of small 
hardtoread type 
so after receiving 13000 comments from the public the atf is 
publishing in the federal register today new regulations effective 
in nine months designed to make the warning more legible breweries 
and distilleries unable to meet the deadline may apply for a 
120day extension 
the complaints involved readability and thats what we think 
we have resolved with the new regulations dot koester an atf 
spokeswoman said in an interview 
were pleasantly surprised said christine lubinsky a 
spokeswoman for the national council on alcoholism and drug 
dependence which mounted a letterwriting campaign among its 
members for the changes 
given what we were seeing on bottles particularly beer there 
was a real need for the changes because most of labels were really 
bad ms lubinsky said there had been some really creative 
efforts to make the labels as illegible as possible 
obviously our industry will comply with it said james 
sanders president of the beer institute although it will 
require changing hundreds of labels on various containers 
labels on many cans and bottles already comply with the new 
more restrictive requirements sanders said 
one change ms koester said is a requirement that the words 
government warning be printed using both capital letters and 
bold type 
other changes involve larger type on larger containers and a 
limit on the number of characters per inch 
the warning reads 
government warning 1 according to the surgeon general 
women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because 
of the risk of birth defects 2 consumption of alcoholic 
beverages impairs your ability to drive a car to operate machinery 
and may cause health problems 
type sizes for one and twoliter containers remain the same 
one millimeter for capital letters on the former and two 
millimeters about the size of newsprint on the latter 
the atf increased the size of the type on threeliter containers 
to 3 millimeters or about oneeighth inch 
ms lubinsky said the atf rejected two other proposed changes 
that would require the labels to be placed in a box on the front of 
the containers the regulations permit the warning to be placed 
virtually anywhere on a bottle or can 
sens strom thurmond rsc and albert gore dtenn were 
among those criticizing the initial regulations last november 
its almost impossible to read gore had said the atf has 
purposely allowed the industry to come up with a label that is 
illegible 
thurmond and gore said the first part of the warning is 
especially necessary because many americans remain unaware that 
alcohol is the leading recognizable cause of mental retardation in 
infants 
sanders however said we still feel that the information in 
the message is common knowledge and thus the public wont be 
surprised by the information nor will sales be affected

while ronald reagan crisscrosses the country 
speaking for the abolition of the limit on presidential terms one 
of his former white house aides is spearheading a drive to impose 
such a limit on members of congress 
former oneterm rep james k coyne of pennsylvania who became 
a special assistant to thenpresident reagan after being defeated 
for reelection in 1982 announced the formation of americans to 
limit congressional terms at a news conference on tuesday 
the group wants state legislatures to pass resolutions seeking a 
constitutional convention to adopt an amendment limiting senators 
to two sixyear terms and representatives to six twoyear terms 
a similar 12year limit is proposed in an amendment introduced 
in congress by sen gordon humphrey rnh with the backing of 
sen dennis deconcini dariz and others 
rep bill frenzel rminn has introduced a measure in the 
house calling for a limit of 20 years or 10 terms for house 
members and three sixyear terms for senators it is similar to 
proposals he has introduced since 1971 
meanwhile the cato institute is issuing a study on the subject 
and the libertarian think tanks president edward h crane iii 
says he favors a limit of six years or three terms for 
representatives 
id like to see one term in the senate but im less concerned 
about the senate crane said in an interview the house is 
really the body that is supposed to be closest to the people most 
representative and therefore should have the highest turnover 
as president reagan often spoke against the twoterm limit on 
presidents imposed by the 22nd amendment and said he would like 
to campaign for its repeal after he left office 
at the former presidents office in los angeles spokesman mark 
weinberg said the proposal is still part of his standard speech 
but he knew of no organized campaign for repeal 
weinberg said reagan has been asked about proposals to limit 
terms of members of congress and has said he believes people 
should be allowed to elect whoever they want as often as they 
want 
thirtyfour state legislatures or twothirds of them must pass 
a resolution before a constitutional convention would be called 
any constitutional amendment approved by a convention or by 
congress would require approval of threefourths of the 
legislatures 
noting that 98 percent of the house incumbents on the 1988 
ballot were reelected coyne said serving in congress has 
indeed become a career job one with addictive qualities 
similar arguments often are made by republicans in their effort 
to wrest control from the democrats who now dominate both houses 
of congress but coyne and others said their movement is bipartisan 
i am not going to stand here and say the democrats are going 
to embrace this said cleta mitchell a former democratic state 
legislator from oklahoma however she said i am convinced this 
may be the longterm salvation of the democratic party and not the 
contrary 
the group said a poll it commissioned by the gallup organization 
last year showed 57 percent of americans favoring the concept with 
34 percent opposed it said republicans democrats and independents 
showed essentially the same level of support 
the announcement came a day after sen strom thurmond rsc 
announced he will seek a seventh term thurmond in a statement 
issued by his office said as long as the constitution allows 
unlimited terms a members seniority greatly influences both his 
effectiveness and ability to meet the needs of the people of his 
state

famine caused by drought and aggravated by 
civil wars threatens millions of african peasants and refugees this 
year the food and agriculture organization says 
the romebased un agency said ethiopia and sudan in eastern 
africa and mozambique and angola in the south urgently need food 
assistance 
it said favorable weather last year led to satisfactory harvests 
elsewhere but 20 countries would need help to distribute food 
within their borders or to export surpluses 
according to an agency report on food supply and crop prospects 
in subsahara africa ethiopia needs 11 million tons of emergency 
food including 770000 tons to feed about 44 million people in 
the stricken north 
about 685000 sudanese and somali refugees fleeing fighting in 
their countries would require the remaining 330000 tons 
the report said donors have pledged 400000 tons to ethiopia and 
there was an urgent need to expedite their delivery and for new 
allocations 
the fao expressed concern about getting relief food behind rebel 
lines in ethiopias rebellious tigre and eritrea provinces 
in mozambique an estimated 2 million people need 800000 tons 
of food and only four fifths of the 500000 tons pledged has 
arrived 
in sudan the report said 200000 tons of emergency food are 
needed in southern equatoria province and its neighbors kordofan 
and dafur 
an estimated 26 million angolans need 300000 tons of food and 
only 29000 tons of the pledged 150000 tons have arrived the fao 
said 
most of the needy there have been displaced by fighting between 
the rebel union for total liberation of angola and the marxist 
government

nelson mandela says whites who 
abandon apartheid will be welcome in the nonracist south africa he 
seeks to build and some have already made the transition 
terry soller a 26yearold white sang and danced tuesday along 
with the 120000strong mostly black crowd that welcomed the 
african national congress leader back to his hometown of soweto 
after 27 years in prison 
this is the first time ive felt part of the future of this 
country said ms soller we are all africans 
she waited for hours to get a glimpse of mandela and her 
tshirt expressed her support for his movement anc lives anc 
leads 
there were several hundred whites scattered among the crowd 
tuesday at soccer city the stadium on the edge of soweto the huge 
black township outside johannesburg 
soweto is less than 12 miles from johannesburg and the residents 
are quick to offer their friendship to white visitors but the 
overwhelming majority of whites in johannesburg have never seen 
soweto and they know little about the circumstances of the 25 
million people there 
there are however growing numbers of whites who reject 
apartheid and sympathize with or even embrace blackled 
organizations 
the antiapartheid democractic party won slightly more than 20 
percent of the vote in last years white elections and most leading 
opposition groups including the anc have some white members 
this is an amazing experience said pippa kapelus 27 we 
have got to be exposed to this we are just as much part of the 
history of this country as anyone else in this stadium 
most of the whites who identify with black organizations are of 
english descent and live in the cities however some afrikaners 
the dutchdescended settlers who control the government and account 
for about 3 million of south africas 5 million whites also are 
joining in

uscontrolled pacific islands are convenient 
gateways to the united states for heroin and other drugs from asia 
and the southwest pacific and the mail often is the last link in 
the smuggling chain a government document says 
federal drug interdiction on the islands is virtually 
nonexistent because of manpower shortages and cuts in antidrug 
aid to the local governments according to an internal interior 
department report and interviews with government officials 
access to the us postal and transportation system often 
contribute to making these us islands transshipment points for 
illegal drugs said the interior document calling the islands 
major concerns with regard to drug trafficking 
in american samoa for example commercial fishing boats bring 
in marijuana and heroin from australia and other pacific nations 
for mailing to us residents said the report obtained this week 
through the freedom of information act 
a local official said the islands greatest drug problem was 
with marijuana and although use of the port for heroin smuggling 
has long been suspected there has never been a heroin seizure 
we hear about heroin from intelligence sources but we have 
nothing concrete said michael sala deputy public safety 
commissioner in american samoa and executive director of a regional 
law enforcement organization 
the drug enforcement administration has just one agent 
responsible for the four pacific jurisdictions american samoa 
the northern mariana islands palau and guam the agent is based in 
guam 
there is a need for additional agents the report said 
american samoa guam and the virgin islands a caribbean 
territory also cited in the report are us territories the 
northern marianas and palau have compacts of free association with 
the united states that include interior department assistance 
nobody knows how much drugs are smuggled through the 
islands said larry l morgan director of legislative and public 
affairs for interiors territorial and international affairs 
branch but from our perspective its a serious problem 
dea officials concurred the area was ripe for smuggling 
although one said he believed a significant dent was made late last 
year in heroin traffic through palau and guam 
a dea spokesman ralph lochridge said the area was unlikely to 
get additional dea personnel soon because other areas particularly 
south america and mexico have been deemed higher priorities for 
interdiction efforts 
if you only have so many bodies its a matter of priorities 
youve got to get the most bang for your buck said lochridge 
who is based in los angeles the office that supervises guam 
obviously if we had more agents wed increase our staffing 
everywhere 
aid for local drug enforcement in the four pacific jurisdictions 
was cut by nearly 1 million in the drug law passed by congress in 
1988 
sala in a telephone interview said the cutbacks forced island 
governments to scale back their plans when all of a sudden 
things are cut you cannot expect miracles he said 
president bush included the interior departments request to 
restore the 1 million in his proposed fiscal 1991 budget 
the report praised local governments for developing antidrug 
plans but said those efforts have been hurt by shortages in money 
equipment and people 
enforcement in the virgin islands is not as big a problem 
because of dea help from puerto rico and miami according to law 
enforcement officials 
the bush administrations revised drug war strategy issued last 
month made no direct reference to the use of the four island 
nations for smuggling but it said more broadly that the pacific 
ocean is virtually unrestricted for maritime smuggling and 
relying on random patrols in such a vast body of water is 
inefficient and ineffective 
because of that the report said interdiction depends heavily 
on intelligence and inspections of ships when they reach us ports 
the source of the usbound drugs entering guam usually is 
asia with palau often serving as a stop before guam the report 
said 
this heroin has been found in some cases to be 60 percent 
pure it said 
the report also said drug use is increasingly blamed for local 
problems particularly in the virgin islands 
in those islands identified as a transshipment point for south 
american cocaine bound for the united states and elsewhere 
widespread addiction to crack in numerous housing projects exists 
and has led to increasing violence and crime the number of 
murders many directly involving the sale and use of narcotics 
tripled last year

president bush clearly relishes his 
metamorphosis from wimp to what he calls macho man even though 
he insists his trip thursday to violencetorn colombia should not 
be seen as an act of bravado 
im not going to do something stupid or macho bush 
reassured a recent audience 
although white house officials claim the president has no 
surprises up his sleeve for the drug summit even these assurances 
are being greeted with some skepticism bush in the past has proven 
adept at springing forth with surprise proposals and agendas 
his decision to ignore the concerns expressed by top aides and 
to attend the fournation conference in cartagena colombia is 
just the latest in a series of bold strokes taken by a president 
who at times has been criticized by democrats as being overly 
cautious 
bush says his decision to go to cartagena amid what may be the 
tightest military and secret service security ever assembled for a 
us president is an important symbolic gesture of solidarity with 
host president virgilio barco in his fight against the colombian 
drug cartels 
its been nearly two years since anyone seriously leveled the 
w word at bush but putting to rest the old wimp factor is 
still a recurring theme in the presidents offthecuff remarks 
i love this he told the commonwealth club in san francisco 
last week the guy they used to call timid is now macho man or 
something 
and last december the day after his stormtossed mediterranean 
summit with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev bush was asked 
at a news conference if it hadnt been too risky for him to venture 
out in a small boat 
dont tell me that that little chop was risking anything 
frankly i havent had that much fun in a long time it was 
sheer pleasure said the president 
you know these charismatic macho visionary guys theyll do 
anything he said 
on an 11 dare from his grandchildren bush stripped to his 
trousers last august and jumped into the chilly atlantic from the 
pier at his oceanfront home in kennebunkport maine 
he fishes and boats in driving rainstorms races through games 
of golf jogs in all kinds of weather and otherwise keeps up a 
wearying pace that has taken him so far to 35 states and 15 
countries 
on the policy front bush also has been known for sudden 
preemptive strikes his decision to invade panama his secret 
dispatching of top aides to china his springing of a major troop 
reduction proposal at last mays nato summit and a further 
unexpected call for troop reductions in last months state of the 
union address 
the wimp factor dogged bush early in his presidential 
effort long operating in the shadow of president reagan bush had 
become the classic no 2 man and came across to many as a bland 
figure given to gaffes and sometimes prissy remarks 
and although the image did not follow bush into the general 
election on the campaign trail he was always reliving the 
tension city of his onair combat with cbs anchorman dan rather 
in early 1988 which some political analysts saw as a defining 
event of the campaign one that helped dispel the wimp tag 
and the vice presidential candidate who in 1984 was raked over 
the coals by womens groups for bragging about having kicked a 
little of democratic opponent geraldine ferraros behind is 
still adept at showing flashes of verbal machismo 
last week after climbing into the cockpit of a b1 bomber bush 
addressed forces of the us strategic air command by radio and 
joked to crews at underground intercontinental ballistic missile 
silos to remember to keep the pointy end up 
after speaking to combatants in military exercises in the mojave 
desert he cracked and now back to war

the white house says all is calm at the 
us information agency but only after administration officials 
stepped in to restore order in a struggle with the voice of america 
the dispute that saw usia director bruce gelb try to fire voa 
director richard carlson was resolved with the voa saying it will 
try to keep broadcasting the six language services it ordered cut 
two weeks ago because of a budget crunch 
voa the governments radio network which is under usia control 
had said it would fire 57 people and trim 3 million from its 
budget by cutting its uzbek swahili lao slovenian greek and 
turkish services 
officials of usia and voa are trying to deal with a budget 
crunch that has left the radio network with a budget of about 170 
million annually but growing operating costs 
the decision to cut the six services was approved by gelb with a 
signature but he wasnt comfortable with it said gelbs 
spokesman frank johnson 
johnson said gelb was out of town the day carlson announced the 
decision two weeks ago 
when gelb returned and read news accounts of the decision he 
was very upset said a senior usia official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
gelb convened the top agency officials and he went wild 
according to a participant at the meeting he claimed he knew 
nothing about it the decision he was almost hysterical he 
claimed we tricked him said the source who also spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
gelb suggested money be taken from voas construction account to 
save the six language services said johnson 
but senior aides objected said that budget already was squeezed 
and carlson said congress already had rejected such a solution 
gelb berated carlson for failing to support him and told the voa 
chief last thursday he was fired the source said 
gelb also told aides to cancel carlsons departure for israel on 
sunday for talks with prime minister yitzhak shamir about the 
controversial construction of a 300 million voa transmitter the 
source said environmentalists object to the project which would 
amplify us transmissions to the soviet union and eastern europe 
white house personnel chief chase untermeyer met with gelb and 
carlson and said tuesday all is calm at usia since the 
meetings the white house moved in because both men are 
presidential appointees approved by the senate 
gelb is a friend of president bush and a campaign fundraiser 
carlson was held over from the reagan administration proof that 
he has our support said untermeyer 
it was agreed they would try and work out their differences 
said another source 
gelb and carlson enjoy a professional and worklike 
relationship johnson said 
carlson left for israel on tuesday meeting with voa employees 
before his departure to address rumors that hed been fired he 
has not resigned and he has not been fired said voa spokeswoman

global crop watchers say there are some 
disturbing similarities in some of the major breadbasket areas of 
the united states and soviet union 
the governments joint agricultural weather facility said 
tuesday that dry soil conditions and lack of snow cover in parts of 
the great plains continue to threaten the winter wheat crop 
the same goes for parts of the soviet winter wheat area 
portions of the southern great plains received some moisture 
but more was needed the report said most of the central and 
northern great plains remained dry but above normal temperatures 
helped to maintain crop condition 
in its international section the report said january brought 
above normal precipitation in the baltic states belorussia 
central region volga vyatsk western black soils region the 
eastern ukraine and parts of the north caucasus 
in contrast there was below normal precipitation in the 
western and southern ukraine the eastern black soils region and 
the volga the report said unusually mild weather covered the 
entire region during most of january 
although the warm weather provided generally favorable 
conditions for winter grain it left crop areas over a wide 
expanse of the soviet union without a protective snow cover and 
caused winter grains to lose hardiness making them more 
susceptible to potential winterkill 
in assessing the us situation the report noted lack of snow 
cover has left the winter wheat crop vulnerable to freeze 
damage 
the facility is operated by the departments of agriculture and 
commerce the weekly reports cover soil and crop conditions but do 
not project yields 
looking at some other crops the report said the sugarcane 
harvest continued in florida but unseasonably hot dry weather 
forced citrus producers to continue irrigating 
the warm weather also continued over the major florida vegetable 
areas where spring plantings were under way 
in georgia tobacco plant beds were reported in good to 
excellent condition and that north carolina farmers continued to 
seed their beds 
rain and wet field conditions again limited field work in the 
delta the report said land preparation for the 1990 cotton 
crop continued in arizona and california 
livestock pastures were helped by rain and mild temperatures in 
the delta and southeast the report said 
in the great plains and corn belt mild temperatures and the 
lack of snow cover reduced the amount of supplemental feeding 
necessary for livestock the report said mild weather 
provided ideal conditions for calving which was under way in many 
areas

italians are hooked on american walnuts even 
as their own production rises according to an agriculture 
department report 
although italy produces walnuts they are a smaller variety 
than the large california variety the united states exports the 
report said an increase in italys production this year is not 
expected to affect the import level since consumers prefer the 
largersized imports 
the united states provides about 92 percent of the walnuts 
imported by italy said the report which was written by frank j 
piason us agricultural counselor in rome 
walnuts are eaten by italians at the end of meals particularly 
during the christmas season and are increasingly consumed as a 
snack food and used in confectionery products he said

a woman who sources say had a personal 
relationship with mayor marion barry is staying in jail rather than 
testify before a federal grand jury investigating alleged drug use 
by the mayor 
us district judge john garrett penn ordered maria mccarthy of 
greensboro nc jailed for civil contempt of court after she 
refused to testify tuesday said her attorney leslie scherr 
penn granted mccarthy immunity from prosecution after she 
initially refused to testify tuesday but she still wouldnt talk 
to the grand jury and was sent to jail scherr said 
prosecutors are reportedly close to requesting the grand jury to 
indict barry who was arrested jan 18 on a cocaine possession 
charge on new charges scherr said mccarthy told him i have to 
live with myself whether he was a friend or enemy we had a 
relationship that doesnt need public scrutiny 
the attorney wouldnt tell reporters whether mccarthy was 
referring to barry but two city government sources familiar with 
barrys social life said barry and mccarthy had a personal 
relationship 
its not really loyalty that kept her from testifying said 
scherr but some kind of moral code she lives by 
scherr said mccarthy knows rasheeda moore the woman who 
cooperated in the fbi sting operation that resulted in barrys 
arrest at a washington hotel scherr declined to comment further on 
mccarthys relationship with moore or the mayor 
under law mccarthy can be held in jail as long as the grand 
jury hearing evidence in the case remains in session grand juries 
are normally empaneled for 18 months at a time but can be extended 
if the case continues 
the grand jury is investigating barrys ties to former city 
employee charles lewis who has cooperated with the panel after 
pleading guilty to two cocaine conspiracy charges lewis who has 
also been convicted of cocaine distribution charges in his native 
virgin islands testified in open court that he supplied barry with 
crack cocaine 
barry who is enrolled in a florida substance abuse treatment 
center has denied using drugs with lewis 
the federal probe began in december 1988 after city police 
aborted an undercover drug purchase from lewis when they learned 
barry was in lewis downtown washington hotel room 
mccarthy is the second woman jailed for refusing to testify 
about barry convicted cocaine dealer karen johnson served eight 
months in jail in 1984 after refusing to tell authorities whether 
she gave drugs to barry or who her drug supplier was 
scherr said that as far as he knew mccarthy had no contracts 
with the city government or any involvement in companies doing 
business with the city

an environmental activist preparing to begin a 
white house policy job isnt getting the post because of what he 
says are strong forces within the administration and congress 
dan w reicher a senior attorney with the natural resources 
defense council a liberal environmental group said he was told 
his appointment was being canceled tuesday the same day the 
washington post reported he was taking the job 
i was canned this morning a week and a half before 
starting reicher said he said he had been told he would begin 
feb 26 as assistant deputy counsel for the council on 
environmental quality 
reicher has criticized bush and reagan administration efforts to 
comply with federal environmental laws particularly in the cleanup 
of problems at nuclear weapons production facilities 
he said pressure from strong forces within the administration 
and on capitol hill prompted council chairman michael r deland 
to reverse his decision to hire him 
deland bushs appointee as chairman of the council said he 
decided not to hire reicher after realizing the degree to which 
hes perceived to be a persistent critic of the administration 
it was my decision my decision alone deland said i have 
apologized to dan 
white house spokesman steve hart denied there was any white 
house pressure applied to deland against the appointment 
it was delands decision hart said it was a policy 
difference that he felt could not be rectified to a satisfactory 
point 
reports last week said there was a serious internal dispute in 
the white house over environmental policy after white house chief 
of staff john sununu softened a bush speech on global warming 
national audubon society vice president brooks yeager said the 
reicher move raises more questions about the administrations 
commitment on the environment 
were a little bit concerned that if someone with his 
knowledge and his integrity cant sustain political scrutiny within 
the administration a lot of high sounding promises made to us 
by the administration dont mean a lot he said 
the council on environmental quality diminished in size and 
importance under the reagan administration but environmentalists 
said they were promised by the bush administration that it would be 
upgraded

the worlds two nuclear superpowers should 
move to prevent the accidental or unauthorized launch of nuclear 
weapons by placing sensors in each others missile fields and 
destruct systems on strategic missiles a ussoviet foundation 
says 
the proposal tuesday by the moscowbased international 
foundation for the survival and development of humanity founded 
by the late soviet physicist and political activist andrei sakharov 
was made as an alternative to the strategic defense initiative 
under research by the united states 
the foundations report has been submitted to rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee together 
with the proposal that its recommendations be debated jointly by 
the house panel and the supreme soviets defense committee 
former president reagan billed star wars as sdi is informally 
called as a continentspanning protective umbrella to foil a 
soviet missile attack but the bush administration endorses a more 
modest research concept 
although tensions between washington and moscow are being 
sharply reduced some administration officials maintain a missile 
defense system could fend off a missile launched by accident or 
fired by terrorists or a hostile third world nation 
andrei kokoshkin deputy director of the soviet institute of usa 
and canadian studies said at a news conference tuesday that the 
report is aimed at countering this argument for star wars 
at the pentagon an official who commented on condition he not 
be identified said some of the reports recommendations could be 
discussed at arms control negotiations 
but he said the united states already has in place a range of 
effective measures designed to prevent accidental or unauthorized 
launches of nuclear weapons 
and he said there are legitimate concerns a radical third world 
nation could develop or obtain nuclear weapons and launchers 
existing technology probably could fashion a defense against a 
nuclear attack on the united states by such a state even though 
the means are not in hand to counter a fullscale soviet missile 
attack 
the report says installing sensors on the missile silos and 
launchers of each side would eliminate the danger that a missile 
strike could be launched because of a false alarm 
the sensor systems would continually transmit preprogrammed 
continually changing coded signals via relay sensors as long as no 
missiles were launched and the sensors were not tampered with it 
said 
it said if an earlywarning satellite or radar indicated an 
enemy missile was launched the absence of a corresponding 
indication from the sensors would be evidence that the warning was 
a false alarm 
the report also called for greater central controls over nuclear 
weapons including installation of socalled permissive action 
links on nuclear weapons to prevent their use without secret 
authorization codes 
the pentagon official said most new us nuclear weapons have 
such devices 
the authors of the report called on both the united states and 
the soviet union to begin urgent studies by all the nuclear powers 
on the possibility of placing destruct devices on ballistic 
missiles to destroy or disarm them before they hit their targets 
this would enable the destruction of a missile launched by 
mistake or without proper authority 
the pentagon official said the united states did not put 
destruct devices on ballistic missiles because their reliability 
was uncertain 
i think it is easier to prevent something from being launched 
than to destroy it after it is already gone he said

the chief aide to phoenix millionaire charles 
h keating jr describes federal regulators who seized keatings 
lincoln savings and loan association last year as kids playing 
games 
testifying on keatings suit to overturn the takeover of the 
55 billion sampl last april judith wischer said the government put 
junior auditors in charge of reviewing the thrifts assets when 
keating was trying to sell the institution in late 1988 and early 
1989 
we found that at this very serious time in our lives we were 
assigned to kids who were playing games with us mrs wischer 
president of lincolns parent company american continental corp 
said in us district court tuesday but they had the upper 
hand 
for several hours tuesday as keating sat with his attorneys in 
the courtroom mrs wischer recounted with frustration various 
events between 1985 and the government takeover of lincoln four 
years later in what she described as an escalating battle of 
experts 
in may 1988 when american continental and the bank board signed 
a memorandum of understanding calling for a new audit she 
said we thought for the first time since that we had a 
settlement that was binding on both sides 
that memorandum was widely criticized in hearings before the 
house banking committee last fall among the provisions was the 
removal of jurisdiction over lincoln from san francisco regulators 
who in may 1987 recommended seizing the thrift then 
regulators now in charge of the sampl bailout contend the twoyear 
delay in closing lincoln could cost taxpayers up to 2 billion 
only four months after signing the may 1988 memorandum however 
lincoln officials became disillusioned again when regulators raised 
new complaints about taxsharing and other agreements that had been 
approved earlier mrs wischer said 
we became very very scared after that meeting she said as 
regulators began imposing new supervisory order on lincoln it 
got to be that the only thing we could do was open the branches in 
the morning and close them at night she added 
as a result mrs wischer said keating and his top advisers 
concluded they could never operate lincoln successfully because of 
what he and some bank board officials have called a vendetta 
against them 
american continental later pursued three different deals for 
leveraged buyouts of lincoln but all were disapproved by 
regulators who concluded little real new capital was being 
invested in each 
in addition to a bankruptcy court proceeding over american 
continental keating is now embroiled in several lawsuits as both 
a plaintiff and defendant with the government and investors in his 
enterprise 
besides the suit here seeking recovery of lincoln he is suing 
the government in federal court in phoenix on charges of illegally 
leaking confidential information about the thrift in 1986 and 1987 
the government has named keating mrs wischer and other 
american continental officials in a civil suit seeking 11 billion 
on charges of fraud and racketeering in their operation of lincoln 
keating also is under criminal investigation by a federal grand 
jury in los angeles according to regulators 
and he is the focal point of a congressional ethics scandal 
involving five senators for whom he raised 13 million in 
political contributions and who in turn interceded on lincolns 
behalf with federal regulators in 1987

residents of this tiny trendy ski resort 
town on tuesday rejected by nearly 21 an ordinance that would have 
made it the nations first furrierfree zone 
with all eight precincts counted the furban ordinance lost 
1701 to 898 
residents also voted for growth defeating by 1561 to 1051 a 
measure to reduce the size of a luxury hotel by 25 percent and 
approving measures to widen the highway leading into town and a 
bond measure to build employee housing 
people seem more concerned with business and monetary gain 
than other values said katharine thalberg who with her husband 
mayor bill stirling led the fight for the fur ban 
they want a larger hotel a bigger highway there does seem 
to be a value shift here in town she said 
revillon furs manager mark kirkland said the big winners are 
the people of aspen we can get back to business and welcome our 
guests back whove been staying away because of all this 
the election which drew international attention attracted 
about 70 percent of aspens 3700 registered voters said city 
clerk kathryn koch 
like ski lifts there was a 20minute wait at polling places 
deputy city clerk kathy strickland said earlier 
we had three booths at the precincts last time and now we 
have four and they still are waiting in line so the turnout 
is going to be good she said 
the chief growthanddevelopment measure was the one on whether 
to stop construction of the 70 million luxury hotel and build in 
its place a smaller one favored by the city council 
other ballot measures were tied to the dilemma of growth in the 
celebrity haven a picturesque town fat with wealthy buyers and 
short on building space 
voters approved a widening of colorado 82 into aspen from two 
lanes to four and a straight route into town over an s curve 
the highway carries more than 22000 cars a day according to state 
figures 
several ballot proposals involved employee housing 
most shop government and ski slope workers cannot afford to 
live in aspen where the average single home sold for more than 1 
million in 1989 
voters approved 1363 to 1203 an ordinance to raise the citys 
sales tax by 045 of a cent bringing the total sales tax to 79 
percent in order to finance affordable housing and day care 
the fur fight polarized the town with stirling and his wife 
leading animalrights activists in demanding the ban and furriers 
leading the charge against it claiming it would drive away 
tourists 
some considered the election a dress rehearsal for a march 13 
recall election for stirling and three other members of the city 
council 
the fur issue drew national and international attention 
the real issue is whether it is all right to kill animals to 
make fur coats said katharine thalberg cofounder of the aspen 
society for animal rights 
thalberg believes fur sales amount to making profits on cruelty 
to animals opponents led by fur retailers framed it as a freedom 
of choice issue saying the government should not tell people what 
to wear or not wear 
the small old mining town has four fur shops and more than 100 
other businesses also sell furs 
financial disclosure statements showed the various special 
interest groups had spent about 250000 67 per voter 
the other big attentiongetter on the ballot was the proposal to 
reduce the size of the luxury hotel already under construction the 
developer mohamed hadid purchased the land from new york 
billionaire developer donald trump 
hadid planned a 292room 66foottall building 
stirling and his supporters on the council spurred by 
complaints that the hotel would block views of aspen mountains ski 
slopes and would just be too big for the town space and services 
wanted to scale it back by 25 percent and down to 44 feet high 
hadids spokesmen said the council approved the project in 
november 1988 and should not be changing the rules while 
construction is under way 
trump reentered the fray in the weeks preceding the election 
reminding people he sold the land because the town would not let 
him build a hotel the size he wanted which would have been close 
to the council proposal

us and soviet trade negotiators working 
under orders to wipe away nearly a halfcentury of trade friction 
between the two superpowers say they are on schedule to get the 
job done by june 
both sides expressed satisfaction with the progress made after 
an initial two days of talks aimed at drawing up a treaty to 
normalize trade between the two nations 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev would 
like to sign such an agreement at their next summit meeting in 
june the bush administration believes freer trade between the two 
nations would provide an important economic boost to the political 
reforms gorbachev is making 
deputy us trade representative julius katz the top us 
negotiator in the talks said the next meeting has been tentatively 
scheduled for later this month in europe with a third bargaining 
session to be held in midmarch in vienna 
i dont have any doubt that we can get the job done he told 
reporters after the talks ended tuesday there was nothing that 
came up that presents an insuperable obstacle 
chief soviet negotiator yuriy chumakov saying that the opening 
discussions had gone fairly well indicated that one key 
sticking point could be the terms under which the treaty might be 
suspended 
the us side is insisting that language be included giving the 
united states the right to suspend the treaty if the soviets are 
found after an annual presidential review to be violating 
requirements for open emigration policies 
the soviets want to negotiate a threeyear trade treaty without 
the threat of suspension arguing that the assurance of trade 
stability is needed to attract us business investment 
would you invest 1 billion if you knew the agreement was 
valid for only one year chumakov asked reporters 
annual review of soviet emigration policies is required by the 
jacksonvanik amendment which congress passed in 1974 in 
retaliation for the soviet governments refusal at that time to 
allow free emigration for soviet jews and other dissidents 
katz said the us negotiating position on this matter cannot 
change unless congress changes the law something not likely to 
occur in the immediate future 
negotiation of a wideranging trade agreement was a primary goal 
established during the bushgorbachev summit last december in 
malta american officials predict that twoway trade between the 
two countries could double or even triple over the next three years 
once the high tariffs imposed by jacksonvanik are lowered 
in the first 11 months of 1989 us exports to the soviet 
union primarily grain shipments totaled 382 billion while 
soviet sales in the united states primarily of petroleum and 
consumer items such as vodka and furs totaled 658 million 
the trade treaty would be used to grant the soviet union most 
favored nation status qualifying it for the lowest tariffs 
available to any other country soviet exports into the united 
states currently bear duties as much as 10 times higher than 
imports from other nations 
by one estimate the price of soviet vodka could drop by 125 
per bottle with the lower tariffs 
american farmers also are watching the trade talks with keen 
interest because the soviets have said they will not sign a new 
grain pact until agreement is reached on a wideranging trade 
treaty 
the current negotiations likely will serve as a prototype for 
similar agreements to lower tariffs for other east european 
nations poland and hungary already have received most favored 
nation status and the united states is considering granting 
similar low tariffs for czechoslovakia romania bulgaria and east 
germany 
katz said the pace of negotiations with other nations would 
depend on when free elections are held with czechoslovakia a 
good bet to be next in line to receive the lower tariffs

the past weeks dramatic moves by the united 
states the soviet union and their chief allies establish a 
framework for the most sweeping eastwest changes since world war 
ii 
the agreements open the way for the reunification of germany 
the reduction of superpower forces in europe and the expansion of 
ussoviet trade 
last week in the soviet union president mikhail s gorbachev 
won approval from the communist party central committee to give up 
the partys monopoly on power for the first time in about 70 years 
secretary of state james a baker iii who visited moscow last 
week made major progress with gorbachev toward an agreement for 
deep cuts in the superpowers longrange nuclear arsenals 
the swiftly moving talks culminated in ottawa on tuesday with 
the announcement of a framework for german unification agreed 
upon by the united states its major european allies the soviet 
union and east germany and a ussoviet agreement to limit their 
troops in central europe 
germany divided since the defeat of adolf hitler in 1945 still 
hosts more than a halfmillion foreign forces who have faced each 
other through the cold war 
this reunification agreement shows everybody has seen german 
unity will happen and they have agreed to a process that will 
provide stability and peace for europe said a west german 
diplomat in washington who asked not to be identified 
the german reunification agreement announced in ottawa sets up a 
twostep process to start after the march 18 elections in east 
germany 
moscow has insisted that germany remain neutral after 
reunification and the united states demands that germany remain 
part of the western alliance 
under the agreement the two germanys first would settle 
internal details then they would work with britain france the 
soviet union and united states the four main victorious allies in 
world war ii to establish agreements assuring peace and stability 
for europe 
such an approach is aimed at assuring the soviets and other 
europeans that germany seen as the source of the two world wars in 
this century would never again threaten its neighbors 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher offered 
assurances of a reunited germanys peaceful intentions saying 
we tell all our neighbors what we want to unite the federal 
republic of germany the german democratic republic and the whole 
of berlin no less and no more we do not have territorial claims 
against any of our neighbors 
moves by leaders of east and west germany matched the pace of 
the other countries on tuesday west german chancellor helmut kohl 
and east german premier hans modrow agreed to begin talks next week 
to make the west german mark the official currency of east germany 
the ussoviet troop cuts announced by canadian external 
affairs minister joseph clark at the end of an eastwest meeting in 
ottawa would allow the united states and the soviet union to have 
195000 soldiers each on europes central front 
that would be a cut from 275000 for the united states and from 
565000 for the soviets and the united states would be allowed to 
have another 30000 troops elsewhere in europe 
us and soviet trade negotiators also said tuesday they expect 
to complete a treaty to normalize trade between the two nations in 
time for signing during the june summit meeting in washington 
the bush administration believes freer trade between the two 
nations would provide an important economic boost to gorbachevs 
political reforms 
during his eightday trip baker not only met with the soviets 
and nato allies but also visited czechoslovakia romania and 
bulgaria to encourage their moves toward democracy and freemarket 
economies 
however some eastwest issues still remain such as differences 
over regional conflicts in afghanistan where the united states 
supports guerrillas fighting the sovietbacked government and 
central america where the united states says the soviets have been 
supporting the nicaraguan government and guerrillas in el salvador

blustery winds pushed more goo 
onto california beaches tuesday as reinforcements joined the battle 
to sop up the oily onslaught a week after a tanker spill fouled the 
coast 
the cleanup crew was tripled to 1120 workers on six miles of 
oilstained beach and another 300 workers were being trained to 
handle the crude oil invasion fifteen miles of beach in southern 
california remained closed 
meanwhile the 811foot tanker american trader docked for 
repairs 
a newport beach man filed one of the first lawsuits in 
connection with the spill 
the classaction lawsuit filed by chet holifield in federal 
court in los angeles seeks damages and money for economic losses 
among the defendants are the ships owner and the company that 
chartered the tanker 
winds combined with increasing surf to push new bands of thick 
crude ashore threatening wildlife sanctuaries the 400000gallon 
spill has killed 86 birds and coated 261 others with oil 
the national weather service said onshore winds to 40 mph could 
develop by thursday 
up to 1000 grunion have also been killed by the spill state 
department of fish and game spokesman pat moore said 
the tiny fish died during a weekend run along the orange 
county coastline moore said grunion come to the edge of the shore 
during such runs to lay eggs in the soft sand any eggs left behind 
in the oilsoaked sand were not expected to hatch he said 
huntington beach mayor tom mays had asked gov george deukmejian 
to declare a state of emergency 
but eileen baumgardner assistant director of the office of 
emergency services said the declaration was not immediately 
necessary because the cleanup was being handled by private industry 
as far as we can tell there are no needs that are not being 
met she said late monday huntington beach is about 35 miles 
southeast of los angeles 
waves of grimy crude oil spilled by the american trader rolled 
onto bolsa chica state beach leaving the beach coated with a layer 
of crude 2 inches thick in some areas 
im disgusted surfer bill casper said while watching the 
black tide roll in at his favorite surf spot near huntington beach 
pier its going to affect the beach for years there will be tar 
on the beach for years 
on a bike path further north near bolsa chica lee buratti 40 
of dana point was taking a break in training for the wheelchair 
race in next months los angeles marathon he complained of the 
petroleum stench 
the fumes were much too much i could feel it in my lungs it 
actually hurt a little and it slowed my pace said buratti 
but buratti said spills were the price of the los angeles 
lifestyle lets face it our life revolves around oil we have 
to have it 
the oily pads absorbent pompons and truck loads of gooey sand 
were taken to a sevenacre site near the newport beach sewage 
treatment plant said tony kozlowski of british petroleum america 
inc which owns the alaksa north slope oil and chartered the ship 
he said the muck can be picked up easier once its on the beach 
when it gets on shore we can deal with it and clean it up 
when its out there its just a waiting game kozlowski said 
its awful said robert august who starred in the surfing 
movie endless summer and now owns a surf shop in huntington 
beach its pretty lousy for business all thats there now are 
reporters and politicians 
businessman ross roberts 48 visiting from yakima wash for a 
boat show speculated that tourism would likely take a beating just 
as it did after the mount st helens eruption in his state a decade 
ago 
its not going to be good for the area all this advertising 
about oily beaches roberts said there was the same effect in 
washington after mount st helens because of all the ash that came 
down 
the patchedup american trader moved from a long beach harbor 
anchorage and tied up at an arco dock on tuesday morning to unload 
its remaining cargo of crude oil and to begin repairs of hull 
punctures 
the oil leaked from the vessel on feb 7 when the ship 
apparently ran over its own anchor while mooring in shallow water 
at an oil pipeline mooring two miles offshore 
the slick meandered away from the beaches for five days with the 
help of offshore winds and calm seas containment booms and sand 
berms kept the oil out of marinas and the ecologically sensitive 
bolsa chica wetlands 
but potential damage to the reserve home for the endangered 
california brown pelican and a stop for thousands of migratory 
birds and marine life was still a concern 
birds are leaving the wetlands and going to the ocean and 
bringing the oil back to the estuary said patrick moore of the 
state department of fish and game oily residue on the birds could 
kill eggs

a scientists peace activist group says the 
united states is violating the treaty against genocide and its own 
laws by aiding cambodian prince norodom sihanouk while he 
cooperates with the communist khmer rouge 
sihanouk has been reported to be sending money to khmer rouge 
guerrilla units in the southeast asian country jeremy j stone 
president of the federation of american scientists said tuesday 
the treaty ratified by the senate in 1988 obligates 
participating countries to undertake prevention of ethnicbased 
mass killing known as genocide and punishment of those accused of 
genocide 
stone said that would include the khmer rouge blamed for more 
than a million deaths during their bloody 197578 rule over the 
southeast asian country 
also violated he said were provisions of the us foreign 
assistance act that since 1985 has forbidden use of american aid 
funds to directly or indirectly sustain or augment operations 
of the khmer rouge 
president bushs administration has declared a major objective 
of its cambodian policy is to block return to power of the khmer 
rouge 
but the administration has also accepted sihanouks alliance 
with the khmer rouge guerilla fighters describing their presence 
as a fact of life 
last years pullout of vietnamese occupation forces intensified 
cambodias civil war and heightened world anxiety about a khmer 
rouge comeback khmer rouge guerrillas and those of two 
noncommunist factions claim territorial gains at the expense of the 
vietnaminstalled cambodian government of premier hun sen 
published reports say the antigovernment factions have been 
cooperating with each other and that westernsupplied weapons have 
been captured from khmer rouge forces 
the united states and other major powers support a cambodian 
peace plan based on a unsupervised interim government and 
elections 
but stone said the khmer rouge would continue fighting if they 
lose such elections and that his organization of 4000 members 
wants to end the killing of cambodians now as fast as we can 
he called for a cutoff of arms deliveries to all cambodian 
factions and for thailand to halt the flow of chinese weapons to 
the khmer rouge over the thai border official american aid has 
been limited to nominal humanitarian assistance while the two 
noncommunist factions in the antigovernment alliance have been 
reported to be drawing more than 20 million worth of western 
covert aid a year

the ottawa agreement on german unification 
provides the decisive international acceptance for a process that 
is already well under way inside the two neighboring countries 
from business ventures to television programming and vacation 
travel the two states have been coming closer together in hundreds 
of ways each day 
what belongs together will grow together former west german 
chancellor willy brandt is fond of saying 
and germans in both east and west have accepted the 
inevitability of a rapid unification since the berlin wall opened 
nov 9 
serious obstacles remain in making a single nation with its 
citizens carrying the same passports paying with the same currency 
and serving sidebyside in the same armed forces 
from an international standpoint the most serious obstacle may 
be the military stance of a united germany 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has said nato membership 
for a united germany is not acceptable the official east 
german news agency adn said 
adn stressed that discussions about unification will also 
include the questions of security of neighboring states 
still mindful of the horrors of the nazi aggression east 
germanys communists are seeking assurances that conservatives in 
bonn have given up any designs on former lands that now belong to 
poland west german chancellor helmut kohl said his country has no 
intention of seeking to regain any lands that were part of prewar 
germany 
the ottawa agreement sets the stage for a virtual revolution 
the first redrawing of european national boundaries since world war 
ii it was a step that only recently many had never expected could 
happen 
internally there are still numerous questions to be answered 
socialism and capitalism can no more be united than fire and 
water theneast german leader erich honecker said during a 1987 
visit to bonn 
while much of what the nowdisgraced hardliner did and said has 
been ridiculed there may be a good deal of truth in his metaphor 
east german industry the part that is still running is a 
product of heavyhanded central planning from east berlin 
west germans say that leads to inefficiency and slowness to 
change even in such simple ways as adapting to the latest fashions 
most east germans are also accustomed to a cradletograve 
socialism that up until very recently has left very little to 
individual choice 
housing clothing and public transportation at rockbottom 
prices are almost a compensation for the hundreds of daily 
sacrifices east germans have had to make 
meshing the economies will be a daunting task and will cost 
billions of dollars 
west germany has one of the most efficient economies in the 
world but east germanys economy has been going downhill since the 
1960s 
west germany has strict factory safety measures and a vocal 
greens party to help enforce environment regulations much of 
coaldependent east germany is an ecological nightmare dangerously 
polluted 
other problems loom as well 
these east germans come over here and get a lot of handouts 
from the government grouses one businesswoman in the prosperpous 
frankfurt suburb of koenigstein but they never saw that much 
money in their life 
many east germans the elderly especially also worry that the 
thousands of marks they stashed away in bank accounts will be 
worthless once the mighty west german mark swallows up its weak 
neighbor 
west german leftists and union leaders warn that east germany 
cannot be a source of lowwage labor 
still the germans on both sides seem determined to work out the 
problems which in many cases will simply require some time and 
patience 
with virtually all major groups and political parties in east 
germany and west germany in favor of unification the main question 
for weeks has been when rather than whether 
every day has brought new ties 
west german businesses have been gearing up to move into east 
germany west germanys dresdner bank has opened an office in its 
founding city of dresden with other financial institutions 
following the trail to east germany 
east german tv shows have been shown on west german television 
west germanys two networks have been broadcasting election 
information programs into east germany in advance of the countrys 
first free balloting on march 18 
newspapers from each country are now sold in the other and west 
german tour companies are promoting trips east 
while some of these steps seem minor taken individually they 
add up to a revolution for a people long separated from family and 
loved ones 
the reuniting of the two countries olympic teams is considered 
likely and will provide a broad symbolic move for two countries 
proud of their athletic prowess 
germans are waiting for berlin to become the capital of a united 
country 
now that the berlin wall has fallen its also necessary for 
the walls in our heads to come down west berlin planning chief 
michaela schreyer said sunday

congress must provide greater safeguards to 
retirees because of pension raiding by corporations that 
terminate employee retirement funds to take control of surplus 
assets says the chairman of a senate committee 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said tuesday that congress needs 
to approve legislation imposing stricter standards on pension 
terminations especially because the retirement plans often are 
replaced with annuities purchased from insurance companies heavily 
invested in highrisk junk bonds 
pension raids leave workers and retirees with frozen pension 
checks while their employers laugh their way to the bank with 
millions of dollars said metzenbaum 
annuities are contracts that pay fixed monthly benefits to 
retirees 
surplus pension assets have become a popular target for 
corporate raiders who acquire a company and use its overfunded 
retirement programs as a source of cash 
metzenbaum said sound pension plans are wrung dry of their 
cash and replaced with annuities offering fixed benefits and no 
chance of costofliving adjustments 
most pension plans are federally insured by the pension benefit 
guaranty corp but the subcommittee was told there is no similar 
federal backing of retirement annuities of insurance companies a 
few states have special funds to guard against insurance company 
defaults however metzenbaum complained the insurance industry was 
poorly regulated and said that increased the risk for retirees in 
pension terminations

federal job training programs fail to serve 
enough hispanics because of income and documentation barriers says 
a government report 
the national commission for employment policy an independent 
agency that reports to congress and the presidnt said tuesday the 
federal job training partnership act needs to be amended so more 
hispanics will participate 
the report based on a 12month study called on congress to 
ease income requirements it also asked the labor department to 
urge states to loosen documentation requirements needed to get into 
job training programs 
while hispanics account for between 13 percent and 14 percent of 
those eligible for job training programs they make up only between 
10 percent and 11 percent of those who take part the report said 
the commission blamed part of the discrepancy on federal 
requirements that mandate candidates for the program be receiving 
food stamps many hispanics refuse to accept public assistance and 
therefore miss out on job training opportunities the report said 
because of their cultural heritage of selfsufficiency and 
attendant distaste for government assistance programs many 
hispanics would rather forego jtpa training than accept food stamp 
assistance just to qualify for the program the agency said 
the report recommended that congress change the law so that 
candidates merely be eligible for food stamps rather than 
actually accepting the assistance

while many people are celebrating valentines day 
some panamanian children are opening christmas presents delayed 
almost two months by us government red tape 
patricia gehri 45 has been working since just after the dec 
20 invasion of panama to gather toys for children she said never 
had a christmas but until tuesday she could not get them 
delivered 
then tuesday afternoon a us marine plane took off from 
macdill air force base with the toys 
it could have been worse she said it could have been 
easter bunnies 
gehri amassed between 8000 and 10000 toys along with the 
marines through their toys for tots program the teddy bears 
games tea sets and dolls had been gathering dust in marine 
warehouses in tampa orlando miami and gehris garage 
i wish we could paint a big red nose on that airplane gehri 
said just like rudolph the rednose reindeer 
the marines picked up all the toys gehri had stored along with 
those in miami and took them to macdill where they were loaded on a 
c130 cargo plane from illinois 
the toy delivery was initially delayed because the marines had 
difficulty getting permission to land a plane in wartorn panama 
but the state department approved the mission last week and the 
government of panama approved it friday 
gehri said she obtained permission by using the denton 
amendment which allows airlifting items for humanitarian efforts 
she had a little trouble convincing government officials that teddy 
bears were humanitarian 
they didnt take it seriously because its toys and not food 
or medicine she said but a teddy bear is medicine to me 
once the toys arrive in panama officials will work with the 
marines to distribute the items to children in refugee camps 
hospitals and orphanages she said 
an exmarine gave me a big giant raccoon today that will go 
to special little girl in the hospital from me she said she 
lost her arm when the pdf panamanian defense forces opened fire 
during the invasion 
gehri a former flight attendant was disabled in 1988 from a 
head injury so severe it impaired her speech after recovering most 
functions her therapist suggested she take on a project to help 
her feel good about herself 
when she decided to send toys to panama she had no idea it 
would become such an involved effort but she has nothing but 
praise for the marines and the panamanian government 
considering everything that has happened its a miracle 
gehri said i would never have had so many toys if they had gone 
off on time

cocaine use may lower sperm counts and create 
other abnormalities that diminish male fertility a new study 
suggests but the effect apparently begins to disappear after drug 
use stops 
the study focused on men from couples who were consulting an 
infertility clinic at yale university it appears in this months 
issue of fertility and sterility the official journal of the 
american fertility society 
a specialist in male infertility cautioned tuesday that the 
study does not show that cocaine use caused infertility in the men 
this is provocative but by no means evidence of cause and 
effect said richard sherins of the genetics and ivf institute of 
fairfax va 
researchers studied 40 men with low sperm counts 77 who had 
sperm with low motility which essentially means too few sperm were 
swimming correctly and 75 who had high concentrations of 
abnormally shaped sperm each of these problems can contribute to 
infertility 
cocaine use by these men was compared to that of 284 other male 
partners of couples who consulted the yale clinic but did not have 
these problems 
researchers found that men who had low sperm counts were twice 
as likely as men in the comparison group to have used cocaine 
within the previous two years they were five times as likely to 
have used it once a month or more and within the previous two 
years or to have used it once a month or more and for two to four 
years 
men with the motility problem were twice as likely as the 
comparison group to have used cocaine for five or more years 
men with high concentrations of abnormally shaped sperm were 
seven times as likely to have used cocaine for five years or more 
and two years or longer ago and four times as likely to have used 
it once a month or more and for two to four years 
male infertility plays some role in almost twothirds of couples 
who have trouble conceiving the researchers said 
given that research shows cocaine use to be quite prevalent 
among men ages 26 to 34 and given the drugs apparent effect in 
the new study i think one can conclude that it may be a 
significant risk factor for infertility said study coauthor 
michael bracken professor of epidemiology obstetrics and 
gynecology at yale university 
but sherins said the statistical association between cocaine and 
infertility in the study was weak the research whets your 
appetite for doing the study right he said 
the proper approach would include medical diagnosis of what was 
causing infertility in the couple he said or a demonstration of 
how sperm quality changes as a person starts or stops taking 
cocaine 
the researchers did not explore how cocaine could affect 
fertility they suggested it may affect early sperm development by 
disrupting hormonal patterns or harm testicular functioning by 
reducing blood flow

cartagena normally is a lazy beach 
town with crowded beaches and a lively night life but this week 
the caribbean coastal town looks like a city after a military coup 
military vessels ply cartagena bay and marines patrol streets 
and set up checkpoints for searching cars and passengers 
the tight security is for president bush and the presidents of 
colombia peru and bolivia who meet in cartagena on thursday for a 
summit on strategies for ending the lucrative and lethal trade in 
cocaine 
they are to gather at a 17thcentury spanish fort part of the 
colombian naval academys base that lies on the tip of a halfmile 
finger of land jutting out into cartagena bay 
helicopter gunships manned by americans and colombians are 
patrolling the bay and surrounding area a colombian frigate is 
anchored a few hundred yards from the fort and highspeed patrol 
boats stop and search other vessels 
further offshore two us ships were on patrol the uss nassau 
an 820foot amphibious assault ship that carries helicopters and an 
1700man marine landing team and the uss sampson a 437foot 
destroyer 
most hotels are requiring that guests not only show their 
passports or other official identification but that they leave 
their fingerprints on file in the event there is a bombing or other 
violence 
while cartagena has not been a major battlefield in the war 
between colombias government and the nations cocaine barons it 
has been the site of enough attacks to seriously harm cartagenas 
tourism 
only a few local people are at the beaches which usually are 
jammed with thousands of people from canada the united states and 
europe at this time of the year 
the foreigners have not been coming to the city since a bomb 
exploded at the cartagena hilton on oct 26 killing two people in 
their room 
another bomb exploded harmlessly in the tourist district a short 
time later and a third device was found at another hotel 
eight years ago two us drug agents were abducted from the 
cartagena hilton by two gunmen posing as room service employes the 
agents were taken into the countryside shot several times and left 
for dead but one crawled to a hospital several blocks away for 
help and both survived 
on dec 15 national police tracked the countrys secondbiggest 
trafficker gonzalo rodriguez gacha to a banana plantation just 75 
miles south of cartagena he was killed by a burst of gunfire from 
a helicopter gunship as he heaved hand grenades and fired an 
assault rifle 
us ambassador thomas mcnamara complained tuesday that american 
reporters are creating an atmosphere of tension by emphasizing 
security measures for the summit 
he said colombians resent such reports and brushed aside 
reporters suggestions that it is the white house that is creating 
the drama and aura of danger for bushs visit 
according to one report from the united states the us secret 
service had found that drug traffickers have shoulderfired 
surfacetoair missiles and it was feared they might be used to 
disrupt the summit 
also it has been reported for several weeks that bushs aides 
opposed the president coming to colombia because of the danger 
since the colombian government declared war on traffickers aug 
18 there have been 262 terrorist acts blamed on drug bosses 
mostly bombings they ahve claimed 209 lives 
while there appeared to be a great show of military force in 
cartagena security measures appeared to be lax at the gate to the 
navy base where bush will meet with the latin american leaders 
an associated press photographer watching the gate to the base 
saw 20 cars many carrying civilians go in during a halfhour 
period only two of the vehicles were searched

chase

with two sawedoff rifles a 303caliber and a 22caliber 
semiautomatic said inspector merv harrower 
the youths two 18yearolds and a 14yearold were due to 
appear wednesday in provincial court their names were not released 
weve got a rather large choice harrower told a news 
conference after declining to say exactly what charges would be 
filed 
there was no indication drugs or alcohol was involved in the 
hijacking which began about 430 pm police said 
the youths commandeered the bus as it was taking students home 
from prince george secondary school they boarded before other 
students telling bus driver syl meise 55 they had something to 
give to one of the students said staff sgt elles peleskey 
after some students left the bus south of prince george the 
three produced their weapons and ordered the driver to drive back 
to the city to a car dealership peleskey said 
after the bus was seized police sharpshooters were sent to the 
scene but no shots were fired by either police or the gunmen 
downtown traffic was cordoned off 
about 2 hours after the incident began police supplied the 
three with a getaway car and allowed them to take one of the male 
students with them 
the three drove north out of prince george about 300 miles 
north of vancouver then turned off the main highway onto a side 
road in an attempt to elude police cars harrower said 
the car went out of control on the slippery side road and veered 
into a snowbank 
by the time the youths got the car out of the snow police had 
surrounded it and the three surrendered harrower said 
harrower said the three told police they had intended to head 
for dawson creek near the british columbiaalberta line a 
250mile drive

on the eve of a uslatin american drug 
summit the powerful medellin cocaine cartel declared that it would 
surrender its three largest cocaineprocessing laboratories to 
authorities 
earlier tuesday leftist guerrillas kidnapped two americans to 
protest president bushs planned visit this week to the coastal 
resort city of cartagena and said they would put their captives on 
trial police said 
one was later released 
antibush demonstrators took to the streets in cartagena where 
about 1000 union members marched and in bogota where police 
fired tear gas at about 100 rockthrowing students no injuries 
were reported 
the drug traffickers said they would turn over three labs that 
have produced 21 tons of cocaine monthly as a contribution to our 
decision to fight for peace and strenghtening of democracy in 
colombia 
they said they would also surrender 15000 55gallon drums of 
ether acetone and other chemicals used to refine cocaine 
the offer in a written statement tuesday night in the cocaine 
trafficking center of medellin appeared to be another effort to 
force the government to end its war on drugs and stop extraditing 
traffickers to the united states 
the communique was signed by the extraditables as the 
members of the medellin cartel call themselves and distributed to 
radio stations and newspapers it did not give a location for the 
chemicals or the three laboratories 
a report by the caracol radio network said the traffickers had 
given the locations to a group of journalists in medellin the 
report from medellin provided no additional details and it could 
not be immediately confirmed 
the communique made no reference to bushs visit extradition 
reportedly is high on the agenda of the summit 
bush is scheduled to arrive in cartagena on thursday security 
is tight there have been reports the medellin cartel might try to 
assassinate him 
presidents jaime paz zamora of bolivia and alan garcia of peru 
are to arrive in cartagena later today and briefly meet with 
president virgilio barco 
the two americans abducted tuesday were identified as david 
kent a 40yearold teacher from indianapolis and james archer 
donnelly a 65yearold businessman from detroit 
donnelly was kidnapped with his colombian wife and the two were 
released unhurt about three hours later in medellin said lt 
eusabio guerrero a police spokesman from the city 
an official at the school where kent teaches speaking on 
condition of anonymity said donnelly was told by his captors that 
they were leftist guerrillas and had taken the action to protest 
bushs visit 
the kidnappings were certain to fuel concerns already high 
over bushs security two us ships are patrolling off the 
colombian coast the uss nassau an 820foot amphibious assault 
ship that carries helicopters and an 1700man marine landing team 
and the uss sampson a 437foot destroyer according to the 
pentagon 
caracol said its medellin station received a telephone call from 
a man who said he was a spokesman for leftist guerrillas and 
claimed responsibility for the abductions the caller said the men 
would be put on trial and would be released in five days caracol 
said he did not explain why there would be a trial or why the men 
would be released 
a police spokesman said the kidnappers were from the national 
liberation army a leftist guerrilla group there was no way to 
confirm the claim drug traffickers have in the past posed as 
leftist insurgents 
the traffickers move for peace is only the latest in a series 
since the government declared allout war on the countrys cocaine 
barons in august the drug bosses have been blamed for 262 
terrorist acts since that have clamed 209 lives most have been 
bombings 
the bombings include the downing of a colombian airliner in 
which 107 people were killed 
fourteen suspected traffickers have been extradited to the 
united states in the last five months 
in december an army unit killed gonzalo rodriguez gacha 
considered number two of the cartel 
barco has said repeatedly he will never negotiate with the drug 
lords

before the two germanys can merge as one 
nation they must overcome divisions that have grown out of 
radically different political and social systems and four decades 
of bitter rivalry 
here are some of the main issues the sides must resolve 
security the united states has insisted that a reunited 
germany remain in nato the soviet union has called for a neutral 
germany there is no decision yet whether a reunited germany would 
even have armed forces 
at present the soviet union has 380000 troops in east germany 
under the warsaw pact military alliance the united states france 
belgium britain and canada have more than 300000 soldiers in west 
germany under the nato alliance 
us and soviet forces in europe will be reduced under an 
agreement announced tuesday but the two german states also have 
formidible forces of their own nearly 400000 troops in the west 
german bundeswehr and about 200000 in the east german armed forces 
borders in the aftermath of world war ii germany lost 
considerable territory to poland and the soviet union these 
countries have insisted that the territorial changes have been 
formalized but there is considerable sentiment in both germanys to 
recover these lands at the bargaining table 
economy west germany with a population of 61 million is the 
largest country in the european economic community and the most 
powerful manufacturing nations in the trading group 
east germany with more than 16 million residents is a 
crucially important member of the moscowled comecon trading group 
but its economy once a model of central planning has been 
devastated in recent months by the exodus of tens of thousands of 
skilled workers to the west it has also polluted the environment 
under reunification west germany would probably bear the brunt 
of financial responsibility for east germany 
so far however the east german has rejected the west german 
proposal for a swift monetary union with the west german mark 
becoming the currency in the east instead east germany has 
appealed for 9 billion in bailout loans yet it has been unwilling 
to release basic economic data demanded by west germany as a 
condition for emergency aid 
government west germany is a parliamentary democracy with a 
stable and vibrant political system chancellor helmut kohl a 
christian democrat faces a challenge from the leftleaning social 
democrats in national elections dec 8 
east germany has been ruled by the communist party since its 
formation in 1948 out of the soviet occupation zone but its 
political system is now in great flux the partys power has badly 
eroded since the berlin wall was opened in november 
communist premier hans modrow faces the countrys first free 
elections on march 18 and the communists are expected to be 
defeated the new social democratic party of east germany is likely 
to emerge as the largest party but nearly a dozen other groups 
could win seats in parliament 
culture and outlook east germanys tightly controlled 
communist system and west germanys freewheeling capitalism have 
produced different character traits in many citizens east germans 
have come to expect zero unemployment from their socialist system 
if the two countries are unified there may be disillusionment in 
store for citizens on both sides

some denizens of this citadel for 
senior citizens fear their tranquil marketing is about to be marred 
by armadas of miniature shopping carts pushed along by 
sugarcrazed 3yearolds 
mothers say the carts are really great at keeping kids out 
of their hair and children call them fun a straightfaced 
spokesman for publix supermarkets has proclaimed the carts 
educational tools for shopping techniques 
but some older people think the kiddy carts are hell on wheels 
this is a grocery store not a playground said 68yearold 
sylvie aronowitz i dont want them under my feet 
publix introduced the tiny shopping carts in the fall but the 
company looked at demographics before deciding which of its 370 
florida stores would be equipped with them said company spokesman 
bill shroeder 
the stores we have identified as having a majority of retirees 
will not get any carts schroeder said 
for many of miami beachs senior citizens shopping is a daily 
ritual that allows them to visit with neighbors while picking up a 
few items they can easily carry home 
carol green 70 said she wouldnt mind the little carts which 
havent been introduced to her neighborhood store except that the 
market is usually filled with older shoppers and the children would 
probably get lost in the shuffle 
but in larger suburban publix stores a small child pushing the 
tiny replica of a regular grocery cart and tagging after an adult 
has become a common sight 
i think theyre really great said lourdes dergan while her 
4yearold son joseph pushed his minicart up and down the cereal 
aisle in a store in a western section of miami it helps keep him 
quiet while i shop 
joseph placed a box of teenage mutant ninja turtles cereal on 
top of the cookies chocolate pudding and fruit already selected 
for his little cart mother approved 
he does all his own shopping dergan said i think it 
really teaches him to make decisions 
when asked if he liked having his own cart joseph said yea 
its fun 
but barbara palladino a 43yearold mother of five has written 
two letters complaining about the carts and says she wont shop at 
publix stores 
i saw a mother with two children each with a little cart 
blocking the entire aisle and it took three minutes for her to get 
out of there palladino said its impossible for a mother to 
control a situation like that 
if they really wanted to help out mothers they should put 
little playgrounds in their store 
but schroeder said there are usually only about 10 kiddy carts 
in each of the stores not enough to cause kiddy gridlock more 
than half the companys stores have the carts 
they have become so popular that a little girl threw a tantrum 
after she discovered all the carts were in use at one store 
thieves make off with many of the carts said israel reyes the 
dairy manager at a store in suburban kendall 
publix is not the first supermarket chain to offer the kiddy 
carts they are in use at stores in houston and other us cities 
schroeder insists the carts are educational objects not toys 
the carts are teaching them to imitate their mother in 
shopping techniques schroeder said a number of mothers have 
called to thank us for this 
we havent observed any shopping with carefree abandon by 
children he said the parents control what the child selects 
and thats why the mothers perceive them as an educational tool 
some senior citizens approve of the idea of child shoppers 
we dont mind them at all said may jones 67 who was 
shopping with her husband mack jones i think they are fun tools 
that can teach 
mrs jones who has seven grandchildren said kids will probably 
grab candy and cookies off the shelves and throw them in their 
personal cart 
sure theyll try to get bad stuff she said thats when 
you teach

mstislav rostropovich returned to the soviet 
concert stage after 16 years of exile leading his us orchestra 
in a rousing version of john philip sousas stars and stripes 
forever 
asked how he chose that bit of defiance rostropovich said 
later from my heart 
the late leonid brezhnev had banished rostropovich for refusing 
to renounce his principles and denounce his friend exiled author 
alexander solzhenitsyn but the cellist and conductor came back to 
a homeland where brezhnev and not he was discredited 
rostropovich returned as the worldrenowned director of the 
national symphony of the soviet unions rival superpower among 
those who attended the concert was president mikhail s gorbachevs 
wife raisa 
washingtons national symphony orchestra responded to 
rostropovichs emotional return with a brilliant performance in 
which every song was a symbol from tchaikovskys pathetique 
symphony no 6 the last piece he conducted in the soviet union in 
1974 to the stars and stripes 
flanked by baskets of carnations and the us and soviet flags 
rostropovich and the national symphony held the audience rapt 
clutches of army recruits who had been helping with crowd control 
listened intently 
rostropovich 62 began with barbers adagio for strings and 
moved on to the tchaikovsky symphony he finished the main concert 
with the wildly varying emotions and styles of the symphony no 5 
of dmitri shostakovich whose grave he had visited immediately on 
arrival in moscow 
after five bows to cries of bravo and tumultuous applause 
rostropovich moved into an encore of a brief shostakovich polka 
and was drawn back for three more encores 
after the concert he plowed through fans musicians 
instruments and trunks stuffed into the narrow backstage corridors 
of the moscow conservatory and emerged in a light snowfall a few 
blocks from the kremlin as he climbed into an official car to 
drive to a reception in his honor at the us ambassadors 
residence a young woman ran up and cried marvelous simply 
marvelous 
at the spaso house party he tossed off vodkas in true russian 
style and enveloped longtime friends with hugs 
rostropovich and his wife soprano galina vishnevskaya left the 
soviet union in 1974 after years of harassment for their unwavering 
support for solzhenitsyn the nobel prizewinning author of the 
gulag archipelago which documented the soviet political prison 
camps 
four years later the soviets took the rostropovichs 
citizenship away for being ideological degenerates 
rostropovich had become an internationally famous cellist by age 
30 and lived a life of luxury and world travel but all that 
changed when he became friends with solzhenitsyn in the late 1960s 
at a time when dozens of prominent russians joined in a chorus 
of derision of the author rostropovich housed solzhenitsyn at his 
dacha for four years he sent a letter to four newspapers in 1970 
saying solzhenitsyn had suffered for speaking the truth all 
refused to publish it 
the presidium of the supreme soviet legislature restored the 
citizenship of rostropovich and his wife just a month ago and 
nullified the decree that stripped them of all their medals and 
honors 
rostropovichs fourconcert tour was arranged within days 
the new soviet minister of culture nikolai gubenko apologized 
in an article in the journal new times for the injustice of 
stripping the couple of citizenship the deplorable violation of 
human dignity should never be repeated he said

a refugee who twice floated to freedom from cuba 
said he will never return to his homeland again unless its to 
battle the government of fidel castro 
jorge diaz and fransisco gomez rodrigues who arrived here the 
first time in august went back to cuba secretly in january to 
fetch their families 
but they were taken into custody and imprisoned for a month 
before they were dispatched in the same 16foot boat they arrived 
in this time flooded with gasoline and lacking a working engine 
oars or even food according to diaz 
if i go back again it will be in an invasion force he said 
thats the only way im going back to cuba when fidel falls 
the voyage of diaz and gomez is apparently the first time cuban 
refugees have repeated the hazardous journey across the florida 
straits immigration officials said 
at the start of the second crossing diaz didnt believe hed 
ever make it to miami 
cuban border guards abandoned them in their boat 30 miles 
offshore and tossed the engine key into the boat but it bounced 
into the water diaz said tuesday as he sat in the krome avenue 
detention center in miami 
i asked them why they didnt just shoot us and save the 
trouble the 37yearold diaz said they said they were under 
orders from the interior minister 
the longtime friends believed they would die at sea with their 
families in miami and cuba never knowing their fate diaz said 
gomez 31 could not be interviewed tuesday he was hospitalized 
with a kidney stone condition aggravated by the boat ride 
immigration and naturalization service officials said 
ins officials have interviewed the two men said vincent 
intenzo deportation supervisor at krome i believe them they 
have been interviewed several times and their stories are 
consistent he said 
in their first voyage from cuba they traveled with four others 
in a small plastic boat but the engine failed and their oneday 
food supply was quickly exhausted diaz said 
the boat drifted for five days until the group was rescued by 
the coast guard about 95 miles off the florida keys 
they spent two weeks in an ins processing center then worked in 
restaurants and odd jobs until they had bought a volkswagen and 
saved 250 they began to make plans to bring their families from 
cuba including diazs wife who gave birth last month to their 
first child 
they traded the car and the money for a 16foot boat outfitted 
it with an outboard motor and gas tanks and early jan 6 left the 
keys city of marathon 
just off havana bad weather blew them off course marooning 
them on a small rock island diaz said the next morning a 
fisherman an acquaintence of diazs spotted them and the cuban 
border patrol boat showed up 
the two were taken to a prison in matanzas province east of 
havana diaz said they begged to inform their families but the 
guards refused 
at one point they told me dont worry our families would 
never know we were in cuba diaz said i thought they were 
going to shoot us right there because that was the only way my 
family would never know 
but early feb 5 they were taken by a cuban patrol vessel about 
30 miles offshore told to get into their boat and left 
their only sustenance on the second trip was a little water left 
in a tank filled the month before three days out a cuban 
freighter approached them but the captain said he had been warned 
not to pick them up diaz said 
on the seventh day by now semidelirious they spotted a vessel 
in the darkness and desperately signaled with a flashlight the 
us tanker chestnut hill rescued them and called the coast guard 
when the coast guard arrived diaz said they had a surprise 
it was one of the same crewmen who picked us up the first time 
i talked to him and he remembered us diaz laughed 
diaz and gomez are renewing their requests for political asylum 
usually cuban refugees are released while their cases are pending

voters rejected by a 21 margin an attempt 
to make this alpine resort the nations first furrierfree town 
despite a campaign that attracted animal rights activists from as 
far away as sweden 
residents also voted tuesday for growth defeating by 1561 to 
1051 a measure to reduce the size of a luxury hotel by 25 percent 
and approving measures to widen the highway leading into town and a 
bond measure to build employee housing 
the winners hailed the results as a victory for free enterprise 
the losers conceded that the mood in the town home to gonzo 
journalist hunter s thompson and other eccentrics had taken a 
lurch beyond the bourgeois 
people seem more concerned with business and monetary gain 
than other values said katharine thalberg who with her husband 
mayor bill stirling led the fight for the fursale ban they 
want a larger hotel a bigger highway there does seem to be a 
value shift here in town 
the big winners are the people of aspen we can get back to 
business and welcome our guests back whove been staying away 
because of all this said mark kirkland manager of revillon 
furs one of aspens four fur shops 
the results set the stage for a recall election next month for 
stirling and three city councilmen who backed the ban 
while furriers gave live interviews on national television 
networks tuesday night antifur activists heckled them and waved 
go to vail signs much to the chagrin of aspen business 
operators fearing a lose of customers to the neighboring ski resort 
despite losing by 1701 to 898 stirling and thalberg claimed 
victory by attracting attention to the issue 
in terms of public opinion and world opinion we won 
thalberg said 
animalrights activists said furs are made from creatures that 
have been raised and slaughtered under cruel conditions 
kirkland who represented the furriers interests had little to 
say about any national impact 
im glad we won im glad its over he said 
the furfighting campaign brought animal rights activists from 
england sweden and the netherlands adding more spice to the brew 
of beautiful people who swing in and out of the chic expensive 
mountain town 
aspen has 3700 registered voters and a population said to dip 
from a peak of 20000 in the winter to 7000 in the summer 
many property owners dont live here full time and real estate 
prices have skyrocketed during the past decade 
this hotel and the other growth issues decide whether aspen 
will be a town of eclectic people or eccentrics like me or a big 
money machine said nick de wolf a retired engineer and 
inventor im afraid the results are pretty clear 
aspen was the first us community to pass a tough antismoking 
ordinance and the first to declare itself a nuclearfree zone

two men were acquitted on charges of 
illegally exporting to japan logs cut from federal land in what was 
believed to be the first time anyone had been tried for violating 
the law 
a federal court jury tuesday acquitted log dealer john j 
tortorelli of bellevue wash and parttime dealer winston bentley 
of spokane wash of all charges 
tortorelli and bentley were accused of having the logs federal 
markings sawed off because they knew they were for export 
federal law prohibits the export of raw logs cut from national 
forests the logs must be processed in us mills where prices are 
much less than foreign mills 
jack davis a us forest service investigator said he was 
surprised that the men were acquitted but said the fact the jury 
chose to believe the defendants is indicative of the complexity 
of investigations of that type 
preparation of the case took two years he said 
tortorelli was accused of buying truckloads of logs cut on 
forest service land in western montana northern idaho and eastern 
washington in 1987 and 1988 and then selling them to japanese 
exporting companies on the west coast 
bentley a church janitor helped inspect and handle some of the 
timber at a processing center in mead wash prosecutors said 
prosecutors believed the case was the first time anyone was 
prosecuted for violating the export ban 
the defense argued that any export of the logs handled by 
tortorelli and bentley was accidental and that the men should not 
be punished for any unintentional violations of federal law 
the government gave immunity to truck drivers duane farmer and 
roger britz of emunclaw wash in exchange for testimony that was 
expected to substantiate the charges however their testimony 
largely supported the defenses version of events

attorneys representing four people accused of 
burning an american flag want a judge to strike down the new 
federal flagdesecration law saying it violates the freespeech 
guarantees symbolized by old glory 
a hearing today before us district judge barbara rothstein is 
the first constitutional challenge of the flag protection act of 
1989 according to david cole a defense attorney 
congress passed the law in october in response to the us 
supreme court decision that burning the stars and stripes is 
protected under first amendment guarantees of free speech 
in that case the court struck down a texas law that banned 
burning of the flag 
congress new flag law is just as unconstitutional as the 
statute struck down cole said if we are to have freedom of 
expression people must be just as free to burn the flag to express 
dissent as they are free to wave the flag to express approval of 
the government 
mark haggerty carlos garza darius allen strong and jennifer 
campbell are charged with burning a flag outside a seattle post 
office shortly after midnight on oct 28 the day the law went into 
effect 
they have pleaded innocent and have moved to have those charges 
dismissed on grounds the act violates the first amendment to the 
constitution 
cole said tuesday he planned to cite texas vs johnson the 
supreme court ruling last june that overturned a texas conviction 
against gregory lee johnson who burned a flag at the 1984 
republican national convention 
assistant us attorney mark bartlett who was handling the 
governments case did not immediately return telephone messages 
tuesday for comment 
cole said the us house and senate have filed 
friendofthecourt briefs and attorneys for both legislative 
bodies were expected to speak 
cole said he did not expect the judge to issue a ruling today 
if she denies the motion he said the defendants would appeal 
directly to the supreme court as provided under the act 
the trial for the four is set for feb 26 in addition to the 
flagdesecration counts each is charged with one count of 
depredation of government property 
conviction on the flagdesecration and destructionofproperty 
counts each carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a 
100000 fine 
president bush had sought a constitutional amendment to ban flag 
burning but that was rejected by congress which passed the flag 
statute instead bush administration officials have said they doubt 
the flagdesecration law would withstand a court challenge

high winds and rough waves today 
blew ashore a gooey black tide from an oil spill halting cleanup 
efforts as officials feared shoreline workers might get swept to 
sea 
officials tripled the size of cleanup crews to 1120 as the 
worst accumulation of crude oil from last weeks spill swept onto 
miles of beach 
but treacherous seas with waves up to 7 feet high brought a 
nighttime halt to cleanup efforts that had been around the clock 
since just after the 400000gallon spill from the tanker american 
trader 
crews were sent home tuesday as high tide approached and onshore 
winds began gusting to 30 mph said coast guard lt richard booth 
the winds were kicking up a lot of sand and it was just 
impossible for people to work booth said 
offshore 13 of the 16 oil skimming boats also temporarily 
suspended cleanup work because of choppy seas he said 
the patchedup american trader moved into long beach harbor this 
morning and tied up at an atlantic richfield co dock to unload the 
remaining 21 million gallons of crude oil in its tanks and begin 
hull puncture repairs 
waves of grimy crude fouled six miles of sand along a 12mile 
stretch of beach southeast of downtown los angeles at huntington 
beach newport beach and bolsa chica state beach the oil has 
killed 86 birds and coated 261 in oil 
im disgusted surfer bill casper said watching the black 
tide roll in at his favorite surf spot near huntington beach pier 
its going to affect the beach for years there will be tar on 
the beach for years 
about 1000 grunion small silver fish resembling sardines died 
during a weekend run along the orange county coastline said 
state department of fish and game spokesman patrick moore 
grunion spawn with frantic dashes onto the beach at high tide to 
lay eggs in the soft sand any eggs left behind in the oilsoaked 
sand were not expected to hatch moore said 
the daily price tag for the beach cleanup is 750000 with the 
bill through tuesday reaching 4 million said james h ross 
president and chief executive of british petroleum american inc 
which chartered the ship 
the oil leak feb 7 came as the tanker tried to moor at an oil 
pipeline delivery point about two miles offshore 
eric bush a 19yearold deckhand on the american trader said 
tuesday that oil poured from the hull after he let down the 12ton 
starboard anchor 
bush said the anchors were being lowered just the way we 
always do when he felt two sharp jolts a few minutes apart he 
first thought the 811foot ship had plowed an undersea mud bank 
but a look overboard proved otherwise 
the water was just boiling with crude bush said 
british petroleum is coordinating most of the cleanup but is not 
expected to pay for final costs which likely will come out of the 
insurance of the ships owner american trading transportation co 
ross said 
gov george deukmejian held off on a request by huntington beach 
mayor tom mays to declare an emergency since he said most of the 
cleanup was being handled privately 
as far as we can tell there are no needs that are not being 
met said eileen baumgardner assistant director of the state 
office of emergency services 
cleanup crews grew tuesday to 1120 workers and 300 others were 
being trained 
one of the first lawsuits in connection with the spill has been 
filed by an 86yearold former congressman 
the classaction lawsuit filed tuesday by chet holifield in los 
angeles federal court seeks compensation for damage and economic 
losses caused by the spill and the alleged failure to properly 
clean up the oil among the defendants named are british petroleum

two ethiopian rebel groups fighting on 
separate fronts claim to have killed nearly 2500 government 
soldiers during weekend battles in two northern provinces 
it was not possible to independently verify the rebel claims 
made in broadcasts from their clandestine radio stations 
the eritrea peoples liberation front today said its fighters 
killed 600 government soldiers in fighting sunday near karan in 
ethiopias northermost province eritrea 
tuesday night the tigre peoples liberation front said it put 
5344 soldiers out of action in fighting saturday and sunday around 
wichale and mersa in wollo province on the main road north from the 
capital addis ababa 
in the attack 1813 soldiers were killed 2520 were wounded 
and 1011 soldiers were captured the tigrean rebels said 
wichale and mersa are about 200 miles from addis ababa 
the eritreans who launched their first major offensive in a 
year last week said they had put a total of 1500 out of action 
in the offensive the offensive followed two attempts at 
negotiations to end the 28yearold insurgency 
the tigreans have controlled their home province since early 
last year in august they claimed a series of battlefield 
victories as they moved west to gonder province and south to wollo 
and showa provinces 
early this year the government launched a counteroffensive and 
claimed to have retaken some of territory 
but on saturday the voice of the broad masses of eritrea 
radio announced the offensive along a front 125 miles long and the 
capture of massawa one of ethiopias only two ports on the red sea 
coast the fighting around karan 55 miles west of massawa began 
sunday 
the rebels said they destroyed eight government brigades about 
12000 men sank nine naval vessels and captured 46 tanks in three 
days of fighting 
ethiopian officials accused the eritreans of launching the 
offensive thursday to relieve pressure on the tigreans by 
government troops 
the tigrean and eritrean rebels have different goals but they 
have coordinated their attacks in the past 
the eritreans have been fighting since 1962 for the independence 
of eritrea a former italian colony 
the tigreans took up arms in 1975 and seek president mengistu 
haile mariams ouster and the establishment of a government 
patterned after that of albania the last hardline marxist state 
in eastern europe 
relief officials say the fighting around massawa has halted 
efforts to feed drought victims in northern ethiopia leaving 
50000 tons of food stored at the port 
the food is part of 700000 tons of emergency food the united 
nations hoped to deliver over the next months to 4 million people 
threatened with famine most of them in eritrea and tigrea 
in khartoum the capital of ethiopias western neighbor sudan 
officials said 24000 ethiopians had crossed the border this month 
to escape renewed fighting in eritea

defense secretary dick cheney today 
pledged no drastic reduction of us troop strength in south 
korea and said americas commitment to its asian ally remains 
strong 
however he was expected to press for a sharp increase in the 
south koreas financial support for the 43000 us troops who are 
stationed here under a 1954 mutual defense treaty signed after the 
korean war 
us troops will remain in korea as long as they are needed to 
guarantee the peace and the korean and american peoples and 
governments want them to remain cheney said after arriving from 
hawaii on the first stop of a twoweek tour of asian nations 
hosting us forces 
the us commitment to korea remains firm and unequivocal 
speculation regarding a us withdrawal from the peninsula or 
drastic reduction of our troop presence here apparently disregards 
the obvious the threat to peace on the peninsula remains real and 
has not diminished he added 
greeting cheney south korean defense minister lee sang hoon 
said the two nations were meeting at a time when military tension 
between south korea and hardline communist north korea remains 
undiminished but he said the two allied nations would work 
closely together to provide for a stable and peaceful asia 
cheney before leaving hawaii on tuesday said the threat from 
north korea remains very high 
if theres one place in the world where as secretary of 
defense i get up in the morning worried about the possibility you 
could have a shortwarning or a nonotice attack against us 
forces its in korea cheney told the pacific and asian affairs 
council in honolulu 
the defense secretary planned to spend three days in south 
korea including a trip to the demilitarized zone 35 miles north of 
seoul 
on sunday he goes to the philippines for a round of meetings 
monday with philippines officials but apparently not with 
president corazon aquino who has said she will not meet with him 
although cheney has said he will have plenty to keep him busy 
the aquino snub drew a rare public rebuff from president bush 
according to a published report 
she can learn a great deal from dick cheney about the way we 
view the very important united states presence in the pacific 
the president said tuesday in an interview with new york newsday 
maybe you could learn from the man or he could learn from 
you madame president bush said in the interview in remarks 
aimed at the philippine leader who turned aside a coup attempt 
dec 1 with the help of us phantom jets 
in announcing the would not meet cheney aquino said the united 
states has failed to follow through on pledges of economic aid and 
also took offense at us blaming the december coup attempt in part 
on corruption and inefficiency in her government 
bush denied in the interview that he was angry theres no 
problem he said shes given her opinion im right to give 
mine 
meanwhile a senior pentagon official traveling with cheney told 
reporters the secretary and his delegation intend to ask south 
korea to increase its 300 million annual contribution to the us 
defense to around 700 million by 1993 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
expected the discussion to be a very difficult one for both 
sides and that no specific resolution was anticipated during the 
secretarys visit 
the money issue also is troublesome because the south koreans 
argue they contribute more than 2 billion to the us forces 
annually through such things as the use of prime real estate in 
downtown seoul for the us military headquarters and an 18hole 
golf course 
the official said the delegation intends to suggest some numbers 
to the south koreans but he didnt expect a resolution until 
october the official said the asian nations hosting us forces 
are very sensitive to being pushed around about money 
the important thing is the trend are they moving in the right 
direction the official said describing the negotiations as 
sort of a kabuki referring to the stylized japanese dance 
the official said another issue on the agenda will be working 
out details for the coproduction arrangement for the sale of fa18 
hornet fighter jets made by mcdonnell douglas corp 
the 42 billion sale has sparked some controversy on capitol 
hill over concern that some of the sensitive technology in the 
fighter would allow the south koreans to develop their own aviation 
industry to compete with us firms the sale requires 
congressional approval 
under the plan the south koreans would buy a dozen planes 
assemble three dozen more from ussupplied kits and coproduce 72 
in korean factories with the help of the us contractor 
cheney has backed the arrangement as a means of helping the 
republic of korea upgrade its air defenses 
the united states spends about 26 billion a year on troops in 
south korea and cheney has come under severe pressure to reduce the 
numbers and increase the support from nations with booming 
economies that benefit by the us protection 
some lawmakers unhappy with the uskorean trade imbalance 
have called for pulling at least 5000 troops from the peninsula 
while others want to slash the force to 10000 soldiers 
even though cheney said at the outset of his twoweek tour of 
south korea japan hong kong and the philippines that he sees no 
need to drastically reduce us forces in the pacific he has 
said adjustments would be made 
talk of a reduced us presence has become more common amid the 
revolutionary changes sweeping the soviet union but cheney warned 
while in hawaii that the united states must be ready for any change 
in soviet policy and the threats from other sources such as 
communist north korea

the american bar association approved by a 
21 margin a resolution opposing government intervention in a 
womans decision to end a pregnancy 
the abas house of delegates passed the resolution 238106 
tuesday after about 2 hours of debate and attempts by opponents to 
defer the resolution said estell rogers a chairwoman of the abas 
rights of women committee 
it was the first time the aba has taken a stand on abortion 
itself although the bar association has issued policy statements 
calling for uniformity in state laws and on the right of funding 
for abortion rogers said 
the resolution could lead the bar association to join prochoice 
advocates in arguments over future abortion cases before the us 
supreme court rogers said 
it means that the resolution is now the official policy of the 
association said debbie weixl an aba spokeswoman 
resolution proponents were reacting in part to a 1989 supreme 
court decision which affirmed efforts in missouri to curtail 
abortion rights rogers said 
the socalled webster decision has just invited a tremendous 
amount of activity in state legislation that will have to be 
litigated said faye wattleton president of the planned 
parenhood federation of america who backed the resolution 
the aba policy statement recognizes the fundamental rights of 
privacy and equality guaranteed by the united states constitution 
and opposes legislation or other governmental action that 
interferes with the confidential relationship between a pregnant 
woman and a physician or with the decision to terminate the 
pregnancy 
among those opposing the resolution was aba president l stanley 
chauvin jr of louisville ky who said the resolution was beyond 
the abas mission others argued the resolution should be tabled 
because the issue was so divisive it would discourage membership 
the house of delegates is the abas only legislative body 
authorized to make policy

a new survey shows fewer high school students 
and young adults are using illicit drugs but federal health and 
drug officials say the numbers are still too high 
one out of two high school students still uses an illegal 
drug before he graduates one out of 10 uses cocaine said 
national drug policy director william bennett those numbers are 
unacceptably high 
the survey released monday is an annual effort by the university 
of michigan and funded by the national institute on drug abuse to 
track the use of drugs by high school seniors college students and 
other young adults 
it shows a decrease in overall illegal drug use over the past 
decade and in 1989 by all three groups 
high school seniors and college students today are half as 
likely to try an illegal drug as they were in 1980 according to 
the survey 
despite the good news said health and human services secretary 
louis sullivan we must not allow our efforts to slacken 
the decline in alcohol use has been more modest and cigarette 
smoking is about as widespread today among seniors as it was a 
decade ago nearly 19 percent of seniors are daily smokers and 60 
percent have used alcohol within the past 30 days 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics abuse and control said the survey 
understates the drug problem because it omits dropouts who are an 
enormous core of the drug crisis he said the survey is of 
extremely limited value 
survey officials acknowledge the limitation but said the data 
suggest drug use among dropouts may also be declining they said 
the survey shows the drop in drug use among high school seniors who 
are truant and have bad grades is as great as the drop among 
seniors who are not truant and have good grades 
among specific drugs 
marijuana casual use within the last 30 days among seniors 
is down from a peak of 37 percent in 1979 to 17 percent in 1989 
and for college students it has dropped from 34 percent in 1980 to 
16 percent last year 
cocaine 28 percent of seniors are casual cocaine users down 
from a peak of 67 percent in 1985 and among college students the 
drop is larger but for the smokable form of the drug known as 
crack casual and daily use has stayed about the same for seniors 
since 1987 when it was first included in the survey 
ice also known as crystal methamphetamine ice was 
included for the first time in the survey because of increasing 
concerns about the drug about 12 percent of the seniors surveyed 
said they had used it at least once in the past year use was 
highest in the west where 3 percent of the seniors had used it 
ecstasy the drug mdna known as ecstasy also was included 
for the first time and was tried by 38 percent of the college 
students surveyed and 33 percent of the high school graduates not 
in college 
steroids about 3 percent of high school senior said they had 
used anabolic steroids which are a controlled substance used to 
build muscles 
the survey of high school seniors which began in 1975 polled 
about 17000 students in 135 public and private high schools 
nationwide the other survey is a followup study of previously 
participating graduating classes in this survey about 1200 
college students and about 6600 high school graduates who are one 
to 10 years past high school were resurveyed by mail

the african national congress is 
willing to compromise with the government on details of a 
postapartheid political system as long as the principle of black 
rights is ensured nelson mandela said today 
the 71yearold black leader giving his first interviews since 
his release sunday after 27 years in prison was asked if the anc 
was willing to ease its demand for a oneperson onevote system 
that would lead to black majority rule 
compromises must be made in respect to every issue as long as 
that compromise is in the interest not only of one population group 
but the country as whole mandela told reporters outside his 
home that is the nature of compromises 
the anc repeatedly has rejected any system falling short of 
oneperson onevote mandela has stressed since his release that 
his movement would like to address white fears of black domination 
although he opposes the governments concept of group rights 
which would give special legal protection to whites and other 
minorities 
we are aware of the fears of the whites in the country of 
being dominated by blacks and we are addressing that very seriously 
and very earnestly he said i am convinced that in discussions 
between the anc and the government we will be able to find a 
solution which will be accepted by everybody 
mandela who plans to consult soon with exiled anc leaders in 
zambia did not elaborate on what compromises might be reached 
i think it be most presumptuous of me to speak for the anc 
he said it is the anc who would decide what compromises it 
should make we are ready for honorable compromises without 
surrendering our principles 
in lusaka zambia today the anc began a twoday meeting of its 
top policymaking body that was expected to focus on mandelas 
future role 
no precise agenda for the talks was released and anc officials 
gave no indication whether they expected mandela to travel from 
south africa to attend 
in the months preceding his release mandela met frequently with 
senior government officials including president fw de klerk to 
discuss prospects for negotiations between them and the anc 
in these discussions mandela said today my optimism has been 
strengthened 
de klerk who has transformed south african politics by freeing 
mandela and lifting a 30ban on the anc seeks to negotiate a new 
constitution that would extend political rights to the black 
majority but preserve some sort of political guarantees for whites 
police meanwhile reported that a new outbreak of fighting 
between rival black factions left at least 13 people dead 
police squads using tear gas rubber bullets and shotguns were 
trying to quell the unrest at kwanobuhle near uitenhage where nine 
people were killed 
four more killings were reported in natal province where black 
supporters and opponents of the anc have been feuding for three 
years the government said army troops would be deployed to halt 
black sectional fighting 
mandela has condemned blackagainstblack violence saying it 
weakens the fight against apartheid the system of institionalized 
racism that denies the countrys blacks a say in national affairs 
and forces them to live in segregated districts 
mandela and his family stayed overnight at the modest fourroom 
house in soweto that the black leader has rented for decades the 
area was quiet after the wild scenes of jubilation when he returned 
to soweto following his release from prison on sunday 
he briefly left today to visit elias motsoaledi an old comrade 
who was put on trial with mandela in 1964 on sabotage charges and 
is now quite ill as mandela left his friends house he talked to 
some young children urging them to go school to gain education and 
help fight apartheid 
more than 120000 people crammed shouldertoshoulder into the 
countrys largest stadium tuesday to greet the man revered by most 
south african blacks as their leader many in the crowd were 
getting their first glimpse of him 
he said the anc would continue the armed struggle as long as 
the violence of apartheid continues 
in cape town the government issued its first formal response to 
mandelas statements since his release 
constitutional development minister gerrit viljoen said the 
government agreed with mandela that apartheid must be eliminated 
and voting rights extended to blacks but he criticized mandelas 
support for continued guerrilla violence and economic sanctions 
the government is not prepared to accede to the handing over 
of power viljoen said if that is the goal of the armed 
struggle then there is no meaningful way ahead

the african national congress today began 
a twoday meeting of its top policymaking body that was expected 
to focus on the future role in the organization of nelson mandela 
no precise agenda for the closed talks was released and anc 
officials gave no indication whether they expect mandela to travel 
from south africa to attend 
the anc international affairs spokesman thabo mbeki said the 
35member national executive committee will discuss a broad range 
of issues stemming from the reforms announced by president fw de 
klerk on feb 2 
de klerk lifted a 30ban on the anc and legalized or lifted 
restrictions on dozens of other opposition groups he seeks to 
negotiate a new constitution that would extend political rights to 
the black majority but preserve some sort of political guarantees 
for whites 
mbeki told reporters that the 35member executive was empowered 
to make firm decisions without the presence of mandela an anc 
leader who was released sunday after 27 years in prison 
the anc has maintained its external headquarters in zambia for 
more than two decades 
mbeki said there were no differences within the anc over whether 
the group should continue its guerrilla campaign in light of the 
reforms in south africas political life 
senior committee member joe slovo said mandelas leading role in 
the anc was undisputed but did not indicate what his future 
position might be 
he is one of the prime leaders of the organization this was 
his position inside prison and is even more so outside slovo 
added 
the meeting in lusaka is expected to endorse the anc stand on 
possible negotiations with the pretoria government 
the group says de klerk has not created a climate for talks 
because he has not shown a commitment to dismantle apartheid 
the anc has demanded the lifting of all provisions of the state 
of emergency and the release of all political prisoners as 
conditions for direct talks

one of the two remaining allmale eating 
clubs at princeton university has voted to admit women but two 
more rounds of voting must be conducted next year before female 
students can join 
the ivy club formed in 1879 voted 5123 tuesday to allow 
women said robert garrett the clubs undergraduate president 
club policy states that two consecutive votes must be held to 
alter rules garrett said the second vote will be next year 
followed by a vote by the graduate board made up of princeton 
alumni 
the ivy club and the tiger inn are the only two of the schools 
13 private eating establishments that do not admit women most 
juniors and seniors take their meals at the clubs which are housed 
in private homes near the campus 
their exclusion of women was challenged in state supreme court 
last week by princeton graduate sally frank now a faculty member 
at new york law school 
ms frank backed by the state attorney generals office and 
princeton university argued that the clubs have a symbiotic 
relationship with the university that removes them from 
protection under the laws governing private organizations she said 
they are subject to the states antidiscrimination laws 
attorneys for the two clubs argued that they are similar to 
fraternities and sororities and have the right to choose their own 
members 
ms frank said her case and recent picketing by students and 
faculty put pressure on the ivy club 
garrett said members voted as they did for different reasons 
and that the club as a whole believes strongly it has a 
constitutionally protected right of association that lets it 
determine its own membership

two catholic leadership organizations 
jointly denounced us policies in central america and defended the 
right of clerics to speak out on moral issues 
we feel compelled by recent months bloodshed and violence 
in central america to speak out against us interventionist 
policies there said brother sean sammon president of the 
conference of major superiors of men 
the joint announcement tuesday by the mens conference and the 
leadership conference of women religious reiterated many of the 
complaints the catholic groups have aired in the past over what 
they called american interventionist policies in central 
america 
we always have a right and a responsibility to speak out on 
critical religious and moral issues said sammon who made his 
remarks in a room hung with grisly photographs of slain men women 
and children 
we join with latin american governments in condemning the us 
invasion of panama as a demonstration of naked interventionism 
we lament the deep wound inflicted on a free and sovereign 
nation said sammon 
the two groups represent 123000 brothers and sisters of 
catholic religious orders 
our country has funded the debilitating war in el salvador for 
more than 10 years and during that decade 70000 salvadorans have 
lost their lives sammon said 
sister helen marie burns president of the women leaders said 
we see those lives as simply representatives of the thousands of 
lives that are being lost and mutilated in the central american 
countries 
the murders which frame the decade for us of the four 
churchwomen in 1980 and the six jesuits and two women in 1989 
point clearly to the persecution of the church there and the 
reality of violence and repressions against clergy sammon said 
he said plans were being made to commemorate the 10th 
anniversary of the march 1980 assassination of salvadoran 
archbishop oscar romero

the bankruptcy filing by the parent of drexel 
burnham lambert inc could take years to sort out but already 
there is little left of the firm whose junkbond machine fueled the 
fastbuck megamerger 1980s 
with most securities firms refusing to trade with drexel and 
banks unwilling to lend money to stem its cash crisis the onetime 
powerhouse began liquidating its huge bond portfolio even before 
its board authorized the bankruptcy filing 
employees meanwhile scrambled to look for jobs in an industry 
that has been shrinking steadily since the october 1987 stock 
market crash 
drexel burnham lambert group inc parent of the securities 
company filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors late 
tuesday only four years earlier riding the crest of a takeover 
boom drexel had posted record pretax profits of nearly 1 billion 
dbl group currently faces a liquidity crisis and does not have 
the financial resources to weather this storm without court 
protection drexel chief executive frederick h joseph said in 
bankruptcy court papers obtained today 
joseph blamed the firms demise largely on a downturn in the 
financial markets he said a slump in the market for commercial 
paper shortterm ious issued to raise cash contracted in 1989 
and drexel was forced to repay 575 million without selling new 
paper to replenish the supply 
the burden of meeting these obligations effectively wiped out 
dbl groups liquidity rendering it incapable of meeting other 
obligations as they matured joseph said in the papers 
the filing showed how quickly confidence can sour on wall 
street analysts said and marked the beginning of the end for a 
firm humbled by criminal entanglements and a plunge in demand for 
highyield but risky bonds a market drexel created 
guards inspected boxes of personal belongings as employees left 
the downtown headquarters tuesday night resumes and phone calls 
from drexel workers flooded other wall street firms 
while no formal layoffs were announced employees considered 
their departure a foregone conclusion drexel brokers roamed the 
floor of the new york stock exchange openly soliciting jobs 
employees were told they would get paid thursday but there were no 
guarantees after that 
people were told the firm at some point is going to wind 
down a drexel executive said on condition of anonymity you 
dont need to draw a picture 
in its petition for bankruptcy court reorganization the firm 
listed liabilities exceeding 3 billion and assets exceeding 36 
billion 
the largest creditor listed is taiyo mutual life of tokyo owed 
697 million it is followed by home capital services inc new 
york 427 million banque indosuez paris 305 million sumitomo 
life insurance company tokyo and the state of californias 
retirement system 25 million fourteen of the top 20 creditors 
are foreignowned companies 
the filing affects only the parent company not the securities 
subsidiary brokerdealers are ineligible for chapter 11 
reorganization under federal bankruptcy law 
nevertheless with confidence shattered analysts expect drexel 
will liquidate its remaining brokerdealer holdings 
drexel immediately began dismantling its securities operations 
tuesday starting to liquidate billions of dollars worth of 
goverment bonds and mortgagebacked securities tens of millions in 
junk bonds and other financial instruments 
drexel also negotiated the transfer of customer brokerage 
accounts to smith barney harris upham amp co withdrew as a market 
maker in 228 overthecounter stocks and put entire business units 
up for sale 
the parent company said it defaulted tuesday on about 100 
million in loans and a lack of cash threatened other defaults 
drexel was turned down for bank financing that it sought to avert 
the filing 
the downfall of drexel which was founded in 1838 in 
philadelphia by a portrait painter named francis drexel has been 
as startling as its recent recent rise mirroring the career of 
junkbond genius michael milken 
milken is credited with singlehandedly creating and controlling 
the market for lowrated debt securities and using them to finance 
billions of dollars in hostile takeovers 
the highflying firm made gargantuan profits in its heyday 
almost 1 billion before taxes in 1986 and paid its employees 
accordingly milken personally made more than 1 billion from 
198387 
drexels attitude was embodied by brash letters telling clients 
it was highly confident it could raise hundreds of millions of 
dollars during corporate takeover battles and by its lavish annual 
junkbond conference known as the predators ball 
but the luster began fading in 1986 when drexel investment 
banker dennis levine was arrested on insidertrading charges the 
investigation later snared arbitrager ivan f boesky drexel other 
employees and an investment firm it did business with 
princetonnewport partners 
drexel in late 1988 agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and 
pay 650 million in fines and penalties milken was indicted last 
year on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering and has since left the 
firm 
some wall street professionals not all drexel backers 
maintain the firm wrote its own epitaph when it settled with the 
government to forestall a possible racketeering indictment and 
agreed to let go of milken which left the 200 billion junkbond 
market without a leader 
the junk market collapsed last fall as several big companies 
staggered under their debt burden 
the value of drexels huge debt portfolio fell with the market 
in the end some observers see drexels junk bonds as the emperors 
new clothes of big business in the 1980s 
milken found a void and he filled it said muriel siebert a 
former banking regulator who runs a small new york brokerage 
unfortunately it got out of hand they were making too much 
money were seeing the unraveling of the extreme excesses of 
money

the condition of a prisoner on an 11month 
hunger strike has stabilized as doctors for the second straight day 
forcefed him a liquid protein diet one of inmates attorneys said 
doctors at duane waters hospital next to state prison of 
southern michigan in jackson had feared inmate rene acunas heart 
might suddenly fail unless he received nourishment other than his 
diet of water and coffee laced with sugar 
paul denenfeld legal director for the michigan chapter of the 
american civil liberties union said acuna 37 of detroit put up 
no resistance tuesday to the second day of feeding through a nasal 
tube 
the doctor called me late yesterday afternoon and indicated it 
would still be a couple of weeks before we could anticipate an 
upswing in his health said denefeld who expressed optimism for 
acunas recovery 
the cuban immigrant went on the strike because he said god wants 
him to prove he is innocent of his conviction on drug charges 
the michigan court of appeals overturned for lack of evidence 
acunas convictions on conspiring to traffic more than two pounds 
of cocaine in august 1988 the convictions carried sentences of 
mandatory life in prison without parole 
prosecutors said he was a lookout for drug dealers but acuna 
has insisted the allwhite jury convicted him solely because he 
happened to be in a white neighborhood when other hispanics sold 
drugs to undercover agents 
acuna a selfemployed handyman and mechanic is unable to post 
the 100000 appeal bond while the prosecution asks the michigan 
supreme court to overturn the dismissal of the convictions 
a campaign has raised 150 toward the 10000 cash needed to 
obtain the bond said carolyn peyser a birmingham nurse collecting 
the funds 
acuna has said he wont eat until he is able to return to anna 
sossa his longtime companion and his two daughters his condition 
worsened last week when he began refusing liquids to protest the 
setting of the appeal bond 
his weight has dropped from 180 pounds to just over 100 pounds

the state may collect its 5 percent sales 
tax from an airline for drinks sold while its jets flew over 
wisconsin a judge has ruled 
dane county circuit judge james boll ordered tuesday that 
republic airlines inc pay wisconsin 90622 in overdue sales tax 
for drinks consumed on its flights over the state between 198184 
boll rejected republics argument that a law authorizing a sales 
tax on drinks consumed in this state did not mean over this 
state 
the judge ruled the state had the right to fairly impose its 
sale tax on flights overhead for any airline that had some definite 
link to the state such as offices based in wisconsin or 
incorporation within the state 
republic with its numerous facilities in wisconsin received 
substantial benefits from the state said state revenue secretary 
mark bugher he declined to say whether other airlines might be 
similarly taxed 
generally we would not be looking to reach out and touch 
every airline that touches the states atmosphere bugher said 
if japan airlines for instance happens to fly over the northern 
reaches of wisconsin it wouldnt be our policy to tax 
republic airlines which was purchased in the mid1980s by 
northwest airlines inc contended that applying the state sales 
tax to flights violated the due process clause of the us 
constitution 
republic was engaged in interstate transportation with offices 
in minneapolis minn when the state sought to collect the 
90622 the airline appealed an order of the wisconsin tax appeals 
commission that it owed the tax leading to the court case 
before it was bought out republic maintained offices in 
wisconsin had equipment and personnel located at airports in the 
state and flew regularly scheduled flights into and out of 
wisconsin cities 
republic said it did not keep records of the location of its 
aircraft when it sold drinks particularly whether the aircraft was 
in wisconsins airspace or above another state 
republic attorney frederic brouner said he did not know whether 
northwest airlines would appeal 
brouner said wisconsins attempt to collect on the tax after the 
sale was particularly onerous because it was impossible for the 
vendor to tax the consumer at the point of sale

lawmakers in the state house rejected two 
antiabortion measures before passing a bill allowing abortions 
until the 25th week of pregnancy a defeat for antiabortion 
advocates 
the 212148 vote tuesday on the measure allowing 
secondtrimester abortions fell short of the twothirds that would 
be needed to override gov judd greggs promised veto 
the measure must pass the senate before it reaches gregg 
something it is not likely to do before the legislature begins a 
twoweek break friday 
by a much wider margin the house rejected a bill that would 
declare that life begins at conception and a bill that would bar 
the use of public money employees or facilities to assist or 
perform abortions 
during tuesdays passionate debate on the abortionregulating 
bill antiabortion house members pleaded with their colleagues to 
think of the unborn 
we are considering a law that would permit the execution of 
the unborn at any time for any reason said rep kathleen

president bushs proposed capitalgains tax 
cut would worsen the federal budget deficit by 114 billion over 
the next five years and continue to lose revenues far into the 
future congressional economists said today 
the estimate by the staff of the joint committee on taxation 
disagrees markedly with one by the treasury department which says 
the tax cut would actually boost revenues by 125 billion over 
five years 
the two estimates agree that the capitalgains reduction would 
raise tax collections this year and next the congressional 
estimate puts the 199091 gain at 39 billion the administration 
forecast is for a 54 billion increase 
capital gains are profits from the sale of stock and other 
investments the realization or cashing in of such profits grows 
with the overall economy a report by the congressional tax staff 
said 
consequently if the economy continues to grow in years beyond 
1995 we would predict the revenue losses in those years would 
exceed the revenue loss for 1995 and would grow in magnitude each 
year thereafter the report said 
the disagreement over effects of a capitalgains tax cut is a 
longrunning one in essence the treasury traditionally has 
contended that a reduction would so spur investment that economic 
growth would increase tax collections even if the rate of tax 
were lowered 
congressional experts rejected those arguments 
the staff report estimated that 661 percent of the benefits of 
a capitalgains reduction would go to those with total incomes of 
200000 and more those making 100000 and more would reap 831 
percent of the tax reduction it said 
people with incomes under 20000 would receive 04 percent of 
the benefit the estimated 638000 people at that income level who 
would receive any of the benefit would get tax cuts averaging 88 
the report said 
the tax cut would benefit 681000 people making more than 
200000 a year their tax cut would average 15454 
under current law capital gains are fully taxed at the same 
rates as wages and other income when fully in effect bushs 
proposal would tax at those rates only 70 percent of the profits 
from the sale of assets owned three years or more property owned 
for more than a year but less than three would qualify for a lesser 
benefit

members of the supreme soviet 
visiting the strategic air command said they would never be the 
first to use nuclear weapons and challenged the united states to 
make a similar pledge 
during the visit tuesday which sac officials believed was the 
first by members of the soviet legislative body the soviets also 
questioned conclusions of an sac report showing soviet military 
superiority 
sac commander gen john t chain jr said he was pleased by the 
healthy dialogue but criticized the firststrike pledge 
a pledge is an intriguing thing chain said but it is 
meaningless it is nice rhetoric but meaningless 
mr gorbachev may be the nicest guy in the world and tomorrow 
stalin the second might take power in the soviet union chain 
said it is my job to assess capabilities and to prevent an 
attack 
all the 10 supreme soviet members saw of sac were the outside of 
the headquarters building and an auditorium where they were given a 
briefing on relative ussoviet strategic force capability 
the briefing by maj dave moore concluded that soviet military 
spending and modernization required the united states to make 
efforts to improve its strategic forces 
we were taken aback by the statement made by the major said 
vitaliy m shabonov a member of the supreme soviet and deputy 
minister of defense it is not a good thing to try to educate us 
on this matter 
after the soviets left chain defended the information presented 
by moore 
we didnt give them any information that cant be backed up 
with pictures chain said 
the soviets were accompanied by us rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee and us rep peter 
hoagland dneb 
the visiting soviets are members of the defense and state 
security committee of the supreme soviet they came to the base 
near omaha at the invitation of aspins committee 
shabonov said ussoviet military discussions should focus on 
intentions rather than capabilities alone 
i have learned that our views of world stability are 
similar shabonov said and the world is looking to us to 
cooperate 
it is only natural that a strategy of fear and intimidation 
concerns us very much shabonov said he concluded that while the 
number of soviet strategic nuclear weapons would go down they 
would continue to be modernized 
you were the first to invent atomic weapons said vladimir 
l lapygin chairman of the supreme soviet committee on defense and 
state security we simply had to catch up you started to develop 
the minuteman and icbms i would like to underline that what we are 
doing all the time is trying to catch up to you 
we would like to take a mutual pledge that neither side will 
be the first to use nuclear weapons lapygin said 
the visit was part of a 12day tour of us military 
installations and scientific facilities that began feb 7 sac 
officials said 
the tour also includes stops at los alamos national 
laboratories kennedy space center north american air defense 
command and minuteman missile and b1b facilities at ellsworth 
sd army armored forces the f16 fighter plant at fort worth 
texas and navy marine and air force bases on both coasts

texaco inc one of the nations oil giants 
announced today a 1 million program to plant trees in three cities 
this spring to kick off private sector involvement in president 
bushs america the beautiful program 
james w kinnear texaco president said the tree money will be 
shared in denver houston and new orleans where the company has 
extensive operations 
kinnear told a news conference at the agriculture department 
that the plantings will be done by texaco volunteers and that he 
expected around 50000 trees would be set out in the three cities 
the trees he said will be big enough to make a difference this 
decade 
both kinnear and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter expressed 
hope that texacos example would lead others in the three cities 
and elsewhere to chip in with their own efforts 
yeutter said existing programs in usda can accomplish a lot in 
rural areas but that a special effort is needed in the cities 
rep lindy boggs dla said thousands of trees in new orleans 
have been ravaged by pests and that texacos program is desperately 
needed 
the america the beautiful project was included in bushs 
budget proposals for fiscal 1991 to help protect conserve and 
enhance the nations natural resources it included the planting of 
one billion trees per year 
one argument in favor of more trees is their ability in the 
growth process to remove carbon dioxide and certain impurities from 
the atmosphere and release oxygen as a byproduct

an indian airlines jet with 146 people 
aboard crashed and burst into flames while attempting to land at a 
southern indian airport today and 91 people were killed 
authorities said 
the airbus 320 crashed at 1 pm while on final approach to the 
runway at bangalore airport airline and airport officials said 
the crash occurred before the plane touched the runway and it 
caught fire as soon as it crashed said ps shetty airport 
manager in bombay where the hourlong flight had originated 
airline officials said the plane which was an hour behind 
schedule carried 139 passengers and a crew of seven 
one airline official said 17 foreigners were believed to be on 
the flight to bangalore one of indias richest cities and the 
center of the countrys hightech and research centers they 
foreigners included a frenchman two canadians two americans 
three japanese and a hong kong resident all who survived said the 
spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
a spokesman for the airline in new delhi reported earlier that 
at least 135 people were killed but airport officials in bombay 
and doctors at hospitals where the victims were taken said 55 
people survived the crash and were being treated for broken bones 
and burns 
theyre alive thats all i can say said one doctor who 
declined to give his name 
news reports said the plane apparently undershot the runway by 
about 50 yards the press trust of india said the plane struck a 
fence or an embankment as it was descending to the runway 
local villagers rushed out of their huts and across the field 
littered with baggage and debris toward the flaming wreckage local 
police were called to try to keep them away 
airline officials did not know what caused the crash but they 
said weather was not a factor the jet was acquired by the nations 
governmentrun domestic carrier about three months ago for 38 
million 
after indian airlines announced it was adding 31 airbus 320s to 
its aging fleet of boeing fokker and avro planes news reports 
criticized the airline for failing to adequately train pilots to 
fly the sophisticated aircraft 
the carrier was also criticized for failing to provide adequate 
hangar space to house and maintain the planes 
the last indian airlines crash occurred oct 19 1988 when a 
boeing 737 crashed on final approach to an airport in the western 
city of ahmedabad killing 133 of the 135 people on board an 
investigation later blamed pilot error for the accident the worst 
in the airlines 26year history 
on the same day a fokker propellerdriven plane operated by the 
other domestic carrier vayudoot slammed into the side of a 
mountain during a fierce rainstorm all 34 people on board died 
indian airlines the major domestic carrier flies to 73 cities 
nationwide and to nine nearby countries it has come under 
criticism for allegedly failing to maintain preflight safety 
procedures on its fleet and to adequately supervise its pilots 
delays in flight schedules also are endemic 
air india also owned by the government is the countrys 
international carrier 
the a320 built by the european consortium airbus industrie is 
the first civilian airliner equipped with a fully computerized 
flight control system which the manufacturer says permits safer 
electronically controlled flight 
developed at a cost of nearly 2 billion the a320 was certified 
for flight on feb 26 1988 and went into service in april 1988

two star wars satellites 
rocketed into space wednesday to test a plan to destroy enemy 
missiles by bouncing deadly laser beams off orbiting mirrors 
a mirror on one of the satellites was designed to reflect lasers 
fired from a mountaintop in hawaii back to a ground target to 
assess the accuracy of a system for intercepting ballistic missiles 
sensors on the second payload were to measure laser strikes in a 
test aimed at correcting laser distortions caused by dust moisture 
and gases as the beam shoots through the atmosphere 
these are key technologies for developing a groundbased laser 
system if we get rid of the distortion in the atmosphere and get 
good accuracy with the laser coming off a mirror it is a major 
step in our program to develop directedenergy weapons said air 
force col william browning one of the project managers 
the satellites were carried aloft by a 12story delta rocket 
that roared off its launch pad right on time at 1115 am 
the tracking chart shows the vehicle right down the middle of 
the track its right on target launch commentator ray adams 
reported minutes after liftoff 
success of the mission could help preserve much of the 45 
billion that president bush has requested for research in budget 
year 1991 for the program formally known as the strategic defense 
initiative some members of congress want to cut deeply into that 
amount 
the beambouncing satellite called relay mirror experiment 
carried a 24inch diameter mirror designed to point a laser beam 
with an error of less than 57 millionths of a degree 
the experiment will use two ground stations on maui hawaii one 
is at the air force maui optical station located on the summit of 
mount haleakala the second is about 12 miles away at the base of 
the mountain 
both ground stations will aim lowpowered laser beams 
simultaneously at the 2300pound satellite orbiting 270 miles up 
rme will use those two beams as signals to orient its mirror when 
the mountaintop station aims another beam at the satellite the 
beam should reflect off the mirror and strike a sensor target at 
the second station 
the tests scheduled to start in about two weeks were scheduled 
to last about eight months with rme passing within range of the 
hawaii stations at least once a day 
the companion satellite is a 3175pound payload called lace 
for lowpower atmospheric compensation experiment its principal 
instrument is a package of 210 lasersensitive sensors packed into 
a square measuring 13 feet on each side 
the mount haleakala laser to be used on lace is equipped with a 
special flexible mirror designed to predistort the laser beam on 
earth in such a way that the expected atmospheric disturbances will 
erase the distortion the result should be a sharp and powerful 
beam by the time it reaches lace orbiting 340 miles high 
previous laser tests using targets on satellites and on space 
shuttles have established a pattern for the type of distortion the 
atmosphere causes 
lace also carries an experiment to acquire and track the exhaust 
plumes of rockets in a test to determine which wavelengths are most 
useful in detecting these plumes another experiment will measure 
neutron levels in space in a test designed to help develop a means 
of distinquishing between enemy warheads and decoys 
the lace experiments are expected to start in about 60 days and 
continue for 30 months

the white house today denounced the kidnapping 
of two americans in colombia to protest president bushs planned 
visit saying it cannot allow threats of terrorism to influence 
its policies or its activities 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush shares the 
concern of all americans about the kidnapping of these us 
citizens and would cooperate with colombian officials to help 
in any way deemed appropriate to help resolve this situation 
fitzwater also sought to minimize reports that bush might use 
the occasion of the drug summit to propose a radar net off 
colombia using us warships to help track cocainecarrying 
aircraft 
i dont expect him to bring it up at the drug conference 
unless colombia or other latin american countries bring the subject 
up first fitzwater said 
the spokesmans comments came on the eve of bushs daylong 
attendance at a fournation drug summit in cartagena a resort city 
on the northern coast of colombia 
colombian authorities on tuesday reported that leftist 
guerrillas had kidnapped two americans in the drug capital of 
medellin colombia to protest bushs visit 
they were identified as david kent a teacher from indianapolis 
and james donnelly employed by a company that manufactures 
hydraulic equipment 
although there had been reports that donnelly had been released 
fitzwater said today we believe those reports are inacurrate 
he said the us embassy had been in touch with members of 
donnellys family fitzwater said donnelly was kidnapped monday 
night but his wife was ordered not to report the kidnapping until 
tuesday 
the us government cannot allow threats of terrorism to 
influence its policies or its activities fitzwater said 
fitzwater said little was known about the group calling itself 
the national liberation army which claims responsibility for 
the kidnappings other than reports that it somehow has links with 
cuba 
we trust colombian authorities will pursue this matter and 
secure the release of mr kent and mr donnelly as soon as 
possible fitzwater said 
meanwhile the spokesman seemed to be backtracking from comments 
of the day before by national security adviser brent scowcroft that 
he expected bush would discuss a proposed radar net at the 
cartagena summit 
acknowledging extreme sensitivies in latin american toward any 
hint of a us military role in the region fitzwater said some 
senior administration officials were concerned that news accounts 
of scowcrofts remarks might not be well received by colombian 
officials 
colombia objected strenuously to earlier reports that the united 
states was considering a naval blockade 
fitzwater said today that any plans for using us forces 
including the radar net proposal should be deemed on the 
shelf unless colombia or other drugproducing nations ask for 
specific us help 
we want to be able to persuade these countries we can be 
helpful at their request fitzwater said 
the spokesman also held out the prospect that the administration 
would support some package of trade aid or concessions to help 
promote alternate crops in colombia including flowers and coffee 
colombian officials have protested that us trade policies have 
undercut these exports at the very time american officials are 
seeking to curb cocaine production and persuade farmers in andean 
nations to switch to other crops 
fitzwater said it was unlikely much progress would be made on 
this dispute at thursdays meeting but this is an area for 
discussion down the road 
colombian authorities say some 5000 security agents will be in 
cartagena to protect the four presidents and two amerrican 
warships have been deployed in the caribbean along with a 
colombian escort ship 
the us vessels are the uss nassau an 820foot amphibious 
assault ship which carries helicopters and a marine landing team 
and the uss sampson a 437foot destroyer armed with missiles and 
two fiveinch guns 
scowcroft acknowledged risks are involved in the trip 
of course its an unusual situation because there are in 
colombia these guerrilla bands terrorist bands with access to 
funds to purchase on the open market any kinds of arms and so 
naturally there are unusual circumstances scowcroft said tuesday 
at a white house briefing 
but we think theyre adequately taken care of he added 
the main purpose of bushs attendance at the summit is a show of 
us support for drugfighting efforts in the three andean 
drugproducing nations plus the expected issuance of a joint 
communique vowing an increased effort to fight the problem

on a possible plea bargain to settle environmental criminal charges 
that could be brought said the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
justice department spokeswoman deborah burstionwade confirmed 
discussions between department lawyers and exxon but she declined 
to say if they involved negotiations over possible criminal charges 
sources said prosecutors from the environmental crimes section 
of the departments land and natural resources division were 
participating in the negotiations 
a plea bargain involving criminal charges could be an outcome of 
those discussions said the sources a settlement could come in the 
next month one source said 
the negotiations were first reported in todays editions of the 
wall street journal 
company spokesman bill smith said exxon had no immediate comment 
on the report

987foot tanker exxon valdez ran aground on a reef along alaskas 
southern coast spilling more than 10 million gallons of north 
slope crude 
the tankers captain joseph hazelwood is on trial in state 
court in anchorage on charges of criminal mischief reckless 
endangerment and operating a vessel while intoxicated 
he faces a maximum sentence of seven years and three months in 
prison and possible fines totaling 61000 if convicted on all 
counts

authorities reported no problems today as 
students filed into selmas public schools amid heavy security for 
a second day after classes were shut down for a week by a racial 
protest 
everybody got in peaceably said national guard sgt norman 
arnold 
gov guy hunt ordered 200 national guardsmen into selma on 
tuesday to help local police and state troopers protect students at 
the nine public schools that had been closed since last wednesday 
two others closed a day earlier 
this is the first time troopers have been used to ensure that 
whites could go to school said jamie wallace executive director 
of the selma chamber of commerce 
the level of protest sparked by the dismissal of superintendent 
norward roussell seemed to recede from past days when demonstrators 
thronged city hall rekindling memories of civil rights marches in 
selma in 1965 
there were no immediate figures on todays attendance no 
student protesters showed up at selma high school when classes 
began 
on tuesday about 150 black student protesters boycotted the 
high school and marched around the flagpole before the opening 
bell chanting shut em down no school 
at city hall about two dozen protesters continued a sitin for 
a seventh day outside some protesters carried placards saying 
equality education 
both black and white parents seriously want their children 
back in schools said roussell in announcing tuesdays 
absenteeism rate was below the 30 percent that had been expected 
about 77 percent of the school systems 5971 students returned to 
classes tuesday he said 
roussell was restored last week but protesters want his contract 
to be extended another three years he had earlier been dismissed 
by the majority white school board 
selmas population is 52 percent black 
roussell said he doubted the conflict will end until there is 
some movement on my contract which expires in june 
his supporters say he was dismissed because of race and his 
efforts to place blacks in higher learning levels detractors said 
the decision was made because roussell lacked the adequate 
managerial skills he has held the 80000 post for 2 years 
it saddens me that children have to be pulled into a political 
and racial conflict that should have been solved years ago after 
the edmund pettus bridge roussell said referring to the selma 
bridge where civil rights marchers were clubbed by state troopers 
in 1965 
police chief melvin summerlin said a 16yearold white student 
reported he was beaten by three blacks with a brick and sticks as 
he walked alone from the high schools agriculture center to the 
main building about three hours after classes resumed 
summerlin said the teenager who was not seriously injured 
indicated his assailants were older than students he said the 
teenager told officers the men said they were beating him because 
he was white 
the school system is about 70 percent black and some white 
parents have moved their children to private schools or other 
systems during the past week roussell said 54 students were 
withdrawn from schools tuesday but he believes most will return 
once they see were open and things are going smoothly

united states announced tuesday that they would meet with their 
counterparts from east and west germany to discuss the alignment 
and military strength of a unified germany 
no date for such a meeting was given but before it takes place 
the two germanys will be left alone to tackle the considerable 
domestic hurdles that must be overcome before unity is possible 
with tuesdays announcement the powers that divided germany in 
1945 clearly acknowledged that reunification is inevitable now that 
communist rule has collapsed in east germany 
the brief oneparagraph statement did not address us concerns 
that a unified germany belongs to the nato alliance the soviet 
union seeks a neutral state the announcement said preliminary 
talks by lowerlevel officials on a unified germanys place in the 
new european order would begin shortly 
it was released about an hour before the soviet union and united 
states announced agreement on troops cuts in europe in which the 
soviets essentially accept a proposal by president bush and agree 
to a ceiling of 195000 troops for each side in central europe 
the agreement allows the united states to keep an additional 
30000 troops elsewhere in europe which mikhail s gorbachev had 
rejected just last week in seeking parity 
the announcements came during a conference of 23 nato and warsaw 
pact countries on opening up the worlds skies to surveillance by 
unarmed military planes on that issue they tentatively agreed to 
allow the first legal spy flights over each others territory the 
accord is to be finalized may 12 
officials have shied away from saying when a unified germany 
could become a reality but the two german states are moving 
swiftly toward that end on tuesday they set up a joint commission 
to set up a single currency 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
president finds that a very reasonable approach to the unification 
question and we are quite supportive 
he called it a good beginning that ensures a certain degree of 
stability and sureness of course as we proceed through this 
west germanys foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said in 
ottawa on tuesday that he hoped a 35nation summit would address 
the issue of reunification in november 
the statemen on a single german state said sixcountry talks 
would focus on external aspects of the establishment of german 
unity including the issues of security of the neighboring states 
the foreign ministers made no comment after release of 
statement apparently reflecting their desire not to create undue 
expectations or prejudice the work facing the two germanys 
the fourpower plan adapted from a us initiative calls for 
the powers to address external security concerns only after east 
germans elect new leaders in free elections set for march 18 us 
officials said 
the plan was first set forward by secretary of state james a 
baker iii and dubbed two plus four for the two germanys and the 
allies 
the statement came after the foreign ministers met for several 
hours on the issue overshadowing the open skies conference 
the subject of german reunion has preoccupied nato and the 
warsaw pact since east germanys hardline communist leader erich 
honecker was ousted in november in a peaceful popular revolt 
the countrys discredited communists struggled to hold on to 
power but agreed last month to share power with opposition groups 
until the elections but there is no confidence in east germanys 
economy and the westward exodus has not abated 
genscher sought to reassure the world that a unified germany 
will not pose a threat to peace 
we tell all our neighbors what we want to unite the federal 
republic of germany the german democratic republic and the whole 
of berlin no less and no more we do not have territorial claims 
against any of our neighbors 
we seek a european germany not a german europe he said 
concern about germanys alignment stems from the strategic 
importance of the region and the possibility that a unified 
germany could again become an aggressor west germanys 
500000troop military is the biggest in western europe having 
been stoked by nato as a frontline defense against a warsaw pact 
invasion 
along with unification west german officials reportedly have 
promised to cut their forces by about 100000 troops and east 
germany would disband its army said david shorr an analyst at the 
british american security information council in washington 
the four powers were under pressure to keep the west german 
military in check and so they devised the two plus four plan 
said shorr who attended the conference 
nato has insisted that a unified germany be part of the 
16member north atlantic treaty organization 
but the soviet union which maintains about 380000 troops in 
east germany wants a unified germany demilitarized so it can be 
of no threat to others foreign ministry adviser vitaly churkin 
said monday 
britains foreign secretary douglas hurd said tuesday that few 
countries at the conference other than the soviet union have 
suggested a unified germany would be neutral 
genscher did not mention the neutrality issue specifically in 
his tuesday speech saying only that unification should occur in 
the context of integration of the european community and that 
nothing will be negotiated without participation of the four world 
war ii allies 
as part of the plan a unified germany also likely would 
renounce the use or stationing on its soil of nuclear weapons us 
officials said 
germanys neighbors in europe would have a voice in the talks 
during the second phase a polish embassy official said on 
condition he not be identified

los angeles times on south africa 
freedom took a new meaning sunday feb 11 as the world watched 
nelson mandela walk out of 27 years of captivity the exultant 
celebration of his countrymen measured their own expectations the 
violence that accompanied the celebration underscored the 
complexity of what lies ahead 
the climax of the day was written in mandelas address to the 
nation as the man imprisoned for terrorism set the agenda for all 
south africans with eloquence and vision he looked beyond the 
bondage of apartheid to the establishment of democracy on a 
nonracial basis 
he used his first hours of freedom to facilitate what now needs 
to happen he was conciliatory praising president frederick w de 
klerk as a man of integrity and recognizing his constructive 
leadership but he was also realistic insisting on two 
preconditions for negotiations the end of the national emergency 
and the release of the remaining political prisoners 
mandela also issued useful warnings to lift sanctions now 
would run the risk of aborting the process toward the complete 
eradication of apartheid that reality has been accepted by the 
american government the struggle he cautioned is not yet over 
 
mandela walked free from prison but not from a system of racism 
that still strangles the lives of the blacks unpredictable 
forces have been freed with him they provide now unprecedented 
risk but also opportunity

portland maine press herald on south africa 
now that nelson mandela has been released it remains to be 
seen whether he can translate his special status as a political 
symbol into practical administrative leadership in other words 
can a man cut off from the world for more than a quarter of a 
century effectively deal with that world when suddenly thrust back 
into it 
there is no shortage of hope not only among south africans 
themselves but within the world community that he can do so and 
the words he spoke with such vigor dignity and resoluteness on 
sunday feb 11 can only bolster that hope 
while acknowledging south african president frederik w de 
klerks role in opening opportunities for change he vowed never to 
retreat from his own struggle for a democratic and free society 
in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal 
opportunities 
it was precisely that vow that landed mandela in prison 27 years 
ago that it had to be repeated shows how little political progress 
in south africa has made in the intervening years that is was 
spoken freely this time shows how much progress has been made in 
just the past few days 
a lot now hangs on the ability of a heroic symbol to give 
practical shape to that longdeferred struggle

east germanys heavily industrialized 
economy was long touted as one of the strongest in the east bloc 
but an exodus of workers devastated productivity and has hastened 
moves toward unification with west germany 
when east german leaders opened the countrys borders nov 9 
they were hoping to stop the flight by convincing citizens that 
serious reforms were under way 
but the exodus spiraled bringing the economy closer to 
collapse more than 85000 east germans have come west this year 
joining 340000 who arrived last year 
peter pietsch an economist for the west german bank 
commerzbank said the effect on east germany has been devastating 
in many offices every fourth of fifth employee is missing 
pietsch told the associated press the country could face a 
collapse if this outflow continues 
statistics released tuesday in east germany show how bad the 
situation is industrial production fell 56 percent in january 
1990 compared to the previous year mostly because of the exodus 
the government said the lost productivity has led to a severe drop 
in exports it said 
serious worker shortages have been reported across east germany 
mail is no longer delivered in some areas because theres no one to 
deliver it soldiers are being used to operate trolleys 
strikes and slowdowns by workers who fear they could lose their 
jobs as east germany undergoes democratic change are another factor 
east germanys economy always lagged behind that of western 
industrialized nations but for years it was considered the 
strongest in the soviet bloc churning out industrial goods 
chemicals and other products for itself and other east bloc 
countries 
its average per capita income last year was the highest in the 
east bloc 
but a growing number of east germans are attracted to wealthy 
west germany because of the prospects of living the kinds of lives 
they were denied under 40 years of rigid communist rule 
west germanys own social services in addition to its job and 
housing markets are seriously burdened by the newcomers and the 
dire situation has led to a number of moves toward unification 
in ottawa canada on tuesday it was announced the two german 
states and the four world war ii victors the united states 
britain france and the soviet union would soon begin talks on 
german unification 
on wednesday the west german cabinet approved a supplementary 
1990 budget that provides 345 billion in funding for immediate 
measures to help east germany 
the two german states at west germanys initiation are also 
about to undertake talks on establishing a common currency with 
west germanys powerful deutsch mark the currency for both 
countries 
this would be a giant leap toward unification 
when the idea first arose there was considerable opposition 
from west german financial experts who feared it could result in 
higher taxes and drag down the value of the deutsch mark 
economists are still advising that such a step be taken 
cautiously but support for the idea has grown with acknowledgment 
of east germanys desperate condition 
economists say it will take huge amounts of money to rebuild 
east germanys economy but they believe it can be done in 10 years 
pietsch said west germanys construction industry especially 
sees good possibilities for investment in east germany once 
freemarket economic conditions are established there his 
commerzbank plans to open branch offices in east germany at some 
point 
the machinery and equipment is generally better in east 
germany than in other east bloc countries he said the 
prerequisites are there for a strong economic upswing once 
investments from the west get going he said

the opposition 
the opposition awami league denounced the restriction as 
undemocratic and said it would go ahead with the planned march 
thursday to demand the resignation of president hussain mohammed

chowdhury 
the awami league and another opposition group the bangladesh 
nationalist party are campaigning for the resignation of ershad 
which they say will pave the way for free and fair elections 
opposition parties charging the government with corruption and 
autocracy have sponsored several strikes and demonstrations in 
recent months to press their demand 
a former army general ershad 59 took power in 1982 in a 
bloodless military coup since then he has held one presidential 
election and two parliamentary votes all the elections have been 
marked by allegations of fraud 
ershad has said he is ready to hold new elections but the 
opposition has refused to participate unless he resigns first they 
say elections under ershad would be rigged in favor of his jatiya 
party

withdrew the bulk of its invasion army from lebanon after a 
threeyear occupation it is to serve as a buffer against

soviet objections to nato membership for a 
united germany remain a major obstacle to reunification despite 
optimism in both east and west germany that they soon will be one 
again 
president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union has said 
germany cannot be part of the structure of nato and unification 
should lead to neutrality or even demilitarization 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany wants to keep a united 
germany in the alliance and the united states is intent on it 
as a compromise foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west 
germany has proposed keeping nato and warsaw pact troops out of 
what is now east germany 
the united states now has 255000 soldiers in west germany and 
the soviet union has more than 380000 in east germany on tuesday 
they agreed to reduce their troops in central europe to 195000 
each 
nato membership is an important issue for west germans whose 
nation is among the worlds richest after four decades of 
protection by the western alliance 
a look across the crumbling berlin wall at the grimecovered 
illkept buildings of east berlin is enough to convince most people 
nato membership has its advantages 
for the federal republic of germany i see little change in 
the nato position says josef janning an eastwest specialist at 
the university of mainz 
he said west germanys leaders would insist on retaining nato 
membership but the issue is complicated and janning told the 
associated press he feels demilitarizing east germany is the most 
practical solution 
janning said demilitarized status could end when europe worked 
out its security arrangements if there are no crises in eastern 
europe and there is no coup in the soviet union that could happen 
as early as this decade he said 
that would lead to a radical realignment of the north atlantic 
treaty organization turning its attention to atlantic rather than 
land defenses janning said 
he added that the united states would be a smaller military 
presence and the rest of its missiles would be removed but he 
predicted nuclear weapons would remain in europe because its 
security arrangements would include them 
the soviet union which lost more than 20 million people in 
world war ii wants a single germany demilitarized so it can be 
of no threat to others soviet foreign ministry adviser vitaly 
churkin said monday at an eastwest conference in ottawa 
foreign secretary douglas hurd of britain said tuesday few 
countries in ottawa except the soviets suggested a neutral germany 
soviet officials also have spoken of abolishing nato and the 
warsaw pact altogther but the comments were greeted skeptically in 
washington and western europe 
east germanys caretaker government also insists on neutrality 
and the new administration to be chosen in free elections next 
month is expected to oppose full nato membership 
in a poll conducted last week 92 percent of the 1429 east 
germans surveyed favored neutrality it was conducted by the 
wickert institute of west germany for quick magazine based in 
munich 
west germanys opposition social democrats have said cutting the 
size of west germanys armed forces might resolve the issue 
defense spokesman andreas von buelow said the soviets will 
prove cooperative if they can be sure the german side cannot mount 
an offensive war and if no threats to borders come from there 
the social democrats have a large following in east germany

the relatively high rate of tuberculosis among 
blacks long blamed on poverty appears to result in part from a 
genetic susceptibility to the disease a study concludes 
the study found that in nursing homes and prisons where the 
races have identical living conditions blacks are twice as likely 
as whites to become infected with tb bacteria 
researchers said they were surprised by their discovery which 
suggests that while crowded housing and other social conditions 
play important roles in spreading the disease genetic factors also 
appear to influence peoples ability to resist tb 
we found that there is a systemic difference between whites 
and blacks said dr william w stead whites seem to be more 
able to fend off the organism without its ever being able to 
establish an infection 
stead happened upon the apparent difference while analyzing 
nursing home and prison statistics at the arkansas department of 
health he reported his findings in thursdays new england journal 
of medicine 
another soontobe published study reports the discovery of a 
racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the tb 
bacteria which could help explain why blacks seem more prone to 
getting tuberculosis 
the arkansas study was based largely on a review of 25398 
elderly people who were free of tb infection when they were 
admitted to nursing homes in the state when they were retested at 
least two months later 14 percent of the blacks and 7 percent of 
the whites showed evidence of tb infections 
prison data from arkansas and minnesota also found that black 
inmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the 
bacteria while incarcerated 
its a very intriguing finding said dr george comstock of 
johns hopkins university i never quite believe anything until 
somebody replicates it but i dont know of any real holes in this 
one 
about 22000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the 
united states resulting in 1700 deaths in the population at 
large tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as 
whites 
the disease which attacks the lungs has long been associated 
with poor crowded living conditions an estimated 10 million 
americans are believed to be infected with the bacteria but not 
sick 
dr george curlin of the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases called the new findings plausible and

in his study stead speculated that whites have evolved better 
defenses against tb because the bacteria has long been common in 
europe and parts of africa north of the sahara but is traditionally 
rare in subsaharan africa 
in contrast blacks are genetically more resistant than whites 
to malaria which is common in africa 
in the other study dr alfred crowle of webbwaring lung 
institute at the university of colorado found differences in the 
resistance of germeating blood cells called macrophages in 
blacks these cells are more likely to harbor tb infections 
this helps explain why black people are more susceptible to 
tuberculosis than are white people said crowle 
at the turn of the century tb was the leading cause of death in 
the united states the number of cases fell steadily until 1984 
experts believe the decline has leveled off in part because of 
the emergence of the aids virus which weakens the bodys 
resistance to infections others possible factors include 
homelessness and immigration of people from areas where the disease 
is still common

the academy voter who can be as contrary as 
jessica tandy in driving miss daisy ignored the sex and 
actioncharged blockbusters of 1989 to bestow major nominations 
wednesday on films about race relations vietnam and the 
handicapped 
ler cerebral palsy my left foot 
nor did the academy voter succumb to a failing memory although 
studios favor lateyear releases for oscar hopefuls two of the 
bestpicture nominees were released early in the year dead poets 
society and field of dreams 
no matter that the late laurence olivier had created an 
unforgettable henry v winning a special academy award in 1946 
the new scruffier henry v or hank cinq as the olivier 
version was called won a best actor nomination for the new kid on 
the classics block kenneth branagh 
the odds were against a nomination for marlon brando as 
supporting actor in a dry white season after all he had 
thumbed his nose at the academy in 1973 sending a young indian 
woman to reject his oscar for the godfather besides few 
people had seen a dry white season an earnest uneven film 
about apartheid in south africa but brandos two scenes contained 
enough of his oldtime magic to make him a nominee 
when gloria swanson lost the oscar for her role of a lifetime in 
sunset boulevard 1950 she groused that it was unfair to 
compete with an actress who had played her role hundreds of times 
on the stage she lost to judy holliday who had created the billie 
dawn role in born yesterday in the theater 
if the swanson theory had been adopted pauline collins 
shirley valentine morgan freeman driving miss daisy 
and kenneth branagh henry v would not have been eligible for 
the acting nominations on the london and new york stages miss 
collins comprised the entire cast of shirley valentine 
among the many surprises in the 62nd nominations was isabelle 
adjani nominated as best actress in the subtitled french film 
camille claudia sophia loren won as best actress for the 
italian two women in 1961 and max von sydow was nominated last 
year for denmarks pele the conqueror but rarely has the 
academy recognized an actor who speaks a foreign tongue 
for the second time in a row academy members refused to 
nominate a popular documentary this year it was michael moores 
humorous and controversial indictment of general motors roger amp 
me 
recent weeks have brought criticism of moores film for its 
faulty juxtaposition of time elements and its entertainment values 
at the expense of accuracy 
so the academy voter again defies the wise money and casts a 
ballot on the basis of conscience and artistic integrity it should 
be a dandy awards festival on march 26

at least 51 vassar college students 
barricaded themselves inside the main campus administration 
building today to protest a racist remark allegedly uttered by sen 
daniel patrick moynihan 
the students blocked the doors by standing in front of them and 
it appears that many students couldnt get out even if they 
wanted to said john wordock a vassar senior who is also a 
reporter for wkip in poughkeepsie 
according to the vassar black student union moynihan on jan 29 
told a black jamaican who is a dutchess county official that if she 
doesnt like it in the united states she should pack her bags and 
go back to where she came from 
moynihan allegedly made the comment at a reception after giving 
a speech at the college students said the woman folami gray 
said she was questioning him about treatment of minorities in this 
country 
gray who heads dutchess countys youth bureau said she took 
issue with some of moynihans statements during the speech and that 
his comment to her was meant to embarrass and silence her 
moynihan spokesman brian connolly said that new yorks 
democratic senator had no recollection of the conversation but 
that if gray was offended by any of his comments it was 
unintentional 
a student told the associated press today that the students 
inside the main administration building would not leave until their 
demands were met 
what our demand is first we want to make sure that moynihan 
is deposed from vassars eleanor roosevelt chair a lecture 
position said jubi headley a vassar junior and we also have a 
list of demands its a combination of things that have built up 
over time 
moynihan is only the second person to hold the roosevelt chair 
established for discussion on such issues as civil rights status 
of women human rights and international relations 
he said the students wanted an intercultural center for 
minority meetings a rabbi to minister to jewish students and 
handicapped access to all buildings talks were scheduled with 
campus officials he said 
headley confirmed that nobody was being allowed in or out of the 
firstfloor college administrative offices and no telephone calls 
other than emergency calls were being transferred from the 
switchboard there he said students who live on the second floor 
were being allowed to use other entrances

anxiety attack after her foreman cursed at her has been awarded 
60000 in damages 
a jury last week ordered monsanto co and a supervisor to pay 
irma white the amount for emotional and physical stress

department at the plant in luling were awaiting safety equipment in 
1986 when gary mcdermott violently berated them for not 
working according to court papers

supervisor mcdermott had the right to chastise the workers who 
did no productive work for an hour and 45 minutes the company 
said in court papers 
monsanto spokesman george williamson said the company will 
appeal 
the plant makes herbicides and industrial chemicals white said

mikhail s gorbachev urged lawmakers today to 
approve his plan for a westernstyle presidential system after 
several of them balked at the idea calling it premature and vague 
members of the supreme soviet the national legislature that 
resumed its session after a twomonth break raucously debated the 
leaderships proposal to call an emergency session of their parent 
body to broaden presidential powers 
an adviser to gorbachev said he expects the new president to be 
elected within a month by the larger legislature the congress of 
peoples deputies 
the 58yearold kremlin chief took the floor at the end of the 
debate and delivered an angry attack on his critics 
unless democracy is strengthened and insured by corresponding 
mechanisms democracy will perish and well lose gorbachev told 
the 434 members of the legislature 
referring to the governments former repressive policies he 
said the victors will be forces who want to tighten the screws 
even tighter than they were earlier 
some people gorbachev said are proposing the soviet union 
follow the romanian version and are equating gorbachev with 
ceausescu he was referring to nicolae ceausescu the romanian 
dictator executed in december after he was ousted in a popular 
prodemocracy revolution 
gorbachev did not make clear whether he meant reformers or 
hardliners were suggesting the romanian version 
vice president anatoly i lukyanov recommended to the supreme 
soviet earlier today that it call the 2250member congress of 
peoples deputies into session on feb 27 to strengthen the 
presidency 
a total of 160 legislators voted against gorbachevs suggestion 
to shut off debate on whether to hold the congress session but it 
passed with 241 yes votes the supreme soviet then voted 30495 
with 34 abstentions to place the issue on its agenda meaning it 
will return to the issue 
a europeanstyle presidency would strengthen gorbachevs 
government powers while further weakening the control of the 
communist party apparatus 
the call for a special session of congress follows by one week 
the partys historic decision to end its 72year monopoly on power 
and lift the strict marxist prohibition on private ownership of 
factories 
gorbachev adviser georgy shakhnazarov told reporters during a 
break in todays session that officials want the congress to elect 
the new president within a month 
presidents in the future should be elected by direct popular 
vote shakhnazarov said the president should serve the same 
fiveyear term as the congress which was elected almost a year 
ago he said 
gorbachev is likely to be a candidate for the new presidency 
but for the second time in a week he spoke cautiously about whether 
he will run 
if we proceed to take a decision on the presidency we will 
decide there will be alternative candidates i dont know if i will 
be among the alternatives gorbachev said 
he told the supreme soviet he had been opposed to presidential 
power but added life demanded changes i think weve reached the 
point when we must take such a decision 
creation of a presidency is among 50 items on the agenda for the 
supreme soviet session which lukyanov said is scheduled to end in 
late april other topics include laws on land and property 
ownership taxes economic reform and secession 
the legislature is also slated to debate the ethnic violence 
involving armenians and azerbaijanis and the consequences of the 
1986 chernobyl nuclear power plant accident 
a halfdozen speakers today criticized the proposal for creating 
a presidency now 
vladimir i kirilov a deputy from the russian city of voronezh 
said that before discussing the presidency the leadership should 
abolish the domineering role of the communist party in the army and 
kgb security police 
anatoly sobchak a prominent liberal from leningrad said 
increasing the powers of the executive branch would decrease the 
powers of the legislature and he opposed that 
a legislative opposition group the interregional deputies 
group circulated a petition in the corridors outside the session 
calling for the president to be directly elected by the people 
voters should hold secret ballots and have a choice of candidates 
from multiple parties it said 
the petition read on the floor of the supreme soviet by deputy 
sergei stankevich also called for the selection of a new 
presidency to be delayed until new legislatures in the 15 soviet 
republics to be elected this spring consider the powers of the 
presidency 
the supreme soviet session was punctuated by worries about the 
ethnic violence plaguing the soviet union that erupted in a new 
republic tadzhikistan this week 
one deputy took a microphone at the kremlin meeting to demand 
that all the 434 deputies present stand in memory of approximately 
250 people killed in ethnic violence in armenia azerbaijan and 
tadzhikistan in the past month 
gorbachev addressing the legislators defended the use of 
soldiers to stop ethnic violence 
we must do everything to put out the fire he said

congressional analysts said wednesday that the 
new capitalgains tax cut proposed by president bush is tilted even 
more toward the wealthy than an earlier version although it would 
do less to worsen the budget deficit 
more than 83 percent of the direct benefit of the tax cut would 
go to those with incomes over 100000 a year according to a study 
by the nonpartisan staff of the joint committee on taxation 
the same staff estimated that 797 percent of the benefit from 
the cut bush recommended last year would have gone to that 
upperincome group 
last years bill would have delivered 1 percent of the tax 
reduction to those with incomes under 20000 this years version 
earmarks 04 percent for that group 
the congressional staff report differs sharply from treasury 
department estimates of how a capitalgains cut would affect the 
federal deficit 
treasury projected the cut would raise tax collections every 
year and by 125 billion in the 199095 period the joint 
committee report forecast annual revenue losses after the first two 
years and losses totaling 114 billion over 199095 
the committee had foreseen a 242 billion loss over six years 
from the bill that bush backed a year ago 
capital gains are profits from the sale of stock real estate 
and other investments they are fully taxed at the same rates that 
apply to wages and other income 
bush has made cutting the tax on capital gains a top priority 
contending such a reduction is needed to keep the economy growing 
under his proposal only 70 percent of the profits from the sale 
of property owned three years or longer would be taxed 80 percent 
of gains from twoyear property and 90 percent from oneyear 
property would be taxed 
democratic leaders of congress use three arguments to oppose a 
capitalgains cut most of the benefits would go to the wealthy it 
would worsen the budget deficit and it would lead to the undoing 
of the 1986 tax overhaul which ended preferential treatment of 
capital gains 
the administration has never denied that the wealthiest 
taxpayers would be the biggest benficiaries from a capitalgains 
reduction although spokesmen prefer to cite estimates that make 
the point less dramatically than those from the joint committee 
staff the administration disagrees that a reduction would start 
the unraveling of the landmark 1986 tax law 
on the deficit question the treasury department contends that a 
capitalgains cut would be such a shot in the arm for investment 
that the economy would boom generating more than enough revenue to 
pay for the tax cut 
the new congressional report signed by ronald a pearlman 
chief of staff of the joint committee on taxation agrees with the 
administration that cutting the capital gains tax likely would 
induce taxpayers to sell longheld assets in the short run 
however pearlman wrote it is out best judgment that the 
longrun behavorial response will be insufficient to produce a 
longrun positive revenue effect 
although the committee staff said there was insufficient 
information on which to base longterm revenue projections we 
believe those losses will continue for years beyond 1995 if the 
economy continues to expand revenue losses would be expected to 
grow each year after 1995 pearlman said 
the congressional report estimates that over a oneyear period 
bushs proposal would give a 159 billion tax cut to 1076 million 
taxpayers for an average reduction of 1481 
people with incomes over 75000 a year who file about 3 
percent of all tax returns would get 88 percent of the tax 
reduction their tax cuts would average 4729 
at the lower end of the economic scale those with incomes under 
20000 who file more than half of all tax returns would get 04 
percent of the tax reduction only 697000 of those 55 millionplus 
taxpayers would be expected to have any capital gains their tax 
reduction would average 86 
in making these calculations the congressional staff used a 
broad definition of income which includes some items that are not 
taxed those include taxexempt interest employerpaid health and 
life insurance and nontaxable social security benefits

the voyager 1 spacecraft sent radio 
signals to earth today indicating it successfully snapped pictures 
of most of the planets to create the first family portrait of the 
solar system nasa said 
engineering data we received show the proper commands were 
executed it looks like the pictures were taken properly said 
mary hardin a spokeswoman for the national aeronautics and space 
administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
voyager 1 which photographed jupiter in 1980 and saturn in 
1981 was ordered to snap the photographs between 512 pm and 
920 pm pst tuesday but it took five hours and 36 minutes for 
signals confirming the commands were executed to travel the 37 
billion miles to earth hardin said 
the space probe took the pictures from a vantage point 32 
degrees above the plane extending from the suns equator the 
planets orbit the sun roughly within that plane 
because no other spacecraft has been in such a position or will 
be there within coming decades this is probably the first time 
and last time in our lifetimes well be able to take such a 
picture hardin said its historic it will give us a 
perspective on our world and universe weve never had before 
nasa officials have said that when the photographs are assembled 
into a montage for display on a wall the planets will appear only 
as tiny dots separated by vast empty spaces and spreading ovr 100 
feet or more 
instructions to take the pictures were transmitted to the 
spacecrafts computer on jan 15 with more detailed orders issued 
feb 2 
because of other demands on nasa deep space tracking antennas 
the photos wont be sent back to earth until late march it will be 
late april before the images can be processed 
the sun and seven of the solar systems nine planets are 
expected to appear as points of light against a starry backdrop 
jpl officials said 
mercury the innermost planet will be too close to the sun to 
be distinguished by voyagers cameras and pluto is too far away and 
too small to show up in images

the president of a housing investment and 
management company suspended by hud secretary jack kemp today 
accused kemp of a scandalous vendetta that has forced the 
company to seek to transfer its huge portfolio of properties 
a bruce rozet president of associated financial corp renewed 
his charge that department of housing and urban development 
sanctions against afc and more than 40 affiliates were without 
merit he launched a scathing attack on kemp whom he said has 
allowed the nations lowincome housing stock to decline 
dramatically since taking office last year 
in huds desperate rush to damage our companies hud has in 
fact hurt the people it claims to be protecting rozet said at a 
news conference 
he contended that kemp has been afraid to take any action at hud 
for fear his administration will become enveloped in accusations of 
mismanagment and scandal like those that have dogged his 
predecessor samuel pierce 
kemp in a statement said hud stood by the suspension the 
facts are provable and they will be decided in a court of law he 
said 
but rozet said kemps actions against his companies were 
designed to mask his and the agencys failures 
we have now become caught up in a political campaign to divert 
attention from a continuing national housing policy of benign 
neglect in the name of hud reform said rozet who says his role 
as a democratic fundraiser made him an attractive target for kemp 
rhetoric and good intentions make good politics and even good 
press but they do not house people rozet said congress and 
the american people will soon realize that the emperor has no 
clothes 
rozet said his company planned to fight the suspension through 
hud administrative appeals and the courts meanwhile he said it 
was negotiating with several groups to take over its portfolio of 
some 350 hudbacked housing developments nationwide with a total 
of 45000 units 
questioned by reporters rozet said his company would not 
receive any money but was simply seeking to find another housing 
management firm to take over 300 of the 350 properties 
its not a question of money its a question of housing 
rozet said if hud wont do business with me i have to find 
somebody else that they will deal with or the tenants will just sit 
there and suffer 
and despite his attack on kemp for issuing the suspension rozet 
said he shared many of the secretarys housing goals and believed 
the hud staff had misled kemp about afcs performance 
in its suspension letter which was directed at an afc 
affiliate housing resources management hud accused the company of 
requesting subsidies for several vacant units at a oklahoma project 
and of misuing repair and security deposit accounts at several 
developments 
in a detailed response rozet said the subsidies were request 
before the two units became vacant and the overpayment was 
appropriately reported to hud he also said the business had 
reported and accounted for all of the questioned spending and 
blamed slow hud processing for many of the disputes 
in any event he said the disputes were routine for large 
developments and that it was unprecedented for hud to levy a 
suspension in such cases 
the suspension only keeps the company from new hud business 
however rozet said it had crippled the companys existing 
portfolio as well because kemp has ordered that even the most 
routine hud decisions regarding afc properties be made at 
department headquarters instead of by the agencys area offices 
which normally handle most transactions 
hud is thereby condemning lowincome innercity tenants to 
live in rapidly deteriorating conditions while hud slowly revises 
its procedures and continues an unwarranted assault on us rozet 
said the tenants are being made the victims while hud carries 
out it scandalous vendetta against our company 
rozet said he has decided to explore the transfer of afcs hud 
portfolio because stalling by the department likely will hurt the 
properties and he does not want to be around for the agency to 
use us as a scapegoat 
the hud suspension which could lead to an outright ban on all 
government work was issued late last month a week before afc was 
to receive a hearing on lesser sanctions affecting its operations 
in oklahoma and the district of columbia 
rozet contended the suspension was issued so that hud would have 
grounds to cancel the hearing hud has become the accuser the 
judge the jury and executioner all before we have a chance to 
tell our side of the story he said

truck operation in suburban calumet park where the hitchhiker 
could spend the night 
lonnie bramlett jr owner of airline towing said he suspected

business inventories fell in december for the 
first time in more than a year while sales remained unchanged the 
government said wednesday 
its a reflection that the economy has slowed down said 
thomas runiewicz an economist with the wefa group in bala cynwyd 
pa it slowed during the fourth quarter and we expect it to 
remain slow until the summer 
the commerce department said inventories were down 02 percent 
to a seasonally adjusted 7952 billion after rising 05 percent in 
november and 03 percent in october 
it was the first decline since a 01 percent drop in october 
1988 and the largest since inventories slipped 06 percent in 
december 1986 
at the same time sales were flat at a seasonally adjusted 
5225 billion november sales were revised downward from a 07 
percent to a 04 percent gain sales fell 05 percent in october 
runiewicz said the fact that inventories fell at the same time 
sales were flat means businesses were cutting back on production 
but he and other analysts agreed that while the economy is weak it 
is not nearing a recession 
it would take a significant decline in sales to tip the 
balance of economic activity in a negative direction said 
richard w rahn chief economist for the us chamber of commerce 
but government reports on retail sales yesterday already suggest 
that such a decline is not in the cards 
the commerce department reported tuesday that retail sales 
which represent a third of the nations economic activity jumped 
16 percent in january 
the december business activity produced a slight decline to 
152 in the ratio of inventories to sales that means it would 
take 152 months to exhaust inventories at the december pace the 
ratio was 153 in both october and november 
on the whole inventories are in pretty good shape said 
evelina tainer an economist with the first national bank of 
chicago it suggests that even though the economy is sluggish 
we shouldnt need much of a correction in the near term 
if inventories were to pile up excessively it could mean severe 
cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs a situation already 
found in the automobile industry 
chrysler corp ford motor co and general motors corp all 
experienced temporary layoffs in january to reduce the number of 
vehicles on backlots 
retail backlogs dropped 01 percent in december but sales fell 
further down 02 percent 
both inventories and sales at the manufacturing level which 
represent about 45 percent of the total slid 04 percent 
wholesalers inventories were down 02 percent while their 
sales rose 11 percent

she also had flashing neon lights and a sandwich board sign not 
allowed under local codes the name of her shop was such a deal 
pohrman said she wants to bring the town together as one big 
family and takes innovative stands on issues on flood control 
for instance she says the first thing shed do is buy pink 
lifeboats for everyone 
shes flamboyant for up here but maybe not by san francisco 
standards said 60yearold veteran walter allen who lives at 
the veterans home 
pohrmans critics include carlee leftwich the mayor protem and 
a sixyear council veteran who is running against pohrman 
anyone who assumes that because the veterans are elderly and 
have health problems that they are also stupid is making a 
terrible mistake said leftwich i would never attempt to 
garner their votes by entertaining them 
richard kessler a 65yearold resident of the home said of 
pohrman shes trying to work the vets home for votes to me she 
is nothing but a burlesque queen a lot of these old senile vets 
are taken in by her 
but pohrmans conscience is clear i love those people she 
said

the prosecutions star witness in the 
joseph hazelwood trial said today the tanker exxon valdezs 
autopilot was turned off long before a crucial maneuver and had 
nothing to do with the ships grounding 
third mate gregory cousins also said he is convinced that had 
the helmsman on the ship followed his orders the tanker would have 
missed a rocky reef by several miles 
the testimony came during crossexamination by hazelwoods 
lawyer who sought to show that all the procedures aboard the 
tanker were moving smoothly until the helmsman failed to execute a 
10degree right turn 
mr cousins isnt it correct that in your mind theres no 
doubt that if that 10degree right rudder had been executed the 
ship would have cleared bligh reef by a substantial margin asked 
attorney dick madson 
thats my belief cousins said 
he also corroborated the defense contention that the autopilot 
had been turned on for only a brief time and definitely was 
disengaged before the grounding and unrelated to it 
cousins testified earlier that hazelwood left the helm of the 
exxon valdez in the hands of an uncertain seaman who misunderstood 
orders and plowed the tanker into a reef 
cousins who was deputized by hazelwood to take command of the 
tanker for about 10 minutes before it went aground suggested the 
helmsman robert kagan caused the nations worst oil spill by not 
following orders to turn the wheel hard 
i think mr kagan didnt really understand the command 
cousins said tuesday he hesitated 
kagan conceded in earlier testimony that he had been timid 
about steering since an occasion in which he was reprimanded for 
oversteering a vessel but he insisted he followed all orders 
aboard the exxon valdez 
cousins indirectly blamed hazelwood for leaving him in charge 
with only kagan to steer hazelwood left the bridge about 10 
minutes before the disaster giving cousins orders to divert the 
tanker from normal shipping lanes to avoid ice cousins said 
he asked if i felt comfortable with what we were going to do 
and i said yes cousins testified he said do you feel 
comfortable enough that i can go below and get rid of some 
paperwork i said i felt very comfortable 
hazelwood promised to be gone just a few minutes and said to 
call him when the ship started to make a turn cousins told the 
superior court jury 
but during a day of questioning by assistant district attorney 
brent cole cousins indicated hazelwood never gave him specific 
steering directions as a result he wound up racing between the 
chart room and the radar screen trying to work out the proper 
maneuver cousins said 
this left him no time to keep an eye on kagan who was steering 
a job that cousins described as extremely simple but critical 
seconds can make a difference cousins said 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with one felony 
count of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of 
reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating a 
vessel while intoxicated the maximum penalty for conviction on all 
counts is 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
his lawyers contend he left clear instructions for the ice 
diversion maneuver and that if his instructions had been followed 
the ship would have moved smoothly past bligh reef hazelwood was 
fired by exxon after the spill 
cousins 39 a veteran seaman said he was on the phone with 
hazelwood at the moment the exxon valdez went aground in the early 
morning hours of march 24 the vessel spilled more than 10 million 
gallons of alaska crude oil into the clear waters of prince william 
sound 
cousins said he had begun to realize that kagan wasnt following 
his orders to make hard turns in the ships course after giving 
another order to kagan to turn harder cousins said he phoned the 
captain in his office a conversation interrupted by the crash 
i told him that we were getting into serious trouble 
cousins recalled he asked wheres the rudder that was 
when we suffered the first shock and we were hard aground 
he said he and hazelwood stopped talking there was nothing 
else to say there was a mutual hangup of the telephones 
cousins also offered a damaging version of hazelwoods actions 
after the grounding saying he thought the captain was trying to 
move the 987foot tanker off the rocks other witnesses have said 
that maneuver could have capsized the vessel causing a worse spill 
and potential loss of life 
hazelwood ordered the engines turned off 10 minutes after the 
grounding but later ordered them turned back on and gave orders to 
move forward cousins said 
hazelwoods lawyers contend that he restarted the engines to 
stabilize the ship on the reef but cousins said that when 
hazelwood finally gave up and killed the engines he declared 
were definitely not going anywhere

spike lee says the strides made during 
the civil rights movement are being eroded and that its his job as 
a filmmaker to portray the present state of racism today 
lee who addressed more than 1200 people at the university of 
iowa on tuesday said racial violence in the howard beach section 
of new york city compelled him to make his 1989 film do the right 
thing about racial tension and violence during a hot city summer 
in a lot of ways this country is going backward instead of 
forward especially with all the whole affirmative action and 
all that stuff that people were dying for in the civil rights 
movement the black filmmaker said 
i wanted to film about the present state of racism today i 
knew i dont have the answers but that wasnt my job lee said 
what my job was to hold the mirror up and let people know that 
this is the way it is and unless we all make an effort to do 
something about it its going to get worse

the ussoviet agreement on troop reductions 
in europe gives president bush the 30000 edge in soldiers he wants 
and pushes nato and the warsaw pact closer to a 23nation treaty 
the terms brought home tuesday night by secretary of state james 
a baker iii from an open skies conference in ottawa canada 
will limit the two superpowers to 195000 soldiers each in central 
europe 
that will be the maximum for the soviets on foreign soil from 
the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains the vast expanse of 
europe 
but the united states will be permitted to station 30000 troops 
in britain italy turkey greece and spain 
this is an important breakthrough which removes a major 
obstacle to the early conclusion of a cfe convention forces in 
europe treaty and it also established the principle that us 
forces in europe are not to be treated as equivalent to soviet 
forces in eastern europe bush said today 
now lets close the deal thats what i want to do conclude 
this cfe agreement and get it done and signed the president 
said theres still some technical problems 
he also hailed a separate agreement to speed german 
reunification the four powers that defeated hitler in world war ii 
have agreed to meet with leaders of the two germanys to lay the 
groundwork for unification 
bush spoke after receiving a briefing from baker who had helped 
negotiate the latest breakthroughs in meetings in moscow and then 
in ottawa with foreign secretaries from nato and warsaw pact 
nations 
the argument baker used in negotiations with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze was that the soviets could get 
reinforcements to europe much more quickly than the united states 
could from across the atlantic ocean 
so an imbalance of 30000 was allowed the us side as bush 
proposed in his state of the union speech jan 31 
the slight concession made by baker was to agree that 30000 was 
an absolute cap 
all 16 north atlantic treaty organization and seven warsaw pact 
members endorsed the agreement on troops joseph clark the 
minister of external affairs for canada said it overcomes one 
of the most difficult obstacles to the treaty the two alliances 
are negotiating in vienna 
but wide differences remain on combat aircraft baker in a 
speech to the ottawa conference on monday accused the soviets of 
trying to lock in an advantage of 2000 combat aircraft over nato 
us officials said there could be a decision to exclude 
aircraft from the weapons to be covered by the treaty but for the 
time being the agreement on troop reductions does not make 
completion of the treaty automatic 
other conventional weapons to be limited include tanks armored 
personnel carriers and helicopters 
clarks announcement in a conference hall with baker 
shevardnadze and the other ministers on hand came as a surprise 
only last friday in moscow gorbachev countered bushs proposal 
with two options either a 225000 or 195000 ceiling but no 
sublimit for central europe 
that is where most soviet troops in europe are now based with 
about 380000 in east germany alone 
but the bush administration prevailed and shevardnadze after 
four meetings with baker essentially accepted bushs approach 
imbalance and all 
some 400000 soviet troops would have to withdraw while about 
80000 american soldiers would return home 
as it is the soviets are under pressure from their allies to 
pull back czechoslovakia hungary and poland all are demanding 
withdrawal 
and east germany is on a fast track to unification with west 
germany a framework for merger was approved in ottawa by the 
united states the soviet union britain france west germany and 
east germany 
the issue of soviet troops in east germany was not addressed 
but unification could require a soviet pullout there as well in 
fact the soviets may find themselves under the 195000 ceiling 
the united states now has about 305000 troops in europe of 
which about 275000 are on the central front mostly west germany 
and 30000 generally in navy and air force units in greece 
turkey italy spain and britain 
shevardnadze in a brief exchange with reporters after clarks 
announcement sidestepped whether gorbachev had yielded to bush 
the soviet foreign minister said gorbachev had never rejected 
bushs proposal he did not say he would not agree to that 
shevardnadze said 
the foreign minister with a twinkle quipped are you 
disappointed 
the agreement on troop limitations capped a series of 
breakthroughs during bakers nine days in europe and canada 
in moscow he and soviet officials resolved several key issues 
that stood in the way of a treaty to reduce longrange missiles 
bombers and submarines by 30 to 50 percent 
sealaunched cruises missiles were separated from the emerging 
treaty that bush and gorbachev intend to sign at their summit 
meeting in washington in june 
also an agreement was worked out for destruction of chemical 
weapons stock also to be signed in june provided other nations 
capable of producing gas agree to an international treaty

three percent said they werent at all active 32 percent 
somewhat inactive and 18 percent somewhat active another 32

disagreed strongly another 28 percent disagreed somewhat 8 
percent agreed strongly 18 percent agreed somewhat and 4 percent 
had no opinion 
the survey was conducted in november by hughes research corp of 
rockville md the students between the ages of 17 and 24 were

an indian airlines airbus jet that had 
been in use only three months crashed onto a golf course and burned 
wednesday short of a runway in southern india and 91 of the 146 
people on board died officials said 
the airbus320 grazed a clump of trees on its final approach to 
bangalore airport and caught fire when it hit the ground about 50 
yards from the runway officials said 
the flight originated in bombay 530 miles northwest of 
bangalore the officials said 139 passengers and a crew of seven 
were on the hourlong flight and at least 55 people survived the 
crash including two americans the airline said 
the planes tail was intact but its fuselage was shattered and 
charred and the nose was smashed across the grassy plain adjacent 
to the airport 
there was no immediate reason given for the cause of the 
accident which occurred about 1 pm airport officials in 
bangalore contacted by telephone said the weather was clear and 
there were no indications of an emergency on board 
the aircraft was among a fleet of 14 airbus320s purchased by 
indian airlines last year at a cost of 38 million per plane from 
airbus industrie the european consortium that manufactures the 
plane 
the jet that crashed entered the fleet in december and had flown 
from bombay to the nearby city of goa and back earlier wednesday 
the airline said 
it was the first crash of an airbus320 in regular commercial 
service an airbus320 carrying passengers crashed june 26 1988 at 
an air show in eastern france killing three people and injuring 
50 the plane was on a demonstration flight and flew too low and 
slowly over an airfield hitting some trees 
the airbus320 is the first civilian airliner with a fully 
computerized flight system which manufacturers say allow for safer 
operation 
instead of the old control column in front of the pilot there 
is a pistolgrip side stick linked to five computers that 
modify and relay the pilots directions to wing and tail flaps a 
mechanical cable link to the tail allows the pilot to fly manually 
in emergencies 
aviation minister arif mohammed khan flew to bangalore to 
inspect the crash site and ordered an inquiry into the accident 
the secondworst in the history of indian airlines he also 
announced compensation of about 30000 to the families next of kin 
of the dead 
airbus industrie also planned to send a team to india 
an airline spokesman in new delhi said there were at least 17 
foreigners on the flight including two americans a frenchman two 
canadians three japanese and a hong kong man all of whom survived 
information about the others will take some time to gather the 
spokesman said because nationalities are not included on the 
tickets 
my husbands presence of mind helped me to get out of the 
aircraft through the back door said marook sadhwa a 29yearold 
canadian who was being treated for burns as soon as we came out 
we ran for a few yards and there were two or three minor 
explosions 
the crash is the latest in a series of mishaps that have earned 
indian airlines the reputation of being one of the worstmanaged 
air carriers in the world 
poor morale among the staff has led to frequent strikes and 
delays are also frequent employees allege that preflight safety 
precautions are often ignored and planes are allowed to fly even if 
major snags are detected 
the last indian airlines crash occurred oct 19 1988 when a 
boeing 737 crashed on final approach in the western city of 
ahmedabad killing 113 people a subsequent inquiry blamed pilot 
error for the crash the worst in the airlines 27year history 
the twinengined narrowbodied airbus consumes 40 percent less 
fuel than similar planes and has been making inroads into the 
mediumrange market long dominated by boeing and mcdonnell douglas 
according to one publication science report the aircraft 
technology includes a preprogrammed software system that tells 
the computer and not the pilot to make judgments 
the software system has the authority to forbid the pilot to 
take the actions he needs to in an emergency 
if the pilot wanted to make a sharp turn to avoid a collision 
the report said the system will not let the airplane respond 
beyond a certain rate

president bush today called soviet acceptance 
of his troop cut proposal for europe an important breakthrough 
that removes a major obstacle to a conventional arms treaty 
bush before signing a panama aid bill praised soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev for accepting his plan to allow the us and 
soviet armies to keep 195000 troops each in central europe with 
the united states allowed to station 30000 more troops in britain 
italy turkey greece and spain 
this is an important breakthrough which removes a major 
obstacle to the early conclusion of a cfe convention forces in 
europe treaty and it also established the principle that us 
forces in europe are not to be treated as equivalent to soviet 
forces in eastern europe said bush 
he also hailed a separate agreement to speed german 
reunification the four powers that defeated hitler in world war ii 
have agreed to meet with leaders of the two germanys to lay the 
groundwork for unification 
bush who had said monday that it was too early for a four 
powers meeting on the future of germany acknowledged he was 
caught by the surprise at which the german unification question has 
moved forward 
secretary of state james a baker iii who helped negotiate the 
latest breakthroughs in meetings in ottawa with foreign secretaries 
from both nato and warsaw pact nations was at the presidents side 
we and our german allies are in full accord said bush 
things move quite fast there 
the foreign ministers of the two german states will meet with 
the foreign ministers of the four powers the united states great 
britain france and the soviet union to discuss the external 
aspects of the establishment of german unity bush said 
this brings us a a step closer to realizing the longstanding 
goal of german unity said bush who has insisted that a united 
german must belong to nato 
these steps along with the inspiring march of democracy in 
eastern europe bring within sight the objective that i have 
stressed throughout the first year of my presidency a europe that 
is whole and free said bush 
now lets close the deal thats what i want to do conclude 
this cfe agreement and get it done and signed he said theres 
still some technical problems 
bush fielded questions from reporters after signing a 42 
million aid package to help panama recover from the effects of the 
noriega dictatorship that was overthrown by a dec 20 us invasion 
talking about developments in europe bush said were dealing 
with historic change i mean to be very elated about this he was 
criticized last year for not reacting with more emotion to the fall 
of the berlin wall 
its very very fast the fact that the secretary was able to 
close this deal in such a short period of time is evidence of 
this he said 
asked why he thought gorbachev had acceded to bushs demands on 
the troop cuts the president said i think he saw that it made 
very good sense weve stayed firm on this proposal 
events are moving awfully fast there and i think they see 
this as good for them i hope they see it as a stabilizing 
agreement for europe said bush 
asked if the warsaw pact as well as nato could have a role in a 
new germany bush said the allies want the stability of us 
forces in europe and a strong nato the eastern european 
countries that make up the warsaw pact want the soviets to leave 
they have a different equation 
we are talking about germany remaining in nato flexibility on 
where the troops in germany are but a strong nato said bush 
changes are going on so fast there that its hard to keep up 
with said bush 
theres a lot of things happened that happened more quickly 
than certainly i would have thought this troop agreement is one of 
them said bush 
asked what had changed between monday and tuesday to make it 
time for the four powers to meet bush said certainly there was 
a feeling on the part of chancellor helmut kohl who told me this 
on the phone yesterday that the agreement that secretary baker had 
been discussing was a very sound step 
were not trying to dictate to anybody over there how it would 
work said bush 
i was not aware on monday that they were going to have a deal 
on tuesday absolutely not said bush 
nor were we in ottawa baker said 
theres a lot of diplomacy going on said bush this 
surprised me that they were willing to make an agreement on 
germany as it did the troops i thought it was right to stay firm 
on it

the african national congress 
insists on full black voting rights but it is open to compromise 
on other constitutional issues and to considering guarantees for 
whites nelson mandela said wednesday 
mandela who plans to consult soon with anc leaders in zambia 
did not elaborate on what compromises might be reached 
i think it be most presumptuous of me to speak for the anc 
he said it is the anc who would decide what compromises it 
should make we are ready for honorable compromises without 
surrendering our principles 
during a conversation with a small group of reporters mandela 
was asked whether the anc was willing to negotiate about its demand 
for a oneperson onevote system which would lead to black 
majority rule 
that is the nature of compromising you compromise on 
fundamental issues he said but did not give the impression the 
anc was prepared to alter its position on voting 
the 71yearold black leader praised president fw de klerk 
who legalized the anc two weeks ago and released him from prison 
sunday after 27 years because of de klerks flexibility and 
integrity he said the possibility of a settlement is always 
there 
compromises must be made in respect to every issue as long as 
that compromise is in the interest not only of one population 
group but the country as whole mandela told reporters at his 
fourroom home where he slept tuesday night for the first time 
since his imprisonment in 1962 
mandela has said since his release that the african national 
congress wants to ease the fears of south africas 5 million whites 
about domination by the 28 million blacks 
he has expressed opposition however to the government concept 
of group rights which would give special legal protection to 
whites and other minorities 
we are aware of the fears of the whites in the country of 
being dominated by blacks and we are addressing that very 
seriously and very earnestly he said wednesday 
i am convinced that in discussions between the anc and the 
government we will be able to find a solution which will be 
accepted by everybody black and white 
de klerks national party is committed to negotiating a new 
constitution within five years extending political rights to 
blacks gerrit viljoen the constitutional development minister 
conceded tuesday the resulting government is unlikely to have the 
national party in control 
in lusaka zambia the anc leadership began a twoday meeting 
expected to focus on mandelas future role and a response to de 
klerks initiatives 
anc officials have acknowledged they were caught off guard feb 
2 when de klerk lifted a 30year ban on the guerrilla movement and 
made other major concessions in a bid to get negotiations started 
in recent months mandela had met frequently with senior 
government officials including de klerk to discuss prospects for 
negotiations between them and the anc 
my optimism has been strengthened in those discussions he 
said wednesday 
mandela reaffirmed support for the ancs guerrilla campaign 
which he helped launch in the early 1960s before receiving a life 
prison sentence and would not apologize for deaths of civilians 
you cant avoid people getting caught up in the cross fire 
when two people are shooting at each other he said people 
must not only worry about casualties caused by the anc they 
must worry about the series of casualties caused by the government 
over the decades 
police said wednesday a new outbreak of fighting between rival 
black factions had taken at least 13 lives 
they said officers using tear gas rubber bullets and shotguns 
were trying to quell unrest at kwanobuhle near uitenhage where 
nine of the victims were killed 
four deaths were reported in natal province where black 
supporters and opponents of the anc have feuded for three years 
the government said soldiers would be deployed to halt the fighting 
mandela has said black factional violence weakens the fight 
against apartheid south africas official policy of race 
segregation he told cbs news on wednesday police appeared 
disinterested in halting the bloodshed 
the area around mandelas home was relatively quiet wednesday 
after scenes of jubilation when he returned the day before 
he left briefly to visit elias motsoaledi a colleague who was 
tried with him on sabotage charges in 1964 and now is ill as 
mandela left his friends house he urged some children to go to 
school so they could become educated and fight apartheid

proposed stiffer fines and penalties for 
corporate wrongdoers were attacked as too tough wednesday by 
businesses but were endorsed by academics and public interest 
representatives who said the sanctions may not go far enough 
the proposed guidelines are extremely harsh punitive 
unwarranted and will place many businesses on the threshold of 
insolvency earlyn church a director of the national association 
of manufacturers told the us sentencing commission 
she said the commission should delay any recommendations for 
about five years because the panels proposals are based on 
inadequate research 
that prompted an angry rebuke from george e mackinnon a 
federal judge and a member of the commission 
mackinnon noting he had 60 years of experience as a lawyer and 
a judge said im not legislating in the dark we know all about 
corporate crime we might even know more than the national 
association of manufacturers 
amitai etzioni a professor at george washington university 
testified that the commission and congress should ignore the 
selfserving cries of outrage by business interests to deter a 
corporation fines should be set at a level which could not simply 
be absorbed as part of the cost of doing business 
let us not make this a valentines day for those corporations 
with blinders to all but their bottom line he said 
hofstra university law professor carl mayer representing ralph 
naders public citizen lobbying organization said the sentencing 
commissions proposed fines would help deter and punish corporate 
crime 
but he urged the commission to go further and give federal 
judges power to suspend or revoke the right of companies convicted 
of crimes to do business with the government he also said judges 
should have power to publicize convictions of corporations to alert 
shareholders workers and consumers 
joseph digenova a former us attorney here who now represents 
a group of defense lawyers said the sentencing commission is 
moving too rapidly 
new laws give prosecutors and judges adequate tools for 
appropriate sentences and restitution he said he said the 
commission should wait at least two years before adopting 
guidelines and in the interim should recommend a range of sentences 
for judges to follow 
the commission last november unveiled tentative guidelines for 
increased penalties for corporations one proposal calls for fines 
of up to 374 million for the worst offenders 
the panel said then that stiffer sentences will provide a 
strong incentive for owners and managers of organizations to 
strengthen internal mechanisms for preventing officers and 
employees from committing crimes and for detecting and punishing 
such crimes that are committed 
the commission created by congress in 1987 called for public 
comment on its proposals before a final report is submitted to 
lawmakers may 1 the guidelines would become law unless congress 
enacts legislation altering or overturning them 
the proposals would require judges to follow certain 
instructions in determining the size of fines and restitution for 
example penalties would be bigger when top executives aid or 
condone crimes or if the officials tried to block a government 
investigation 
fines would be lower if highlevel executives had reason not to 
be aware of the criminal conduct 
fines for companies formed to engage in criminal activity would 
be large enough to put them out of business 
the guidelines are aimed at punishing businesses and forcing 
them to make restitution but are not directed at punishing 
individual corporate officials 
the commission established sentencing guidelines for individual 
defendants two years ago and their constitutionality has been 
upheld by the supreme court

to the citadels corp of cadets had been rejected under the 
military academys menonly rule 
the us justice department has indicated it will consider the 
schools decision on the womans application in deciding whether to 
investigate the policy 
the department recently ordered virginia military institute 
the only other statesupported military academy in the country to

the order in its own lawsuit 
women are admitted to summer and evening classes and can earn a 
degree from the citadel but since the statesupported military 
academy was founded 148 years ago no woman has been admitted to 
the 2000member corps of cadets 
the rejected citadel application was the first ever from a 
woman school spokesman lt col ben w legare jr said tuesday 
the admission policy to the the citadel has not changed 
therefore the application for the female for 1990 entrance was 
rejected he said legare said a rejection letter was sent on 
friday to the applicant whose name was not released 
the rejection could lead to a lawsuit or a justice department 
investigation said georgetown university law professor john 
banzhaf ii 
banzhaf has been helping two south carolina women with justice

a major subsidized housing landlord suspended 
by hud secretary jack kemp said wednesday he planned to give up 
control of most of his properties accusing kemp of a scandalous 
vendetta that was crippling service to lowincome tenants 
a bruce rozet president of californiabased associated 
financial corp said he was negotiating with several housing 
investment and management firms and hoped to transfer roughly 300 
of the 350 properties owned managed or otherwise controlled by his 
company and affiliates 
nonetheless rozet said the company would challenge the 
suspension saying the accusations were without merit and that the 
company had provided documents to prove that to hud but has been 
ignored 
rozet also said kemps fear of scandal had virtually halted 
government housing programs 
we have now become caught up in a political campaign to divert 
attention from a continuing national housing policy of benign 
neglect in the name of hud reform rozet said the tenants are 
being made the victims while hud carries out it scandalous vendetta 
against our company 
kemp in a statement said poor conditions at the properties 
cited in the suspension letter speak for themselves he said 
his outrage is not directed at any one owner or manager but at 
a number of owners and investors he says have reaped lucrative tax 
benefits but invested little of their own money in the projects 
the department also released a memo from one of its attorneys 
that said huds inspector general was working with the fbi to 
investigate whether associated financial corps management 
affiliate housing resources management billed hud for subsidies 
for vacant units at an oklahoma development that memo said local 
hud officials in several states had raised questions about housing 
resources actions 
rozet said the company on two occasions billed hud for subsidies 
for units that became vacant after the requests were filed but 
housing resources quickly reported the vacancies and overpayment to 
hud rozet said saying such developments were routine because of 
high tenant turnover 
when hud issued the suspension late last month rozet said his 
role as a fundraiser for sen alan cranston of california 
twotime presidential contender jesse jackson and other democrats 
gave republicans looking for a democrat to draw into reports of hud 
scandals an easy target kemp has said politics had no role in his 
actions against associated financial and its affiliates 
at a washington news conference he called to answer huds 
charges rozet said he shared many of kemps goals he contended 
kemp has been misled about associated financials performance by 
minions who went after the company 
in huds desperate rush to damage our companies hud has in 
fact hurt the people it claims to be protecting said rozet who 
is scheduled to testify before congress in the near future about 
his companies properties which include 45000 subsidized 
apartments 
although the suspension only prohibits associated financial and 
its affiliates from seeking new hud business rozet said kemp 
recently ordered field offices to send all associated 
financialrelated work to agency headquarters hud inspectors this 
week also began visiting the properties with cameras demanding to 
see your worst unit rozet said 
those developments he said had convinced him associated 
financial had to give up the properties it controlled until it 
resolved its battle with hud rozet said his companies would 
receive no money through the planned transfer of control and that 
hud would have to approve the deal 
its not a question of money its a question of housing 
rozet said if hud wont do business with me i have to find 
somebody else that they will deal with or the tenants will just sit 
there and suffer

screwworm larvae were discovered in the wound 
of a us soldier injured in panama prompting warnings that the 
pest could infect animals in texas 
screwworms are the larvae or maggots of a blowfly that feed on 
the flesh of warmblooded animals they can kill livestock if the 
animals go untreated 
a 30year program had eradicated the screwworm first in the 
united states and later in mexico 
the soldier was among the first to arrive in san antonio on dec 
20 for treatment at brooke army medical center hospital spokesman 
ray dery said tuesday 
theres just a remote possibility that anything escaped from 
the hospital said paul jensen assistant area veterinarian with 
the us department of agriculture the weather was in our 
favor 
a hard freeze that hit san antonio in late december probably 
killed the larvae which thrive in warm climates officials said 
some of the larvae from the soldiers wound were saved for 
analysis and the rest were disposed of in medical trash and ended 
up at a local landfill dery said 
weeks later entomologists with the national museum of natural 
history in washington identified the samples that were saved as 
screwworm 
were asking any local veterinarian within a 20mile radius if 
they find any larvae infestation in any animal wound to send it to 
our identification lab in mission jensen said

adrian noble the 39yearold director whose 
credits range from shakespeare to cole porter was named wednesday 
the next artistic director of the royal shakespeare company 
noble will assume his post april 1 as artistic directorelect 
he takes over fully in july 1991 when current artistic director 
terry hands steps down after 25 years with the company 
noble will have a team of three executive producer michael 
attenborough associate producer genista mcintosh and general 
manager david brierley to form what a press statement called a 
powerful artistic planning and operational nucleus for the 
company 
the announcement came just a week after the company announced it 
was closing its two london theaters for four months beginning in 
november in order to stem a mounting deficit that threatened to 
reach 68 million 
some people have said ive been offered a poisoned chalice 
noble told a news conference at the companys london base the 
barbican 
ive simply been offered to guide and run the greatest theater 
company in the world fund us properly to fulfill that brief 
he said 
the revamped structure answers criticism that management of the 
company had become too large a job for one person it echoes 
somewhat the delegation of authority at the royal national theater 
londons other large statesubsidized playhouse which divides 
responsibilities between artistic director richard eyre and 
executive director david aukin 
noble a graduate of bristol university has been an associate 
director of the company for 11 years staging such admired 
productions as henry v which marked the professional 
shakespearean debut of this years oscar nominee kenneth branagh

wood and a trilogy the plantagenets drawn from four 
shakespeare history plays 
his 1987 revival of cole porters kiss me kate drew mixed 
reviews but transferred to the commercial west end for a lengthy 
run a mooted broadway engagement never materialized

the democratic party moved wednesday to allow 
california to shift its presidential primary from june to early 
march a change that would place the largest state among the first 
to vote in 1992 
the democratic national committees rules and bylaws committee 
acting with the support of dnc chairman ron brown agreed to change 
party rules to permit california to hold its presidential primary 
on the first tuesday in march 
the change expected to be approved easily by the full dnc next 
month means a proposal in the california legislature to hold its 
democratic and republican presidential primaries march 3 1992 
would be permissible under national democratic party rules 
california felt very strongly they wanted to be a player in 
the process said alice travis a member of the dnc executive 
committee from california coming last made it somewhat 
irrelevant 
the proposed rules would allow the party to apply a new sanction 
against states that violate national party rules by holding 
primaries or caucuses too early or too late or violate other 
delegateselection rules the change would provide an automatic 25 
percent reduction in the states total delegates 
the california assembly last summer approved shifting the 
states presidential primary from june to march and the state 
senate is expected to vote on the change thursday 
republican gov george deukmejian has dropped his opposition to 
the change removing a major obstacle 
the new democratic rules allow iowas caucuses to be the first 
presidential delegateselection event followed a week later by new 
hampshires firstinthenation primary 
california under the proposed schedule would become the first 
big state to vote 
one consequence could be to lessen the importance of the two 
earliest states by allowing wellfinanced betterknown candidates 
to concentrate on the state with the richest block of delegates 
it is important that a large state crucial to electing a 
democratic president weigh in early in the process brown said 
californias june primary date has placed it at the end of the 
delegateselection process when the nominee was already a foregone 
conclusion 
the 1988 california primary victory by michael dukakis over 
jesse jackson gave dukakis the delegates he needed to clinch the 
nomination but his nomination had been assured for practical 
purposes months earlier 
the party action technically moved up by one week the opening of 
the socalled window for states to hold primaries or caucuses 
with the change that period would run from the first tuesday in 
march to the second tuesday in june 
special exceptions allow new hampshires primary one week 
earlier however and iowas caucuses eight days before new 
hampshire a special provision also allows maine to begin its 
caucus process early 
the change presents a calender with iowa new hampshire and 
california on successive weeks followed one week later by the 
socalled super tuesday round of numerous state primaries illinois 
would hold its primary a week after that 
party activists expect the california change to trigger other 
states to move up their dates and perhaps some will join 
california on march 3

the state department has refused to grant a 
visa to a top nicaraguan diplomat to make public appearances this 
week in washington and new york a us official said wednesday 
the official asking not to be identified said the decision was 
made because nicaraguan officials could not guarantee that visas 
would be issued to all members of congress wishing to go to 
nicaragua next week to observe the presidential election there 
according to the official some members of congress who have 
requested visas have not received them a nicaraguan spokeswoman 
said delays have been common in processing visas because of a large 
number of requests 
nicaraguan vice foreign minister victor hugo tinoco had been 
scheduled to make an appearance here thursday at the carnegie 
endowment for international peace he also was planning to appear 
later in the week before the americas society in new york 
the us official said tinoco withdrew his request for a visa 
after the state department imposed its condition concerning 
congressional observers 
the state department had been willing to grant tinoco a visa if 
he had agreed to limit his activities to the united nations and the 
organization of american states 
nicaraguan embassy spokeswoman cecilia lopez had no comment on 
the state department action but she said that about 3000 foreign 
observers are expected to be on hand for the feb 25 balloting 
which features a matchup between president daniel ortega and an 
opposition coalition led by violeta chamorro 
last week a 20member congressional delegation appointed by 
president bush was disbanded because the sandinista government 
denied some members permission to enter the country 
the nicaraguan position is that it is inappropriate for the 
sandinistas to accept an official us delegation because of 
american support for the nicaraguan contras and the us economic 
embargo imposed against that country 
the nicaraguans invited the delegates to apply for visas to 
observe the election in an unofficial capacity 
twelve members of congress will join an unofficial observer 
delegation headed by former president carter eight other lawmakers 
will form part of two other delegations organized under the 
auspices of the un and the oas

hundreds of pushy barking sea lions some 
weighing more than 800 pounds are occupying at least 20 slips at 
the pricy pier 39 yacht basin delighting tourists but making life 
miserable for the marina and boat owners 
theyre cute as buttons but theyre very aggressive 
complained management spokeswoman lucy hobgoodbrown theyre not 
hurting business but theyre damaging the docks and they have bad 
breath 
the problem is that the herringgobbling sea lions are under the 
federal marine mammals protective act and may not be harassed 
hunted captured or killed 
i dont think you can even glare at them said marina 
manager sheila chandor 
national marine fisheries service biologist brad hanson said 
experts are mystified as to why the mammals have descended on such 
a public spot he said they usually prefer relatively isolated 
areas 
for more than a month the members of the herd with up to 300 
animals have been fishing frolicking and fighting at the boat 
berths which can sell for up to 50000 
pier 39 is a shopping restaurant and amusement complex just 
east of fishermans wharf 
the management is worried that the bulky animals adding 
unexpected tons of weight to floating docks will do serious damage 
to them and the attached water pipes and electric conduits when 
the whole gang is out of the water the docks are awash 
many electric meters at dock boxes have already been slapped 
loose when the sea lions haul out of the water the frisky 
creatures also scrape loose metal flashing and bash in relatively 
fragile dock boxes 
our guests wont leave chandor mourned but the 
tourists love it 
the piers main walkway runs directly in front of the sea lions 
adopted neighborhood during afternoons the place is a cacophony 
of barking blubber chattering tourists and clicking cameras 
the sea lions are all bulls most of them 3 to 5yearold 
juveniles hanson said some however are fullgrown and highly 
aggressive characters that have charged people venturing onto the 
docks no one has been hurt 
hanson thought the sea lions invaded the marina because the 
berths happened to be empty at the time boats are to be returned 
to the occupied docks next week and all hands are hoping for the 
best 
the mating season starts in may and were hoping the males 
here will go and join the ladies at the breeding grounds in the 
channel islands said hobgoodbrown the islands are north of los 
angeles near santa barbara

prime minister margaret thatcher of britain who had not hidden 
her unease about a united germany felt much happier after the 
argreement tuesday in ottawa canada to hold the sixpower talks 
her aides said 
we were worried there wasnt a framework in which we and the 
russians and other interested parties could actually discuss the 
external side of this foreign secretary douglas hurd said now 
we have that framework we are much happier 
under the agreement the united states soviet union britain 
and france the allies that conquered nazi germany and still 
occupy berlin will confer with both germanys on the security 
ramifications of a single germany 
officials of east germany and west germany will negotiate after 
east german elections march 18 then join the allies to focus on 
the external aspects including the issues of security of the 
neighboring states the ottawa announcement said 
a sixpower agreement would be presented to a 35nation summit 
before the end of the year 
the soviet union whose casualties in world war ii were 
heaviest said wednesday its sensitivities should be taken into 
account 
we have a psychological trauma we lost 26 million people in 
the war foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a 
news briefing he added however that he believed europe was 
changing for the better 
premier tadeusz mazowiecki of poland said at the end of a 
threeday visit to britain we want to be present whenever the 
question of the security of germanys neighbors is discussed our 
stand is that our security matters cannot be settled by proxy for 
us we must be present 
mazowiecki said poland wants a treaty guaranteeing its borders 
which embrace territory populated by ethnic germans and annexed 
from germany at the end of world war ii no peace treaty was 
signed so poland has no formal guarantees 
west germany has said a unified germany would respect the border 
and make no territorial claims 
israeli officials referred to a statement monday by foreign 
minister moshe arens that the jewish state puts its faith in 
democracy 
no one but certainly us jews can think about reunification 
without somehow remembering what happened 50 years ago arens 
said referring to the 6 million jews killed by the nazis but he 
added if a united germany is a democratic germany then i 
dont think that there is a danger to be concerned about 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany said 
after an hourlong meeting wednesday with mrs thatcher that final 
arrangements for reunification should be ready before the end of 
the year 
the prime minister has expressed firm support for german 
unity genscher told reporters outside mrs thatchers residence 
at 10 downing street it is an enormous encouragement for 
germans in east and west 
in november mrs thatcher said german unification was not on 
the agenda her aides say that was before east germany slid into 
economic chaos largely due to the mass flight of skilled workers 
to west germany 
the pace of events has surprised everyone hurd said 
wednesday 
mrs thatcher has been accused at home of wasting british 
influence by belatedly and grudgingly accepting german unification 
hurd said the most important issue for the sixpower talks was 
whether a single germany would remain in nato as the united states 
wants or becomes neutral as the soviet union prefers 
president francois mitterrand of france urged the 12nation 
european community which includes west germany to hasten its own 
moves toward closer union 
for me what is essential is that europe again take its true 
place in the world after the selfdestruction of two world wars 
he said in an interview with eight regional french newspapers 
the acceleration of the intergerman process should be 
accompanied by the acceleration of the european process 
ireland current president of the european community said it 
would summon the 12 nations soon to discuss german reunification

villagers threw firebombs and acid at troops 
protecting the communist party headquarters in the tadzhik capital 
on wednesday but the violence eased after three leaders in the 
republic resigned soviet media said 
the three agreed to resign during a meeting of party leaders and 
activists who are protesting housing shortages and the arrival of 
armenian refugees said orif aminov of the tadzhik branch of the 
state television and radio agency 
earlier in the day about 5000 young men went on a rampage in 
the republics capital looting setting fires and attacking 
passersby irrespective of nationality the soviet news agency 
tass said 
but officials denied soviet television reports that 37 people 
had been killed in the violence in tadzhikistan which borders 
afghanistan and china tass said 12 people had died tadzhik 
interior ministry spokesman mikhail shtatnov reported 11 dead and 
143 injured 
president mikhail s gorbachev criticized the rioters and called 
for harsh action against them saying the countrys destiny and 
the safety of our citizens is at stake 
ethnic disturbances have killed hundreds of people in central 
asia and the caucasus areas of the soviet union in the past year 
the violence in tadzhikistan broke out monday after rumors spread 
that ethnic armenians reportedly persecuted by natives of the 
azerbaijani republic were being moved into the taszhik republic 
where housing is scarce 
more troops landed in dushanbe the capital on wednesday to 
guard strategic points and restore order tass said the evening 
television news show vremya showed hundreds of people facing a wall 
of troops carrying riot shields with a barren stretch of street 
between the two tense groups 
however shtatnov and dushanbebased journalist anatoly larenok 
said in telephone interviews that the troops were in full control 
larenok said they had blocked approaches to the city to prevent 
rioters from neighboring villages from entering 
larenok said the crowd outside the central committee 
headquarters was demanding that victims of the three days of 
violence be buried in that central square 
tass described a pitched battle between protesters and troops 
it said the crowds demanded that the leaders resign and that all 
armenians in the republic be expelled 
militants have been making attempts to reach the tadzhik 
communist party headquarters since this morning tass said 
wednesday crowds throw gasoline bombs bottles with sulphuric 
acid and stones at troops blocking the buildings entrances 
aminov said the city quieted after the communist party central 
committee meeting with protest leaders calling themselves the 
popular committee of 16 announced the resignation of tadzhik party 
chief kakhar makhkamov premier izatullo khayeyev and president 
gaibnazar pallayev 
aminov said the crowd outside the central committee headquarters 
also demanded the ouster of the interior minister and military 
commandant kamil pulatov but he remains in his post 
the national newspaper trud said the rioters were young men from 
villages in the nearby gissar region many of whom still are living 
in tents after their homes were destroyed in an earthquake in 
january 
though the rioting reportedly was set off by rumors that 
armenian refugees would be given priority for new housing the 
young men who had come into dushanbe with concealed sticks metal 
rods and canisters of gasoline had attacked russianspeaking 
people in five suburbs the newspaper said 
gorbachev told the opening session of the supreme soviet 
legislature in moscow that new legislation is being prepared to 
deal with such violence 
we should throw the book at those who under slogans of ethnic 
revival draw people into a fight for their ambitions and selfish 
goals gorbachev said wednesday 
this is a kind of chain reaction accompanied by an orgy of 
violence gorbachev said the countrys destiny and the safety 
of our citizens is at stake comrades we must do everything to put 
out the fire 
gorbachevs greater tolerance of dissent has given rise to 
fierce demonstrations of ethnic pride that range from peaceful 
independence movements in the baltics to brutal ethnic clashes in 
the caucasus 
shtatnov said none of the dead was killed by interior ministry 
soldiers sent in to quell the fighting but malik khadyrov of the 
state radio and television offices in dushanbe said his 
correspondents reported seeing some people fatally shot by soldiers 
radio moscow quoted commanders of regular army forces in 
dushanbe as saying they would not step in to restore order because 
they did not want to repeat the mistakes made in april in the 
republic of georgia when soldiers attacked peaceful demonstrators 
and led to 20 deaths 
the government issued a radio appeal for citizens to fight bands 
of rioters said a dushanbe resident zina ushanova in a telephone 
interview it called on residents of the city to don white head 
bands to distinguish themselves from rioters

a prominent soviet legal scholar said 
wednesday the soviet judicial system is riddled with incompetent 
judges and must be revamped if political reforms are to succeed 
yuri rozenbaum who has drafted proposed new soviet laws on 
freedom of conscience and the press also said the soviet 
bureaucracy has many nogoods incompetents who have to be 
thrown out 
rozenbaum an attorney who works on the commission on freedom of 
conscience of the supreme soviet or parliament spoke at the 
eastwest forum a private organization that sponsors contacts 
between soviet and us scholars and government officials 
before the reforms of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
judges were picked by the communist party and held onto office if 
they were sufficiently subservient rozenbaum said 
weve discovered we dont have competent judges he said 
reformers would like to see the next batch of judges picked 
without party interference and to have their pay increased to 
assure their indepedence rozenbaum told the group independent 
selection of judges can only occur if local elections in the soviet 
union are conducted in democratic fashion he added 
communist party candidates are expected to face tough challenges 
in republic and local elections being held this month and next in 
the 15 republics that make up the soviet union 
secessionist candidates are expected to do well in the baltic 
republics of lithuania latvia and estonia as well as the southern 
republics of georgia armenia and azerbaijan 
in the four central asian republics no significant changes are 
expected in local elections because the largely moslem population 
there votes according to tribal and family customs he said 
the most fundamental problem is in the executive branch 
said rozenbaum 
some incompetent bureaucrats have already been discarded under 
the political and economic restructuring initiated by gorbachev he 
said 
but the government apparatus is the primary problem for 
perestroika or restructuring because entrenched bureaucrats have 
been dragging their heels implementing the reforms rozenbaum said 
bureaucrats are uncomfortable with the growing contact 
between elected lawmakers and nongovernment lawyers he said 
this makes the bureaucrats afraid because the deputies are 
becoming too independent and not paying attention to lawyers within 
the apparatus he said

the government cut off electricity to massawa a red sea port they 
claim to have captured 
massawa gets its electricity from eritreas capital asmara 
whose 40mile road westward from the port is also claimed to be in 
rebel control 
the rebel communique issued from their office in khartoum 
sudan said they killed more than 600 troops wounded 900 and 
captured 27 in fighting in recent days around keren 55 miles west 
of massawa they provided no rebel casualty figures 
the rebel offensive the largest in more than a year coincided 
with fighting in wollo province where another rebel group the 
tigre peoples liberation front has claimed it killed more than 
1800 government troops wounding 2500 and capturing more than 
1000 
the fighting was saturday and sunday 180 miles northeast of the 
ethiopian capital addis ababa the group said in a clandestine 
broadcast 
president mengistu haile mariams marxist government has not 
directly denied the rebel claim they control massawa and the only 
land route to asmara 
in addis ababa the government had made no statement since 
saying monday there was heavy fighting along the 40milelong 
asmaramassawa road and at the port itself

the medellin cartel which officials 
have feared might attack president bush during his visit here 
apparently decided to aim for positive publicity beginning with the 
surrender of three cocaine laboratories 
the three jungle labs worth an estimated 20 million and 
capable of producing 20 tons of cocaine each month were turned 
over late tuesday by cartel representatives 
but the national police chief gen miguel gomez told reporters 
wednesday the laboratories had not been used for some time and that 
there was no cocaine or chemicals for processing at them 
furthermore police raided another laboratory tuesday and seized 
1540 pounds of coke and 60000 gallons of chemicals proving the 
traffickers are going ahead with their production of cocaine gomez 
said at a news conference in caratagena 
he also said the traffickers promise to free hostages to end 
the drug war was meaningless because five people released in the 
last six weeks had to pay ransoms gomez did not say how much the 
ransoms were 
leftist guerrillas wednesday continued to hold two us citizens 
kidnapped to protest the bush visit this week a police spokesman 
said he denied earlier reports that one of the victims had been 
released 
the americans were identified as david kent a teacher from 
indianapolis and james donnelly employed by a company that 
manufactures hydraulic equipment 
the white house denounced the kidnappings and said it cannot 
allow threats of terrorism to influence its policies or its 
activities 
bush is to meet in this port city with presidents virgilio barco 
of colombia alan garcia of peru and jaime paz of bolivia to try to 
build a fourcountry strategy to halt the flow of cocaine into the 
united states 
the colombian national radio network rcn citing barco 
administration sources said barco would ask bush to help the 
country seek 1 billion in credits from international banking 
organizations over the next three years 
barco will ask the us treasury department to guarantee 
colombian bonds to be sold on european markets rcn said 
rcn which said it received an advance copy of the agreement to 
be signed thursday by the four presidents said the document calls 
for a world antidrug conference next year without specifying a 
date or the place 
the four presidents pledge in the statement to meet again within 
six months to review their progress in the war against cocaine 
according to rcn 
also expected to be on the summit agenda are us plans to 
control exports of chemicals used to process cocaine as well as to 
fight trafficking in arms used by drug barons 
the bush administration has said it will give 22 billion in 
aid to bolivia colombia and peru over the next five years to help 
in their antidrug efforts 
the three jungle laboratories in choco state on the border with 
panama were opened to journalists tuesday night 
the journalists also received a communique repeating a peace 
offer from the extraditables as the medellin drug bosses call 
themselves 
on jan 17 traffickers offered to lay down their arms abandon 
the cocaine business and help fight crime in colombia if the 
government would promise them constitutional and legal 
guarantees 
most officials took that to mean guarantees against what the 
traffickers fear most extradition to the united states since 
barco intensified a campaign against traffickers last august the 
government has extradited 14 drug suspects 
in the last month the traffickers have released six of 21 
hostages authorities say they are holding and have turned over a 
bus with 1000 pounds of dynamite 
the goodwill gestures have done little to ease security fears 
and 5000 security personnel from the four countries at the summit 
have been sent to cartagena to protect the leaders in addition 
guests at local hotels are being fingerprinted and 
dynamitesniffing dogs will be on patrol 
the united states has also stationed two ships the nassau and 
the sampson off the coast of colombia to protect bush

president mikhail s gorbachev appealed wednesday 
for legislative backing for a stronger presidency and said it was 
vital to his reforms but wary lawmakers refused to be stampeded 
into setting a timetable 
once again the 542member supreme soviet proved itself a force 
to be reckoned with in the new soviet political game which under 
gorbachev has shifted more from closeddoor sessions of the kremlin 
leadership to elected government bodies 
after a twomonth break the fledgling soviet legislature 
reconvened for the third time in its less than oneyear history 
lawmakers approved a 22item agenda to debate bills designed to put 
flesh on the skeleton of gorbachevs economic and social reforms 
including legalization of private property 
however the kremlin leaderships proposal to call an emergency 
session of the supreme soviets parent body the congress of 
peoples deputies to replace the office now held by gorbachev with 
a stronger westernstyle presidency met with raucous debate 
unless democracy is strengthened and ensured by corresponding 
mechanisms democracy will perish and well lose gorbachev 
angrily told his critics 
otherwise he said the victors will be forces who want to 
tighten the screws even tighter than they were earlier 
more power for the presidency would strengthen gorbachevs 
government powers while further weakening the communist party 
apparatus that he is trying to reform 
gorbachev would have two powerful instruments to implement his 
program of perestroika the party apparatus and the reinforced 
machinery of government 
vice president anatoly i lukyanov who flanked gorbachev 
beneath a gilded globe emblazoned with the hammer and sickle 
recommended that lawmakers call the congress into session feb 27 
to fortify the presidency and make other constitutional changes 
including the planned abandonment of the communist partys legally 
guaranteed right to govern 
a close gorbachev adviser georgy shaknazarov told reporters 
during a break in the proceedings that top kremlin officials want 
the congress to elect the new president within a month 
but the supreme soviet voted 30495 with 34 abstentions to 
debate the presidential issue first if the supreme soviet approves 
gorbachevs plan to fortify the presidency it must then be 
confirmed by the congress of peoples deputies 
gorbachev the soviet leader since march 1985 is likely to be a 
candidate for the new presidency but for the second time in a week 
he spoke guardedly about whether he will run 
if we proceed to take a decision on the presidency we will 
decide that there will be alternative candidates he said i 
dont know if i will be among the alternatives 
still a halfdozen speakers wednesday criticized the rush to 
create a more powerful presidency and gorbachev acknowledged that 
some soviets equate him with late romanian dictator nicolae 
ceausescu he did not clarify whether the comparison was being made 
by reformers or by hardliners who supported ceausescus brand of 
ironfisted leadership 
ceausescu was ousted by a popular revolution and executed dec 
25 
gorbachev told the legislature that he was once opposed to 
presidential power but life has demanded changes in the 
soviet political system the head of state has traditionally been 
merely a figurehead 
a prominent liberal lawmaker from leningrad anatoly sobchak 
said that increasing the powers of the presidency would decrease 
those of the legislature and he opposed such a shift 
ilmar bisher of latvia said he supported the stronger presidency 
but only if the powers of the office are carefully tailored he 
said that couldnt be done in time to hold a session of the 
2250member congress this month 
another speaker said the people would consider it strange for 
the congress to elect a president now since it elected gorbachev 
to a fiveyear term as supreme soviet chairman sometimes termed 
president for short only last spring and increased his powers 
in the corridors outside the kremlin hall a legislative 
opposition the interregional deputies group circulated a 
petition demanding that the president be directly elected by the 
people it said voters should cast ballots in secret and have a 
choice of candidates from several parties 
the petition read on the floor of the supreme soviet by group 
member sergei stankevich also called for the question of a 
bolstered presidency to be postponed until new legislatures to be 
elected in the 15 soviet republics this spring can consider the 
idea 
in a platform approved last week the communist partys 
policymaking central committee called for removal of the partys 
constitutional guarantee on power and set aside the strict marxist 
prohibition against largescale private ownership 
the supreme soviet will consider both issues it scheduled a 
report thursday morning on a bill that will allow soviet citizens 
and foreigners alike to own property including buildings and 
entire factories

for the drug summit in colombia reportedly because he saw no point 
in arriving a day early only to wait for president bushs arrival 
on thursday 
garcia had been scheduled to leave wednesday afternoon for 
cartagena colombia for the meeting with bush and presidents 
virgilio barco of colombia and jaime paz zamora of bolivia 
his departure was delayed until 5 am thursday and he told

cartagena summit saying i cannot meet with the leader of an 
invading nation 
he also recalled perus ambassador to washington in protest and 
briefly halted peruvianus antidrug operations in the huallaga 
valley

garcias plane would arrive in cartagena about half an hour before 
bushs on thursday morning 
among those accompanying garcia will be foreign minister 
guillermo larco cox and perus ambassador to colombia javier 
pulgar 
completing the entourage will be two officials from a 
cocagrowers cooperative and a un official who works with the 
cooperative in perus upper huallaga valley where most of the

the food and drug administration on wednesday 
approved a new drug that relieves the symptoms of endometriosis a 
disorder of the reproductive tract that affects more than 4 million 
us women 
the drug synarel is the first drug of its class to be approved 
for this condition it will be marketed by syntex corp 
synarel is administered as a nasal spray twice daily for six 
months and works by stimulating and then suppressing production of 
estrogen which controls the growth of the endometrial tissue that 
lines the uterus 
endometriosis occurs when this tissue which usually is shed 
monthly with menstruation migrates outside the uterus most often 
into the abdominal and pelvic region where it swells and bleeds 
during menstruation 
this tissue implants on the ovaries the intestines and the 
fallopian tubes where it can cause blockage and infertility 
symptoms of endometriosis include severe menstrual cramps pain 
during sexual intercourse painful urination and painful bowel 
movements 
side effects of synarel which is nafarelin acetate are the 
same as problems associated with menopause including hot flashes 
vaginal dryness and less commonly decreased sex drive syntex 
said a small loss of bone density also can occur but most is 
recovered after treatment is completed 
currently the most widely prescribed drug for treatment of the 
symptoms of endometriosis is danazol a derivative of a male sex 
hormone its side effects include weight gain decrease in breast 
size deepening of the voice acne oily skin and unwanted hair 
growth

a proposed change in federal communications 
commission rules would allow dialaporn services to transmit 
indecent material to adults if they required credit card payments 
issued access codes scrambled their messages and asked phone 
companies to list 900 calls to their services on customers bills 
the fcc is seeking public comment by march 2 on the rules which 
the commission first adopted in 1987 but congress concerned that 
the rules were not tough enough to prevent enterprising youths from 
gaining access to the sex messages banned dialaporn services 
outright in april 1988 
but the supreme court overturned the law saying the statute 
could apply only to commercial material that was judged obscene 
patently offensive and without redeeming value not merely 
indecent 
the court said the technological safeguards proposed by the fcc 
were enough to ensure that minors would not reach the dialaporn 
services and therefore the government was left with no compelling 
reason to ban such calls for adults 
the court retained the outright ban on forpay obscene telephone 
material 
in its notice tuesday the fcc asked for comment on the 
effectiveness feasibility and need for the billing notification 
requirement in light of intervening statutory regulatory or 
market changes 
it also asked commenters to suggest alternatives including 
technological advances and new telephone company service offerings 
including a discussion of the related costs and benefits of each 
alternative

president bush hailing historic change in 
superpower relations said wednesday that soviet acceptance of his 
troop cut proposal removed a major obstacle to a conventional arms 
treaty for europe 
bush said he was caught by surprise at how quickly the troop 
agreement and a separate pact to speed german unification had 
fallen into place 
were dealing with historic change bush told reporters he 
added with a laugh i mean to be very elated about this 
bush was criticized last year for his lowkey public reaction to 
news that east germany was opening the berlin wall 
the latest developments came tuesday in ottawa in talks between 
secretary of state james a baker iii soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze and other european foreign ministers 
with baker at his side bush said he was delighted with the 
agreement on troop cuts 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who last week called for 
parity with us forces agreed to a pullout that will leave both 
sides with 195000 troops in central europe but an additional 
30000 us troops in britain italy spain greece and turkey 
this is an important breakthrough which removes a major 
obstacle to the early conclusion of a cfe conventional forces in 
europe treaty and it also established the principle that us 
forces in europe are not to be treated as equivalent to soviet 
forces in eastern europe said bush 
now lets close the deal thats what i want to do he 
declared theres still some technical problems in it 
preparing for other possible deals notably on longrange 
nuclear weapons baker will meet shevardnadze again in april in 
washington to prepare for the june summit of bush and gorbachev 
officials said 
despite the agreement on manpower ceilings the united states 
and the soviet union still must settle differences over combat 
aircraft and anticheating procedures to wrap up a 23nation treaty 
to reduce forces and weapons in europe 
the treaty is now under negotiation in vienna between the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
for treaty purposes central europe is defined as west germany 
denmark belgium luxembourg and the netherlands for the us side 
and east germany czechoslovakia poland and hungary for soviet 
troops 
on the germany question the four powers that defeated adolf 
hitlers nazi germany in world war ii the united states soviet 
union britain and france have agreed to meet with leaders of the 
two germanys to lay the groundwork for unification 
bush who had said monday it was too early for a four powers 
meeting on the future of germany said he was surprised at the pace 
of events 
this brings us a step closer to realizing the longstanding 
goal of german unity said bush who has insisted that a united 
germany must belong to nato he also said the developments bring 
closer a europe that is whole and free 
meanwhile yuri dubinin soviet ambassador to the united states 
said the manpower levels agreed upon at ottawa are the ceiling 
and not the floor in our view 
we should continue with these talks to secure the withdrawal 
of all foreign troops from europe by 19951996 and the elimination 
of all military bases on foreign territories by the year 2000 
dubinin told a news conference 
bush asked why he thought gorbachev had acceded to his position 
on the troop cuts said events are moving awfully fast there 
and i think they see this as good for them i hope they see it as a 
stabilizing agreement for europe 
asked if the warsaw pact as well as nato could have a role in a 
new germany bush said the allies want the stability of us 
forces in europe and a strong nato the eastern european 
countries that make up the warsaw pact want the soviets to leave 
they have a different equation 
we are talking about germany remaining in nato flexibility on 
where the troops in germany are but a strong nato said bush 
asked if he were ready to propose initiatives for talks on 
longrange nuclear missiles bush said he had not yet had a chance 
to talk to baker since his return from moscow and ottawa 
but now guess what were going to do were going to go in 
and talk about this bush said 
bush fielded questions from reporters after signing a 42 
million aid package to help panama recover from the effects of 
manuel antonio noriegas dictatorship and the us invasion that 
overthrew him some of the money was shifted from african aid 
accounts congress is still working on a 1 billion panama aid 
package

asked to meet with the leaders of west and east germany to discuss 
the great fear that german reunification brings to the community 
of victims of nazism 
i must tell you i am not among those in the cheering section 
applauding the rush towards german reunification rabbi marvin 
hier wrote chancellor helmut kohl of west germany and prime 
minister hans modrow of east germany 
however if that is the inevitable course let us at least 
place on record our concerns he said 
hier is the founder of the center headquartered in los angeles 
which seeks to keep alive the memory of the nazi persecution of 
jews in germany and naziconquered lands 
in nearly identical letters he asked to meet with kohl during 
his forthcoming trip to washington and with modrow in germany next 
month the letters were made available wednsday to the associated 
press 
you are undoubtedly aware he wrote both leaders of the 
great fear that german reunification brings to the community of 
victims of nazism 
it is not an irrational fear of the kind that one explains 
away as the nightmares of victims who remain locked into their past 
and lose all perspective of present reality 
the fears are real because those who bear the scars of the 
last unified germany do not see their concerns being addressed in 
the current reunification discussions betwen world leaders 
hier listed 10 points he wanted to raise among them were a 
program to teach german schoolchildren about the annhilation of the 
jews the creation of an agency to monitor and prosecute hate 
groups the continuation of the special relationship now 
existing between west germany and israel the convening of a 1992 
conference of world leaders on the 50th anniversary of the 
conference at which the final solution was developed the 
establisment of a german commission to protect holocaust sites the 
banning of terrorist organizations that have enjoyed 
respectablity in east germany a cultural exchange program 
between german and jewish organizations german television and 
radio programs on the reconciliation restitution payments to the 
families and victims of nazism and a german commitment to 
revitalize former synagogues in east german territory

an indian activist pleaded guilty 
wednesday to 14 kidnap charges stemming from the armed seizure of a 
newsroom in 1988 and was sentenced to 18 years in prison 
eddie hatcher 32 and fellow tuscarora tribesman timothy jacobs 
had claimed they were trying to draw attention to local law 
enforcements alleged involvement in drug dealing when they held up 
to 20 people hostage at the robesonian newspaper on feb 1 1988 
the pair armed with shotguns surrendered to the fbi after 10 
hours 
after hatcher and jacobs were tried and acquitted on federal 
kidnapping charges a robeson county grand jury indicted them on 
state charges jacobs pleaded guilty to kidnapping charges last 
year and received a sixyear sentence 
hatcher made no statement during wednesdays court appearance 
he answered only yes or no as superior court judge coy 
brewer jr asked him about the plea bargain 
the hearing contrasted with hatchers last appearance when he 
threw pens at a judge and called him a racist 
defense attorney barry nakell said hatcher who faced a maximum 
sentence of 420 years on the charges had decided on his own to 
seek the plea bargain nakell said the newspaper seizure had led to 
some small measures of progress but not the through 
investigation the situation deserves 
district attorney richard townsend said hatcher and his 
attorneys had created a media circus with their charges but 
none of them had been valid 
there have been attempts to influence what happens in this 
courtroom by making accusations and the wilder the better 
townsend said but the only accusations that have been found to 
have any merit are the 14 charges of kidnapping in this case 
townsend said hatchers flight from robeson county to seek 
asylum at two indian reservations and the soviet consulate in san 
francisco combined with his charges of official corruption 
sounds like a plotline from dallas with meet the press thrown 
in and a dash of miami vice 
townsend said the newspaper hostages had agreed to the plea 
bargain 
it certainly was acceptable to me said lee hamilton one of 
the robesonian reporters held i definitely thought he hatcher 
would drag it out as long as he could and get all the attention he 
could

west germany approved 36 billion in 
aid for east germany on wednesday to keep its economy afloat and 
prevent its citizens from fleeing in frustration until the two 
nations become one 
an additional 1 billion was approved to resettle east germans 
who come to the west 
though the money is earmarked for specific east german programs 
none of it will go directly to the government of communist premier 
hans modrow who likely will be ousted when the country holds its 
first free elections on march 18 
modrow whose twoday summit here concluded wednesday had 
requested 9 billion in immediate direct aid tuesday but was turned 
down by the government of chancellor helmut kohl 
both leaders however hailed the landmark agreement by the 
soviet union the united states france and britain that sets up a 
procedure for formal talks on reunification 
the agreement by the four world war ii allies that defeated and 
divided germany 45 years ago is a diplomatic breakthrough and a 
first step to a timetable for reunification 
we see this as an exceptionally important development and a 
great success for the west german foreign minister an important 
step toward german unity hanns schumacher a west german foreign 
ministry spokesman said wednesday 
modrow told reporters in bonn that he welcomed the announcement 
made during a meeting of warsaw pact and nato nations tuesday in 
ottawa and considered it the best means of protecting both german 
interests and those of the wartime allies 
the accord follows kohls weekend visit to moscow to meet with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who tacitly approved germany 
reunification 
the talks will take place in two parts the two germanys first 
will discuss merging their economies and other domestic issues 
the second phase is to include the four wartime powers and will 
deal with the strategic and global implications of a united 
germany particularly its military allegiance 
east german is a key component of the sovietled warsaw pact and 
west germany serves much the same role in nato the united states 
wants to keep a united germany in nato while the soviets are 
pressing for german neutrality 
during the talks between the germanys west germany has a 
commanding position because of its vibrant economy which will be 
needed to bail out the financially ailing eastern state where 
thousands are fleeing to the west 
modrow who spoke with west germany industrial leaders on the 
last day of his visit told reporters before returning to east 
berlin that he was disappointed by kohls rejection of east 
germanys appeal for immediate aid 
government and opposition political forces had asked for up to 
9 billion to help the east german government until the election 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann said bonn turned 
down the request because it makes no sense to grant loans or 
credits to east germany when so little is known of its economic 
situation 
however finance minister theo waigel on wednesday announced 
cabinet approval of 24 billion to modernize east germanys aging 
factories repair roads install a new phone system and other 
immediate measures to improve production and living standards 
the 1990 budget supplement also provides 1 billion to cope with 
the costs of tens of thousands of east germans resettling in west 
germany and an additional 12 billion for a contingency fund for 
unforeseen expenses related to east german reforms 
haussmann told reporters that the bulk of the money would be 
available immediately 
but the funds are earmarked for specific projects and will not 
be at modrows disposal to cover daily expenses and the east german 
governments mounting debts 
modrow and kohl did agree on tuesday to establish a joint 
commission to work out a formula for merging the two economic 
systems after the march 18 elections bonn government spokesman 
norbert schaefer said the group would hold its first talks on 
tuesday

previous night that also was stopped by police firing tear gas

and knives swords and spears made of scrap metal window railings 
and bed frames a government statement said

prove they fled persecution those who are denied refugee status

industry minister ariel sharon who resigned 
this week said wednesday he will form a new faction to pressure 
his rightwing likud bloc into taking a tougher stand on peace and 
the palestinian uprising 
attorney general yosef harish ruled earlier wednesday that the 
resignation was invalid because sharon did not tell the government 
of his plans before submitting a letter to prime minister yitzhak 
shamir 
that gives the former defense minister until the weekly cabinet 
meeting sunday to reconsider but sharon said wednesday he would 
resubmit his resignation at the meeting it would take affect 48 
hours later 
on israel television sharon said i must according to 
regulations submit my resignation again this i will do 
on the same day i intend to announce that i will go out 
and fight for a new policy and for achieving security i got up 
from my chair to begin marching so that in the future someone will 
not say how come you didnt warn us of the coming disaster 
on monday sharon told the cabinet his main reason for resigning 
was to protest shamirs plan for holding elections in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip as a prelude to peace talks 
he claimed shamir had left an opening for possible plo 
involvement in negotiations by not ruling out palestinians deported 
by israel during the 26monthold uprising in the occupied lands 
he also has urged the military to use harsher measures in the 
territories 
at least 656 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
during the uprising and 182 have been slain by other palestinians 
most on suspicion of collaborating with israel fortythree 
israelis have died 
sharon said he will visit local likud branches to seek support 
and will travel abroad to meet with leaders of jewish communities 
he accused shamir of leading a silent government that is 
incapable of adopting any decisions 
two israeli sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
foreign minister moshe arens might stop in washington later this 
week on the way to mexico 
that could be a step toward a meeting secretary of state james 
a baker iii has sought with arens and esmat abdelmeguid the 
egyptian foreign minister as a way of beginning talks between 
israel and palestinians 
sharon 62 directed israels 1982 invasion of lebanon as 
defense minister he was forced to resign in 1983 when an israeli 
commission found he bore some responsiblity for the massacre of 
hundreds of palestinians in beirut refugee camps by lebanese 
militias allied with israel 
shamirs spokesman avi pazner indicated wednesday the prime 
minister did not want sharon in the cabinet and was seeking to 
remove him as chairman of likuds central committee 
associates of shamir said he would have more room to maneuver in 
the peace effort with sharon out of the way 
in another development wednesday the army reported that israeli 
soldiers killed a palestinian guerrilla who infiltrated israels 
border security zone in southern lebanon and allied militiamen 
captured three of his comrades 
it said the infiltrators were spotted at midday on the bridge to 
beaufort castle a crusader fort three miles north of the border 
and their intention was to attack israeli forces in the security 
zone three infiltrators were killed in the same area monday

the government raised its count of gray 
whales along the baja california coast wednesday but said there 
were still fewer whales than normal 
it also said the main concentrations had gathered nearly 300 
miles farther south than usual 
in the southern part of the distribution zone more than 500 
whales were observed luis fleischer head of the national marine 
mammal program said in a statement by the fisheries department 
the ecology department reported no more than 120 grays on monday 
in the pacific waters of baja california where the marine mammals 
migrate annually to reproduce but department experts also said 
that bad weather had limited a weekend survey 
the grays continue to be behind schedule and we know that they 
are arriving at points further south than usual but we cant say 
why fisheries department spokesman elias kuri said wednesday in 
a telephone interview 
the whales have traditionally given birth in three lagoons 
within the vizcaina biosphere reserve 330 miles south of san 
diego where a population of 900 to 1150 can usually be observed 
this time of year reserve biologist jorge hernandez said 
some grays would travel to a lagoon about 260 miles farther 
south called magdalena bay 
however fleischer said the terfront corruption they throw his name 
around just to throw it around cutler said its a continuing 
vendetta 
gotti who was acquitted last week for the third time in 
criminal cases and the other individuals face no criminal charges 
in this case the suit instead seeks to remove from office any ila 
officer convicted of violating federal racketeering laws and to 
allow appointment of trustees to oversee union elections and 
discipline ila officials 
the defendants also could be forced to pay back illegal profits 
were trying to take the ila away from the mob and give it 
back to the ila rank and file said fox the fbi agent 
the ila locals named in the suit were local 18041 of north 
bergen nj local 1588 of bayonne nj local 814 in brooklyn 
and locals 1809 824 and 1909 all in manhattan on the west side 
according to the suit the genovese family controlled the new 
jersey locals the gambino family the brooklyn local and the 
westies through influence of the gambino family the manhattan 
locals 
thirtytwo present and former ila officials including current 
ila president john bowers also were sued in addition to his 
position with the association bowers is president of the three 
manhattan locals named in the suit 
most of the allegations in the suit are based on previous 
criminal cases the guilty pleas two weeks ago in brooklyns 
federal court of two ila officials and the racketeering conviction 
in 1988 of donald carson the second highest ranking ila official 
also were cited 
another case listed was the westies racketeering prosecution of 
1988 in which mcelroy and other westies members were convicted of 
controlling the west side piers through violence coonan is serving 
a 75year sentence 
leonard newman the executive director of the waterfront 
commission of new york harbor said that despite the numerous 
convictions of ila officials corruption continued out of office 
is not out of power he said 
thornburgh said the individual prosecutions were not successful 
in removing the pervasive influence of organized crime from the 
waterfront he said the civil suit was needed to attack corruption 
as a systemic problem 
the case is similar to one the federal government settled with 
the international brotherhood of teamsters last year in which the 
government tried to wrest control from allegedly corrupt union 
leaders through courtappointed administrators 
another suit against the union at manhattans landmark fulton 
fish market was unsuccessful in january 1989 a judge rejected the 
governments attempt to take over the union 
the ila suit was assigned to us district judge leonard b 
sand who will hold a hearing on the case feb 26

britain will confer with its european community 
partners about ending sanctions against south africa but it 
reserves the right to act on its own foreign office minister 
william waldegrave said wednesday 
of course we are obliged and willingly would accept the 
obligation to consult with our partners in the ec which is what we 
will do waldegrave said in a house of commons debate on south 
africa policy 
if we fail to reach agreement the government must reserve its 
rights to act on its own if necessary and that is the legal 
position 
earlier waldegraves chief foreign secretary douglas hurd 
sidestepped persistent inquiries from gerald kaufman foreign 
policy spokesman for the opposition labor party who wanted him to 
say if the government would act unilaterally 
since nelson mandela leader of the african national congress 
was freed from prison on sunday prime minister margaret thatcher 
has said she intends to try to get the 12nation european community 
to drop a ban on new investment and on promoting tourism to south 
africa both voluntary measures 
she hinted she will go ahead alone if necessary 
ec foreign ministers will discuss the issue tuesday in dublin 
ireland 
kaufman called mrs thatcher the worlds best friend of 
apartheid 
hurd said the government firmly rejected south africas racial 
segregation policy 
it is wrong it doesnt work and the sooner it is ended the 
better hurd said 
opposition lawmakers jeered mrs thatcher on tuesday when she 
defended her position on sanctions she did not participate in the 
more subdued debate wednesday 
labor party leader neil kinnock said if sanctions were lifted 
the only force for change left in south africa would be mass 
action with all its risks 
hurd said the government was not proposing to lift all 
sanctions what we are proposing is a stepbystep approach a 
measured approach

the nations principal maker of 
radioactive isotopes for nuclear medicine was shut down 
indefinitely because of a leak in its reactor cooling system the 
third in three months officials said 
the us nuclear regulatory commission and the state department 
of environmental conservation ordered the cintichem reactor shut 
down tuesday until the company proves it can operate without 
radioactive leaks according to a joint statement 
tests showed none of the leaks were a threat to public health 
said dr ronald massey head of the nrcs onsite inspection team 
the company located about 50 miles northwest of new york city 
manufactures radioactive isotopes unstable forms of ordinary 
elements from uranium the isotopes are made into medical tracers 
for diagnosing cancer and other diseases 
one out of every three or four people in the united states are 
affected by what nuclear medicine does said david gallaher 
company operations director 
an expert on nuclear medicine said wednesday that hospitals and 
other medical facilities would be searching for an alternate source 
of technetium 99 the principal radioisotope used in nuclear 
medicine 
technetium which does not exist in nature also is produced in 
canada and europe and may also be available from the us 
department of energy said dr stanley goldsmith a member of the 
state lowlevel radioactive waste siting commission and a member of 
the physicsnuclear medicine department at mount sinai medical 
center 
goldsmith said cintichem was the major producer of 
radionuclides isotopes for medicine and biology for the northern 
hemisphere maybe north and south 
i think there is going to be a shuffling and hopefully there 
will be provisions made said goldsmith they probably have 
supplies for a week of the shortlived material 
in a letter to company officials the nrc acknowledged the 
effects the suspension could have on nuclear medicine said nrc 
spokesman steve horwitz 
therefore please keep the regional administrator informed of 
the impact of this order on the ability of the medical community to 
obtain radioisotopes the letter said 
all of the leaks were contained and none allowed radioactive 
material to reach the nearby indian kill reservoir which serves 
more than 100 households company officials said 
the latest leak was found in a water tank that is part of the 
reactor cooling system it was confined to a pump room said plant 
manager james j mcgovern 
the shutdown order requires cintichem to determine causes of the 
leaks and check for equipment breakdowns show how repairs will be 
done and prove that they will hold and put together a monitoring 
program to assure prompt detection of future leaks 
in addition the state dec intends to delay approval of 
cintichems air emissions and drainage runoff discharge permits 
until the company does a detailed environmental audit for possible 
onsite contamination 
mcgovern said much of the required repair work is underway 
cintichem also was cited for six violations of nrc regulations 
in october the company faces both federal and state fines but has 
challenged the citations

a federal judge declared a mistrial in a 
chinese heroinsmuggling case wednesday after a key prosecution 
witness said he had lied under pressure and death threats from 
chinese officials 
us district judge william orrick halted proceedings in the 
case against three men accused in connection with 700000 worth 
of heroin found inside dead goldfish after the witness recanted 
his testimony and said he had been tortured in a shanghai prison 
he is seeking asylum in the united states 
the case which dates from march 1988 was the first 
international drug prosecution involving cooperation between 
chinese and us officials 
orrick said the breakdown of the trial was proof positive you 
cant meld the legal system in the peoples republic of china with 
the legal system in the united states 
assistant us attorney eric swenson told reporters orricks 
conclusion was valid for this case but im still confident that 
this type of problem does not have to affect future cases the 
legal system in china is almost identical to many of the western 
european systems 
no decision has been made on a retrial swenson said 
federal drug agents said in 1988 that seven pounds of southeast 
asian heroin had been put inside condoms that were sewed into the 
bodies of goldfish and mixed into shipments of live goldfish from 
china to the united states three men arrested in san francisco 
leung taklun chico wong and andrew wong were charged with 
possessing heroin with intent to distribute 
the witness wang zongxiao was arrested in shanghai in march 
1988 and held there for most of the time until last december when 
he was brought to san francisco he testified feb 1 that he took 
part in the heroin shipment along with leung 
but wang filed for asylum four days later saying he had been 
threatened with death by officials from shanghai who accompanied 
him to the united states 
he said in court papers that he had been coerced into confessing 
and warned by the chinese officials not to reveal the coercion or 
the later beatings and electric shocks he was given not to 
contradict testimony of shanghai security officers and not to 
disclose that students and workers were held and tortured in the 
shanghai prison 
wang returned to the witness stand tuesday outside the presence 
of the jury described his torture in china and said he had lied 
in his testimony that implicated leung 
orrick said wednesday he was declaring a mistrial because of the 
allegations of perjured testimony and because the chinese 
government had not provided defense lawyers before the trial with 
wangs earlier statements as the judges order required after 
those actions any conviction in the case would surely be reversed 
on appeal he told the jury 
he also noted that the two shanghai officers who accompanied 
wang to san francisco had returned suddenly to china on sunday i 
dont think youll be seeing them again orrick said 
the judge issued an order last week prohibiting us officials 
from returning wang to china while his asylum application is 
pending cedric chao a lawyer appointed to represent wang said 
the case for asylum is strong and described wang as at peace 
with himself after his latest testimony 
it would be unconscionable to send him back to china to face 
certain death chao told reporters

civil rights city 
the protests began when white school board members refused to 
extend roussells contract beyond june

sitin 86 percent of the enrolled students were back in class the

tuesdays figures 
absenteeism in the city school system is normally around five 
percent according to roussell it was 23 percent tuesday when 
schools reopened amid heavy security and down to eight percent 
wednesday 
roussell said he hopes that all parents will soon return their 
children to school and that the schools guarded by police 
national guardsmen and state troopers will soon no longer look 
like armed camps 
most of the absentees have been blacks including about 150 who 
marched around the flagpole in front of selma high school on 
tuesday and chanted slogans

thousands of people disappeared or were murdered 
by government forces death squads and insurgents in sri lanka last 
year amnesty international said in a report released early 
thursday 
reports of killings increased sharply after emergency 
regulations introduced in june 1989 permitted the immediate 
disposal of bodies the londonbased human rights group said 
members of the security forces who commit murder are aided and 
abetted by these regulations the groups report said 
amensty international acknowledged the government faces 
extensive violent opposition 
nevertheless armed opposition violence can never justify 
torture or deliberate killings of prisoners and civilians by 
government forces the report said 
it said the tactics of sri lankan security forces and allied 
death squads increasingly mirrored the criminal violence of the 
armed opposition janatha vimukthi peramuna peoples liberation 
front 
the front is a sinhalese nationalist group opposed to the 
sinhalesedominated governments 1987 peace plan with the tamils in 
the northeast 
the sinhalese group according to the report is believed to be 
responsible for thousands of murders since it began its insurgency 
in the south in 1987 
thousands of prisoners were detained in the south without 
charge or trial under emergency regulations and there were 
widespread allegations of torture and deaths in custody amnesty 
international said 
in the northeast indian troops who were sent to enforce the 
peace plan were reported to have committed summary executions and 
there were numerous allegations of torture of prisoners by 
members of the indian force the report said the last of the 
indian troops are to be withdrawn by the end of march 
amnesty international also said the guerrilla group the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam were generally believed 
responsible for hundreds of murders including the killing of 
prisoners and civilians 
the liberation tigers oppose the indian troop presence and are 
fighting for autonomy 
tamils comprise about 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
population most tamils are hindus and they say they are 
discriminated against by the buddhist sinhalese majority 
nationwide it is impossible to estimate the true number of 
victims and although some bodies were identified by relatives the 
identities of many remain unknown amnesty international said 
hundreds of victims have been mutilated beyond recognition 
burnt in heaps on tires or in pits or have been thrown into 
rivers it said 
amnesty international said the victims included lawyers who had 
taken up human rights cases and witnesses to alleged cases of human 
rights violations

president bush will refuse to meet with 
peruvian coca growers at the colombian drug summit and will travel 
to cartagena with a sharply reduced staff because of concerns for 
his safety white house officials said wednesday 
on the eve of the oneday meeting of four hemispheric nations 
the white house also retreated from previous suggestions that bush 
would revive a proposal to send us navy warships into south 
american waters to track cocainetrafficking planes 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater denounced the 
kidnapping of two american citizens in colombia on tuesday by 
leftist guerrillas who said they were protesting bushs impending 
visit 
while saying that bush shared concerns over the two americans 
safety fitzwater asserted that the united states government 
cannot allw threats of terrorism to influence its policies or its 
activities 
bush will fly to colombia early thursday joining presidents 
virgilio barco of colombia jaime paz zamora of bolivia and alan 
garcia of peru for six hours of antidrug talks at a heavily 
guarded navy base at cartagena 
the four leaders plan to issue a joint statement pledging to 
cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking bushs summit 
partners were expected to press him for more economic aid to ease 
their farmers shift from lucrative coca plants used to produce 
cocaine to growing legal crops 
the united states has pledged a 206 million increase in 
spending on military law enforcement and economic assistance for 
peru colombia and bolivia next year as part of a fiveyear 22 
billion andean aid package 
garcia who had once threatened to boycott the summit because of 
the us invasion of panama has invited a group of peruvian coca 
growers to accompany him to the cartagena summit to underscore the 
economic impact of eradicating cocaine production fitzwater said 
we have no opinion of that fitzwater said he can take 
anybody he wants thats fine 
but fitzwater said bush would not meet with the coca growers and 
indicated that the united states does not want the growers to 
attend the summit sessions 
this is a summit meeting between the heads of state 
fitzwater said there will not be other ancilliary kinds of 
activities involved 
on the issue of us naval warships in south american waters 
fitzwater would not rule out the possibility of a summit discussion 
of using us vessels but he said bush did not intend to raise the 
subject because it is such a sensitive issue in latin america 
particularly since the panama invasion 
brent scowcroft the white house national security adviser had 
broached the idea tuesday during a meeting with reporters 
fitzwater said resulting press accounts had caused some 
consternation among us officials who were worried about how 
scowcrofts remarks might be interpreted in latin america 
there will be no military assistance for drug fighting to any 
country that is not requested by them coordinated through them and 
executed in support of their counternarcotic objectives 
fitzwater said 
nbc reported wednesday that the united states is setting up an 
electronic picket fence in the air and on the ground to monitor 
suspected drug flights from colombia the report said the us 
forces are supposed to spot the planes and the colombian forces 
will chase them 
nbc citing american military sources said american cargo 
planes and as many as 160 us soldiers already are on the ground 
in colombia 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said she knew nothing about 
the nbc report 
despite stringent security precautions being taken in colombia 
there were deep concerns about protecting bush in a country where 
drug lords are blamed for widescale bombings assassinations and 
other violence 
fitzwater said the united states has every assurances of 
safety and maximum security from colombian officials 
i think however that it is clear from the past history that 
one cannot rule out various kinds of activities at some location 
he said 
fitzwater said bushs official entourage has been reduced to a 
minimal staff and that the usual backup plane for other traveling 
aides has been eliminated 
fitzwater said the purpose was to eliminate any excess 
personnel and for security reasons to simply not have any more 
people there than is absolutely necessary 
bush will be accompanied by secretary of state james a baker 
iii white house chief of staff john sununu scowcroft drug policy 
director william bennett fitzwater and a handful of other aides

president najib pleaded anew to afghan 
opposition forces to enter into peace talks in an address to the 
nation on the eve of the first anniversary of the soviet withdrawal 
from afghanistan 
soviet foreign ministry eduard shevardnadze meanwhile offered in 
moscow to discuss removal of the stockpiles of weapons his country 
has sent to afghanistan 
the united states has long refused to consider halting its arms 
shipments to the moslem guerrillas because it says the soviets 
built up enormous arsenals for the najib regime 
shevardnadze also suggested a conference on afghanistan to 
include representatives of the various afghan groups the united 
states the soviet union iran and pakistan with un 
representatives participating 
najib offered the guerrillas a sixmonth ceasefire and said his 
troops would stop firing longrange scud missiles if the guerrillas 
stopped firing rockets at kabul and other cities 
so far the guerrillas have rejected all truces offered by kabul 
and have refused all negotiations with najib and his peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan 
there was little in najibs invitation that seemed likely to 
entice them to give up their nearly 12yearold attempt to oust the 
ruling party which took power by coup in 1978 
the guerrillas whose headquarters are across the borders in 
pakistan and iran call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors 
najib took office in 1986 he is one of four successive 
sovietbacked leaders to run afghanistan through a series of 
internal party coups and power struggles 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to prop up 
its faltering protege party and started withdrawing in may 1988 
under a unsponsored accord the last red army combat troops 
crossed the border back to the soviet union on feb 15 1989 
the aghan president former head of the dreaded khad secret 
police again proposed creating a national council that would form 
a broadbased coalition government he called for new parliamentary 
elections they would be held without resort to force for 
influencing them and the results would be respected by the kabul 
government he said 
najib also said his government places enormous value to the 
role of the united nations and is ready for cooperation with 
whatever outline the un may table 
he did not address the question of whether he himself would step 
aside during any peace talks but about four hours before his 
speech was broadcast by staterun television najmuddin kawyani a 
member of his partys powerful politburo dismissed this idea 
kawyani told foreign reporters there could be no preconditions 
to any talks 
news reports before and after us secretary of state james 
baker iiis visit to moscow last week said the americans would drop 
their demand that najib resign before any peace negotiations began 
provided he was gone before the talks ended 
during the talks the results of the talks should be clear 
kawyani said it should be decided who should go if the 
americans determine the results before the talks that najib 
should go then the talks will be for what 
najib proposed sending a kabul delegation to talk to mujahedeen 
leaders in peshawar and quetta in pakistan he said the delegation 
should also visit tehran iran where a second mujahedeen alliance 
is based and to europe where afghan exiles opposed to both the 
najib government and the mujahedeen live 
he said if the opposition refused to accept representatives of 
his government or party the delegation could consist of clergymen 
scholars and intellectuals with no affiliations 
the mujahedeen rejected similar offers in the past considering 
any delegates who might be sent from kabul as nothing more than 
najibs henchmen 
he also invited the guerrillas to come to kabul and said they 
are not required at the first stage to meet state and party 
authorities in afghanistan 
he offered restructuring of the economy with a movement away 
from state control of investment and enterprise 
najib said the united states pakistan and saudi arabia 
continued to arm the mujahedeen and denounced them for it 
an english translation of najibs spech delivered in kabuls 
persian dari language was provided by the foreign ministrys press 
center 
kabul complained wednesday in a letter to the un security 
council that pakistan and the united states were intensifying 
aggression against afghanistan in violation of accords aimed at 
ending the war 
it said pakistan was helping in the shipment of military 
supplies and training for the rebels and that the united states 
was delivering advanced weapons 
a spokesman at the pakistan un mission denied the allegations 
and called them part of a propaganda campaign to divert attention 
from kabuls problems a state department official said afghanistan 
has made similar statements in the past and that washington saw no 
merit in the allegations

retired israeli col yair klein accused 
of training drug traffickers paramilitary squads trained the men 
who placed a bomb aboard a airliner that killed all 107 aboard last 
fall the head of colombias intelligence police said wednesday 
night 
this is the person who has done the most damage to colombia 
and according to colombian law is responsible for the deaths said 
the police chief gen miguel maza marquez in a news conference in 
the city of cartagena 
cartagena is the site for thursdays drug summit to be attended 
by president bush of the united states and presidents virgilio 
barco of colombia jaime paz of bolivia and alan garcia of peru 
last year colombian authorities issued an arrest warrant for 
klein whom they accused of leading a team of israeli british and 
australian mercenaries in colombia 
colombian police seized films of the group training paramilitary 
squads and said that drug traffickers paid the mercenaries to give 
the courses 
maza said that some of the men receiving training later blew up 
the avianca 727 shortly after taking off from bogota on a domestic 
flight nov 27 
the attack was one of over 262 terrorist actions contracted by 
drug traffickers since the government intensified a campaign 
against them last august more than 200 people died in the attacks 
klein was the man who trained the actual perpetrators of the 
avianca airline attack maza said he was the one who taught 
them how to make the bomb and therefore is responsible under 
colombian criminal law for this atrocious crime 
klein is living in israel and is being investigated by that 
countrys authorities there is no extradition agreement between 
israel and colombia 
maza said that two of the suspects in the airliner bombing were 
killed in a chain of bogota massacres following the death of 
gonzalo rodriguez gacha a leader of the medellin drug cartel in a 
dec 15 gunfight with police 
a joint operation carried out by colombian police and interpol 
the international police agency uncovered evidence that two basque 
separatists belonging to eta the basque terrorist organization 
also had carried out terrorist activities in colombia maza said 
he accused the two men of carrying out a dec 6 bombing of the 
intelligence police headquarters in bogota in which 63 persons 
died he would not identify the suspects because he said the 
investigation of their activities was continuing 
but he said they had been hired by the medellin cartel to kill 
him police have said that maza in the headquarters at the time 
was the target of the bombing 
maza also announced that colombia and spain would sign an 
agreement next week to share information about traffickers he has 
predicted that spain could become the european colombia because 
traffickers had chosen it as a distribution point for cocaine 
shipments from latin america

michigans senate on wednesday overwhelmingly passed a bill 
requiring minors to get permission from a parent or judge before 
having an abortion and south carolina senators unanimously 
approved similar legislation with a twist 
under south carolinas bill parents who deny a daughters 
request for an abortion would have to share legal and financial 
responsibility for her child until the young mother turns 18 
the michigan legislation adopted 298 now goes to the house 
which is expected to pass the restriction 
however democratic gov james blanchard is expected to veto the 
bill setting up an override battle or an attempt by antiabortion 
forces to enact such a law through a petition drive 
the measure adopted wednesday would allow a girl under 18 to 
seek a probate court order allowing an abortion if she couldnt get 
the permission of a parent or adult guardian 
it is the first antiabortion legislation to advance in michigan 
since the us supreme court in july gave states more power to 
restrict abortions pennsylvania last fall adopted the nations 
toughest abortion law but many of its provisions have been put on 
hold because of a challenge from abortionrights groups 
im very positive the house will accept what weve done 
said republican sen fred dillingham manager of the bill in the 
senate 
michigan wants and needs protection for parents and for minors 
with problem pregnancies barbara listing president of right to 
life of michigan said in a statement 
the senate rejected amendments offered by minority democrats who 
called the bill too harsh the most substantive would permit 
consent by another family member and require counseling another 
would allow an abortion in cases of rape or incest 
the bill generated some heated debate although the outcome was 
assured 
today will be a day of infamy for this body said sen john 
kelly a democrat were going to have to live with the despair 
the suicides the backalley abortions these young people have 
committed no crime 
south carolinas bill passed unanimously on a voice vote is 
also the first since the us supreme courts decision 
the state already has a law requiring girls under 16 to obtain a 
parents consent for an abortion but similar laws without a 
judicial consent option have been declared unconstitutional in 
other states and south carolinas ordinance has not been enforced 
under the bill passed wednesday girls under the age of 17 could 
obtain permission for an abortion from a grandparent or guardian in 
addition to a parent or judge 
its not everything that we wanted but its much of what we 
wanted said sen david thomas a democrat and an abortion 
opponent this is the best i could have hoped for 
abortion foes had opposed any senate amendments to a bill passed 
by the house last year allowing only parents or a judge to give 
consent but were forced to accept compromises on who could approve 
an abortion and on the issue of responsibility 
overall we were realistic we knew the state was not going to 
break with precedent said inez tenenbaum a lobbyist for south 
carolina coalition for choice if anything were very encouraged 
that we got some positive changes in the current law 
the bill now returns to the house which can either accept the 
senate amendments or work with senators on a compromise bill to 
submit to both chambers republican gov carroll campbell has 
promised to approve abortion restrictions 
on tuesday new hampshires house approved 212148 a bill to 
allow abortions until the 25th week of pregnancy and in 
healthrelated situations afterward 
the bill goes to the senate which is not expected to take up 
the bill until at least march republican gov judd gregg has 
promised to veto the bill

the nato military alliance and it urged more talks in the future 
valentin falin a member of the supreme soviets international 
affairs committee said the group had very substantive 
discussions with nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner 
the discussion was a rather open one i think we need such 
kind of discussions he told reporters after the hourlong meeting 
at the headquarters of the 16nation north atlantic treaty 
organization 
moreover both sides came to the conclusion that there is a 
need for a series of such discussions so that we understand each 
other better falin said speaking through a translator 
he also said talks were needed so that we have a clearer 
vision of things to come on this particular subject both sides 
have much in common in their appraisal and also have to seek ways 
to achieve these objectives 
falin said the officials only discussed the sensitive topic of 
the reunification of west and east germanys in an indirect 
manner it was not a precise subject of discussion 
also in the delegation was marshal sergei akhromeyev a key 
adviser to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and former chief 
of staff of the soviet armed forces 
late last year soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze made 
a historic visit to nato becoming the first soviet foreign 
minister ever to do so

the skipper of the exxon valdez thought 
the seaman who was at the tankers helm when it ran aground had 
problems steering and warned others to watch over him the ships 
second mate testified wednesday 
both capt joseph hazelwood and third mate gregory cousins 
talked about problems with robert kagans steering of the ship 
second mate lloyd lecain jr testified at hazelwoods trial 
how would you rate mr kagans abilities the prosecutor 
asked lecain 
id say slightly below normal lecain said i talked to 
capt hazelwood about it he knew he had a problem he told me to 
keep an eye on him when he was steering 
lecain claimed that cousins whom hazelwood had left in charge 
of the ship had been on previous voyages with kagan and knew he 
had to be watched cousins however testified he had never sailed 
with kagan before the fateful trip 
the march 24 accident the worst oil spill in us history 
caused more than 10 million gallons of alaska north slope crude oil 
to spill into the clear waters of prince william sound 
outside the jurys presence hazelwoods lawyer dick madson 
said that that exxon had placed lecain on leave because of mental 
and emotional problems and that lecain was known for making up 
wild stories and claims 
he has a problem with fantasy madson told superior court 
judge karl johnstone he said lecain once told hazelwood he kept 
two cyanide pills with him in case he had to commit suicide and 
that he was ninjatrained lecain also had claimed involvement 
in the irancontra affair madson said 
johnstone said he would not permit madson to tell this to the 
jury because it was character evidence prohibited by alaska law 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with one felony 
count of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of 
reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating a 
vessel while intoxicated the maximum penalty for conviction on all 
counts is 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
kagan who was blamed by cousins for not steering the ship 
properly had told jurors the captain commended him for his 
handling of the wheel in the wake of the accident 
but cousins testified earlier wednesday that the comment 
attributed to hazelwood actually was typical of the captains 
sarcasm 
did you hear the captain say anything to kagan asked madson 
yes said cousins i remember the comment something to 
the effect of damn fine job bob 
and did you take that as serious or sarcasm asked the 
lawyer 
kind of dark humor said the witness 
cousins also contradicted two widely circulated reports that 
followed the accident he said the ship was not on autopilot in the 
minutes before it ran aground and he said hazelwood never tried to 
reverse in an effort to pull the tanker off the reef 
cousins said he realized hazelwood was in shock as was the 
rest of the tanker crew after the vessel ran aground and caused 
what became the nations worst oil spill 
hazelwoods first order to him was to get a fix on the 
ships location cousins said 
did that seem a prudent command asked madson 
yes we needed to know where we were on the reef said 
cousins 
madson then asked whether hazelwood seemed able to give clear 
concise commands and cousins said he did 
madson asked whether any of the engine commands required 
reversing position 
cousins said no indicating that hazelwood ordered the ship 
to move forward madson asked whether an order to reverse would 
have been proper if hazelwood was trying to get off the reef 
that would make sense said cousins but my experience in 
being on a reef is very limited this was the first 
his comment drew laughter in the courtroom 
he added it makes sense that if you plow into a pile of 
rocks the way to get off is back off 
other witnesses however have said that had hazelwood succeeded 
in reversing the ship and backing off it probably would have 
capsized causing a worse oil spill and possibly a loss of life 
his lawyers contend he left clear instructions for an ice 
diversion maneuver and that if his instructions had been followed 
the ship would have moved smoothly past bligh reef hazelwood was 
fired by exxon after the spill 
cousins 39 a veteran seaman said he was on the phone with 
hazelwood at the moment the exxon valdez went aground 
cousins said that although hazelwood had left the bridge 10 
minutes before the accident his office was a mere 15 seconds away

colombias four main labor 
federations denounced president bushs visit and prompted marches 
in at least three cities wednesday to protest his trip and this 
countrys economic policies 
police clashed with students in one demonstration held after 
the unions issued a joint statement on the eve of thursdays 
antidrug summit in cartagena to be attended by presidents bush 
virgilio barco of colombia jaime paz zamora of bolivia and alan 
garcia of peru 
paz flew into cartagena late wednesday and praised bush for 
making cocaine trafficking a top priority of his administration 
he best understands the dimensions of the drug problem paz 
told reporters at the airport 
cartagena was under intense security to guard against possible 
attack by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas colombian 
newspapers have said about 5000 members of colombian security 
forces were assigned to the cartagena area 
all vehicles entering cartagena were searched wednesday and 
colombian marines stopped cars at roadblocks to look for weapons 
witnesses estimated a few thousand people took part in a 
peaceful march called by labor officials in bogota the capital 
other marches took place in medellin home of the infamous medellin 
drug cartel and in the northern city of cucuta 
workers marching in bogota with bush go home banners burned 
an american flag but rigid police control had been ordered to 
prevent violence and none was reported 
about 100 demonstrators clashed with police near the national 
univerisity of colombia in bogota but no injuries were reported 
police shot tear gas at students throwing stones witnesses said 
the union statement issued in bogota condemned the us 
invasion of panama in december and declared 
for this and 1000 more reasons we are not happy with the 
visit to the country of the us president colombians will not 
applaud the us marines in any latin american country much less 
in our own territory 
the unions ordered the marches to protest bushs visit and the 
governments freemarketoriented economic policies 
about 3 million workers out of a total labor force of 10 million 
belong to the four unions which represent a wide range of 
political forces

he was referring to kennedys alliance for progress program for 
latin america that assigned priority to housing for the poor 
throughout the continent 
colombian marines with assault rifles and grenades meanwhile 
surrounded the news center in cartagena but the greatest danger to 
the estimated 1200 reporters photographers and camera crews 
appeared to be tripping over themselves in the crush 
there also was the physical toll of scooting out of the 
airconditioned luxury of the cartagena convention center into 
95degree heat for interviews 
photographers and camera crews busied themselves filming and 
photographing warships in the bay soldiers using mirrors to search 
under cars for bombs and antiriot police standing by 
the us secret service heightened anxieties by leaking that the 
drug traffickers had groundtoair shoulderfired sam7 missiles 
and might use them during the summit 
presidential aides plan to confine the white house press corps 
accompanying bush to a hangar in baranquilla where bush will land 
thursday morning 
the reporters will be kept there six hours while bush is taken 
to cartagena 85 miles away for the drug meeting which will be held 
in a 17th century spanish fort on the cartagena bay 
despite signals from the white house and the secret service that 
violence would not come as a surprise no bombs bullets or threats 
materialized on wednesday the only apparent casualties were 
reporters with sunburns 
two us warships prowled the colombian coast helicopter 
gunships buzzed around the bay and all tourist boats and other 
nonmilitary sea traffic was ordered to clear out 
a colombian frigate and highspeed navy patrol boats armed with 
twin 50caliber machine guns were anchored in the bay not far 
from the spanish fortress 
frogmen were seen entering the bay at several points apparently 
checking for explosives 
one was seen coming up with a lobster

bitter northwest wind and heavy 
seas heaved gooey crude oil on shore wednesday forcing skimming 
boats to suspend operations while workers tackled the bulk of a 
coastal oil spill on the beach 
wind trailing a pacific winter storm gusted from 25 to 30 mph 
under a sunny sky while a mixture of tar balls brown foam and 
thick oil coated miles of the coast especially beaches exposed 
headon to the pounding surf 
in balboa about 10 miles south of here resident ralph gray said 
thick muck hit the beach for the first time wednesday 
i thought it was no big deal before since they said it was 
just a little amount of oil out there said gray 27 but we 
need bulldozers now 
about 400000 gallons spilled from the tanker american trader on 
feb 7 after its hull was punctured apparently by its own anchor 
while the ship maneuvered into a mooring station about 2 miles 
offshore 
wind blasting to gale force forced 16 oilskimming boats to 
suspend operations tuesday night and the gusts apparently drove 
much of the remaining crude onto the beach 
aerial observers reported wednesday that a light oily sheen 
still hugged the coast from lower bolsa chica state beach to 
newport beach but coast guard officials reported that very little 
of the spilled crude remained in the water 
we expect the balance of the oil to wash ashore today 
enabling cleanup crews on the beach to get whats left said 
peter bartelme a spokesman for british petroleum america inc 
which owned the spilled crude 
disaster crews which were tripled to more than 1200 members as 
officials struggled to deal with the spill resumed work after dawn 
wednesday 
oil washed ashore had percolated as deep as 3 feet into the sand 
in some areas according to cleanup officials environmentalists 
were concerned 
there is a whole world of organisms that live in the 
intertidal zone that are going to be affected as oil washes up on 
the beach said dorothy green of heal the bay a local 
environmental group just think of where the shore birds usually 
are following the waves in and out and poking at the beach those 
birds are feeding on those organisms 
volunteers and others so far have found about 135 birds killed 
by the oil and wildlife rescue workers are striving to save an 
additional 329 oiled birds said tom paulek of the california 
department of fish and game two unidentified mammals were killed 
he added 
by wednesday evening coast guard planes reported no oil visible 
at sea said newport beach police sgt andy gonis 
in sacramento department of fish and game director peter 
bontadelli criticized aspects of the cleanup he said some 
protective booms initally were installed incorrectly and that 
skimming failed to collect enough oil 
many of these problems should have been anticipated and were 
not bontadelli said 
huntington beach mayor tom mays told reporters he was 
disappointed that gov george deukmejian spurned his request to 
declare his community a local disaster area we feel there is a 
major disaster here mays said 
deukmejian deferred action on the request tuesday said eileen 
baumgardner assistant director of the state office of emergency 
services as far as we can tell there are no needs that are not 
being met she said 
british petroleum which chartered the ship is coordinating 
most of the cleanup but is not expected to pay for final costs 
which likely will come out of the insurance of the ships owner 
american trading transportation co said james h ross president 
and chief executive of british petroleum 
huntington beach residents complained that fumes from the 
beached crude were causing headaches and nausea according to don 
livsey a huntington beach resident and founder of a local group 
called save our surf 
you can get the smell going out our front door said livsey 
who lives two blocks from the beach and who said he is among those 
stricken with headaches since the spill my wife is experiencing 
the same thing and theres concern because shes pregnant 
assistant secretary of labor gerard scannell who administers 
the occupational safety and health administration told reporters 
he was unaware of complaints about hydrocarbon vapors 
our environmental team in cooperation with osha and the coast 
guard have extensively sampled the area and have not found levels 
of exposure that could cause illness bartelme said 
a classaction lawsuit involving the spill was filed tuesday by 
newport beach resident chet holifield in federal court in los 
angeles the suit seeks compensation for damage and economic losses 
caused by the spill and the alleged failure to properly clean up 
the oil among the defendants named are british petroleum and 
american trading

officials at a roman catholic high school in 
miamis little haiti area canceled a blood drive after learning 
haitian donors were not welcome 
i have no problem with their blood being rejected after being 
tested but to single out a group that takes me aback said 
brother genaro sulo principal of archbishop curleynotre dame high 
school it seems to be saying that all haitians have aids 
the exclusion is required under a federal food and drug 
administration policy that bars people born in or emigrating from 
haiti and certain parts of africa as blood donors said fda 
spokesman brad stone 
a previous fda policy banned donations from haitians who arrived 
in the united states after 1977 when the deadly virus first was 
detected in the us the miami chapter of the american red cross 
changed its guidelines to comply with the revised fda rule tuesday 
the national centers for disease control in atlanta stopped 
listing haitians as a highrisk group for the transmission of aids 
in 1985 after the extent of the disease in the world population 
became known but cdc still discourages haitians from donating 
blood 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus carried 
in blood heterosexual activity is believed to be the prime means 
of transmission in haiti 
school officials learned of the guidelines last week when senior 
lisa henry the blood drive leader was recruiting students a 
teacher told her that some haitians had been rejected last year 
it was learned that 25 of the 138 volunteers wouldnt be allowed 
to participate under the fdas mandatory rules when sulo heard 
that the students would be turned away he called off tuesdays 
blood drive 
our hands are tied said christopher chidley spokesman for 
the red cross in miami it is not something we look forward to 
doing its going to be harder for us to collect blood

a confidential report on decembers 
deadly earthquake in newcastle says police bungled rescue 
efforts and prevented more lives from being saved the report 
prompted officials to order an investigation wednesday 
the report by the new south wales state fire brigade leaked to 
a sydney radio station said police were late to the scene and not 
persistent enough in searching for survivors in the dec 28 quake 
that left 12 people dead 
at the newcastle workers club it was an horrific situation 
response from the fire brigade approximately two to three minutes 
ambulance half an hour police rescue in excess of one hour the 
report said 
as the rescue effort continued it was apparent that confusion 
and bungling began to spread it said 
the report said it may have been possible to save trapped people

fire officer felt police had prematurely collapsed portions of the 
building nine people died there 
ted pickering the states police and emergency services 
minister ordered a full investigation into the allegations 
the fire brigade report was prepared after a meeting of fire 
officers two days after the earthquake in newcastle a 
predominately industrial city of 500000 75 miles north of sydney 
fire brigade officials on wednesday acknowledged existence of 
the report with one senior officer said fallout from its release

the head of the new south wales police rescue squad defended 
police involved in the quake saying they acted professionally at 
all times 
in a situation like that when everyone is under pressure i 
dont feel anyone should be critical inspector ken holmes said 
the quake measured 55 on the richter scale and was australias 
most destructive temblor 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
a quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in 
populated areas while one measuring 6 can cause severe damage in 
populated areas

a weeklong celebration opened tuesday 
to commemorate the 1980 winter olympic games a spectacle that 
began with bureaucratic blundering and finished with one of the 
united states grandest moments in sports 
ten years ago today on this site the focus of the world was 
on this community as the olympics returned to lake placid master 
of ceremonies dennis ryan said at the opening night ceremony we 
tell the world tonight that we remain ready again to host the 
winter olympic games 
people in the tiny adirondack mountain village looked forward to 
the olympics 10 years ago but at the start nearly everything that 
could go wrong did go wrong 
a mismanaged bus system left thousands of spectators stranded in 
the bitter cold and ultimately the state declared a partial 
transportation emergency massive traffic jams in and around lake 
placid further prevented transportation to and from the various 
sports venues 
the ticketselling and telephone systems were overloaded the 
international olympic committee even issued a public reprimand to 
the lake placid organizing committee for its bungling of the first 
medal ceremony on frozen mirror lake 
but the bus system improved dramatically after a few days and 
speedskater eric heiden and the us olympic hockey team made the 
nation briefly forget its troubles 
every motel room in lake placid has been booked for the weekend 
and organizers expect 20000 people to visit the village of 2500 
by the time the celebration ends sunday said lake placid commerce 
and visitors bureau spokesman peter wilson 
there seems to be an incredible amount of interest said don 
krone a spokesman for the organization that assumed control of 
most olympic facilities following the 1980 games the olympic 
regional development authority a lot of people are calling 
people who have fond memories of 1980 even the athletes 
they didnt get to see what lake placid was like 10 years ago 
the figure skaters who are coming back lisa marie allen michael 
botticelli david santee have spent a lot of time talking to each 
other on the phone in the past couple of weeks and theyre all 
over the country 
eight members of the us olympic hockey team including 
goaltenders jim craig and steve janaszak captain mike eruzione and 
defenseman bill baker will return saturday they will be honored 
in a ceremony in the same arena where they shocked the sports world 
by defeating the soviets and winning the gold medal 
former olympians will also hold a figureskating exhibition 
the opening ceremonies tuesday night were much more modest than 
those of a decade ago when 23000 people watched the traditional 
parade of athletes spread a sea of color across the olympic stadium 
instead of 1 million flowers 2000 birds 40 hotair balloons 
and 25000 heliumfilled balloons a small torchlit parade of 
nations was watched by a crowd of about 3000 standing in a muddy 
field 
there was some international representation in the procession 
but it was composed mostly of local high school athletes dressed in 
their favorite sports outfits and carrying flags from the 37 
nations that participated in the 1980 games 
the 75foot tall olympic flame was ignited amidst a backdrop of 
fireworks and music 
when the 1980 games ended lake placid was saddled with a 6 
million debt and some disgruntled citizens wanted to sell the 
olympic torch to raise money that never happened but the torch 
fell into disrepair and only recently was reassembled 
part of the opening ceremony was dedicated to the memory of the 
rev j bernard fell who was president of the lake placid olympic 
organizing committee fell died in 1985 after a long illness 
the olympic torch will become a permanent memorial to him 
officials said

a woman is suing her psychiatrist for 14 
million claiming the doctor tried to help her commit suicide on 
four occasions once spoonfeeding her yogurt lethally laced with 
seconal her lawyer said tuesday 
fern isaacson 31 of manhattan who suffers from an incurable 
and degenerative illness survived the incident in 1987 when she 
decided she did not want to die and the psychiatrist induced 
vomiting said the attorney bruce clark 
the psychiatrists lawyer denies that the doctor was trying to 
help isaacson commit suicide but rather was trying to get her to 
reaffirm that she wanted to live 
isaacson also has asked the manhattan district attorneys office 
to look into attempted murder charges against d elisabeth jenks 
clark said the lawsuit is for medical malpractice 
we have opened a preliminary review of ms isaacsons 
complaints we have not begun a formal investigation yet said 
gerald mckelvey spokesman for district attorney robert morgenthau 
he would not elaborate 
within a few months after she started seeing dr jenks the 
doctor first suggested she commit suicide clark said she said 
fern shouldnt have to go through this pain and horrible life shes 
living and she should end it 
isaacson was diagnosed in 1980 as having ehlersdanlos syndrome 
an incurable disease that attacks the bodys connective tissue 
by the time she began seeing jenks in 1986 isaacson had 
undergone 70 operations was severely depressed and suffered 
problems stemming from her childhood clark said 
he said isaacsons mother a pediatrician tried to commit 
suicide when isaacson was 2 by slitting her wrists she locked her 
daughter in the bathroom with her during the attempt clark said 
when isaacson was 8 her mother killed herself in her 
daughters bed said clark so suicide was always on ferns mind 
because of what her mother did 
clark said the doctor who works out of gouverneur hospital in 
manhattan first suggested fern take a large amount of her 
cardiac drugs 
he said the conversations were recorded at the doctors 
request and that he has quite a few tapes 
clark said jenks suggested suicide four times and was present 
twice when his client made the attempts each one involved using 
medications prescribed to isaacson by her other doctors clark said 
he said the most significant one occurred in 1987 when jenks 
emptied the contents of 29 seconal capsules went back to 
isaacsons apartment with her mixed the drug into some yogurt and 
spooned it into fern until there was only one spoonful left and 
fern said she didnt want to die 
clark said the doctor then induced vomiting and helped isaacson 
to a hospital 
jenks was not at gouverneur hospital on tuesday and did not 
immediately return a call left on her answering machine jenks 
attorney anthony sola said jenks participated in pretend 
suicides meant to bolster her patients will to live 
dr jenks goal which was successful was to convince the 
patient that she did not want to die sola said 
he also said that isaacson has a long history of psychiatric 
disorders and has previously threatened lawsuits against other 
psychiatrists 
the federal drug enforcement agency is also looking into the 
case 
were still in the preliminary stages of our investigation 
said dea spokesman mark hannan he added that the dea was looking 
at it from the compliance perspective monitoring prescriptions by 
doctors

television for years the mythic battleground 
for cops and robbers is becoming as much a part of law enforcement 
equipment as handcuffs and badges 
officers can now learn more about everything from making traffic 
stops to subduing unruly suspects by tuning in to the law 
enforcement television network 
the network went on line full time in july 1989 and since then 
has acquired about 1200 law enforcement agency subscribers 
throughout the continental united states ranging from small 
departments to the fbi said network president billy prince 
the comments were getting back say its the best thing since 
the twoway radio weve been hearing stories of officers staying 
after a shift to watch it prince said 
letns satellite programming available to subscribers 24 hours 
a day monday through friday runs the spectrum from the latest law 
enforcement techniques to police news the network showcased its 
programming last month at the american society of law enforcement 
trainers conference in san diego 
each of the five regular training segments is designed with a 
level of law enforcement in mind from street beat geared 
toward the officer on the beat to command update which 
provides training for supervisors and administrators 
the programs are supplemented by roll call a quarterhour 
of police news and training segments 
our purpose is to train existing officers in the uptodate 
things going on in their profession prince said in a telephone 
interview from his dallas office we let them know whats going 
on and let them know what works and what doesnt work so they dont 
wind up reinventing the wheel 
the network took its cue from a similar project begun in 1986 to 
train auto mechanics and car salesmen prince said in mid1988 
wescott communications began funding what would eventually become 
letn 
the service was initially limited to one day a week now it 
operates on a 10 million annual budget said prince a former 
dallas police chief 
letns staff is mostly exlaw enforcement professionals 
including three former police chiefs technical adviser missy 
olinn who is licensed to practice law in ohio and has a 
background in unarmed selfdefense instruction reviews all 
programs and scripts for content including faithfulness to police 
procedure 
because adults learn from what they see and hear its 
important that all of the details are right olinn said 
thats important we dont want to endanger an officer because of 
the program 
although the network employs no fulltime instructors trainers 
are chosen from among the best in the nation olinn said 
dale stockton training and personnel manager for police in 
carlsbad a coastal town north of san diego said the department 
has been pleased with letn since it became a subscriber in october 
my recommendation would be to continue it stockton said 
it costs this department 488 per month i ask myself for 488 
what else can i do that would effectively deliver such 
comprehensive training as this so far i havent found anything 
one of the networks most notable subscribers the fbi has been 
with letn since its inception although spokesman mike kortan said 
the bureaus public affairs office in washington dc does not 
employ letn for actual training 
i would not characterize them as a training vehicle for the 
fbi for us its sort of a news outlet for the fbi kortan said 
their format allows for a little more indepth stories which is 
a break from the usual short soundbites that were used to

a proposal goes before the southern 
baptist executive committee next week to cut the denominations 
support of an interbaptist religious liberty lobby in washington 
from 391769 a year to 50000 
dominant fundamentalists in the 148 millionmember denomination 
have long sought to curtail participation in the baptist joint 
committee on public affairs which also serves eight other baptist 
denominations 
the subcommittees proposal if it gained approval by the 
southern baptist convention in june would shift most of the 
funding to a separate denominational agency 
in washington the rev james m dunn executive director of the 
bjcpa called the move irresponsibile saying such efforts have 
been rejected by five recent annual conventions

theres only one certainty about the peace 
dividend everybody wants a piece of it and that includes some 
politicians who arent enthusiastic about declaring much of a 
dividend yet 
the government hasnt yet figured out how much it will be and 
how or when it will be produced there will be defense spending 
cuts targets and timing yet to be determined 
the peace dividend is a slogansize name for an urgent new 
installment in the long debate over defense spending and national 
priorities now transformed by the ending cold war the 
transformation of the communist bloc and the apparent easing of the 
soviet threat 
with congress in recess this week thats one of the issues 
campaigning members are taking up with their constituents the 
peace dividend debate already is unfolding in congressional 
committees where the chairman of one house panel showed defense 
chieftains an ax and said it was symbolic of the mood at the 
capitol 
while president bush is trying to avoid runaway expectations of 
a sharp swift cut in defense expenditures because of the 
revolutionary changes in eastern europe and moscow the 
administration has its own plans for the potential dividend seeing 
the potential savings as a guarantee that he can stand permanently 
on his promise of no new taxes 
a conservative think tank skeptical about the whole business 
says that if there really is a peace dividend it should be used to 
cut taxes otherwise according to the heritage foundation the 
savings are likely to be used in a congressional spending spree 
dividends normally are paid to investors not kept by the 
corporation the foundation said 
the bush defense budget is under attack in congress where some 
democrats argue that it looks like a cold war leftover the budget 
seeks a 53 billion increase in pentagon spending adjusted for 
inflation that means a reduction of about 2 percent in real growth 
administration critics say the threat is receding a lot faster 
than that bush said this week that his budget makes good sense 
i think the american people want a cautious approach to 
this he said i dont think any of us think we can see with 
clairvoyance as to whats going to happen the day after tomorrow 
some of the democrats are jumping all over us he told a 
news conference but thats all right that just goes with the 
system 
but there also is skepticism among some members of congress in 
both parties who tend toward the cautious approach bush advocates 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
says hes looking for an administration defense blueprint that 
takes into account the changing world balance and the prospects for 
arms control he said he doubts congress will go ahead with costly 
weapons systems like the stealth bomber program the star wars 
space defense system and the mobile mx missile unless the 
administration presents a blueprint that fits its proposals into 
arms control prospects in the post cold war world 
while those are the big ticket weapons the administration 
maintains that sharp immediate cost cuts could come only in 
conventional force spending an argument pentagon critics dispute 
nor does the current budget anticipate significant savings this 
year through the withdrawal of us forces from europe bush 
proposes the withdrawal of 80000 troops from europe under an 
eastwest agreement now in negotiation 
the president said those savings too will come gradually over 
the years he said he doesnt want soldiers who seek reenlistment 
to be dumped by the arms services i would hope that attrition 
can take care of the cuts that inevitably will be coming bush 
said 
he also said there is no reason to change the nato weapons plan 
that includes shortrange nuclear missiles battlefield weapons 
that would be targeted on east germany and other warsaw pact 
states the west germans resisted modernizing those us missiles 
even before the undoing of the old communist regimes 
bush said that at this point he sees nothing to change the nato 
compromise that left the modernization question open until 1992 
for all of that and despite the fact that economists say any 
peace dividend will be far smaller than those after vietnam and 
korea the search for a dividend is on 
budget director richard g darman called it the spend the 
peace dividend game in which the politicianplayers conjure up 
vast sums in supposed savings to be appropriated for their pet 
projects 
thus washington entertains the notion of spending fifty times 
a dividend that has not yet definitively materialized a true 
wonderland phenomenon darman said in his introduction to the 
budget 
then again anyone who had forecast the remodeling of eastern 
europe a year ago would have been accused of wonderland dreaming 
too

savers and investors watched with remarkable 
calm this week as a pillar of the financial scene for the past 
decade wall streets drexel burnham lambert inc collapsed 
some specialists in matters of personal finance said the steady 
behavior of the stock and bond markets proided impressive evidence 
of longterm confidence in the economic and investment outlook 
others suggested that decisionmarkers in individual households 
and offices of professional moneymanagement firms alike had 
simply been numbed by a long succession of crises and did not know 
what to do next 
in many ways drexel personified the golden era on wall street 
with its daring and innovation bringing what once was considered 
highrisk debt into the mainstream of the investment world so the 
instant message of its demise seemed to be the 80s are over 
but if a turning point has been reached how should anyone with 
money to manage respond 
is it time to cash in the mutual fund investments abandon plans 
to buy a house and run for the hills or will patience and 
confidence be rewarded for those who sit tight and ride out the 
storm 
few of the experts profess to have any pat allpurpose answers 
to those questions 
but there is ample evidence they say that individual investors 
began months or even years ago to protect themselves from jolts 
like the recent slide in the junkbond market or the 1987 crash in 
stock prices 
last year for instance assets of moneymarket mutual funds 
surged by nearly 100 billion to record highs 
in the nearly two decades since they first appeared money funds 
have become a popular choice for investors seeking to minimize 
their risks in uncertain times 
financial adviser william e donoghue attributes the resurgence 
of money funds now to such factors as excessive real estate loan 
losses and writeoffs of bad loans in general 
as many investors in stock mutual funds know the stock market 
has also been showing the effects of debt worries for some time 
although the dow jones industrial average posted record highs 
last october and in early january most of the market has been in a 
deteriorating phase since last august observes the merrill lynch 
market letter in its current issue 
in the wake of the debt boom furthermore a new financial job 
description is already in vogue on wall street the workout 
specialist looking to find bargains and salvage whatever assets 
remain in the wreckage of deals gone bad 
for the speculatively inclined the supply of bankruptcy bonds 
has increased sharply in recent years said george putnam iii 
editor of the bostonbased turnaround letter 
in 1989 putnam calculates 37 companies with 71 billion in 
bonds outstanding filed bankruptcy actions 
we expect these trends to continue for at least the next year 
or so he added there will certainly be no shortage of 
bankruptcy securities for turnaround investors to consider 
if the situation creates opportunities it also embodies risks 
and perils that have not yet been fully grasped argues james 
grant whose grants interest rate observer has long warned of 
severe fallout from debt excesses 
if the woes of junk are unique to junk there would be nothing 
to fear in the stock market much less in business activity he 
said 
if however the junk bond markets break is the sign of broad 
distress investors must take appropriate precautions 
in grants view a potentially traumatic move from adventures in 
debt back to traditional financial values is under way 
the thunderheads rolling across the sky are the portents of a 
return to conservative lending he says that is bullish for 
many things in the long pull for the short run however it is not 
bullish for stock prices or for business activity

the annual drive has begun to recruit hundreds 
of volunteers to make the appalachian trail more walkable along its 
2100mile route from maine to northern georgia 
promoters put it this way break rocks get muddy and sweaty 
dig in the dirt sleep with rhododendron laurel and bears split 
logs bridge bogs with the logs you split 
if that isnt incentive enough the appalachian trail conference 
promises that volunteers will get a strange tshirt your old 
friends wont understand and your mother wont want you to wear 
volunteers conceived and built the hiking trail in the 1920s and 
1930s and have managed and maintained the path ever since 
gradually the trail gained support from national forest and park 
authorities and from the states involved 
in 1968 the route was officially designated by congress as a 
national scenic trail the 65yearold private nonprofit 
appalachian trail conference was appointed the footpaths 
daytoday caretaker in 1984 
the forest service in the agriculture department and the 
national park service in the interior department are major 
sponsors the trail connects eight national forests six national 
park units and more than 60 state park game and forest lands 
it winds its way along the crests of the mountains across 
farm valleys and through rugged and secluded high country says 
the conference almost all the trail is located on lands owned 
either by the national park service the us forest service 
states or other public bodies 
spokesman brian king said in a telephone interview from 
conference headquarters in harpers ferry wva that he had no 
tabulation of 1989 work for the entire trail but that the southern 
crew for example had 80 volunteers who worked 8500 hours and 
built 77 miles of footpath along with bridges one shelter and 
three outhouses 
the seasonal crews of volunteers began in 1983 in southwestern 
virginia and a midatlantic crew started in pennsylvania in 1984 
the conference also works with new england clubs to finance and 
recruit season workers in that area 
the conference is comprised of 31 clubs and 24000 individual 
and family members 
the southern crew which works in virginia north carolina and 
tennessee in the late spring and summer is based in the mount 
rogers national recreation area in southwestern virginia 
midatlantic operations are scheduled in september and october 
in virginia west virginia maryland pennsylvania new york and 
new jersey 
king said volunteers have come from all across the united states 
and there are usually two or three from overseas often from 
britain 
the conferences recruiting literature says the volunteer teams 
concentrate on trail construction and resourcemanagement 
projects that might not otherwise be tackled by local maintaining 
clubs or public agencies with limited budgets 
work includes trail design and construction shelter and bridge 
construction rough carpentry rehabilitation of eroded trails 
clearing and openarea management 
the work is often physically demanding requiring perseverance 
and patience while living with limited comforts in the outdoors 
the report said trail crews of four to six volunteers are led by 
a skilled leader on projects from thursday through monday and 
return to a base camp for tuesdaywednesday weekends when members 
may explore area attractions 
volunteer crew members can opt to work for a week or the whole 
season anyone age 18 or older male and female can apply there 
is no age limit 
enthusiasm good health and adaptabilaity are important 
prerequisites the report said willingness to following 
instruction and safety rules and to share equally in camp chores is 
essential previous experience is helpful but not necessary 
once a volunteer reachs a base camp most expenses are covered 
including lodging food transportation to and from work sites 
tools safety equipment group camping gear as available and a 
small weekly stipend for laundry and incidentals 
for further information prospective volunteers should write atc 
southwest and central virginia regional office po box 10 
newport va 24128 or call 7035447388 the appalachian trail

roll over chuck berry and tell bob dylan the 
news at the first grammys banquet in 1959 rock n roll was out 
in the streets 
in the beginning were perry como henry mancini and louis prima 
rock n roll was well established by the late 1950s but the first 
winner for record of the year was domenico modugno for volare 
while album of the year honors went to mancini for the music from 
peter gunn 
twentyeight trophys were handed out that first grammy ceremony 
in los angeles which was not televised this year 77 grammys will 
be given out during the awards broadcast from the shrine auditorium 
on wednesday 
at the first show como won for best vocal performance by a 
male prima and keely smith were cited for best performance by a 
vocal group or chorus so what happened to elvis presley little 
richard and buddy holly 
it baffles me as to exactly how so many important artists were 
not part of the process said michael greene president of the 
national academy of recording arts amp sciences which conceived the 
grammys shortly after forming in 1957 
you look at the people who began the academy it was started 
by the nat king coles the big band people the jazz people it 
has a way of kind of perpetuating itself 
though started because many artists and technicians in the 
recording business were seeing their efforts go largely 
unrecognized for years the grammy awards seemed like one long 
bloopers record for rock n roll fans 
though presley never won a grammy for rock he received the bing 
crosby award for members of the recording industry who during 
their lifetimes have made creative contributions of outstanding 
artistic or scientific significance in 1971 presley did win 
three times for gospel albums and twice in 1967 and 1974 for 
the same record how great thou art 
winners for record of the year include percy faith tony bennett 
and herb alpert robert goulet the starland vocal band and the 
swingle singers have all been cited as best new artist 
the album of the year in 1960 was bob newharts button down 
mind two of rocks greatest singles the rolling stones i 
cant get no satisfaction and bob dylans like a rolling 
stone came out in 1965 but the best contemporary single grammy 
went to roger millers king of the road 
from 1966 to 1978 there was no category for best rock n roll 
record in 1975 writer pete hamill earned a grammy for best album 
notes for dylans blood on the tracks though what he wrote was 
deleted after the first pressing 
the same year bruce springsteen released born to run but 
the winner for record of the year was the captain amp tenilles 
love will keep us together 
greene is a former musician and grammy basher who decided the 
only way to beat the system was to join it he worked his way 
through the academy in the early 1980s and after being elected 
president in 1985 gently nudged the grammys away from tin pan 
alley 
categories for hard rockmetal contemporary blues new age and 
rap have been added the rolling stones fats domino and paul 
mccartney received lifetime achievement awards but what about all 
those perry como fans were they ready to step aside for public 
enemy and living colour 
when i became chairman we had around 5000 members greene 
said we now are up to 8000 those additional 3000 are as a 
result of membership outreach programs to communities we had not 
addressed before rap metal new age hispanic 
i refer it to as the graying of the academy membership we had 
to come up with a formula which wouldnt disenfranchise the older 
membership i think you can ask anyone its not a problem anymore 
those people who really had a problem they had a choice to get 
with the program or step aside

the rambling slow speech is the nemesis of 
any television awards show so how did comedian garry shandling get 
picked to be host of the threehour cbs telecast of the 32nd annual 
grammy awards 
well you know i hosted the ace awards a few years ago and 
and and uh uh it went well and it really wasnt a problem with 
uh my my delivery the droll shandling explains 
its not its really not that slow you know im laid back 
but i put it more as laid back ive never had anyone actually 
come up to me and say speak faster other than my girlfriend in 
the heat of an argument 
the national academy of recording arts amp sciences will present 
its coveted grammys for the best music of 1989 at the cavernous 
shrine auditorium on wednesday 
don henley and his thoughtful the end of the innocence album 
was nominated for four top awards leading a host of pop and rock 
veterans up for more awards or receiving longoverdue consideration 
for grammys 
henley who has one solo grammy to his credit and four from his 
old days with the eagles had his lp nominated for album of the 
year and best male rock performance the title tune is up for 
record and song of the year 
other nominees include bette midler linda ronstadt tom petty 
billy joel and bonnie raitt whos looking for the first grammy in 
a distinguished career perennial favorite aretha franklin could 
win her 16th grammy 
prince also was a major nominee earning four of seven bids 
drawn by the batman movie soundtrack neneh cherry indigo 
girls milli vanilli soul ii soul and tone loc were nominated as 
best new artists of 1989 
presentations will be framed by performances of nominees harolyn 
blackwell larry carlton rodney crowell miles davis fine young 
cannibals herbie hancock henley billy joel kd lang branford 
marsalis aaron neville raitt ronstadt and sting 
the glitter glamour and variety will be provided by presenters 
including spunky dance queen paula abdul rockers motley crue and 
bob seger breezy singer olivia newtonjohn and actress meryl 
streep 
so what does shandling figure to do 
ill do a little opening monologue and then i understand 
theres going to be some music from what i understand theres a 
lot of music on this particular awards program he said 
the connection between shandling star of its garry 
shandlings show and the recording industry seems a bit tenuous 
i made a 45 once he says conceding i have a little 
catching up to do i still have an eighttrack tape system 
shandling will review the award show format and write his own 
material beyond his haircut and getting plenty of sleep the night 
before he claims no worries about the show 
i guess guns n roses isnt going to be making an acceptance 
speech so that takes some of the risk out he says 
itll be exciting to meet a lot of the musical stars who will 
be there because ive spent quite a lot of money on them this will 
be an opportunity for them to give me some of my cash back im 
certainly going to hit paul mccartney up for 200000 
mccartney and jazz trumpeter miles davis will receive lifetime 
achievement awards dick clark will be presented the trustees 
award and posthumous tributes will be paid to pianistcrooner nat 
king cole and pianist vladimir horowitz 
in all there were 388 nominees in 77 categories

anthony m kennedy who has solidified a 
conservative supreme court majority since becoming a justice two 
years ago sunday says he feels no special pressure when thrust to 
center stage 
people ask me how do you feel being the ninth vote i say 
well im one of nine everybodys vote makes a difference 
kennedy said in a rare interview 
as the junior member he is the last to give his views and to 
cast his vote on each case during the courts secret conferences 
if its 54 my say is very important kennedy said im 
guaranteed an audience 
legal scholars say kennedy an unassuming californian may 
underestimate his role and impact 
they say his appointment may have marked a turning point in the 
courts history giving chief justice william h rehnquist the 
conservative equivalent of the working liberal majority arthur 
goldbergs appointment in 1962 gave chief justice earl warren 
over the range of cases the goldbergkennedy analogy is quite 
apt he has provided a consistent conservative vote said mike 
seidman a law professor at georgetown university 
in his first full term which ended last july kennedy joined 
54 rulings that gave states greater power to regulate abortions 
and allowed capital punishment for mentally retarded murderers and 
killers who committed their crimes when as young as 16 
kennedy also provided the crucial fifth vote in a series of 
rulings that outraged civil rights activists by limiting the scope 
of affirmative action and federal antibias laws 
he wrote for the court when it upheld drug testing for some us 
customs employees and for railroad workers involved in serious 
accidents 
kennedys most surprising vote last year helped form a 54 
majority to strike down a texas law banning desecration of the us 
flag 
in a recently published book new york university law professor 
bernard schwartz theorizes that the flagburning law probably would 
have been upheld had kennedy not joined the court he cites a 1974 
court memorandum quoting justice lewis f powell as saying the 
physical integrity of the flag may be protected 
kennedy replaced powell who retired 
the close votes left some scars with justices on both sides 
authoring some acrimonious opinions 
last year the rhetoric i thought was unfortunate i plead 
guilty kennedy said it was in part because of the 
tremendous number of issues we were trying to deal with it 
reflects the competitive nature of the judges 
he hinted that several justices at one point realized things 
might be getting too competitive some of us took steps 
kennedy said before pausing and laughing it could have been much 
worse 
kennedy said it is important to distinguish the justices 
professional relations from their personal relations of course 
we disagree but personal relations here are good he said 
kennedy 53 was ronald reagans third choice for the post left 
vacant by powells retirement in june 1987 
reagans nomination of conservative judge robert h bork was 
rejected by the senate after a bitter political struggle in which 
bork was portrayed as a rigid extremist reagans second choice 
judge douglas h ginsburg withdrew after news reports that he 
smoked marijuana while a law professor 
on the whole the difference between kennedy and bork probably 
has not been dramatic said rod smolla a law professor at the 
college of william and mary kennedy voted the way you would 
expect bork to vote 
but daniel farber a university of minnesota law professor said 
kennedy may prove to be more flexible 
he has a reputation for thoughtfulness and openmindedness 
farber said i hope he will stake out his own positions in future 
years 
despite the mountain of work more than 400 appeals handed to 
kennedy when he arrived he had little trouble getting accustomed 
to the change from his life as a judge on the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals in his native sacramento calif 
he worked as a federal appellate judge for 12 years after a 
career in law and as a lobbyist in the legislature 
i worked hard in the 9th circuit but i would say theres 
three times more work here kennedy said obviously theres 
not three times more hours in a day so the intensity level is 
different 
kennedy often works six days a week at the courts impressive 
building arriving by 530 or 6 most mornings his office offers a 
striking view of the us capitol across the street 
he also works each evening in a basement office at his suburban 
virginia home he said but i switch to nonwork related reading 
after eight 
his evenings are spent quietly reading and talking to his wife 
mary a former elementary school teacher whom he married 25 years 
ago we arent much for television he said 
the couples three grown children live in california 
for years a parttime professor of constitutional law at the 
university of the pacifics mcgeorge school of law in sacramento 
kennedy now enjoys traveling to law schools for lectures and 
speeches 
thats one thing about the job change he said when i get 
invited someplace now mary gets invited we enjoy traveling 
together

that famous gamin quality still shines in 
leslie carons face but an air of worldliness has been added to 
the star who entranced the film world as lili and gigi 
thats only natural since the french actressdancer at 58 has 
weathered 40 years in films she maintains an active career both 
as actress writer and she hopes as director but dont ask her 
to dance 
dancing oh no she declares it gets too hard 
the last time i was lured on the stage my swan song was the 
utmost i cant do anything to come close to that i dance seven 
minutes with baryshnikov and nureyev i am the only dancer ever to 
do that with both of them on a stage it was for a charity event at 
the met if you please 
after that i bowed out 
caron returned to hollywood for the launching of a new film 
courage mountain its an update of the heidi saga with 
juliette caton as the adolescent swiss heroine and charlie sheen as 
her army sweetheart caron plays the stern ironwilled 
headmistress of heidis boarding school in italy the school is 
caught in the turmoil of the start of world war i and the 
schoolgirls escape over the alps to safety pursued by a villainous 
italian 
ive been associated with childrens stories quite a lot in my 
career all those little girl parts observed the star i 
should think that was why they asked me to play in this film 
but lately i havent been playing such nice characters 
immediately after courage mountain i played a madam in a 
bordello and in the same year i played coco chanel a woman of 
tremendous authority 
this role was nice i felt like i was playing a schoolmarm who 
was a little bit crazy so intense about her teaching and the 
education of those children and the forming of their minds she was 
rather a dear lady i enjoyed playing that 
i saw her as a kind of pioneer i based her character a little 
bit on the bloomsbury set virginia woolf and all those women with 
high ideals i went much farther than the part demanded but this 
is what i had in mind 
leslie caron became an immediate star in 1951 when gene kelly 
picked her out of roland petits paris ballet to dance with him in 
an american in paris she was barely 16 the daughter of a 
french chemist and an american dancer she followed with such films 
as lili the glass slipper daddy long legs with fred 
astaire the oscarwinning gigi fanny father goose 
with cary grant and promise her anything 
what does she remember fondly of her hollywood years 
gene kellys house on saturday night it was open house there 
were no keys on the locks in those days from eight oclock on 
anyone who felt the need for a good drink and good company would 
wander in guests would sit down at the piano or start singing or 
start dancing or just talk 
there were so many entertainers there on saturday night that 
it was really quite thrilling and always producerdirector 
stanley donen would be sleeping through it all 
what does she remember not so fondly 
the iron rule of the studio mgm was uncomfortable she 
recalled one was a property of the studio it was a little 
regimented you had to do what they told you im very selfwilled 
as you may have noticed i didnt always want to do the films that 
the studio wanted me to do so i would stand up to them sometimes 
that was frightening it took some courage 
why did i leave i just liked liberty i didnt want to be 
under contract i tried to leave from the moment i was locked in 
there it took me eight years to get my liberty back which was 
probably a foolish thing on my part because i think the studio 
system was good especially for actresses you had constant work 
had i been a little more intelligent and been able to work with the 
system i could have found some parts i could have worked instead 
of being rebellious as i was 
with the lshaped room in 1962 she proved she was a 
dramatic actress as well as a dancer her three marriages to 
meatpacking heir george hormel british director peter hall and 
american director michael laughlin ended in divorce 
with her two children by hall on their own she has engaged in a 
wide range of activities from serving on film festival juries to 
writing short stories and next directing 
ive been writing a script and i want to direct it she 
said its my third script and i want to direct this one id 
love to start on that profession dont tell me its a bit late i 
dont believe it 
its an experience actors want to have gone through i think 
every actor always has wanted to do that usually they stop after 
one experience charlie laughton directed one film so did albert 
finney also frank sinatra kirk douglas jack lemmon marlon 
brando 
for the past 13 years caron has maintained her home in paris 
sometimes i think its too nice there she said sometimes 
you can just be lulled away by the wonderful wonderful things that 
happen in paris premieres theater films dinners friends you 
could just waste your life away doing pleasant things not working 
im a hardworking person i love to work

long before cable broadcaster ted turner 
began coloring blackandwhite prints margaret spargo was adding a 
blush to the cheeks or a splash of color to the dresses of the 
subjects in her monochrome portraits 
almost daily she sits at a little red table in the window of her 
storefront studio with its old bellows camera in back and its 
shelves piled high with papers photographs and tools of her trade 
carefully coloring photographs by hand 
propped around her are examples of her handiwork a technique 
that is regaining popularity in art schools that makes little 
impression on her 
spargo who wont reveal her age is a woman of few words 
especially describing how she learned her technique nearly 60 years 
ago 
i just did it on my own dont ask me how i learned i just 
did it she says 
working from detailed notes about her subjects she deftly dabs 
nearly transparent oil paint with a piece of cotton onto the faces 
of a mother father and son she had spent several painstaking 
hours working with a colored pencil and brush to match the womans 
blue print dress 
that was a lulu its not quite right but its close she 
said admiring her work and wistfully recalling the days when 
clothes were plainer 
she works quickly with widening circular strokes if she 
strays the paint can be wiped away until it fully dries in about a 
day the artistry comes in blending the colors and highlighting the 
features so the boys blue eyes have a lifelike almost impish 
sparkle 
in spargos typical unconcerned attitude she cant tell you how 
long it takes her to finish a typical photograph 
that sounds silly but ive never timed myself people are 
much too scientific about things she said 
a typical 8 by 10inch tinted portrait of one person costs 50 
but if the customer wants spargo to color with heavier opaque oils 
that must be brushed on it will cost 200 
hand coloring emerged in the 1840s shortly after 
daguerreotypes the first commercially viable photos taken on glass 
plates said david gibney negative archivist of the international 
museum of photography in rochester ny 
at first a little blush was added to the cheeks and a splash of 
color to jewelry fully tinted photos became popular after the turn 
of the century until color photo materials improved and became 
affordable in the 1940s 
i think a lot of sins that the cameras lens brings out can be 
hidden with hand coloring and you can enhance the good things 
gibney said 
it made its resurgence in college fine art programs during the 
past 10 years as an art form said e ken white chairman of fine 
art photography at the rochester institute of technology and 
himself a hand colorer 
workers at john g marshall manufacturing co in chicago the 
major distributor of the special oils only know theyve shipped 
many more paint kits lately 
we get calls every day from practically all over the world 
said margaret heft who helps assemble the kits ive worked for 
the company for nine years and every year its increased 
she estimated the company ships about 50000 tubes of paint and 
kits a year directly to customers compared with about 20000 a 
decade ago and about 10 times that number are shipped through an 
affiliated wholesaler 
even the best color print will begin to age in five years but 
handcolored photos can last 50 years without much deterioration 
white said 
handcolored prints of stilllifes or scenery became a major 
industry around the turn of the century with photographers such as 
wallace natting of boston maintaining stables of retouchers he 
said 
its hard to visit an antiques store in new england and not 
find a wallace natting hanging on the wall somewhere white said 
spargo doesnt recall all the specifics of when she got into the 
business she only remembers that it was sometime in the 1930s and 
she was 19 when she went to work for photographer fred stiles at 
his downtown studio 
she was dissuaded from becoming a nurse by her older sister who 
worked at the local hospital for a summer so she went to stiles 
who had shot her parents wedding photos 
i just thought i wanted to do something that i would learn 
something not just a job she said but after the first day of 
retouching the photo of a boy to remove his freckles she almost 
went looking elsewhere 
stiles told me it looked like a hen scratched it which it 
probably did she said 
but spargo persevered under a succession of owners and four 
years later bought the studio it was at a national photography 
workshop at winona lake ind where she went to learn more about 
commercial photography that she took up hand coloring 
spargo had planned to do color photography but the great 
hurricane of 1938 wiped out much of westerly and made supplies 
hard to get after that other things came up and she just never 
got around to it 
i dont know why she said 
she also does a good business in copying and retouching old 
photographs but discourages people from getting them hand colored 
because they probably dont know what the true colors were 
in her own way she hews to tradition even while adding color 
to black and white and thats why she doesnt like the new trend 
toward colorizing movies 
i like them better in black and white they were made that 
way why change them she said its just a notion i have

something strange has been happening lately to 
bluesman bobby radcliff the bikers and flying beer bottles have 
disappeared from his concerts no guns no knives no cops 
suddenly his audiences are no longer confined to drunks aging 
beatniks and hippies yuppies like him jazz collectors too how 
radcliff worries can he keep the blues dirty in front of people so 
wellbehaved 
ive been in these rough and tumble clubs most of my life 
said the 39yearold singerguitarist whose first national release 
is called dresses too short 
just in the last year we played at cbgbs and that went over 
really well and freaked me out a little bit all of a sudden youre 
playing in these big places and its a little unnerving he said 
of the new york club 
we played at the ritz last week youre playing in front of 10 
times an audience ive been in these small clubs where people are 
right in your face you know what theyre thinking what theyre 
feeling and you know how to gauge their response level youll 
play a note and theyll go yeah 
not that radcliff is complaining he has no wish to return to 
the lean times of the mid1970s when a dying blues scene forced 
him to earn a living lifting boxes 
but the blues is a most personal kind of music demanding active 
interchange with an audience radcliff remembered seeing bb king 
in small clubs talking up women while squeezing sounds from his 
beloved guitar lucille 
the intimacy of a small place is pretty cool radcliff said 
thats when you see an audience and a performer come together at 
a nightclub you can start up and mellow out go along and start up 
again youre working in a framework of three or four hours 
in these big rock gigs you got to go right on up and when im 
off i dont feel like im warmed up yet 
radcliff grew up in affluent chevy chase md and by age 12 was 
already checking out live shows around howard university nearby 
washington dc 
our teacher let us out of school early he was one of these 
hip teachers he recalled for 250 youd see three acts 
jimmy reed booker t and the mgs sam and dave across this 
street was this huge record store and wed go buy the records that 
we had heard played 
radcliff loved elvis presley johnny cash and the other early 
rock n roll stars but longed for something more in the early 
1960s he found it the blues first slim harpo then muddy 
waters howlin wolf and dozens of others when he was 16 radcliff 
ran away from home in search of bluesman magic sam who showed his 
young fan around the clubs of chicagos west side 
back home he modeled his singing on elvis and magic sam and 
started playing guitar in local bands giving concerts at churches 
picnics and barbeques by the early 70s he was performing in 
blues clubs notably cousin nicks a tiny bar in northwest 
washington 
sometimes wed go back and hang out in the alley at the rear 
of the club and the bass player almost got his bass stolen from a 
small gang of kids he recalled there were lots of little 
miniholdups and stuff some of our fans would get robbed coming in 
and out of the clubs that was kind of a rough area 
but cousin nicks closed in the mid70s and radcliff bounced 
around california albuquerque nm and washington again before 
settling in new york it was 1977 the discos days the time of 
saturday night fever and donna summer the blues seemed 
outdated and radcliff watched his peers drop out 
they got really depressed wound up drinking themselves under 
the table he said i guess i had some kind of deep belief that 
somehow maybe it would work out even though nothing was there was 
that deep part of me that thought there was some slim chance 
now the blues are back and radcliff has an album on black top 
records major labels were interested but at a price with one 
record company executive even imagining him as a cross between 
elvis and david bowie 
dresses too short is pure radcliff several of the songs 
kool and the gang going home tomorrow hard road to 
travel have been in his live show for years lasting as long as 
the trusty white fender guitar hes owned since the late 60s 
most people will tell me that theres so much garbage on the 
radio radcliff said big companies are not really interested 
in hiring a lot of alternative type bands like blues they want 
bands they can filter through the system 
a lot of the stuff thats out now is not feeling or 
intellectual i like pop myself but i couldnt live on it

twentyfive years before gabriel garcia marquez 
created his imaginary macondo in one hundred years of solitude 
the cuban writer alejo carpentier laid the literary foundations of 
magical realism in a visit to haiti 
viewing the fantastic ruins left behind by the emperor 
henrichristophe carpentier was struck by the marvelous 
reality of latin america where collective faith in the 
supernatural wrought incredible alterations on the real world 
garcia marquez once remarked that if franz kafka had lived in 
latin america he would have been considered a realist but it was 
carpentiers matteroffact treatment of the magical in the 
kingdom of this world where the protagonist turns into a fly 
that marked a turning point in the latin american novel 
in recent months farrar straus giroux has released the 
kingdom and three other works by carpentier in paperback 
editions given the steady popularity of latin american fiction 
among american readers in the past decade the attention paid to 
this silent forerunner of the boom is welcome 
carpentier who was born in 1904 and died in 1980 had the 
misfortune to be ahead of his time when the kingdom of this 
world and the lost steps were first translated in the 1950s 
both flopped his fascination with the african sources of caribbean 
culture may have left american readers cold 30 years ago but it is 
timely today given the renewed interest in the music food and 
culture of the region 
the other new editions are explosion in a cathedral also 
quickly remaindered after its 1962 publication and the chase 
published in spanish in 1956 and never before translated 
carpentiers writing is intensely sophisticated and less 
lightspirited than that of carlos fuentes mario vargas llosa and 
garcia marquez all of whom acknowledge a debt to him as one of 
the first latin american writers to appeal to a worldwide audience 
he had to lay down firm roots in european traditions that later 
boom writers were able to transcend 
like so many other latin american writers carpentier went to 
paris as a political refugee in the 30s he was associated 
through his interest in avantgarde music with some of the 
founders of modernism picasso the dadaist tristan tzara the 
surrealists louis aragon and andre breton 
it was french surrealism in carpentiers words that taught 
me to see textures aspects of latin american life that i had not 
noticed 
carpentier abandoned the naturalistic novel what he called 
those poor slices of life that fill bookshop windows with their 
pages that smell of cheap boarding houses and civil servants 
dandruff to investigate the unique baroque quality of latin 
american reality 
a 1943 visit to haiti and further explorations in the depths of 
the south american continent led him to the realization that latin 
american consciousness so different from that of north america and 
europe required a new literary vision 
his novels are remarkable for their coverage of a variety of 
themes in modern latin american fiction not only the major 
waves but even the lesser ripples as terry j peavler a latin 
american literature profsesor at penn state university has written 
in explosion in a cathedral he describes the ravages of the 
french revolution on the caribbean bringing to light a forgotten 
chapter of history while probing the contradictions inherent in 
revolutionary movements 
some of the same territory is covered in the chase the 
story of the intermingled lives of a tickettaker at a concert hall 
and a misguided student activist in the cuba of the 30s 
the lost steps a clear precursor to mario vargas llosas 
latest book the storyteller and a cousin to thomas manns 
death in venice explores the protean lure of indigenous 
spiritualism for the inhabitants of modern civilization 
while carpentier was a man of the left his books are far from 
sanguine in their assessment of revolutionary politics 
in the closing pages of explosion in a cathedral the two 
main characters offer soliloquies that might be taken as 
expressions of carpentiers dualistic view of revolution 
victor a charismatic cynic speaks of playing so many parts 
that i no longer know which one i should be playing ive put on so 
many costumes i no longer know which is the right one 
his lover sofia responds perhaps that is the most splendid 
thing the revolution has done to have altered more than one 
persons ideas 
carpentiers greatest works were produced in the 40s and 50s 
when he lived in venezuela in 1959 he returned enthusiastically 
to havana after fidel castros triumph 
the cuban poet heberto padilla recounts an espisode in the 
early 60s when carpentier had been called to paris to receive a 
literary prize when he failed to appear for the ceremony cuban 
embassy officials panicked afraid he had defected padilla said 
they were relieved to learn he had simply skipped off for a 
vacation with a girlfriend 
the cuban government never trusted him said donald shaw a 
university of virginia professor who has written a book on 
carpentier his attitude toward them was always ambiguous and 
their reception of him was equally ambiguous 
carpentier directed the state publishing house until 1968 when 
he was dismissed and sent to paris as a cultural attache when he 
died his body was returned to havana for a state funeral 
procession headed by castro himself

three failed marriages helped country 
music songwriter sanger d whitey shafer to compose the 
memorable all my exs live in texas 
in fact he wrote the amusing ditty recorded by george strait 
with his fourth wifes assistance the 1987 song is probably 
shafers best known work in a 25year composing career thats 
yielded 200 recorded tunes 
i think ive written something about everything thats ever 
been written about the 55yearold shafer said recently 
his wry look at former spouses embellished by the catchy title 
became one of the most popular country songs of the past decade 
local country music bands everywhere have the song in their 
repertoire 
the tune also helped strait win the prestigious entertainer of 
the year award from the country music association last year 
and attention all those exs the royalties helped shafer too 
he and current wife lyndia who have been married eight years 
wrote the song about his three exwives its not malicious and 
listeners tend to feel sorry for the fellow in the song who cant 
even return to the river where he learned how to swim 
thats why i hang my hat in tennessee the song says 
hed like to go to texas but things are kinda hot down 
there explained shafer born and raised in the waco texas 
area it was a fun song to write i did change the names to 
protect the guilty 
the rhyming title which has become one of the most famous in 
country music is a followup to a punchy line he wrote in the 1970s 
for another song i was following the rodeos in texas and being 
chased by the fathers of my exs 
some titles dont tell the whole story but this one did 
said shafer who got the nickname whitey in high school because 
of his lightcolored hair 
he gives strait a fellow texan credit for taking a chance on 
the song others considered inappropriate 
i think if he had not have cut that it would never have been 
recorded shafer said people are funny about cutting cute 
songs but that one just had something about it it was too cute to 
pass up 
i wish i had a bushel basket full like that one 
the inevitable question is whether his three exwives really do 
live in texas and how they reacted to the song they do live 
there but one sort of drifts back and forth between california and 
texas shafer said 
hes not sure how two of them feel but exwife darlene took it 
fine 
were still friends he said 
last year shafer wrote the hit song i wonder do you think of 
me which was the first tune released by country singer keith 
whitley after whitley died in may of an accidental overdose of 
alcohol it was a no 1 record 
i liked him a whole lot and hed been to my house a lot when 
he first came to town shafer said he was a heck of a talent 
a great singer and was only getting better as he went on he also 
had a great personality 
some of shafers other top songs include does fort worth ever 
cross your mind recorded by strait thats the way love 
goes a no 1 country music record by both merle haggard and 
johnny rodriguez and i never go around mirrors also recorded 
by whitley 
shafer moved to nashville from texas in the mid1960s with the 
idea of becoming a singer he did some performing but found the 
competition stiff 
there were too many singers he recalled so he turned to 
songwriting 
for some reason ive always been able to retain a string of 
notes ive heard he said it just seems like i know what kind 
of idea will go with a certain melody 
shafer who recently was inducted into the nashville songwriters 
hall of fame describes himself as a writer of traditional country 
music with little interest in pop oriented styles give him a few 
beers and his favorite instrument and hell come up with a country 
song 
it just seemed like a guitar and six pack went together he 
said 
right now i like to write love songs because im in love when 
i was rough and rowdy i wrote rough and rowdy songs 
but he says country musics honkytonk songs glorifying alcohol 
such as hank williams theres a tear in my beer arent as 
popular as they used to be 
drinking and getting drunk is not hip any more people dont 
like to see it its almost indignant to be tipsy people just 
dont want to mess with people who cant control their lives

drexel burnham lambert incs demise could reach 
far beyond the junkbond sensation it created forcing interest 
rates higher hurting the financing ability of many us companies 
and possibly creating new takeover opportunities for foreign buyers 
investment strategists and business executives said tuesday that 
these were the types of economic consequences to expect from 
drexels decision to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy protection even 
though the investment bank is nowhere near the largest 
when we had the explosion and problems at three mile island 
it impacted the entire utilities industry said paul e berg 
president of berg fiduciary consultants a investment advisory firm 
in port chester ny youve got pretty much the same situation 
here 
the drexel bankruptcy filing could inject more sellers into the 
already depressed junk bond market that the firm dominates 
creating a confidence crisis that might spread into other 
securities some experts said 
such turmoil in turn could have a more profound effect by 
forcing interest rates higher at a time when many economists say 
interest rates must come down if the economy is to avoid a 
recession 
this means that the cost of capital to the united states will 
increase said chriss street a strategist at seidler amdec 
securities inc a los angeles investment firm the cost of 
capital overseas will be relatively lower we should expect a lot 
of acquisitions by foreigners 
to the surprise of some the market for junk bonds survived a 
wave of paranoia tuesday and prices of many issues actually 
stabilized managers of several junkbond mutual funds said they 
didnt receive any flood of calls from investors who wanted to get 
out 
but others said the markets behavior reflected confusion about 
the ultimate impact of drexels problems and they predicted that 
over the next several days at least the demand for junk bonds would 
stall 
its going to be very difficult to find buyers for that 
paper said jack barbanel managing director of first global 
asset management a princeton nj investment concern youll 
find many sellers but not many buyers 
many expressed surprise at the frightening speed with which 
drexel hurtled toward collapse because of the junk bond market it 
largely was responsible for creating in the 1980s 
it took a long time to string together this enterprise and 
not much time at all for it to crack up said james grant author 
of a prominent financial newsletter that frequently has warned 
against the perils of junkbond debt its not unlike the 
collapse of tyson in tokyo 
others likened drexels demise to a disaster that will further 
erode the tarnished credibility of the depressed securities 
industry overall and convince investors to shun investments that 
have no relation to junk bonds 
this could force companies that historically have relied on 
selling stocks and bonds for new capital to curtail spending plans 
lay off workers or even seek bankruptcy protection themselves 
meanwhile banks insurers pension funds mutual funds and 
other investors who bought junk bonds because they promised such 
high rates of interest could wind up owning nearly worthless pieces 
of paper some financial strategists said 
now the reality is beginning to sink in its coming home to 
roost that when people originally called them junk bonds thats 
exactly what they were barbanel said 
others emphasized however that the overall amount of junk 
bonds held by most investors remains only a tiny percentage of 
their portfolios the total value of assets held just by pension 
funds for example is more than 25 trillion while the entire 
junk bond market once amounted to about 200 billion 
if everybody owned a piece of a junk bond it would be pretty 
small said william overgard director of investment consulting 
at buck pension fund services in new york 
drexel vaulted to prominence in the 1980s by aggressively 
peddling highinterest securities with low credit ratings as a way 
to raise money for businesses seeking to expand the securities 
became known as junk bonds because of their relatively higher risk 
of default compared with investmentgrade corporate bonds 
even before drexels latest problems a number of prominent 
deals that depended on junkbond financing had begun unraveling or 
faced serious obstacles drexel played a role in many of them 
on tuesday for example drexel client integrated resources 
inc a diversified financial services company that has been 
struggling for months sought federal bankruptcy protection

sharply lower at around 17 cents a share down from 25 cents monday 
integrated officials said they were forced to file for 
protection under chapter 11 of federal bankrutpcy laws because a 
few creditors refused to negotiate the debt restructuring the 
creditors had filed or planned to file legal complaints against 
integrated 
the company which said it hoped to resume talks with creditors 
soon said the creditors had the ability to seize integrateds 
assets to satisfy their individual claims 
working out a consenual outofcourt reorganization depends on 
the good faith of substantially all the creditors chairman 
stephen d weinroth said in an interview we were spending too 
much time and too much money trying to stave off actions where the 
ultimate outcome was not in doubt 
sooner or later they were going to get a judgment said 
weinroth a former senior executive with drexel who left to manage 
integrated 
integrated originally was a real estate company and expanded 
rapidly several years ago by selling taxsheltered investments 
eventually becoming the largest seller of those investments 
that business was scuttled by 1986 taxlaw revisions and the 
company then moved aggressively into insurance and mutual funds 
financed largely through junk bonds arranged by drexel 
for a while integrated was one of the many junkbond financed 
ragstoriches stories but it was unable to sell enough 
realestate partnerships insurance policies and mutual funds to 
service its debt burden and its high overhead 
they had a capital situation where they were living on the 
edge said leigh walzer a securities analyst with rd smith amp 
co in new york they were living in an age of high leverage that 
made them then unmade them 
integrateds filing in us bankrutpcy court in manhattan 
protects the company from creditors while it continues to operate 
and attempts to reorganize its finances the company said none of 
its subsidiaries and affiliates is included in the filing 
among the subsidiaries is corporate jet manufacturer learjet 
corp of wichita kan which earlier this week agreed to be sold 
for 60 million to an investment group that includes the management 
of savannah gabased gulfstream aerospace weinroth said he 
doesnt expect any major delays in winning the bankruptcy courts 
approval for the sale 
the learjet purchase by the management group is part of a 
twopart deal that also involves the groups acquisition of 
gulfstream from chrysler corp for 825 million 
weinroth said integrateds liabilities totaled 1961 billion as 
of june 30 the latest date for which results are available that 
included 162 billion in long and shortterm debt with junk 
bonds accounting for 800 million 
assets totaled 1402 billion giving integrated a negative net 
worth of 559 million according to weinroth 
according to the bankruptcy court papers integrated said its 
top 10 creditors included large banks and savings and loans some 
of which bought much of the junk bonds issued by drexel under its 
indicted former bond leader michael milken 
manufacturers hanover trust co led all creditors with a total 
owed of 5584 million followed by chemical bank with 5157 
million 
drexel ranked fifth with 41105 million in exposure centrust 
savings and loan the miami thrift seized less than two weeks ago 
by federal regulators ranked seventh with 39 million in public 
debt 
integrated earlier this year sold its key financial services 
businesses to broad inc a los angeles financial services concern 
for 95 million far less than the 450 million integrated had 
hoped to receive 
a few other units have been either liquidated or sold weinroth 
said 175 million in assets have been sold so far 
some analysts predicted integrated would emerge from bankrutpcy 
a shell of its former self focusing on real estate limited 
partnerships and interests in leveraged buyout operations

chrysler corp has taken sharp 
losses to cut jobs and close plants but the leaner look and the 
sale of its gulfstream subsidiary will help the company compete in 
a tough 1990 auto market chairman lee a iacocca said 
a 664million fourthquarter loss and a 66 percent drop in 
earnings for 1989 means no profitsharing for hourly workers and no 
bonuses for salaried employees iacocca said tuesday 
but savings of 12 billion from the companys costcutting 
program should come through in time to help 1990 profits although 
prospects for the first quarter remain doubtful he said 
weve got our capacity down our cash position just got a 
little better and were focused iacocca said 
analysts agreed 
they are coming to grips with getting rid of some of this 
excess capacity and thats going to be felt in 1990 said harvey 
heinbach of merrill lynch and co in new york 
the outlook should be promising for them on earnings said 
thomas ogrady president of integrated automotive resources inc 
in wayne pa they have written all this off in 1989 so for 1990 
they have a clean slate 
chryslers first quarterly loss since 1982 came largely from a 
onetime restructuring charge of 577 million which covered costs 
of closing plants discontinuing some car models and paying pension 
and severance costs to trim the whitecollar work force the 
company said 
the fourthquarter loss equivalent to 290 a share compared 
with earnings of 433 million or 185 a share in 
octoberdecember of 1988 
revenues for the quarter sagged to 79 billion from 93 
billion a year earlier the company said 
for the year chrysler reported net income of 359 million or 
155 a share down from 105 billion or 466 a share in 1988 
revenues were 3492 billion vs 3415 billion in 1988 
the fourthquarter charge of 577 million was partly offset by a 
309 million gain on the sale of part of the companys stake in 
mitsubishi motors corp the company said 
chrysler had an aftertax loss of 87 million before the 
onetime charges 
but iacocca said the results reflected what he termed a 
fullblown recession in auto sales necessitating rebates of more 
than 1200 a car just to keep sales limping along 
i am not in the least disappointed he said 
united auto workers union president owen bieber and vice 
president stan marshall who directs the uaws chrysler department 
said they regretted that earnings didnt trigger profitsharing for 
hourly workers 
under chryslers uaw contract they said in a statement at 
least there will be some equality of sacrifice and chrysler 
executives will have to go without bonuses as well 
chrysler has shut down its jefferson avenue assembly plant in 
detroit and announced plans to close its st louis car assembly 
plant in september 
the company announced a costcutting program in october aimed at 
cutting 1 billion from its 26billion annual budget by the end of 
this year including elimination of 2300 salaried jobs it has 
since boosted the costcutting goal to 15 billion 
the company said it agreed to sell gulfstream for 825 million 
to a partnership of allen e paulson chairman and founder of the 
savannah gabased company and the new york investment firm of 
forstmann little amp co 
its called restructuring to compete iacocca said we 
looked at the market for the early 1990s and it looked a little 
grim we probably could have muddled through but we chose not to 
we chose to get ready for the 90s its all part of our plan 
i hear the words i want to believe it but the proof remains 
to be seen said auto analyst charles brady of oppenheimer and 
co in new york the only true vote of whether youre doing your 
job or not is whether you are selling cars or not 
chrysler stock closed at 1637 on the new york stock exchange 
down 25 cents 
general motors corp and ford motor co are scheduled to report 
earnings thursday

if automakers thought they would get a breather 
from pressure applied by the national automobile dealers 
association they may have to think again 
ray green the new president of the national automobile dealers 
association said there should be no cozy relationship between 
dealers and manufacturers 
if this were a real marriage we would have been in divorce 
court a long time ago said green head of the green holding co 
which operates eight franchises in southern illinois 
today we are looking at some differences with the 
manufacturers that go to the very core of our relationship 
differences that must be resolved if the auto dealerships in this 
country are to survive much less thrive green said tuesday at 
the close of nadas fourday convention 
nada figures show that about half of the 25000 dealerships in 
the united states arent making money and nada leaders have put 
most of the blame on automakers 
green succeeds ron tonkin of portland ore who hammered 
dealers for their increasing reliance on incentives mandatory 
membership in dealer advertising associations and other issues 
if the manufacturers think we are just going to hide theyre 
wrong green said 
he said he planned to keep up the fights tonkin began and hes 
planning to add a few of his own 
he said dealers should be represented in nearly all levels of 
decisionmaking by the automakers product planning and marketing 
for instance he said that would be part of a new franchise 
agreement hes working on he hopes to get half of the automakers 
to adopt the new agreement 
in his opening address to the convention tonkin championed 
higher dealer involvement with manufacturers and dealer 
unification tonkin and green said dealers and manufacturers should 
approach each other at arms length 
but charles folliott owner of the car store in norwalk vt 
said his relationship with manufacturers is good 
if anything i feel that manufacturer representatives are more 
willing to listen he said 
earlier this month chrysler corp showed they were more aware 
of nada when executives invited tonkin to speak to the board of 
directors it was the first time that a dealer organization chief 
addressed the board of any of the big three automakers 
and manufacturers felt the clout of their dealers when at 
tonkins urging late last year they began cutting their newcar 
orders to trim the growing inventories on their lots at the same 
time sales slumped and the combination of declining sales and 
dealer orders prompted the companies to cut production 
in turn that resulted in the layoff of thousands of auto 
workers

restrictive government policies on both sides 
of the border and antiquated transportation and processing 
facilities threaten the growth in usmexico agricultural trade 
according to a study by congressional investigators 
the general accounting office congress investigative arm said 
trade between the neighboring countries increased from 23 billion 
during the recession year of 1982 to 4 billion in 1988 the 
highest growth rate among major us agricultural trading partners 
while mexico is one of the united states best customers of 
agricultural products gao said several problems continue to impede 
trade including stiff health regulations import licensing 
requirements and tariffs 
mexican growers complain their agricultural exports are subject 
to excessive us plant and animal health regulations and that us 
tariffs on certain crops are too high us sources complain that 
mexicos continued reliance on import licensing requirements is 
inconsistent with international trading laws gao said 
mexicos transportation infrastructure also has been inadequate 
to handle the large increase in trade in recent years and if not 
improved will continue to limit trade volume between the two 
countries said the study requested by us rep kika de la garza 
dtexas 
gao said mexicos rail system is outdated and lacks the capacity 
to carry the increasing cargo from the united states storage 
facilities are also lacking and rail cars are used instead to store 
grain or other goods 
due to delays in returning rail cars to the united states and 
congestion at the border gao said us rail companies refused 
several times last year to accept any mexicanbound shipments 
imposing a de facto embargo 
roads in mexico are in general disrepair making transportation 
of goods by truck a slow process us truckers meanwhile 
complain that they cannot operate in mexico while mexican truckers 
can enter the united states with their cargo 
another problem gao said is that congestion bottlenecks and 
excessive delays characterize conditions at border crossing points 
saul mercado director for latin american affairs at the texas 
department of agriculture said another problem for texas exporters 
is that railroad rates are higher instate than for outofstate 
shippers making it cheaper for someone from kansas to get his 
grain to the border than a texan 
mexican trucks can carry heavier loads than texas law permits 
requiring much costly loading and unloading at the border mercado 
said 
mexico is the no 1 buyer of texas agricultural products 
mercado said 
we export every day livestock and grain and all kinds of 
commodities to mexico mercado said 
the state which has a positive balance of trade with mexico 
lists its top exports as cattle for breeding sheep goats and hogs 
for slaughter and a few dairy cows and some horses the state also 
ships corn sorghum rice and some wheat 
mexico provides the united states with tropical products and 
specialty crops such as coffee and tomatoes 
mexicos outstanding external debt which totaled more than 100 
billion in 1988 is also a major constraint to trade gao said 
despite those problems mexico bought more agricultural products 
from the united states than all but three other countries in 1988 
japan south korea and the soviet union with a total value of 
223 billion 
mexico in turn ranked third among all agricultural suppliers 
to the united states after canada and brazil providing the us 
with 182 billion in foodstuffs two years ago 
the united states had a positive agricultural trade balance in 
1988 with mexico of about 414 million

merv griffins resorts casino hotel in 
atlantic city will revive and have a stable financial future 
leaders of the firm predict 
those assurances were made tuesday to the casino control 
commission despite recent troubles that forced the casinos parent 
firm into bankruptcy court 
the casino atlantic citys oldest plans to pump more than 45 
million into muchneeded capital improvements this year and next 
year so it can compete with rival gaming halls again officials 
told the commission 
state gaming enforcement officials however said they believe 
financial projections made by casino officials are too optmisitic 
and the cloud of bankruptcy leaves the operation open to problems 
the commission is holding a series of hearings to determine if 
the casinos license should be renewed 
griffin who purchased resorts international in 1988 from 
billionaire developer donald trump attended the hearing but did 
not testify before the commission resorts international is the 
casinos parent firm 
during a break in the proceeding griffin said he is extremely 
confident his new management team can turn around the casinos 
fortunes 
the entertainer and television game show mogul said resorts 
location next to trumps huge soontoopen taj mahal casino puts 
it in a prime spot to grab business from what will be the 
epicenter of activity on the boardwalk 
i believe in atlantic city and i believe in resorts said 
griffin i believe that our ideas and marketing plan will bring 
it right back to being one of the top three casinos on the 
boardwalk 
facing huge debts resorts international in december filed a 
reorganization plan in federal bankruptcy court that seeks to get 
rid of about twothirds of its 912 million debt by allowing 
griffin to swap 78 percent of his resorts stock the plan still 
requires approval from the firms bondholders and the casino 
control commission 
deputy attorney general mary jo flaherty of the commissions 
gaming enforcement division said the bankruptcy court proceedings 
are costly and give resorts a stigma that will make it tougher to 
resolve its financial problems 
if resorts remains on a bankruptcy track they will not be 
able to maintain a competitive position ms flaherty said 
david c hanlon president and chief operating officer of 
resorts said he expects the company to be out of bankruptcy by the 
early summer 
ms flaherty said casino officials have crafted a recovery plan 
that is too optimistic in its projections of how much business the 
casino can attract she said the casino in 1989 accounted for nine 
percent of the space in atlantic city but had only eight percent 
of the market 
hanlon however said 1989 was an abberration and insisted that 
the casinos projections of revenue cant get any more 
conservative i have a high level of confidence in these numbers 
hanlon said resorts business has lagged because the casino is 
in woeful physical shape compared to its competition a condition 
the present ownership said it did not anticipate when it bought the 
property he said a capital improvement plan to pump 35 million in 
1990 and 105 million in 1991 will remedy this problem 
since 1983 there was little or no refurbishment at the 
facility at a time when every other major facility was making 
improvements hanlon said from a physical systems and 
technological point of view were well behind everyone else in 
town people went elsewhere and those who stayed did so as a 
matter of habit 
hanlon said he expects a great deal of the physical improvements 
at the casino to be completed by the time the taj mahal touted as 
the worlds biggest casino opens in april 
the hearing is expected to continue thursday

allen paulsons name and telephone number have 
been in the rolodex of corporate jet shoppers for years now 
prospective buyers of learjets will be looking for him too 
paulson and his investment partner new yorkbased forstmann 
little amp co bought chrysler corps gulfstream aerospace corp 
subsidiary tuesday for 825 million in cash and in a separate deal 
agreed to purchase learjet corp from integrated resources inc for 
60 million 
paulson becomes the main man in corporate aviation with 
gulfstreams small and mediumsized jets and the sleek and speedy 
learjets he founded gulfstream in 1978 and said owning it again 
is like having your baby back 
new yorkbased integrated had been trying to sell learjet since 
last august integrated filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization tuesday for chrysler the gulfstream deal buoyed 
spirits on the day the company reported its first quarterly loss 
since 1982 
if i had a company that really needed its own plane the giv 
would be right at the top of my list but if i go out to look at 
one of those and out of the corner of my eye i see a fleet of 
lears maybe i buy one of those too said charles brady an auto 
analyst with oppenheimer amp co in new york who has followed 
gulfstream 
brady said chryslers sale of gulfstream which it bought from 
paulson for 637 million in 1985 was a good move given chryslers 
current concentration on building cars and trucks chrysler still 
wants to sell electrospace systems and airborne systems the other 
two pieces of chrysler technologies corp 
gulfstream the biggest piece of chrysler technologies was 
carrying its weight showing at least a years backlog of orders 
for the planes it makes at three plants in georgia oklahoma and 
california savannah gabased gulfstream employs about 5000 
workers 
i took the crown jewels out of chrysler technologies 
paulson said tuesday during a news conference in savannah 
paulson said he thinks gulfstream can be more efficient on its 
own chryslers board of directors voted down paulsons suggestion 
last year to make an offer for wichitabased learjet 
ronald glantz an auto industry analyst at dean witter reynolds 
inc in san francisco said the story going around when chrysler 
bought gulfstream was that chairman lee iacocca prohibited by the 
federal government from having a corporate jet during the years 
when chrysler was recovering from its near bankruptcy proved the 
companys recovery was complete by buying a jetmaker instead of a 
single jet 
government loan guarantees helped chrysler survive in the early 
1980s 
learjet is competing for a us air force contract worth more 
than 1 billion to produce more than 200 tanker transport trainer 
system aircraft to be used by new yorkbased flight safety 
international inc 
flight safety has a facility adjacent to the savannah plant 
where gulfstream customers pilots and service representatives are 
trained 
we in savannah could do a lot for the learjet product 
paulson said 
paulson said it was too early to discuss details of the union 
between gulfstream and learjet but consolidation of the two 
companys engineering and sales departments is possible 
paulson also said gulfstream would not be forced to sell off 
assets to satisfy the financing of the acquisition

maryland tobacco growers may soon end a centuries old tradition 
of handtying hands of tobacco leaves opting instead for 
70pound bales that could cut labor costs by as much as 30 percent 
its the first major change in the form of marketing tobacco 
in more than 350 years said claude mckee director of the 
university of marylands experimental tobacco farm near upper 
marlboro 
the state department of agriculture has announced that at least 
two major buyers have agreed to purchase maryland tobacco that is 
baled and a third has given informal approval 
mckee said he approached tobacco companies with the proposal and 
has received written agreements from phillip morris cos inc and 
universal leaf tobacco co 
traditionally workers have spent the fall and winter months 
preparing for the spring auction by tying bundles of 25 to 30 
leaves of similar quality into a fanshaped hand using the stem of 
one leaf 
bales of tobacco measure three feet by two feet by one foot and 
weigh about 70 pounds mckee said buyers have expressed a desire to 
have uniform bales throughout the industry 
it would be a change from an antiquated way and it could put 
more money in the farmers pocket said maryland agriculture 
secretary wayne cawley 
whether the change occurs however depends on if buyers will 
pay as much for baled tobacco as they do for handtied tobacco 
cawley said 
cawley said an effort to change to bales three years ago failed 
because buyers at auctions declined to pay as much for baled 
tobacco 
baling was first used in the burley tobacco region kentucky 
tennessee west virginia north carolina and missouri about 10 
years ago and almost all burley tobacco is now baled 
my feeling is that the ground has been broken mckee said 
one or two will lead the way and the rest will follow it could 
be a big breakthrough a real laborsaver

with new emergency notification rules in 
effect a pesticide plant unit was set to resume production two 
weeks after leaking the same poisonous gas that killed 3500 people 
in bhopal india 
a feb 2 leak of methyl isocyanate at the rhonepoulenc plant 
went unreported for three days and prompted kanawha county 
officials to demand strict notice requirements 
i think were going to have a lot of dialogue between 
communities and the plants about what is expected plant manager 
ron bearer said tuesday thats one of the good things that are 
going to come out of this 
the unit was shut down for routine maintenance jan 31 two days 
later it leaked a small puff of mic that injured seven 
construction workers nearby plant officials said news of the leak 
was made public three days later 
bearer said production of mic would resume today 
the leak prompted changes in how and when rhonepoulenc will 
notify local emergency officials about poisonous gas leaks the 
company now intends to announce all leaks of acutely toxic 
material no matter how small despite federal regulations that 
require notification only if a pound or more of material escapes 
were still working through the agencies about exactly what 
that does mean bearer said one molecule is not what they 
want were literally treating it as any kind of release at all 
bearer also said he didnt believe the strict reporting 
requirements had to be adopted by other rhonepoulenc plants or 
other plants in west virginias chemical valley 
i think this is related specifically to the fact that we 
handle mic bearer said were just going to include other 
toxic materials 
rhonepoulenc officials met again monday with kanawha county 
emergency workers to discuss the new plant procedures in 
notification and maintenance 
i think they did a genuine review and they looked at problems 
they had and they addressed them county manager ron gregory said 
the leak occurred when workers released a vacuum in the mic unit 
to free a stuck pipe when the pipe was opened a small amount of 
mic escaped 
under rhonepoulencs new system pressures and vacuums will be 
kept on the unit so the chemical can be forced out also employees 
will work on only one piece of major equipment at a time 
estella chandler who has lived in institute for 25 years and 
was a cofounder of people concerned about mic questioned the 
honesty and intentions of rhonepoulenc and the two dozen other 
chemical plants nearby 
its business as usual but we will continue to protest the 
presence of hazardous materials and do what we can to protect 
ourselves chandler said 
in december 1984 methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a union 
carbide corp mic unit at bhopal and killed 3500 people the 
institute plant was the only sister unit to the bhopal operation 
union carbide sold that part of the plant to rhonepoulenc in 
1986 a year after a leak of another pesticide ingredient sickened 
135 people in institute

drexel burnham lambert trading ltd said wednesday 
it was deferring foreign currency and precious metals payments for 
one business day in the wake of the bankruptcy filing by its new 
yorkbased parent 
a statement issued by drexels london office said the move was 
to ensure that its trading partners didnt call for payments which 
drexel might not be in an immediate position to meet 
it is anticipated that the settlement cycle will begin again 
with the payment of us dollars for value feb 14 in new york and 
the firm intends to settle transactions for value feb 14 and feb 
15 by feb 15 drexel said 
the move was made with the approval of the bank of england 
the british central bank confirmed it was aware of the 
deferments and that it was watching developments in the drexel 
case it said it was as in all cases primarily concerned with 
monitoring capital adequacy 
the foreign exchange stock and metals markets were nervous 
wednesday morning but the markets reaction to the drexel filing 
under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy act was relatively subdued 
and there was no major selloff 
foreign exchange dealers said the drexel news didnt have any 
immediate impact on the dollar but the uncertainty surrounding the 
firms future and the us financial scene could limit the dollars 
upside potential 
the dollar was trading at 16928 against the british pound in 
london late wednesday morning compared with 16907 late tuesday 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was up 173 
points or 08 percent at 23105 at 11 am in london 
londons major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of 416 
at midmorning wednesday down from 41865 bid late tuesday 
it is obviously not good for confidence in us investment as 
a whole said geoffrey dennis senior international economist at 
the london investment firm james capel amp co 
but he added there is not much risk of systemic failure 
because of the drexel bankruptcy 
bob semple a market strategist for county natwest securities 
said people shrugged off drexel a bit too easily you dont know 
where the ripples will stop 
the head of foreign exchange at another british bank who didnt 
want to be identified said it all depends on how it develops 
and whether the us fed has to help maybe we havent seen the 
full effect of drexel yet 
some dealers described drexels trading in the currency markets 
as sizeable but the firms position was damaged as far back as the 
october 1987 stock market crash and the subsequent problems in the 
junk bond market other said so the impact of drexels wednesday 
announcement was limited 
but drexels decision to defer payments for one day likely will 
add to the firms problems and the whole affair could raise 
questions about the credit worthiness of other us investment 
banks dealers said 
the flight to quality will leave drexel gasping for 
breath said the head of foreign exchange at a british bank who 
ask not to be identified said would you want to give them 
credit after this 
drexel is one of the 13 market makers in the london gold bullion 
market and although it isnt certain whether the firm will pull out 
at this stage the announcement likely will damage its reputation 
dealers said 
however other firms have pulled out as market markers in the 
past so this wouldnt in itself have any impact on the gold market

groupe bruxelles lambert sa managers 
today proposed that the belgian holding company write off its stake 
in the us securities firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
drexels parent company filed for protection from creditors 
under us bankruptcy law late tuesday 
in a statement the company said its managing directors 
consider that it is prudent to propose to the board of 
directors a total writeoff of the drexel stake 
gbl has an effective 26percent stake in drexel burnham the 
statement added that gbl had no commitment to drexel other than the 
stock holding

toshiba corp has developed a prototype of a 
4megabit static random access memory chip company officials said 
wednesday 
toshiba said the new 4megabit sram is the first to use 
thinfilm transistors as memory cells a technology that reduces 
power consumption 
sram chips are more complex than the more common dynamic random 
access memory chips which are already available in 4megabit 
capacity sram chips generally use less power than drams and do not 
need special refresh circuits to retain their information 
making them wellsuited to batterypowered equipment like laptop 
computers 
however the larger number of transistors used by srams make 
them harder to design and manufacture than drams with the same 
memory capacity 
toshiba said the new chip has the same circuit density as 
16megabit drams which are expected to be the next generation of 
memory chips 
on tuesday ibm said it has begun producing 16megabit drams on 
a trial basis but said commercial production could be at least 18 
months away 
a toshiba official said his company does not know when the 
4megabit sram will go into commercial production currently the 
largest commercially available sram is 1 megabit 
a 4megabit memory chip can store about 4 million binary units 
of information or the equivalent of about 16 newspaper pages

a decision by vms realty partners one of the 
nations largest real estate companies to suspend most payments to 
creditors and investors has been a long time coming one industry 
expert says 
to those of us who have followed this company closely this is 
a little bit anticlimatic said barry vinocur editor in chief of 
stanger publications a division of the investment research firm 
robert a stanger amp co 
most people expected that the day of reckoning was going to 
come at vms vinocur said it was just a question of when it 
would arrive 
chicagobased vms said tuesday it had suspended 
nonessential payments to lenders and to its eight publicly 
owned mortgageinvestment funds citing severe cash flow 
problems 
this presents the best option for preserving the value in the 
firm and all of its investors said vms president jeffrey park 
he declined to comment further and the company statement did not 
elaborate 
experts said the development signals the seriousness of vms 
financial woes and reflects the decline of highly leveraged 
realestate syndication which provided taxsheltered investment 
opportunities until the 1986 tax reform act canceled the tax breaks 
the partnership manages assets of more than 9 billion 
including such highprofile properties as the boca raton hotel and 
club in boca raton fla the four seasons biltmore in santa 
barbara calif the grand teton lodge in grand teton national park 
and the westin maui hotel in hawaii 
tuesdays development follows a management shakeup in november 
that put jeffrey j park a former xerox executive in charge of 
vms a xerox subsidiary xerox credit corp owns 25 percent of vms 
at the time of the management change vms announced a 110 
million writeoff that analysts said reflected the softening 
realestate market the declining popularity of realestate 
investment trusts and the folly of vms heavy borrowing and 
interlocking business relationships among its funding operations 
realestate ventures and service companies 
critics say its business practices made the entire structure 
vulnerable to the financial difficulties of vms 
the wall street journal reported feb 1 that from 1981 to 1989 
vms raised 26 billion in equity from 110000 outside investors in 
100 realestate limited partners and the eight publicly traded 
realestate investment trusts 
the journal reported that vms had given back about 500 million 
through various distributions but that the fate of the remaining 
21 billion was uncertain 
vinocur said vms typically would use the money raised by the 
funds to obtain even bigger loans for realestate acquisition or 
development 
but the income from many vms properties have failed to match 
expectations making it difficult to meet loan payments analysts 
said 
shareholders in some of vms trusts have filed lawsuits in us 
district court in chicago accusing vms and its owners of fraud and 
extensive conflicts of interest 
vms has said it will vigorously defend the charges 
vinocur said tuesdays announcement may indicate that xerox has 
taken charge of the situation after replacing former vms chairman 
peter r morris with park 
xerox credit corp said its 25 percent equity in vms has a book 
value of 106 million 
xerox credit also said its interest in vms includes three debt 
components 136 million in subordinated notes and accrued 
interest 125 million advanced to vms through a line of credit 
and 200 million in collateralized loans and other secured 
financing arrangements 
b alex henderson an analyst who follows xerox for 
prudentialbache securities inc said vms does not account for a 
meaningful amount of xeroxs operating profit

east german premier hans modrow who 
is expected to be ousted in coming elections ended his summit in 
bonn today with promises of major west german investment but no 
immediate cash to bail out his economy 
modrow and chancellor helmut kohl also agreed to begin talks on 
eventually making the west german mark the official currency of 
east germany 
but modrows brief summit was overshadowed by an agreement 
between the four world war ii allies on eventual reunification of 
the germanys the germanys france britain the united states and 
the soviet union agreed in ottawa on tuesday to hold talks leading 
to reunification 
the hard details on merging the germanys politically and 
economically however are not expected to be tackled until after 
east germany holds its first free elections on march 18 
bonn on tuesday rejected modrows request for 9 billion to 
bolster the failing east german economy until the elections when 
modrows government is likely to be thrown out 
but today west german finance minister theo waigel announced 
that the government had agreed during a cabinet meeting to add 
nearly 42 billion to this years budget to finance recovery 
projects in east germany 
those funds are earmarked for capital investments proposed 
earlier and will not be made available for tiding over the east 
berlin governments daytoday expenses as modrow had sought 
the real news on germany unity came in the canadian capital 
where warsaw pact and nato nations were meeting to discuss allowing 
surveillance flights 
behind the scenes the four world war ii allies that divided 
germany the soviets the united states france and britain were 
hammering out a method for negotiating reunification 
the accord calls for two sets of talks the first involving the 
germanys during which they are to work out economic and other 
domestic considerations for reunification the announcement in bonn 
of currency talks appears to have been timed to coincide with the 
ottawa agreement 
the second talks would involve the germanys and the four allies 
that divided the country after defeating nazi germany and which 
still technically occupy berlin 
those talks are to deal with the critical issue of military 
alliances east germany is a key strategic component of the warsaw 
pact and west germany fills the same role for nato 
the soviets want a neutral united germany while washington 
insists on continued nato membership 
the agreement is partially the result of the perceived impending 
collapse of the economy in east germany kohl claimed on tuesday 
that more that 85000 east germans have fled to the west in the 
past six weeks 
modrows provisional government a conglomeration of proreform 
communists and former opposition figures that came to power when 
mass protests toppled the hardline government of stalinist erich 
honecker last year appears doomed in the march 18 elections 
as a result kohl has avoided making substantial deals with the 
modrow government until a new one is elected 
modrow met today with the head of the association of german 
industry tyll necker who said neither aid nor massive western 
investment were advisable yet because east germanys laws remain 
too restrictive 
several of the east german cabinet members who accompanied 
modrow to the talks said the delegation was disappointed with the 
bonn meetings 
mathias platzek of the east german greens party a minister 
without portfolio in modrows interim coalition told reporters 
that the west german hosts dealt with them somewhat 
schoolmasterly

the stock market headed higher today showing 
few ill effects from the collapse of drexel burnham lambert inc 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 1171 to 263581 
by 11 am on wall street 
gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading 
of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 718 up 464 down and 
524 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 5002 million shares at 
midmorning 
stock prices turned in a mixed showing tuesday as drexel which 
rose to prominence in the 1980s as the champion of junk bond 
finance moved to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and 
liquidate 
the firms demise left many questions unanswered about the 
outlook for the highyield bond market and the possible effect of 
pervasive debt problems on the economy as a whole 
but analysts said the markets took the news as no great 
surprise given the muchpublicized weakening that has been going 
on for months in enthusiasm for junk bonds and other leverage 
investments 
some wall streeters believe the waning of junk debt might 
set the stage for a revival of traditional financial values that 
could put the stock and bond markets on a sounder longterm footing

great northern nekoosa corp isnt giving 
up the fight against a hostile takeover bid from georgiapacific 
corp but it is ready to concede its independence 
the norwalk connbased paperproducts company which has been 
fighting georgiapacifics 38 billion offer for more than three 
months said tuesday that several recent setbacks have led it to 
consider a merger although it wants a higher price than 
georgiapacifics 63ashare bid 
georgiapacific went to court in portland maine this morning 
to mount a challenge to some of great northerns latest moves 
the company faces a showdown at a march shareholders meeting at 
which georgiapacific is seeking to have the companys directors 
replaced with its own candidates who would allow the merger to go 
through 
stephen m hill great northerns director of investor 
relations said it certainly was a possibility shareholders 
would back georgiapacific 
great northerns directors on tuesday postponed the shareholder 
meeting to march 20 from march 2 to give shareholders time to 
consider other possible offers great northern also said it had 
directed its financial adviser goldman sachs amp co to contact 
qualified buyers and seek bids higher than 63 a share 
georgiapacific spokeswoman gail smith reached in atlanta this 
morning said her company had gotten no information beyond great 
northerns announcement tuesday evening 
based on the information in great northern nekoosa corps 
press release our view is that great northerns attempt to 
postpone the march 2 shareholder meeting and to amend its poison 
pill are unlawful and ignore the interests of shareholders 
georgiapacific said in a statement we intend to seek 
appropriate relief 
georgiapacific attorneys filed papers in us district court in 
portland this morning asking judge gene carter to stop great 
northern from delaying the march 2 meeting ms smith said the 
court clerks office said a filing had been made by 
georgiapacific but it had not yet been processed and made 
available to the public by late morning 
georgiapacific has said in the past that all terms of its 
tender offer were negotiable 
great northerns announcement follows several setbacks in its 
efforts to remain independent 
earlier in the week georgiapacific announced it was selling 
off some of its paper operations to avoid antitrust questions that 
could impede the merger great northern had raised the antitrust 
issues in a federal lawsuit in connecticut that it considered its 
first line of defense in the takeover battle 
in addition a federal judge in maine has struck down various 
provisions in great northerns bylaws that would have made the 
takeover more difficult 
great northern said the accumulation of events led its board of 
directors to seek other potential buyers 
the board believes that it is in the best position to conduct 
an orderly active and effective exploration of all financial 
alternatives designed to culminate in the highest possible per 
share value for shareowners said great northern chairman william 
r laidig we believe that a price of 63 per share is certainly 
achievable 
great northern stock closed at 62 up 50 cents in new york 
stock exchange trading tuesday the companys announcement was made 
after the market closed 
georgiapacific an atlantabased forest products company 
proposed buying great northern last year in a move that would 
create the largest company in the industry with 14 billion in 
annual sales great northern has fought the bid vigorously saying 
the price is too low and illegal on antitrust grounds 
a federal judge in bridgeport conn is hearing testimony on 
whether the new company would have a stranglehold on linerboard 
check paper and certain pulpwood markets as great northern alleges 
in its antitrust suit 
the company also has criticized georgiapacific harshly for 
making the bid saying its trying to beef up its financial health 
and operating efficiency at the expense of great northern 
shareholders 
we still felt that was the case hill said but were at a 
point in time where its appropriate to seek other buyers to 
assure getting the best value for the shareholders 
hill would not comment on possible buyers its getting into 
fairly high finance so there arent that many players he said 
after georgiapacific the largest forest products companies are 
weyerhauser inc and international paper co according to 
testimony from georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr in 
bridgeport 
when asked what price the company was seeking hill said the 
best one possible with a qualified buyer somebody with money to 
pay

the amazing thing about almost all financial 
debacles is that those involved know better but allow their 
negative feelings to be overcome by the lure of big profits 
it happens regularly 
when bankers clamped down on home mortgage loans in the 1970s 
because they said such loans could be risky they lent hundreds 
of millions of dollars to less developed nations in order to obtain 
premium interest rates from then 
it was well known at the time that the loans were hazardous and 
might not be repaid banker magazines warned of the practice and 
even the general media carried interviews with analysts who 
accurately forecast what would happen 
still the chairman of one of the nations largest banks 
repeatedly scorned the warnings suggesting the writers were 
uninformed these loans he said are backed by the full faith and 
credit of governments theyre secure he said 
it happened in texas real estate and later in new england 
everybody in the building and real estate knows from experience 
that their occupation is cyclical everyone in banking should know 
that the economy as a whole is cyclical that it expands and 
contracts repeatedly 
it didnt stop them builders built and lenders lent and each 
one thought they would be the exception as if the gods were 
watching over them they gambled that they would close their deals 
before the downturn began 
the serious problem with that thinking is that the line is never 
drawn and each lender and builder tries just one more time 
they might be forgiven for not anticipating a sudden disaster 
such as a collapse of oil prices but they certainly had to know 
that in the natural cycle of events building booms come to an end 
often abruptly 
moreover a boom exaggerated by excessive lending is almost 
guaranteed to blow up nothing new in that theyve all seen it 
before 
it happened with the savings and loan associations 
while managers of some sampls seemed not to know what they were 
doing since deregulation of financial institutions had opened up 
brand new lending investing opportunities for them seasoned 
managers understood very well 
they understood risk and they understood high investment 
returns knowing that their practices couldnt continue forever 
they nevertheless felt they could cash in on a good thing just one 
more time soon they couldnt get out 
among the many problems that worsens greed is secrecy no lender 
wanted another to know that they were going to take just one more 
risk finance just one more building and then get out so they 
all took one more risk 
as a result the nation suddenly had more office space more 
industrial space more housing than it needed and all those 
beautiful projections that looked so good on paper were seen for 
what they were unsubstantiated hopes 
now we have junk bonds or highyield credit instruments 
designed to finance the very riskiest of enterprises such as 
takeovers 
those who developed the idea knew the risks were great but what 
is risk they asked but the other side of the coin doesnt 
everyone know that reward is in direct ratio to the risk assumed 
junk bonds were bought by the most highly educated and 
supposedly savvy portfolio managers those who guided the affairs 
of foundations mutual and pension funds university endowments and 
the like the lure overcame them 
in none of these instances was the collapse general although it 
was total in specific individual instances some investors have 
indeed benefited the reward for assuming high risk and in the 
future others will 
while the lure of big money is likely to produce future 
financial devices of the same sort others probably will learn a 
lesson 
many banks for example are reexamining standards on home 
equity loans known less euphemistically as second mortgages those 
loans have proliferated in recent years an economic decline could 
put some of them in foreclosure 
one tipoff is that some bank customers are working two jobs just 
to pay the interest a warning sign

an indicted yen trader told the fbi that 
corruption was widespread at the chicago mercantile exchange and 
that the open outcry system was dominated by crooked brokers 
according to recently filed court documents 
robert h bailin one of 48 people indicted in the federal probe 
of the nations largest commodities exchanges also contended that 
many traders are forced to make cash kickbacks to the big guys 
upstairs 
he was referring to commodity brokers who accept customer orders 
and phone them to floor brokers for execution 
bailin 37 made the statements during interviews with two fbi 
agents in january 1989 six months before he and 20 other japanese 
yen traders were indicted 
but his attorney terence p gillespie noted that bailin has 
pleaded innocent and said he plans to contest the governments 
version of the interviews at trial the chicago tribune reported in 
todays editions 
transcripts of the interviews were attached to a pretrial 
document recently filed by prosecutors 
bailin and 15 others who have pleaded innocent are scheduled to 
go to trial may 21 according to a clerk for the us district 
judge in the case william t hart 
an exchange spokesman said the merc would investigate bailins 
claims 
the transcripts indicate bailin told the fbi that he recalled a 
day in which 1 million in pork bellies futures contracts were 
bought and sold outside of the mercs trading pit 
the open outcry system does not work at the merc he told 
the agents contending that the system was dominated by a small 
group of powerful brokers who refused to deal with honest traders 
he said more than a dozen undicted yen brokers forced him to 
accept losses they had incurred through their own trading errors 
during court hearings two weeks ago bailin and two other 
indicted yen traders told us district judge william hart that 
they gave the interviews partly because agents and prosecutors had 
tricked them

cable television mogul bill daniels plans to sell 
nearly half of his cable brokerage firm daniels and associates to 
nine of the companys executives 
daniels 69 will sell 49 percent of the firm leaving him a 
majority owner with 51 percent said senior vice president of 
marketing bob russo on tuesday 
the move is part of daniels plan to give himself more time for 
other business and philanthropic interests russo said 
he has been putting in place a management group that gives 
him the opportunity to focus in other areas and still remain 
confident his company is going in a direction that he wants to 
see said russo 
daniels is credited with being one of the founders of the cable 
television industry and has continued to take a highprofile role 
in its growth 
last year daniels and associates brokered 100 cable and mobile 
communications transactions worth 57 billion and daniels wants 
to ensure it retains the preeminent financial services role russo 
said 
daniels has always espoused the idea that its the boss whos 
beholden to the employees and not the other way around said a 
representative of paul kagan associates a california cable tv 
analysis firm it sounds like something that would be very much 
in line with his corporate management policies 
russo one of the new minority partners said the sale also 
indicates a distinct transition to more of a management committee 
direction as opposed to bills dynamic and very singular 
leadership 
the deal should be completed by march russo said

citing a sharp decline in sales harrods is 
closing its fur salon which has sold minks to the rich and famous 
for nearly a century 
the world renowned department store said wednesday sales have 
dropped by 40 percent over the last four years but it denied 
caving in to pressure from animal rights groups 
the salon whose concession is held by fur retailer grosvenor 
canada will close on april 21 following a decision 13 months ago 
by harrods parent company house of fraser plc to end fur sales 
at its other 62 stores 
that announcement followed firebomb attacks on house of fraser 
stores including against shops in plymouth and cardiff 
according to government figures cited by harrods sales by 
britains biggest fur traders totaled the equivalent of about 19 
million in the first half of 1989 compared with 136 million in 
all of 1984 
harrods said it would begin closing the salon with a sale 
beginning friday at prices slashed by up to 75 percent 
but it will not be the last time furs are sold at harrods 
according to spokesman andrew wiles 
theres no doubt we will sell furs again but not in the same 
way it will be in a smaller more specialized way theres a 
chance we might consider selling designer furs wiles said 
harrods said it will retain its fur cold storage and continue to 
offer its fur alteration cleaning and valuation services 
lynx an antifur group said in less than five years the 
british public has become aware of the extreme and totally 
unnecessary cruelty involved in the production of fur coats

market ending months of stalemate 
the agreement clears the way for a new accord to reduce import 
barriers and duties on products such as nuts coffee and spices to 
be signed when the current round of general agreement on tariff and 
trade talks ends in december 
under the plan each gatt member has to submit proposals for the 
elimination or reduction of its respective tariffs and nontariff 
measures to the genevabased secretariat by march 15 
negotiators will then meet in april to discuss whether the 
various proposals go far enough to meet the gattsponsored uruguay 
rounds objectives on the fullest liberalization of trade in 
tropical products 
when the fouryear round was launched in punte del este in 1986 
governments agreed to pay due regard to eliminating duties on 
unprocessed tropical products to abolishing or cutting duties on 
semiprocessed and processed products and eliminating or cutting 
nontariff measures such as quotas 
as a first step toward these goals ministers meeting in 
montreal in december 1988 agreed on a package of trading 
concessions to developing countries worth some 20 billion dollars 
however negotiations were subsequently held up by the impasse 
over an internationallyagreed approach to cutting overall tariffs 
a compromise formula was agreed last month freeing the way for 
progress in talks on tropical products 
trade officials were also expected to reach agreement wednesday 
on a schedule for proposals aimed at cutting nontariff measures in 
a wide range of products 
a new accord to free trade in tropical products is regarded as 
vital by third world countries many of whom are dependent on 
export earnings from these commodities 
although tariffs on tropical products are generally low they 
are also selective according to a gatt official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the official cited the example of colombia which faces tariffs 
of about 20 percent on sales of cut flowers one of its most 
important exports to the european community flowers from israel 
entering the ec by contrast are not subject to duties he said 
gatt is the main international forum for sponsoring trade 
negotiations its 96 members account for about fourfifths of world 
trade

a littlenoted report suggests that more 
americans are working at two jobs now than at any time in decades 
perhaps since the 1940s when there was a warinduced labor 
shortage 
the report from the labor department shows dual jobs to be a 
growing trend in 1980 49 percent of employed people held two 
jobs the percentage rose to 54 in 1985 and in 1989 it continued 
on to 62 percent 
simultaneously over the past decade there has been a tendency 
of women to put in more hours at official rather than family 
jobs and for older workers to supplement pensions by working at 
retail outlets 
marriages are occurring later than before and there is a 
similar tendency to postpone children until later in life and to 
afford a home under present conditions often if not usually 
requires the bounty of two incomes 
still in many areas of the country the financing and upkeep of 
the home takes a larger percentage of household income than it used 
to up to 50 percent in certain instances or double what used to 
be considered affordable 
question is this really the good life that was promised is 
this progress 
in spite of socalled affluence fom the labor department shows dual 
jobs to be a 
growing trend in 1980 49 percent of employed people held two 
jobs the percentage rose to 54 in 1985 and in 1989 it continued

still in many areas of the country the financing and upkeep of 
the home takes a larger percentage of household income than it used 
to up to 50 percent in certain instances or double what used to 
be considered affordable 
question is this really the good life that was promised is 
this progress 
in spite of socalled affluence for example debt is 
increasing and that same labor department survey shows that 44 
percent of those working an extra job are doing so to meet 
household expenses and to pay debts 
consider this while more women than ever are working well over 
50 percent of them they earn less than men and advance more 
slowly and surveys show they still havent shed most of their 
household chores 
questions about progress arise in other areas too the national 
debt is greater than ever productivity increases have slowed for 
the first time since the great depression of the 1930s the 
percentage of homeowners is shrinking 
success in the fight against proverty has slowed herbert hoover 
in 1928 said the country was nearer to the final triumph over 
poverty than ever before in the history of any land today one 
in seven live in poverty 
progress consider these facts taken from a study by the us 
census bureau and the conference board a private notforprofit 
educational and research group 
since 1900 life expectancy has risen from under 50 years to 
more than 75 years infant mortality has fallen from 99 per 1000 
births in 1915 to about 11 today average weekly hours in 
manufacturing declined to 405 hours in 1985 from 494 hours in 
1915 while real hourly wages rose from 244 to 953 
comparable net worth figures werent available for earlier years 
of the century but in 1950 per capita net assets were 27021 
half those of 1985 and the relative costs of food clothing and 
shelter have declined steadily 
more houses have indoor plumbing and central heating systems 
and each year those houses seem to have more baths swimming pools 
decks family rooms telephones radios tvs electric toasters 
computers and smoke alarms 
vacation time has risen leisure has become a big business and 
activities that once were the exclusive preserve of the elite such 
as golf tennis sailing and skiing are growth industries 
more money more leisure and the pursuit of fun and travel 
have enormously enriched the way we live says the report 
what do you think

they used to call it near beer it had a small 
market pimply kids looking for a way to emulate grownups 
its become big business 
noalcohol beer it is called thank you the worlds top two 
brewers in an insatiable quest for customers are leading the 
charge 
anheuserbusch inc has rolled out odouls nonalcoholic brew 
and miller brewing co has launched sharps to stimulate a 
longignored segment of the market the brews legally the 
companies cannot refer to them as beer have less than a 
halfpercent alcohol content 
will this stuff sell 
one beer industry analyst bob weinberg of rs weinberg amp 
associates in st louis said he was skeptical partly because 
noalcohol brew tastes in his words godawful 
weinberg said the industrys big two were trying to position 
noalcohol brew as a new adult soft drink but they will have to 
displace diet coke and diet pepsi already wellentrenched not to 
mention bettertasting and lessfilling 
this trend it makes no sense to me weinberg said i am 
baffled in all honesty i cant see it 
drinking opponents also expressed doubts about noalcohol beer 
they said a concoction that resembles beer wont necessarily 
dissuade young people from chugging the real thing 
hamilton beazley president of the national council on 
alcoholism and drug dependence in new york said noalcohol beer 
was likely to confuse alcoholics and could even make children more 
apt to drink 
i dont see a happy image on super bowl day of a 6 or 
7yearold kid drinking a can of noalcohol beer while his dad 
drinks the hightest stuff beazley said 
beer is not just a beverage this is kind of like candy 
cigarettes its a poor model for kids 
noalcohol brew sales havent been impressive since 
anheuserbusch and miller got serious about peddling it in recent 
months 
while anheuserbusch sold nearly 81 million barrels of beer last 
year capturing 42 percent of the market for example the number 
of barrels of noalcohol beer sold industrywide was between 
700000 and 11 million 
primary markets are moslem countries where alcohol drinking is 
banned and the united states 
nonetheless company officials claim both odouls and sharps 
are off to fast starts 
bob merz group manager for odouls contended that 
healthconscious adults a growing segment of the market were more 
apt to reach for a noalcohol beer than a soft drink or juice in 
certain circumstances 
for instance merz said noalcohol beer could be the 
appropriate beverage for the designated driver at a party 
nonetheless noalcohol beer seems to be the most risky venture 
of all the diversification taking place especially at 
anheuserbusch 
the worlds leading brewer has gone from budweiser to busch to 
michelob to light beer to dry beer and several concoctions in 
between counting odouls its beer stable is now 17 brands strong 
that includes a reducedalcohol beer called la which has had 
limited success selling about 100000 barrels in 1988 but it was 
still beer watered down or not 
in the case of odouls will taste be enough one of beers 
plusses after all is its kick 
perception may also pose a problem 
none of a group of six drinkers informally polled by the ap 
liked the taste of odouls when they knew what they were drinking 
one said the brew resembled mildly flavored water and another said 
it was like beer frozen and then thawed 
but only two of the six could identify odouls in a blind taste 
test with two other brands 
both breweries are betting heavily that its projected audience 
the premium beer drinker primarily male age 35 and older is 
ready for a noalcohol beverage industry insiders estimate the 
anheuserbusch and miller have spent more than 10 million each 
developing nonalcohol products 
similar to diet coke the advertising campaign for odouls 
stresses that the taste will win you over 
the longtime noalcohol leader kingsbury a product of g 
heileman brewing co definitely has noticed 
everything weve seen and heard is that miller and 
anheuserbusch are going to be spending very heavily said david 
shield a brand manager for heileman weve got some things up 
our sleeves too were planning on increasing our activity 
though it debuted nationally only two months ago odouls 
really has been around for several years 
anheuserbusch began developing a noalcohol product in the 
early 1980s introducing an incarnation known as lax in savannah 
ga in 1986 in march of 1989 odouls was released in six 
southeastern markets 
merz said the taste resembles that of busch without the 
alcohol like the brewerys other brands odouls goes through the 
same steps brewing aging fermentation before a final 
coldfiltering step removes the alcohol 
merz said current technology eliminates the heavy syrupy taste 
once associated with noalcohol beers 
the brewing process used for sharps is a secret at miller 
generally the company brews sharps at a lower temperature 
minimizing the development of alcohol said tony sciolla an 
associate brand manager 
some beverage industry analysts suggest that noalcohol beer is 
the logical nextstep in a constantly changing industry since 
milwaukeebased miller introduced the wildly successful miller lite 
in 1973 the beer market has exploded with new choices 
there are four varieties of michelob alone and almost every 
beer has light and dry companions 
weinberg said 80 percent of millers business last year came 
from beers that did not exist in 1973 sixtythree percent of 
coors business came from new product lines 
anheuserbusch alone from the rest is decidedly oldline with 
only 20 percent of sales coming from new products budweiser busch 
and michelob continue to carry the weight 
with that power base industry analysts say anheuserbusch can 
afford to take a few chances the same is true for miller no 2 in 
sales 
we wouldnt have gotten involved with noalcohol beer if we 
didnt think the opportunity was there said millers sciolla

the president of perrier announced today that the 
company will withdraw its mineral water from worldwide distribution 
because small amounts of a naturally occurring toxic gas passed 
through a dirty filter and contaminated some bottles 
gustave leven told a news conference the company took the step 
because half measures were not possible 
traces of benzene have been found in samples of the water in the 
united states canada the netherlands and denmark in recent days 
but only part of the production will be withdrawn from the 
french market after a preliminary ruling by the health ministry 
that it poses no danger to the public leven said 
the recall will affect 120 additional countries that consume the 
popular greenbottled water perrier officials said estimating it 
could cost the company about 35 million 
news of the problem caused the companys stock to close today at 
248 down 49 from its closing price friday 
todays announcement by perriers president came days after 72 
million bottles of perrier were withdrawn from the us market 
after benzene was detected there 
benzene a chemical used in cleaning solvents entered the water 
in trace amounts when workers failed to change a pipe filter at 
perriers natural spring at vergeze in southern france 
the water and the natural carbon dioxide gas that makes it 
bubbly are normally separated underground then carried up separate 
pipes to the bottling plant perrier managing director frederik 
zimmer said 
a filter on the gas pipe that removes benzene and other 
impurities had not been changed in several months zimmer said 
malfunctioning and allowing naturallyoccuring benzene to seep 
through 
we dont know exactly how long the filter had been there 
thats the problem said zimmer it was complete negligence 
zimmer ruled out industrial espionage and said disciplinary 
action had been taken against the workers involved 
in the netherlands more than a million bottles were recalled a 
spokesman for the dutch importer said earlier today 
small traces of the stuff to the extent of about 10 parts per 
billion have been found in several samples that have been 
tested here in recent days said herman schieffers managing 
director of hero nederland bv 
in denmark traces of benzene were found tuesday in several 
perrier bottles prompting the importer peter heering and the 
distributer albani breweries to withdraw up to 300000 bottles 
heering said it was a very very small portion of benzene that 
was found and there is no danger heering said today 
a japanese subsidiary said tuesday that it would withdraw the 
water from stores because of the contamination found in the united 
states 
before today perrier had said it believed an employee 
mistakenly used a product containing the cancercausing chemical to 
clean grease from one bottling line whose production was destined 
only for north america

the financial services industry which reshaped 
corporate america in the 1980s with highrisk junk bond financing 
is undergoing a restructuring that will lead to more conservative 
lending policies experts said at a conference board gathering 
wednesday 
separately economists participating in the groups twoday 
conference on the financial outlook for 1990 generally predicted 
the us economy would avoid a recession this year although 
inflation would rise 
the financial difficulties of drexel burnham lambert inc whose 
parent filed for bankruptcy court protection on tuesday 
illustrated the problems facing the entire industry 
drexel pioneered the use of highrisk highinterest junk bonds 
for a range of corporate financing spurring the wave of mergers 
and buyouts that reshaped corporate american in the 1980s but the 
firm ran into financial trouble when that market stumbled 
senior conference board economist vincent g massaro said that 
in 1981 roughly 7 percent of total corporate debt was rated 
speculative by moodys investors service inc the rating 
agency last month the figure was 20 percent he said 
the percentage of companies sales that goes toward debt 
payments has risen to the point where it has eroded competition 
within some sectors of corporate america said moodys president 
john a bohn jr 
he predicted the issuance of speculativegrade bonds 
otherwise known as junk bonds would plunge by at least 50 percent 
this year and that attitudes would shift toward financial 
conservatism 
leveraged buyout and takeover activity as a driving force 
will fade bohn said 
in another area experts agreed the united states would escape a 
recession this year but said challenges on both domestic and 
international fronts will test the economys ability to sustain its 
recordsetting expansion 
thhe united states will face challenges from several directions 
according to bohn usjapan relations will be put to the test in 
the coming years and banks will be pressed to resume lending to 
less developed countries to get their economies going and in 
eastern europe the stage is set for a new range of eastwest 
trade and financial incentives he noted 
how the united states will fare with these longterm challenges 
is unclear economic growth will continue at roughly a 25 percent 
pace this year massaro said but inflation will rise to between 5 
percent and 6 percent 
i see the us economy in a late phase of the cycle a time 
when prudent decisionmakers will guard their flanks massaro 
said 
the conference board is a nonprofit network of companies trade 
and professional organizations government agencies and labor 
unions

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade paced by a late 
surge in the soybean and soybean oil markets 
analysts said soyoil futures led the advance with support 
stemming from new export sales of us soy oil to pakistan and 
several african nations soybean oil for delivery in march closed 
up 29 cents at 1995 per hundredweight 
joel karlin an analyst with research department inc a 
chicagobased brokers advisory service said a government report 
last week indicating soy oil stocks are declining has made the 
market more sensitive to supplyanddemand signals 
wheat futures were mixed with contracts for nearterm delivery 
up amid expectations that china will tender soon for some of the 1 
million metric tons of subsidized us wheat offered to it last 
week by the agriculture department 
a winter storm moving out of the central plains into the midwest 
pressured deferred wheat contracts and helped limit gains in the 
soybean and corn markets due to the potential for beneficial 
precipitation in cropproducing areas 
at the close wheat futures were 2 cents lower to 1 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in march at 387 a bushel 
corn futures were 1 cent to 1 cents higher with march at 243 a 
bushel oats were cent to 1 cents higher with march at 141 a 
bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with march at 
566 a bushel

the junk bond market gained further ground 
wednesday following the bankruptcy filing of junk pioneer drexel 
burnham lambert inc which began peddling its inventory of 
highyield highrisk issues to a handful of prospective buyers 
a spokesman for first boston corp confirmed that 
representatives took a look at the drexel junk bond portfolio but 
he declined to characterize their interest in it 
also said to be picking through the inventory were salomon 
brothers inc morgan stanley amp co and merrill lynch amp co 
spokespeople at these firms had no immediate comment some traders 
also said general electric credit corp was rumored to have 
reviewed drexels junk holdings 
drexel whose parent filed for federal bankruptcy court 
protection on tuesday is in the process of liquidating its 
government bond holdings 
there has been fear among some market participants that a 
selloff of drexels huge junk bond portfolio would put downward 
pressure on a market that already has been battered by defaults 
among several major junkfinanced companies in recent months 
in the junk bond market on wednesday gains continued to be 
centered on highquality gogo issues such as colt industries 
safeway and duracell whose prospects for paying off their junk 
debt are considered relatively less risky 
after rising as much as 20 per 1000 in face value in tuesday 
bargainhunting the better issues gained another 5 to 15 per 
1000 late wednesday as investors sought to pick up quality debt 
at low prices 
people do realize that not all the companies are dogs and 
that some highcoupon debt does have value said elizabeth 
reiners a vice president at dean witter reynolds inc 
drexel almost singlehandedly turned the market for highrisk 
highinterest corporate bonds into a booming business during the 
1980s when the securities were widely used for financing corporate 
mergers and takeovers 
although its share of the market has shrunk in recent years 
drexel still is the dominant junk bond underwriter over the years 
the firm underwrote billions of dollars worth of the bonds some of 
which remain in its own private portfolio 
drexel spokesman steve anreder while not directly confirming 
that the junk bond portfolio is up for sale said the wall street 
firms may have been invited to review it such a move is not 
surprising anreder said as drexel is looking at any options to 
maximize the value of its holdings 
drexel never has publicly placed a value on its junk holdings 
but market speculation has put the price tag as high as 1 billion 
exactly which issues are included in the portfolio also is unknown 
people can make some serious educated guesses about what they 
own but nobody knows for sure unless theyve seen the inventory 
said one junk bond manager who asked not to be named 
all the issues drexel has brought to market would be on it 
speculated john moran a trader at advest inc 
traders said it is less important how and to whom drexel sells 
its portfolio than how quickly it can unload the issues 
selling it as one piece may be better to get the uncertainty 
out of the market said one trader who asked not to be identified

great northern nekoosa corp has begun 
looking for a friendly buyer and hostile suitor georgiapacific 
corp went to federal court wednesday to make sure it gets in on 
the auction 
great northern said its financial adviser goldman sachs amp co 
had begun soliciting buyers who might be interested in paying more 
than the 63 per share offered by hostile bidder georgiapacific 
late tuesday great northern chairman william r laidig issued a 
statement throwing the company open for bids saying that 
georgiapacifics 38 billion takeover attempt apparently 
prevented great northern from continuing its longterm plans to 
remain independent 
great northern stock rose 2 to 64 a share on the new york 
stock exchange georgiapacific fell 37 cents to 4450 a share 
great northern spokesman stephen m hill declined to say which 
potential buyers had been contacted or how many there were 
sherman chao an analyst with the new york investment firm 
salomon brothers speculated that the only other domestic paper 
companies capable of bidding were weyerhaeuser co based in 
tacoma wash and international paper co based in purchase ny 
a spokesman for weyerhaeuser had no comment on the great 
northern situation a spokesman for international paper said his 
company had expressed no past interest in buying great northern and 
he did not believe it has any interest now although there would be 
no comment if any merger discussions were held 
separately wednesday georgiapacific asked a federal judge to 
block great northerns postponement of a shareholder meeting at 
which stockholders were to vote on whether to oust the great 
northern board of directors in favor of candidates nominated by 
georgiapacific 
on tuesday night great northern had announced it was postponing 
until march 20 the previously scheduled march 2 meeting 
great northern also said it had amended its bylaws so that in 
the event georgiapacifics candidates ended up controlling the 
board they still would be forced to use great northerns poison 
pill defense against hostile takeovers 
georgiapacific filed papers in us district court seeking to 
restore the march 2 meeting date and asking us district judge 
gene carter to supervise the auction for great northern 
there can be no doubt that gnns attempt to restrict the power 
of future directors is in blatant violation of maine statutes and 
wellestablished principles of corporate law georgiapacific 
stated 
chao said great northerns attempts to resist georgiapacific 
apparently were defeated last week when the federal judge ruled 
that the board could be ousted by just a twothirds vote of great 
northern shareholders great northerns bylaws had called for a 
threefourths vote but carter said that provision violated maine 
corporate law 
a proxy fight was clearly a losing proposition for great 
northern chao said great northerns executives decided to seek 
a buyer once it looked like they were going to be out of office 
soon anyway chao said 
hill said he did not know whether goldman sachs would be 
seeking higher bids from georgiapacific but georgiapacifics 
court filing accused great northern of planning to keep it out of 
the bidding

the european commission decided 
wednesday to oppose air frances purchase of a controlling interest 
in union de transports aeriens a privately held french airline 
the commission found that stateowned air frances acquisition 
violates competition rules of the european economic community a 
commission spokesman said 
the spokesman who declined to be identified by name said the 
commission plans to send a formal statement of objection to air 
france and the french government he said the letter would open the 
way for discussions on what actions need to be taken to eliminate 
the commissions objections 
eec officials say air france could be forced to shed some of the 
routes it acquired through its uta purchase 
air frances purchase values uta frances biggest private 
airline at almost 7 billion francs or around 12 billion on 
jan 17 air france paid 38 billion francs for a 546 percent 
stake in uta 
air france bought the uta stake from chargeurs sa a holding 
company with transportation and textile interests chargeurs had 
controlled 829 percent of utas capital 
air france and uta officials were unavailable for comment 
wednesday 
the spokesman said the commissions decision was based on air 
frances position as the dominant force in its market article 86 
of the eecs founding treaty of rome prohibits abuse of a dominant 
market position by any company when it affects commerce within the 
12nation trading bloc 
the acquisition gives air france control of 97 percent of air 
routes within france all of the international routes allocated to 
french airlines the purchase also raised air frances stake in air 
inter a domestic french airline because uta owned a majority of 
it 
uta has a small fleet of 19 jets six of which are owned by its 
charter subsidiary aeromaritime uta operates on longhaul routes 
mainly to the pacific and africa 
chargeurs chairman jerome seydoux had said on several occasions 
that he would sell uta if the french government did not authorize 
it to operate on european and transatlantic routes

stock prices turned in a mixed showing tuesday as drexel which 
rose to prominence in the 1980s as the champion of junk bond 
finance moved to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and 
liquidate 
the firms demise left many questions unanswered about the 
outlook for the highyield bond market and the possible effect of 
pervasive debt problems on the economy as a whole 
but analysts said the markets took the news as no great 
surprise given the muchpublicized weakening that has been going 
on for months in enthusiasm for junk bonds and other leverage 
investments 
some wall streeters believe the waning of junk debt might 
set the stage for a revival of traditional financial values that 
could put the stock and bond markets on a sounder longterm footing

police in riot gear erected barriers as 
soontobejobless drexel burnham lambert workers left their 
headquarters for lunch wednesday a short stroll from the new york 
stock exchange 
blue sawhorses blocked the sidewalk not to keep the curious 
from what once was wall streets highestflying firm but because 
vice president dan quayle happened to be touring a jobtraining 
center next to the drexel building 
whats quayle doing coming to rescue drexel shouted one 
employee of the firm whose collapse into chapter 11 bankruptcy 
proceedings will put most of drexels 5300 workers out of work 
he and other workers said drexel management gave no indication 
of the severity of the firms troubles and most of the staff was 
stunned tuesday when drexel announced it would liquidate most 
assets and quit business 
i guess you could tell the story of numbness said a drexel 
junkbond professional who asked not to be identified because 
he still does not know how many more weeks his job will last 
it wasnt gradual in terms of layoffs and then management 
telling employees to prepare for a bleak future anything like 
that it just suddenly happened 
drexels collapse will dump thousands of jobseekers into an 
already depressed securities business and while the best will 
quickly find work many others wont 
hey there was a lot of talent there and top talent will 
always find a home on the street said wolfgang demisch the head 
of research at ubs securities inc in new york and a potential 
hirer of drexel analysts 
but the broader message is that the street is shrinking 
demisch said he likened the plight of drexel employees to the 
difficulties aerospace workers would face if a large company 
suddenly closed in todays climate of defense cuts 
many drexel managers began to jobhunt quietly in december after 
learning their bonuses would be paid in stock rather than cash 
said executive headhunter stephanie katris 
ms katris is an assistant vice president at henner associates 
in chicago a fourperson company specializing in executive 
searches for the capital markets industry 
since december henner had received a few calls a week from 
highlevel drexel workers seeking sales or corporate finance work 
she said that trickle turned to a flood this week 
theres been 30 calls in the past two days she said 
wednesday they say ill do anything theyre ready to get 
into banking or work for smaller specialty brokerages 
one big question for prospective employers will be whether 
workers succeeded at drexel because of their efforts or because of 
the companys hammerlock on highyield bond financing 
there was a time when a salesman from drexel could pick up the 
phone and sell pretty much anything based on the reputation of the 
firm and their ability to provide liquidity ms katris said 
gary goldstein president of the whitney group an executive 
search firm in new york said his office has been getting up to 30 
calls an hour most from drexel people compared with less than 20 
on a normal day 
people are still feeling the emotional shock of it 
goldstein said like god a week ago i signed two engagement 
letters business as usual all of a sudden theyre getting their 
last paychecks 
a continent away in beverly hills calif where michael milken 
built a drexel empire based on the highrisk highyield junk 
bonds valentines day business slumped at gumps the luxury gift 
store beneath drexels offices at the foot of californias premiere 
shopping street rodeo drive 
normally they buy a lot said a gumps employee but i 
havent seen anything of them this year 
the drexel junkbond worker said some employees were spending 
nearly all their time looking for work while others tried to hold 
back huge waves of calls from clients trying to close accounts 
outside the corporate offices on broad street the employee who 
joked about the vice presidents visit said workers were shocked by 
the suddenness of the news but were still able to trade dark 
asides 
theyre renaming the company nightmare on broad street 
starring freddy krueger joseph he said a dual reference to the 
burnscarred nightmare on elm street slasher and drexel chief 
executive frederick joseph 
my dad called me from california last night and said son 
your bedroom is still here

the collapse of drexel burnham lambert maybe 
another blow to an already teetering market for junk bond financed 
takeovers but dealmakers are showing they still have plenty of 
ways to do business 
georgiapacific corp is undertaking a 38 billion hostile bid 
for rival paper manufacturer great northern nekoosa inc and the 
management of chryslers gulfstream aerospace subsidiary is buying 
the division for 825 million 
the bidders for those companies have gone back to some older 
more conservative financing methods as other corporate borrowers 
that once relied on the junk market may now be forced to do 
the takeover business slowed to a crawl when junk bond money 
dried up last fall after serious problems emerged at a number of 
companies heavily financed with the highinterest debt 
the bankruptcy court filing late tuesday by the parent of drexel 
whose fortunes rose and fell with the market for the highyield 
debt securities that it pioneered was another devastating blow to 
junk bond financing once the premier route for backing a buyout 
georgiapacific has lined up financing from a syndicate of banks 
at an interest rate of 1 percent above the prime rate which 
currently stands at 10 percent that compares with the 16 percent 
levels commonly attached to junk bonds 
being able to do the deal without junk bonds was one of its 
selling points said ad pete correll georgiapacifics 
executive vice president in charge of pulp and paper 
gulfstream meanwhile is being bought with bank financing and a 
combination of equity and debt financing provided by the divisions 
chairman alan paulson and the investment firm forstmann little amp 
co 
paulson said he never considered using junk bonds 
junk bonds began falling seriously out of favor in september 
when campeau corps 67 billion purchase of federated department 
stores inc which depended heavily on the risky securities 
began to unravel a number of new junk bond financings were put on 
hold 
the junk bond market has taken a series of hits since then and 
drexel whose biggest business was selling the securities suffered 
heavy losses that contributed to the firms chapter 11 filing 
already dim prospects for takeover entrepreneurs to raise 
large amounts of money using highyield bonds is further dimmed 
this is another significant negative said gregg a jarrell a 
finance professor at the university of rochesters william e simon 
school of business 
morris mendelson a professor of finance at the university of 
pennsylvanias wharton school of business said drexels downfall 
wont kill the junk bond market but i suspect that some firms 
that might have been able to raise money in the junk bond market 
while drexel was alive wont be able to now 
bernard black a columbia university school of law professor 
said the junk bond market would shrink drexels problems mean a 
possible source of liquidity is no longer there he said 
theres no market maker for recently issued debt 
junk bonds are best known for backing big takeovers but they 
also have been used extensively by smaller companies some of these 
firms resorted to highyield debt because they could not obtain 
other financing and may face trouble if they need loans in the 
future 
they may be slower in their growth said allen michel a 
professor at the boston university school of management they 
will not be able to expand at the same rate theyll have to pull 
in their horns 
mendelson painted a darker picture you may have more firms 
going bellyup that wouldnt have had to go bellyup before 
investors pursuing buyouts are finding that the failure of junk 
bonds has created problems besides forcing them to look for other 
means of financing trying to get bank financing means meeting a 
newly toughened set of qualifications 
in junk bond financing hundreds of individual investors might 
be putting up 1 million for many of them a relatively small 
amount but a bank syndicate has a smaller number of participants 
who have much more at stake and therefore more stringent standards 
said jerome e hass a professor of managerial economics and 
finance at cornell universitys johnson graduate school of 
management 
what they want is a business that has a cash flow capacity to 
service the debt hass said of lenders 
georgiapacific said it expects to have a debt load of 75 
billion if it succeeds in its bid for great northern securities 
analysts who track the company say that the suitor and its target 
have strong cash flows and say georgiapacific will be able to pay 
down its debt 
lawrence ross an analyst with painewebber inc said banks also 
were willing to back georgiapacific because it is tremendously 
strong financially and operationally 
furthermore were not talking here about someone from outside 
the industry taking over a company somebody who doesnt know 
anything about the industry ross said

business failures fell to the lowest level in 
more than a decade last year as massive savings and loans flops 
and the real estate slump subsided dun amp bradstreet corp reported 
wednesday 
business failures nationwide declined 129 percent to 49719 
from 57099 in 1988 said dun amp bradstreet a new yorkbased 
marketer of business information 
the decline was most pronounced in texas where business 
failures dropped 324 percent to 5323 however failures rose 419 
percent in massachusetts to 789 as new england states reported an 
increase in bankruptcies 
business failures according to the report are defined as 
companies that cease operations for a number of reasons including 
bankruptcy foreclosure or reorganization 
fewer failures were reported in agriculture mining 
manufacturing and the services sector as well as in wholesale and 
retail trade 
but the finance insurance and real estate sectors registered a 
91 percent increase in business failures to 2770 from 2540 in 
1988 the report said 
the troubled savings and loan industry and the subsequent 
stress in the real estate sector drove failures up earlier this 
year but the upward trend appears to be subsiding said joseph 
w duncan a dun and bradstreet economist 
the largest regional decrease in business failures was in the 
mountain states colorado showed a 328 percent drop utah was down 
523 percent wyoming off 429 percent new mexico fell 14 percent 
and arizona declined 132 percent

jon baker helped finance a major hollywood movie 
and hosted princess di but he admits there isnt much glamour in 
his job title insurance salesman 
when it comes to a life insurance salesman and a used car 
salesman a lot of people say id rather affiliate with a used car 
salesman so would i baker said the industry breeds 
mediocrity 
if it sounds like baker is trying to shake up the insurance 
business and remove its stigma as a boring profession that attracts 
greedy loafers youre right he said the system needs to change so 
agents will sell more policies and maintain them over a long period 
of time 
its part of a formula that led baker and his former partner 
john lander to sell 1 billion worth of insurance in 1988 
there is no magic dust said baker 47 
he started in the insurance business in 1970 working for mutual 
of new york but four years later he formed the partnership with 
lander 
the two brought to this venture an assembly line system for 
soliciting and meeting customers planning policies closing deals 
and collecting referrals all at once using differing workers 
but baker also had interests elsewhere 
in 1978 he got lander to join him in providing financial 
backing for the motion picture the buddy holly story 
while the movie received three academy award nominations 
including one for best actor for gary busey and won the award for 
best sound track baker said the venture turned out to be a 
financial nightmare 
the picture went way overbudget he said i was in 
constant warfare with the producer group im surprised we ever got 
it in the can 
the national independent theater exhibitor sued columbia 
pictures over the distribution rights but the case was dismissed 
yet the movie is still the source of litigation baker claims 
columbia hasnt fully paid him 
minnows who want to get into the water with sharks and 
piranhas get eaten alive he said 
baker admits his outside interests strained the partnership with 
lander 
the breaking point came in early 1989 when baker turned his 
attention to the royal academy of music in england the year 
before he had become chairman of a newly created foundation that 
would provide scholarships for americans wishing to study at the 
academy 
in the fall of 1988 baker was invited to london to meet with 
princess diana who served as president of the academy he then 
planned a reception for her in new york in february 1989 
all of december january and february i was consumed in 
this he said john lander didnt like it his motivations 
were different 
lander was more focused on the insurance business and so the 
two parted each forming his own company 
bakers career in life insurance hasnt always gone well when 
congress eliminated a tax break for corporateowned life insurance 
in 1986 baker estimates his firm lost more than 3 million 
effectively we went out of business he said 
but baker and lander rebuilt their company looking for new 
avenues to sell insurance 
one fruitful idea has been to market insurance policies as a way 
for businesses to stem the rising cost of health coverage under 
this system a company buys insurance on its workers and when an 
employee dies the benefits are used to help cover the companys 
medical costs 
baker acknowledges this scheme is a bit ghoulish but says 
insurance salesmen need to find creative ways to sell their product 
this industry is so screwed up said baker who now oversees 
18 people in his office in wellesley a boston suburb theres an 
opportunity for those who know what theyre doing to generate an 
unlimited amount of production and revenue 
in 1988 baker said this production generated 20 million worth 
of premiums for the two partners which translated to 1 billion 
worth of insurance industry experts consider that a major 
achievement 
baker has actively sought a highprofile image in the insurance 
business which is heavily concentrated in the northeast at a 
recent conference of bostonarea life insurance salesmen he 
proposed lowering commissions for the first year then raising them 
in following years while the policy remains in effect 
that move would encourage people to make more sales and keep the 
policies from lapsing he said 
his view is from the standpoint of a very comfortable agent 
said jack bobo executive vice president of the national 
association of life underwriters agents receive large firstyear 
commissions because selling a policy requires a lot of planning 
with the customer 
if they cannot be rewarded the experience is that the 
planning doesnt get done he said also a cut in commissions 
could push agents out of the business 
but baker said thats exactly what the insurance industry needs 
failing and marginal producers he said must be 
terminated

here is a brief explanation of junk bonds and 
their role in the nations financial markets 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
corporate bonds rated below investment grade by either standard 
amp poors corp or moodys investors service are considered 
junk that means a companys ability to pay interest and repay 
principal is considered speculative meaning there is a higher risk 
of default to compensate the bonds carry higher yields 
currently an average of 1535 percent compared with 962 percent 
for investmentgrade corporate bonds and 832 percent for 10year 
us government bonds according to moodys 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
moodys estimates there are more than 200 billion in junk bonds 
outstanding representing about 25 percent of all corporate bond 
issues the market mushroomed in the 1980s growing almost nine 
times in size 
in contrast all debt issued by the nations nonfinancial 
concerns which includes government borrowings totals about 96 
trillion the nations equity market or stocks is worth about

young companies unable to issue investmentgrade bonds and to

raised by junk issues from 1980 to 1988 went to finance companies

drop in fourthquarter net income attributed to higher catastrophe 
costs and rising costs in automobile losses while transamerica 
corps profit jumped 31 percent 
aetna based in hartford conn posted net income for the 
fourth quarter of 151 million or 135 a share down from 209

602 a share down 5 percent from 713 million or 625 a share 
in 1988 revenue for 1989 totaled 196 billion up from 178 
billion the previous year 
aetna said its losses from catastrophes reduced fourthquarter 
income by 66 million and 1989 earnings by 170 million after 
taxes the fourthquarter losses came mainly from freezing weather 
in december and the october earthquake in california 
aetna chairman james t lynn said losses were partially offset 
by stronger earnings from employee benefits businesses and 
increased capital gains 
san franciscobased transamerica credited strong performances in 
its insurance and finance businesses for its robust gain in 
fourthquarter profit

atampt reported a slight increase in 
long distance telephone calls wednesday as the company offered 
valentines day discounts to make up for a ninehour service 
disruption last month 
call volume was up about 1 percent from 8 am to 5 pm the 
hours of the special atampt spokesman mike keady said there were 
about 786 million calls attempted during those hours up from 777 
million the previous wednesday he said 
the long distance network handles about 110 million calls on a 
normal business day 
the discount applied to residential and most business customers 
including credit card and tollfree 800 calls 
a programming error in atampts call switching network partially 
knocked out longdistance service nationwide for about nine hours 
jan 15 keeping millions of calls from being completed 
lynn newman another spokesperson at atampts operations 
headquarters in basking ridge said the discount was the only 
measure planned by atampt to compensate customers 
this is our way of saying youre a valuable customer ms 
newman said 
the phone giant offered longdistance customers an average 33 
percent discount off regular daytime rates for calls within the 
united states between 8 am and 5 pm discounts averaged about 37 
percent off calls to 158 countries worldwide 
in some states where local utility regulators gave the company 
permission discounts also applied to intrastate calls handled by 
atampt she said 
i think its a very generous way for them to atone for any 
damages done said jim furlong spokesman for computer sciences 
corp of los angeles a computer services company that relies 
heavily on long distance calling 
furlong said the company did not attempt to determine how much 
money if any it lost during the ninehour outage 
were not the least bothered or concerned by that oneday 
problem he said 
its a very nice gesture said roger connor a spokesman for 
marriott corp which relies on longdistance telephone calls for 
reservations for its 530 hotels worldwide i think its more than 
adequate 
connor said the company did not believe it lost money because of 
the outage 
mary oneill a spokeswoman for american airlines said her 
company was trying to work out compensation for the outage that 
affected reservation lines last month 
because we had a special corporate contract we were not 
eligible for that discount said ms oneill she said the 
airlines is negotiating with atampt to find an acceptable 
settlement 
she said americans volume of calls was reduced by about 
twothirds on the day of the outage

the chicago mercantile exchange on wednesday 
unveiled a blueprint for the 1990s that foresees eastern european 
participation in the mercs agricultural markets and new sources of 
revenue for exchange members 
but the first objective of the worlds secondlargest commodity 
futures exchange is to regain public confidence after last years 
bruising revelation of a federal tradingfraud investigation the 
mercs board of governors said in a statement 
in order to maintain our successful momentum there must be 
absolute confidence in the integrity of our markets the 
statement said 
the continuing investigation of trading practices at the merc 
and the larger chicago board of trade has yielded indictments 
against 48 people 26 of them merc traders 
leo melamed chairman of the merc boards executive committee 
said the freemarket revolution in eastern europe promises to 
revitalize the mercs agricultural futures and options markets 
which were overshadowed by the wildly successful development of 
financial futures in the 1980s 
people in the emerging democracies of eastern europe want more 
meat and importers there can be taught how to protect their 
businesses from market fluctuations by using futures and options to 
lock in prices in advance melamed said in a telephone interview 
in addition to its existing cattle hog and porkbelly 
contracts the merc may develop new hedging instruments 
specifically for the eastern european market he said 
were going to make that into quite a priority because it 
looks like theres a demand for it melamed said 
the board also proposed a new business venture the cme resource 
and service co to develop products and services for market users 
and divide the profits among the mercs approximately 2700 members 
some of the ventures cme resource may pursue include publishing 
telecommunications services accounting services and tradeclearing 
for markets other than the merc melamed said 
the venture would be modeled after globex an automated global 
trading network the merc is developing with reuters holdings plc 
that will return profits to exchange members 
globex will be launched in the spring the merc said

unsecured creditors of eastern airlines said 
tuesday they would work with the carrier to reach agreement on a 
bankruptcy reorganization plan rather than push for easterns 
liquidation 
the committee representing unsecured creditors a group composed 
mainly of trade suppliers such as aircraft manufacturers who are 
owed about 11 billion by eastern made the announcement after 
meeting in new york 
in a statement the committee said it was briefed by its 
financial advisers about easterns proposed reorganization plan 
other reorganization alternatives and the potential recovery to 
be achieved in a liquidation 
eastern proposed only partial repayment of its debts in its 
latest reorganization proposal filed with the federal bankruptcy 
court in new york in late january previously the carrier had 
promised to repay its debts in full 
the creditors committee has made no determination to pursue a 
liquidation in this case the unsecured creditors statement said 
the creditors committee intends to proceed with immediate 
negotiations with eastern texas air and the examiner with a view 
toward achieving a consensual plan of reorganization that is in the 
best interests of creditors and which provides for a viable eastern 
airlines going forward 
eastern spokesman robin matell welcomed the creditors committee 
statement 
we look forward to continuing negotiations with the committee 
in hopes of reaching a consensual agreement he said late tuesday 
easterns reorganization plan calls for paying unsecured 
creditors only 10 percent of their debts in cash when the airline 
emerges from bankruptcy protection and another 70 percent over the 
following 10 years without interest 
in return for accepting partial repayment texas air would give 
the unsecured creditors a 40 percent equity stake in eastern 
the plan also calls for paying preferred stockholders no more 
than 10 cents on the dollar in the form of new securities the 
preferred holders who are owed 1175 billion criticized 
easterns reorganization plans and advocated the liquidation or 
outright sale of the airline two weeks 
the machinists union has been on strike against eastern since 
last march 4 it was joined in sympathy walkouts by pilots and 
flight attendants forcing the airline into bankruptcy court 
protection on march 9 the pilots and flight attendants abandoned 
their strikes just before thanksgiving but eastern has rebuilt as 
a smaller carrier and hired mostly nonunion workers to replace the 
strikers
