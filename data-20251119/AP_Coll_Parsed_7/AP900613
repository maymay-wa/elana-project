defeated southern baptist moderates on 
wednesday weighed an uncertain perhaps separate future from their 
fundamentalistdominated convention as it undercut a 
religiousliberty agency in the nations capital 
unless the denominations ruling bloc becomes more inclusive and 
accepts the rest of us brothers and sisters some are going to 
leave said the rev daniel vestal defeated moderate candidate for 
the denominations presidency 
similar breakaway sentiments came from others in that camp 
which charges fundamentalists with using their appointive powers to 
control agencies and institutions of the 149millionmember 
denomination 
the rev morris chapman whose election as president tuesday 
extended fundamentalist control for a 12th straight year has 
supported moving the staff of the countrys largest protestant body 
toward a unanimous belief that the bible is errorfree 
the convention wednesday slashed support of the washingtonbased 
baptist joint committee on public affairs the influential 
religious liberty lobby of nine baptist groups for 50 years 
fundamentalists have assailed it for opposing prayer sponsored 
by public schools and for not fighting abortion 
the convention cut 87 percent of its support to the agency by 
shifting 346796 to the 13 million budget of the christian life 
commission in so doing it gave the job of lobbying for religious 
freedom to an agency whose primary mission is upholding morality 
with that change theyll laugh us off capitol hill said 
the rev ron sisk of tiburon calif 
the convention also gave some of the religious liberty function 
to the public affairs committee creating three perhaps 
conflicting voices 
the rev james dunn head of the baptist joint committee said 
it would keep up its defense of churchstate separation and against 
government intrusion into religion 
we wont downgade our religiousliberty agenda he said 
noting that assurances of supplemental financing were coming from 
state and local southern baptist churches across the country 
he told reporters that with the multiple agencies there likely 
will be contradictory testimony at times its something well 
have to live with 
the rev richard land head of the christian life commission 
said his agency shares the joint committees stand on churchstate 
separation and many other issues land predicted that conflicts 
will be far fewer than sometimes has been supposed 
but he added that there are many places where 
misinterpretation of supreme court decisions against sponsored 
school prayers have produced a brooding hostility to religion 
he said the greatest threat to religious liberty in the last 
decade of this century comes not from violation of the 
constitutions ban against establishing religion but from violating 
the reglious freeexercise guarantee 
he charged there were infringements and restraints on peoples 
religious conscience 
the rev grady cothen of coral springs fla head of of a newly 
formed religious liberty council to back the denominationally 
downgraded joint agency said the convention had turned a very 
sharp corner to the right 
it implies that the powersthatbe do not want to bring along 
the rest of us christian brethren they obviously want to be free 
of us but they wont make it 
however cothen former president of the denominations sunday 
school board added in an interview some will pull out its 
inevitable 
vestal trounced in an election in which chapman took 58 percent 
of the ballots by more than 38000 messengers said moderates 
soon would convene a meeting to consider their future 
let me confess some mystery about that future he told 
reporters its premature to talk about separation but he said 
there would be departures unless the current regime broadens its 
inclusiveness 
a lot of people are now ready to do something tangible to 
express their dicontent and alienation said the rev stan hastey 
of washington executive director of the baptist alliance they 
group was formed to pursue alternatives to the current 
denominational administration 
he said several moderate groups including the alliance baptist 
committed to the southern baptist convention and women in 
ministries would participate in the meeting about future steps 
probably in august

a pottery bowl painted with a 
23pointed star shows that an exploding star witnessed by ancient 
asians and arabs was also seen by prehistoric indians in the 
southwest scientists said tuesday 
the bowl provides us with the best supported historic record 
from the western hemisphere of the supernova that created the crab 
nebula said r robert robbins an astronomy professor at the 
university of texas at austin 
in fact the bowl is the most certain record of the supernova 
that has ever been discovered outside china and japan he said 
during the 176th meeting of the american astronomical society 
the white earthenware mimbres indian bowl made between 1000 
and 1150 ad and found in what is now southwestern new mexico 
also shows the blackpainted figure of a rabbit curled into a 
crescent shape to symbolize the moon robbins said 
in many indian cultures in the new world the rabbit commonly 
represents the moon because indians tended to see a rabbit in the 
moon rather than a man in the moon he said 
chinese astronomers recorded the appearance of the crab nebula 
supernova in 1054 in the constellation taurus their records showed 
the star was so bright it could be seen in the daytime for 23 days 
the supernova also was recorded by the japanese robbins said 
steve maran senior staff scientist at the goddard space flight 
center at greenbelt md said the supernova also was noticed in 
baghdad where it was recorded in an 11th century medical 
publication 
the mimbres bowl is decorated with a small blackpainted 
sunburst with 23 rays at one of the rabbits rear feet the 23 rays 
represent the 23 days the supernova was clearly visible during the 
day robbins said 
the crab nebula is a huge cloud of gas in space that is the 
remnant of the supernova supernovas are dying stars that blow up 
and eject matter in all directions 
the crab nebula is about 6 light years wide and about 6500 
light years from earth one light year equals almost 6 trillion 
miles which is the distance light travels in one year 
american astronomers discovered early in this century that the 
crab nebula is expanding at a rate implying an explosion beginning 
about 900 years ago when first seen from earth 
a computer analysis shows the position of the sunburst and the 
rabbit generally coincides with the location of the supernova and 
the crescent moon on the morning of july 5 1054 robbins said 
it shows us how sophisticated these people were said 
robbins who worked with photo technician russell westmoreland of 
the university of texas at austins astronomy department 
the mimbres lived in small farming villages the bowl was from a 
village called galaz and was found in the 1930s by scientists from 
the university of minnesota robbins said

at least 3 million gallons of oil 
spilled into the gulf of mexico from the mega borg officials said 
wednesday and the captain said the explosions that ripped through 
the supertanker came without warning 
i was in the radio room alone and suddenly the door swung 
open the lights went out and glass was crashing down said 
capt cm mahidhara told a panel questioning the norwegian 
vessels crew 
fires sparked by the blasts friday were under control but 
continued to burn wednesday crews have found a hole in the center 
tank of the 886foot ship said coast guard capt thomas greene 
a minimum of 3 million gallons has left the cargo tanks and 
im presuming that most of that has gone into the water greene 
said i dont see any risk of losing cargo from the other tanks 
most of the spilled light crude oil has burned or evaporated 
authorities said greene said between 12000 gallons and 40000 
gallons remained in the water 
the coast guard had initially estimated that up to 100000 
gallons of the ships 38 million gallon cargo had leaked 
the norwegian government convened a board of inquiry wednesday 
at a galveston hotel to question the crew the captain said he 
noticed nothing wrong before the explosions which occurred around 
1130 pm friday as oil was being transferred to a smaller tanker 
57 miles southeast of galveston 
as far as i could see everything was in good order said 
mahidhara a sailor for 17 years and a captain for nine 
the crew is being questioned by erik leikvang general consul of 
norway and ole leithe a norwegian maritime investigator they are 
trying to determine the ships seaworthiness and whether there is 
any criminal liability stemming from the explosions and leak the 
coast guard also is participating in the hearing 
mahidhara said the crew went over a safety checklist before 
transferring the fuel and all checks were satisfactory 
mahidhara said after the explosion choking black smoke kept him 
from locating and commanding his 41member crew two men were 
killed and two others are missing and presumed dead seventeen 
crewmen were injured 
mahidhara and five other crewmen stayed aboard the burning 
tanker to search for four missing men 
the remains of the ships chief officer tojo sagar were found 
outside the pump room he said the body of crewman bernardo cortez 
had been crushed by a falling skylight and also was found outside 
the pump room he said 
mahidhara a seaman for 17 years and a captain for nine said he 
considered trying to launch a rescue effort for two men seen in the 
engine room but decided against it because of the smoke and fire 
i did not think it was wise to send people down there it was 
too dangerous i would have lost more people he said 
i looked forward and saw bright flames were coming from the 
pump room and ventilators he said the flames were licking up 
right over the bridge the top of the pump room had been completely 
blown off 
leikvang said the hearing was only for factfinding 
i dont think we can find the reason for the explosion from 
this hearing said leithe maybe later when the ship is empty 
and cleaned we will know more 
an oil sheen streched 12 miles from the tanker on wednesday 
said greene the oil had begun forming tar balls and greene said 
he could not determine where the balls might wash ashore or how 
soon 
salvage boats and coast guard ships were skimming the water and 
using containment booms to try to corral the slick the coast guard 
said winds picked up on the gulf hampering the booms work but 
that the choppier waters would help chemical dispersants sprayed 
over the spill 
six fireboats aimed a dozen streams of water on the rear of the 
ship leaving it shrouded in a cloud of steam and gray smoke 
in the afternoon crews tried using flamedousing foam on fire 
pockets in the engine room but as had been feared the fire flared 
up again and they returned to using water said coast guard chief 
petty officer todd nelson 
the reflash is a minor setback nelson said there is very 
little fire left on the ship 
meanwhile the coast guard said the texas land and water 
commissions can test a process that uses bacteria to eat oil on 
the mega borg spill provided the federal environmental protection 
agency approves a plan to be submitted thursday 
the rear of the mega borg has dropped more than 60 feet since 
the tanker caught fire and waves were washing over the deck 
an 825foot britishregistered tanker the vic bilh was 
standing by to transfer the remainder of the mega borgs cargo but 
coast guard officials have said that operation could be dangerous 
because the ship was listing slightly and crews might have to pump 
water into the holds to keep the vessel balanced 
the mega borg operated by mosvolds shipping of farsund norway 
was bound from palanca angola it was scheduled to travel to aruba 
after galveston 
elf trading inc a houston subsidiary of a french oil and gas 
company owned the cargo and said it would participate in the 
cleanup 
the mega borg was carrying more than three times as much oil as 
was spilled by the exxon valdez off alaska in march 1989 in the 
nations worst oil spill but authorities noted the oil spilled in 
alaska was heavy crude which doesnt dissipate nearly as rapidly 
as light crude

on most nights the nightingale the 
flying carpet and the king clamber along the rocky smugglers trail 
in the foothills of mount hermon between lebanon syria and israel 
carrying american cigarettes scotch whisky and electrical 
appliances for syria on their backs they run the gantlet of syrian 
and israeli soldiers dug in along a front that threads across the 
snowcapped 9200foot mountain 
on the return leg they carry diesel fuel from iran and other 
goods that are prized in lawless lebanon where civil war began in 
1975 and central authority collapsed long ago 
the nightingale the flying carpet and the king are mules 
specially trained for the sixhour trek on and around mount hermon 
where the borders of lebanon syria and israel intersect 
because of their special skills each mule is worth about 
3000 twice the average for a pack animal in southeast lebanon 
those skills include recognizing and running from anyone in 
military uniform and leading pack trains of up to 100 mules 
its a nomans land out there said adnan daher a 
16yearold smuggler the israelis are on a hill to the west the 
syrians on a hill to the east and lebanon behind us 
no accurate figures on the smuggling trade are available but 
diplomats in syria say it amounts to hundreds of millions of 
dollars a year 
shebaa a predominantly sunni moslem town in the 
israelioccupied sector of south lebanon has been a smugglers 
haven for decades the men of shebaa have traditionally defied 
authority 
about 5000 of shebaas original population of 200000 still 
live there said mohammed zoheiri a sprightly man of 90 who has 
been mukhtar or mayor for 45 years 
the others went to beirut other parts of lebanon or the 
oilrich persian gulf states because work opportunities are 
scarce here zoheiri said whlle sipping tea with visitors 
he said the mulers as he calls them have known no other 
way of making a living they were born on muleback 
some of his 40 grandsons are mulers as his own father was 
zoheiri said and added its shebaas profession 
over the border in syria is sirghaya the nerve center of syrian 
smugglers where half the 15000 people live off the contraband 
business 
theyd have to arrest the whole town if they wanted to stop 
us said a merchant in nearby madaya the main outlet for the 
smuggled goods he was unwrapping highheeled italian shoes that 
had just crossed the frontier 
although it costs money in lost tax revenue diplomats say the 
illegal trade also helps the troubled syrian economy 
a recent report by the us embassy in damascus said the 
offthebooks economy is both a sore point and a salvation the 
black market provides badly needed goods and in many ways keeps the 
economy going 
because of the steady flow of contraband the planners of 
syrias socialist economy do not have to divert precious foreign 
exchange for imports president hafez assads government generally 
turns a blind eye as long as the trade keeps to border towns 
diplomats in damascus said there even was a sizable illicit 
trade in goods from israel through the israelioccupied zone in 
south lebanon 
iron reinforcing bars and other building materials are 
particularly prized in syria the us embassy report said syrian 
construction workers would be out of jobs but for smuggled 
building materials 
daher the 16yearold smuggler from shebaa said after a recent 
nocturnal expedition we provide whatever our syrian partners 
demand 
he said the shebaa men hand over their loads to syrian mule 
trains 
each mule carries about 100 kilograms or 220 pounds each 
smuggler owns two mules and clears about 100 a week four times 
the average wage in lebanon 
syrian soldiers usually start intercepting us after the snow 
melts said a smuggler who identified himself only as ahmed we 
move to another unloading spot close to the israelicontrolled 
hill the syrians dont go there 
a few days earlier a syrian customs patrol fired on a pack 
train from shebaa and killed a mule but the smugglers escaped with 
the rest of their animals 
shebaa smugglers have 600 to 800 mules said amin a 51yearold 
who has been in the trade since boyhood 
its a dangerous profession but shebaas smugglers rarely get 
killed he said we know our way and the lead mules are well 
trained 
most shebaa men killed in recent years were victims of land 
mines he said 
amin said it takes up to three months to train a lead mule 
which should be big strong healthy and smart 
a mule chosen as a leader is kept in an isolated dark stable 
without food or water for two days he said 
then a man who shouldnt be a smuggler because the mule would 
get used to his smell goes in dressed as a soldier and beats the 
mule with a stick amin said a smuggler goes in after him and 
gives the mule food and water he said the soldier fires a 
rifle near the mule during the beating the soldier becomes the 
mules enemy he explained and the animal tries to escape the 
minute a soldier is seen or a bullet is fired at this point the 
mule becomes eligible to lead a caravan

there is a new home for the worst 
of the worst the most violent and escapeprone of californias 
92000 prison inmates it is pelican bay an eerie hightech 
prison within a prison that is touted as the nations most secure 
lockup 
its name ay make it sound like a resort but pelican bay is a 
stark silent xshaped place monitored by video cameras and 
microphones here more than 1000 prisoners live in a world of 
concrete and steel and silence confined to their 80squarefoot 
cells for 22 hours a day they are allowed out for a 90minute 
exercise period alone and without athletic equipment in a tiny 
concrete yard with 20foothigh walls 
the prisoners in the security housing unit the core of the 
pelican bay state prison are set apart from the rest of the prison 
population they live in eightcell pods one man to a cell 
each pod has its own adjacent exercise area 
the other inmates about 1700 in the general population are 
treated like conventional prisoners they have access to barbells 
and basketballs they eat in the prison kitchen and spend time in 
the day room with telephones and cable television they can 
have conjugal visits with spouses 
but the security housing unit prisoners exist in isolation 
these are the worst of the worst the ones who have shown they 
cant be managed safely said lt al deines a prison spokesman 
they have assaulted the staff or they have had heavy possession 
of drugs or they are verified members of gangs 
pelican bay opened its wellsecured doors seven months ago 
previously the states worst prisoners usually went to san quentin 
or folsom prisons places rich in the folklore of criminology but 
no longer adequate for the states huge prison population 
at pelican bay prisoners are shackled and flanked by two 
truncheonwielding officers every time they are moved outside their 
cells 
aside from that guards have little direct contact with the 
prisoners they open the sliding cell doors slabs of steel 
perforated with small holes by remote control pneumatics and 
they use loudspeakers to direct the inmates in and out except for 
the periodic sound of a door slamming or a voice on a speaker the 
security housing unit the shu is strangely quiet 
listen an officer tells a visitor what do you hear 
nothing its not like other prisons 
an armed guard in an enclosed glassandsteel control booth 
monitors groups of pods above the corridors a heavy mesh screen 
allows guards to walk overhead and the upper ceiling is laced with 
pipes that can spew water or tear gas in an emergency 
the design for the shu was patterned partly after a 700inmate 
prison in florence ariz but the pelican bay prison is larger 
with major differences in design warden charles marshall describes 
it as unique in the nation 
outside the gray gravel compound is as deserted as a 
ghosttown ringed by concentric chainlink fences topped with 
razor wire and armed guards although surrounded by californias 
lushest forests the fenced prison site has no shrubs no 
vegetation at all to break the line of sight 
the inner fence sounds an alarm at a touch in the ground just 
under the earth special sensor cables crisscross the prison 
grounds and will trigger an alarm if more than 40 pounds of 
pressure is applied the guards one each in 11 towers spaced 700 
feet apart are armed with 223caliber carbines 
the prison is a scant 50 yards from us 101 but invisible 
behind dense coastal forests there are no signs no marked 
turnoffs no direct access from the highway to the prison about 10 
miles south of the oregon line and four miles from the ocean 
occasionally passersby catch a glimpse of a guard tower through 
the trees and wander onto the grounds surrounding the compound to 
investigate the nearly quarterbilliondollar prison 
that makes the tower guards very nervous deines said

americas teaching force is aging and reformers 
fear the trend could thwart the drive toward school improvement 
during the last 20 years the average age of the nations 23 
million public school teachers rose from 36 to 41 according to 
statistics from the national education association unpublished 
data from the 1988 current population survey of the census bureau 
shows that 484 percent are 40 or older 
educators have usually invoked such statistics as evidence that 
mass teacher retirements lie ahead with no certainty that the 
profession is attractive enough to draw young recruits 
half to 54 percent of the nations teachers will be eligible for 
retirement by the year 2000 said jewell gould research director 
of the american federation of teachers 
this graying of the profession contains other worrisome 
messages several reformers believe age statistics suggest that a 
decade of school reform has been at least partly misdirected 
school reformers havent looked a lot at the fact that in a 
decade many of the teachers who will be in the schools are not 
there now said linda darlinghammond a professor at columbia 
teachers college and an authority on the teaching profession 
ernest l boyer president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching said the numbers mean the nation had 
better pay more heed to improving the training of the next 
generation of teachers he said this group will carry the burden of 
reform for years to come 
he said it was a mistake to focus almost exclusively on present 
teachers 
both older and younger teachers have to be considered but if 
i were to draw a conclusion id say we have been far too 
neglectful of educating the new generation of teachers who will be 
determining where schools will be going in the first quarter of the 
21st century said boyer in a recent interview 
darlinghammond added its generally easier to train a new 
teacher in reform techniques such as team teaching than it is to 
persuade a veteran teacher to break longcherished classroom habits 
some teacher colleges have begun to address these problems the 
holmes group a coalition of about 100 education schools 
interested in reform is fostering programs allowing student 
teachers to practice new techniques in public school classrooms 
several such programs have started recently in michigan for 
example 
the rise in the average age of teachers during the last two 
decades mirrors declining student enrollments and tight state 
school budgets those trends have been most pronounced in the 
midwest and northeast 
not all states keep teacher age data but a check of state 
departments of education and local union affiliates found the 
average age of teachers in connecticut for example is 433 in 
georgia 42 indiana 42 michigan 44 maryland 411 and new 
jersey 425 
the median age in new york was 424 as the 198889 school year 
and 251 percent of the teaching force is 49 or older 
in massachusetts suffering the effects of a decadeold tax 
revolt measure and a worsening budget crisis the average age is 47 
by contrast teachers in new mexico a sunbelt state with a 
growing student population average 377 
reformers concerned over average age emphasize they dont mean 
to belittle the skills of veteran teachers 
more experienced teachers are more productive they just wont 
make the mistakes a younger teacher would said gould 
nonetheless the age statistics lend urgency to the need to 
update the skills of veteran teachers and create more collegial 
environments in public schools said darlinghammond 
by and large teacher effectiveness increases during the first 
five to seven years of a career then levels off and may even 
decline whether that happens depends on the school environment 
collegial environments that have lots of opportunities to develop 
and learn help foster professional growth but thats not 
typical she said 
educators believe that school improvement is most likely to take 
root in schools with a balanced mix of young and old teachers 
from what i see whether or not a person is willing to take a 
look at innovative ideas has little to do with age said keith 
geiger president of the national education association i hear 
as many innovative ideas from 50 yearolds as 25 yearolds 
but statistics suggest that the balance has swung toward a 
heavier concentration of veteran teachers many of whom have seen 
reform waves come and go with little apparent effect and may be 
viewing current reform efforts skeptically 
i think all teachers want to be part of exciting changes 
boyer said but we have to ask which teachers will be prepared 
to harness technology will they be prepared to deal with an 
increasingly bilingual population will they be prepared to be 
creative and not just conforming

the 77yearold former hardline communist party chief and his 
wife margot have about 300000 east german marks in personal 
savings according to attorney friedrich wolff the west german 
newspaper die welt said 
it quoted wolff as saying the money was legally acquired and 
should be treated like the savings of other east germans 
west german marks will become the currency of east germany on 
july 2 when the nations merge their economies a key step in 
unification 
under a formula for replacing the nearly worthless east german 
mark older people would have savings of up to 6000 marks 
converted at a 1to1 rate and amounts higher than that at a 
2to1 rate 
honeckers money would be valued at 153000 west german marks 
90270 
honecker and other officials of the former communist regime 
toppled in october were taken to a police hospital in east berlin 
on may 28 
the mostly elderly exleaders are being examined to determine 
whether they are physically and mentally fit to be prosecuted for 
alleged crimes 
honecker is in failing health and had been in a soviet military 
hospital in the town of beelitz before he was brought to east 
berlin 
east german officials have changed signals several times on 
whether to prosecute members of the old guard most of the charges 
against honecker and other officials center on abuse of office and 
corruption party leaders are believed to have amassed large 
amounts of cash and property 
die welt said in tuesdays report that the government has begun 
criminal proceedings aimed at confiscating honeckers wealth 
making it unlikely the former party chief will be allowed to 
convert his cash 
wolff said he would file a claim for compensation on honeckers 
behalf unless the exleader is allowed to convert his savings 
he said he does not expect honecker to be prosecuted 
already today can i determine actual legal grounds for 
criminal prosecution are not apparent he was quoted as saying

abortion has emerged as one 
of the most emotional unification issues facing the germanys and 
people in both nations are debating which states abortion law 
should prevail 
west germany restricts abortions to three situtions medical 
necessity rape or incest and dire social or economic hardship in 
east germany first trimester abortions are performed costfree 
upon demand 
numbers reflect the widely varying laws 
in east germany with a population of 16 million 73000 
abortions were performed last year in west germany whose 
population is four times higher there were 75297 legal abortions 
east german doctors are prohibited from performing abortions on 
foreigners except in cases of emergency but pregnant west german 
women are already crossing the border hoping to take advantage of 
the looser law 
the two germanys plan to unite under the west german 
constitution as the quickest way to merge economic unity is to 
take place on july 2 and full union could come later this year 
the west german government led by chancellor helmut kohl says 
its constitution bars an abortion law such as east germanys 
the right of the unborn child to live is not open to question 
under our constitution said norbert greis a legal expert for 
west germanys christian social union the bavarian sister party to 
kohls christian democrats 
not everyone in kohls coalition agrees however 
west german justice minister hans engelhard has suggested two 
different abortion laws could exist for an interim period after 
unification the archconservative christian social union says that 
would be out of the question 
the west german social democrats say east germanys law is a 
good model for a united germanys abortion regulations arguing it 
places more importance on a womans rights 
women in east germany would certainly not abide seeing their 
longvalid abortion law fall victim to a harmonization of 
intergerman law said lawmaker renate schmidt a social democrat 
many east german women say hes right 
changing the abortion regulations would only bring trouble for 
us said a young pregnant east german woman registering for an 
abortion at a womens clinic in heiligenstadt a rural east german 
border town 
east germans are expected to face considerable economic hardship 
following unification because thousands of people are expected to 
lose their jobs and prices will soar many fear an abortion law 
like west germanys could increase the economic burden on families 
by forcing them to have unwanted children 
christa schmidt east germanys minister for family and womens 
affairs said she would not budge an inch on abortion rights 
although east german prime minister lothar de maiziere has not 
spoke out on the issue many members of his christian democratic 
union disagree with ms schmidt 
dr rudolf kessel chief doctor at the heiligenstadt clinic 
says he thinks east german women are too easygoing about abortions 
for a lot of women abortion is simply seen as a form of birth 
control especially in the big industrial cities this is the dark 
side of our law kessel said 
west germanys law passed in 1972 makes it extremely difficult 
for a woman to get an abortion those who request abortions on 
economic or social grounds must get two doctors to confirm their 
case is legitimate and must show proof of being counseled on 
adoption and welfare assistance 
in east germany a doctor can reject a request for an abortion 
only if the first 12 weeks of a pregnany have passed kessel said 
many west german women travel to the netherlands for abortions 
where the law is less strict some fear a type of abortion 
tourism will extend to east germany unless the nations bring 
their abortion laws into line 
abortion has long been a highly emotional issue in west germany 
last year the conviction of a prominent bavarian gynecologist 
caused a huge national stir and is still widely debated 
dr horst theissen found guilty by a bavarian court of failing 
to follow abortion guidelines was banned from practicing as a 
gynecologist for three years 
bavaria state predominantly catholic also tried 156 of 
theissens patients who were accused of having abortions under the 
hardship clause without proof of the required counseling most were 
fined up to 1600 
the trial resulted in charges among opposition politicians that 
west germanys abortion law was one of the most backward in 
europe 
abortion has not been such a heated issue in predominantly 
protestant east germany nonetheless there are strong 
antiabortion sentiments in roman catholic pockets such as 
heiligenstadt

the venerable times of london has bowed to the 
demands of a vulgar modern age revising its victorianera style 
guide to include such brash and contemporary language as the title 
ms 
the 205yearold newspaper whose readers tend to regard its 
eccentricities as a national treasure on the order of big ben 
introduced the usage changes in tuesdays editions 
editor simon jenkins tried to break the news gently 
the mirror that a newspaper holds up to the world is 
constantly smudged with jargon bad usage and verbosity wrote 
jenkins who took over in march a style guide is a periodic 
cleansing of that mirror 
the times style guide introduced at the turn of the century 
was last revamped in the mid1960s 
there were regular updates but the guide remained terribly 
restrictive and quite victorian said literary editor philip 
howard who helped write the new guide 
even so he was quick to point out it was very magnificent 
with high standards 
the old style guide was replete with arcane treasures such as 
the times singular spelling of mikhail s gorbachov its 
rendering of the soviet leaders name was based on its 
transliteration of the cyrillic letters 
our russian specialists know that our spelling is better but 
if the rest of the world spells it another way ours looks very 
odd howard said were right but were wrong 
so from now on its gorbachev 
under the old style the times referred to leonardo da vincis 
masterpiece as the monna lisa a spelling that might seem to 
some as mysterious as the ladys smile it will revert to mona 
lisa 
the old times style book said that one should always spell 
monna lisa with two ns to show that we are gents and that we 
know that it comes from monna which is derived from the italian 
madonna said howard 
but that and other displays of erudition he conceded also 
came to look very odd 
the times is under siege from more than modern usage 
circulation dropped to 434389 in daily sales this spring compared 
with 442109 a year previously 
a new highbrow newspaper the independent was started 3 years 
ago and is fast closing in on the times with daily sales of 416200 
under the new style guide there were changes in courtesy titles 
for both men and women 
from now on ms will be automatically used in times news 
columns for american women for the rest of womanhood it will be 
trotted out on special request 
the times is bracing for some flak over that one 
when ms is used in the times we get angry letters often 
written by women who want to know what is that vulgar new word and 
how do you pronounce it said howard author of we thundered 
out 200 years of the times 17851985 
howard thinks use of ms will make journalists jobs easier 
however 
it is awkward for a reporter to have to go up to a woman after 
a lecture and ask her if she is married howard said a younger 
woman is likely to tell them to mind their own business and they 
may get a clip around the ears with a handbag 
the associated press stylebook style guide for many us 
newspapers prescribes using ms before a womans last name if 
she prefers it 
the times is also dropping courtesy titles on first reference 
something certain to disappoint readers who enjoyed such prim 
designations as mr ringo starr 
on subsequent reference most people continue to get a title 
except criminals artists athletes and the long dead 
some modern words introduced in earlier revisions of the style 
guide have now come to seem dated the hippies of the 60s who 
gathered for summer solstice celebrations at the 4000yearold 
stonehenge monument in southern england have become travelers 
in the modern times 
the words of a generation ago like hippie sound absurdly 
oldfashioned said howard newspapers have a duty to use the 
language of the current generation 
the new guide also has a blacklist words that slip into 
journalese as a form of obfuscation and circumlocution and 
gobbledygook he said 
these include problem provision very issue accommodate 
crisis interesting and situation especially crisis 
situation and probe 
words like probe should be confined to stories about 
surgeons he said

tiny minis brisk bike tights and beautifully cut 
jackets set the pace for the chanel cruise wear shown in the 
original rue cabon salon where coco herself once presided 
it was chanels first show devoted to cruise wear though we 
have been making it for years said chanels designer karl 
lagerfeld 
this was my idea to have an intimate lunch show to launch the 
betweenseason clothes and set them off he said at a catered 
champagne lunch after the show tuesday 
top couture seamstress directors work better when they know 
theyll be admired by the press and a larger audience not just in 
a showroom he added 
the line of clothes for cruising whether aboard a boat in 
the street or at polo clubs looked like sharp versions of what 
lagerfeld has been doing for a couple of seasons at chanel for 
whom he has been head designer since 1983 
he topped most of them with beautiful oversized boater hats 
neat and put together well they looked angled to sell they 
ranged from beautifully cut navy shantung jackets with patch 
pockets to little robinsegg blue or tearose pink boucle suits 
the details were sharply etched 
the lateday wear featured some beautifully classic 
blackandwhite outfits in crepe de chine and pleated shortie 
chiffon skirts lagerfelds original vision of chanel of yore 
he also featured his current favorite shades of hot coral peach 
and soft wisteria for next winters sunny resort wear 
for those with great figures the skintight navy jersey sailor 
suits with middystyle tops were worn with goldbuttoned bermuda or 
corsairlength clinging pants 
the only criticism was that it all looked terribly junior miss 
even in beautiful boucle tweed suits featuring raspberry or lime 
plaids fine for young girls and older sophisticates like audrey 
hepburn but perhaps a bit flighty for the likes of french 
politicians wives who often favor chanel 
many women can wear these clothes said lagerfeld hinting 
that perhaps a few skirts will come out longer in the boutiques 
lagerfeld himself wore a blazer and tie with a cameo tie clip 
his usual ponytail and dark glasses by christian dior 
the little chanel trapezeline coats with their doublebreasted 
gold button effects and the light pink poplin pants suits evoked 
luxury cruise liners in 1958 when lagerfeld was a teenager 
learning design in paris 
but the traditional quality was there as well and chanel was 
proud to show it off up close 
the cruise line wear is not cheap outfits will be in the 
2000plus range on a par with the readytowear 
with lagerfeld at the helm the worlds most copied house is 
stil keeping a jump ahead of the ripoff artists

east germanys leading political party has 
called for both german states to elect a single government in 
december 
the christian democrat caucus in parliament said tuesday that it 
would seek to have lawmakers vote on german unification this summer 
and that allgerman elections should be held no later than 
middecember 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany has been pressing for 
allgerman elections in december in place of the west german 
elections set for dec 2 
east germany held its first free elections on march 18 ending 
four decades of communist rule 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere the leader of the 
christian democrats has been noncommittal about holding december 
elections 
de maiziere was on a state visit to the united states on 
tuesday but guenther krause leader of the christian democratic 
faction in parliament said de maiziere favored the proposal 
krause said the christian democrats would soon begin talks on 
the proposal with other parties in their governing coalition which 
includes the leftleaning social democrats 
the east germany social democratic leader wolfgang thierse 
said his party opposes the elections because details of unification 
must first be worked out 
social democrats in both countries favor a slower pace for 
reunification while the conservative christian democrats have been 
seeking to move the process as quickly as possible 
many analysts believe kohl the leader of west germanys 
christian democrats would make a stronger showing in an allgerman 
balloting than in west german elections 
east germanys christian democrats enjoy a larger margin of 
support than their counterparts in west germany

trouble with zoning authorities for taking in homeless mothers said 
tuesday she would close down the operation and seek approval to run 
it as a shelter 
in a letter to this southwestern connecticut towns zoning 
enforcment officer donna russell said she was ready to comply with 
the dec 15 order banning her from operating her lakefront home as

the order on the understanding that she and her 18yearold son 
daniel will not be fined and that no further action will be taken 
against them if she complies within a reasonable time 
last week officials warned that russells son the legal owner 
of the house faced arrest on a misdemeanor charge of violating 
local zoning ordinances if the matter remained unresolved 
russell asked in her letter that she be given time to find 
alternate housing for the two women currently living in her home 
the town issued its december ceaseanddesist order after local 
officials concluded that russell was operating a homeless shelter 
in violation of local zoning law the law requires that 
threequarters of the people living in a single family dwelling be 
related by blood marriage or adoption 
in her letter russell wrote i still believe that the towns 
actions against me were unfair and unconstitutional

texas banks are back in the black after more 
than four years of steady losses while oncethriving massachusetts 
institutions have become the industrys biggest moneylosers 
nationally commercial banks earned 62 billion in the first 
three months of 1990 the federal deposit insurance corp said 
tuesday the performance except for a sharp earnings dip in the 
last half of 1989 was in line with bank profits over the past two 
years 
but the overall performance masked dramatic turnarounds in some 
states 
texas banks which lost 42 million during the first quarter of 
1989 turned a profit of 164 million in the first quarter of this 
year it was their first quarter in the black since the last 
quarter of 1985 
massachusetts banks went the other direction they earned 202 
million in the first quarter last year but lost 171 million in the 
januarymarch 1990 period the worst loss of any state the other 
states to post losses were new hampshire and rhode island which 
border massachusetts and arizona 
economists said the reversal was telling evidence of the 
phenomenon of rolling recessions that have moved from region to 
region while the economy nationally has expanded for more than 
seven years 
one of the characteristics of the 1980s was the rolling 
recession said james j mcdermott jr an analyst with keefe 
bruyette amp woods a new york securities firm now we are having 
rolling recoveries as well 
as banks in the northeast experience pressure banks in the 
southwest are showing signs of stability and in some cases slight 
improvement 
the problems in both texas and massachusetts stem from sharp 
drops in real estate values but now texas real estate is 
recovering as new englands declines 
in massachusetts 922 percent of banks real estate loans were 
delinquent in the first three months of 1990 up from 689 percent 
in the previous quarter in texas the delinquency rate fell from 
1034 percent to 676 percent 
the fdic said much of the improvement in texas however could 
be attributed to the agencys bank rescues 
absent government assistance there are no indicators yet of a 
strong performance rebound by texas banks it said 
economists said tough action by regulators forcing new england 
banks to take losses this year could benefit them in the long run 
1990 is going to be a down year for a lot of banks but its 
conceivable if we get through 1990 without a significant weakening 
of the economy that they could resume healthy growth said robert 
litan of the brookings institution a washingtonbased think tank 
fdic chairman l william seidman characterized bank performance 
nationally as not a bad result given all the publicity given to 
real estate problems 
but analysts said it would take a downturn at only a few large 
banks to cause trouble for the insurance fund which posted 
backtoback losses in 1988 and 1989 even if most of the industry 
is healthy 
the fdic can still lose its shirt on the bottom 10 percent in 
fact it can lose everything its wearing and everything in the 
house litan said 
the percentage of banks losing money rose to 1015 in the first 
quarter from 912 percent in the fourth quarter of 1989

government officials say attorney general dick 
thornburgh acted within the law in heading discussions on revising 
the clean air act even though 20 percent of his assets are in 
stocks affected by the legislation 
president bush granted ethicslaw waivers to thornburgh last 
spring so the attorney general could head domestic policy council 
discussions leading to proposals to amend the clean air act 
administration officials said 
thornburgh needed the waivers because he held 149827 in stocks 
and bonds in 12 major industrial and oil companies and a public 
utility alvin a schall a thornburgh aide said tuesday 
these holdings amounted to 20 percent of the attorney generals 
assets of 722083 schall said 
federal conflictofinterest law bars highranking government 
officials from participating in decisions that would affect them 
personally 
but the law allows for granting waivers if the financial 
interest is not so substantial or was too remote or too 
inconsequential to affect the integrity of government officers or 
employees services 
you probably could make a pretty good argument that it isnt 
even necessary to get a waiver but just to be safe we did 
schall said 
he said the cleanair waivers were sought even though there was 
only a very attenuated relationship between any action the 
council might take on cleanair issues and the value of 
thornburghs investments 
the office of government ethics did not object to the waivers 
deputy director donald campbell said 
the statute allows the appointing authority in this case the 
president to find that a financial holding is not so substantial 
and significant as to affect performance campbell said 
if he was taking action that would specifically affect one of 
those companies a waiver is not the way to resolve it he added 
thornburgh obtained the cleanair waivers in may 1989 when the 
domestic policy council which he chairs was considering acid 
rain toxic emissions from factories and ozone pollution 
the attorney generals investments covered by the two waivers 
included holdings in four oil companies amoco corp atlantic 
richfield mobil corp and shell oil co and general motors 
general electric and westinghouse 
the other affected holdings were investments in wisconsin public 
service corp arco chemical corp black amp decker corp ppg 
industries inc procter amp gamble co and eastman kodak co 
the waiver for acidrain covered the wisconsin utility in which 
thornburgh has less than a 5000 investment the investments cited 
for a potential conflictofinterest in discussion of 
toxicemission issues amounted to 16 percent of the attorney 
generals assets holdings implicated by the ozone issue amounted 
to 4 percent of thornburghs assets schall said 
according to the financial statement thornburgh filed last 
month those holdings were worth between 109000 and 365000 or 
37 percent of an investment portfolio valued between 287000 and 
977000 
the financial disclosure law requires federal officials to 
report only broad ranges in the value of their stock and bond 
holdings schall provided the details on the value of the stock in 
oil and industrial companies at the time the waiver was granted 13 
months ago 
at that time thornburgh calculated the value of the affected 
holdings according to their current market value schall said 
thornburgh was also granted a waiver to participate in the 
drafting of legislation to ease antitrust restrictions to encourage 
the formation of jointproduction ventures schall said 
thornburgh cited holdings in american telephone amp telegraph co 
and international business machines corp as posing a potential 
conflict of interest the attorney generals holdings in each of 
the two companies is valued between 5000 and 15000 according 
to his latest financial disclosure statement 
the waiver to help write jointproduction legislation was sought 
because both atampt and ibm are involved in the research involving 
highdefinition television schall said 
thornburgh has shunned involvement in a number of issues because 
of his financial holdings

national organization for woman 
it puts us into a subhuman level places women into a thing 
mode bruce said in a telephone interview 
the june edition of esquire devotes several articles to wives 
and lists the twelve virtues of the perfect wife which 
describes the ideal woman as obedient thrifty and reverent 
now and the feminist majority urged members and supporters to 
mount a letterwriting and telephone campaign against esquire the 
groups also urged subscribers to cancel and advertisers to withdraw 
their ads

president bushs string of successful vetoes 
remains unbroken but democrats are maneuvering for a second chance 
to force an amtrak aid bill into law over his objections 
bush emerged tuesday with the 11th veto of his term intact after 
democrats failed by three votes to muster the twothirds majority 
needed to override the presidents veto of a bill to support the 
rail service 
the president vetoed the 2 billion authorization bill last 
month because it also would have required that the interstate 
commerce commission approve acquisitions of major freight railroads 
by nonrailroad companies 
republicans promised during tuesdays debate that bush would 
support a substitute bill continuing support for the passenger rail 
service as long as the regulatory provision is omitted 
if they send us the bill without the icc provision hell sign 
it white house spokesman steve hart said after the 6436 vote 
sixtyseven votes were needed democrats will really only need 
to find two votes however since one of the 36 votes was that of 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
despite his desire to override the veto mitchell voted with 35 
republicans to sustain it since he was on the winning side 
mitchell is able under senate rules to call for a second vote if 
democrats can find the two extra votes needed to override 
those two votes will have to be republicans since all 55 
democrats in the senate have come out for the override there is no 
deadline for the second vote 
party pride was at stake said sen j james exon dneb 
i hope that we can get back not to whats nice for the party 
but what is right for america he said overriding this veto is 
certainly right for america and its transportation needs 
despite the victory it was the closest veto fight for bush so 
far in the house last week 58 republicans joined 236 democrats in 
voting to override the amtrak veto it was the first time either 
chamber had voted against the president a twothirds majority is 
needed in both chambers to override a veto 
republicans have introduced bills in both chambers to authorize 
federal spending for amtrak but without the regulatory provision 
that prompted the veto the senate version was introduced on the 
floor tuesday night by sen conrad burns rmont 
the bush administration and the reagan administration before it 
proposed to eliminate money for amtrak from all their budget 
requests the bill bush vetoed was not a funding bill but rather an 
authorization bill that means it gave congress permission to 
appropriate funds later for specific purposes 
the icc already must approve any sale of one railroad to 
another but supporters of the vetoed bill say the jurisdiction is 
needed over acquisitions by nonrailroad companies to prevent 
against the dismantling of railroad assets to pay for the takeovers 
what we want to avoid is a situation where people come in and 
buy the railroad and then just dismember it said sen paul 
simon dill 
in his veto message bush called the proposed icc oversight an 
unwarranted regulatory roadblock to the financial restructuring of 
the railroad industry

although theyve been whipped in each and 
every veto showdown with president bush congressional democrats 
are showing no inclination to stay down on the mat for the 10count 
as the senate sustained bushs veto of bill to authorize 2 
billion for amtrak rail passenger service the house set up a veto 
fight with the white house over how much federal workers can 
participate in political campaigns 
by an overwhelming 33487 vote the house on tuesday rebuffed 
the administrations latest veto threat and sent bush a bill to 
allow federal workers to take an active role in partisan politics 
for the first time in more than half a century 
ninety or more than half of the houses 176 republicans 
including gop leader robert michel of illinois bolted from the 
administration in joining with 244 democrats to approve the changes 
in the 1939 hatch act 
the senate passed the same bill by a potentially vetooverriding 
6730 vote last month but gop leaders there have expressed 
confidence they can persuade enough colleagues to change votes to 
sustain a veto 
to win a veto fight bush must garner more than a third of the 
votes in either the house or senate as he did tuesday with 36 of 
the senates 100 members voted to sustain his veto of the amtrak 
bill 
in an effort to avoid another veto fight over the hatch law 
which outlaws most political activities for 3 million civil service 
and postal workers house leaders agreed to accept a senate version 
less onerous to the administration but still opposed by top 
administration aides 
many supporters of the changes had expressed a willingness to 
yield even further such as maintaining the current prohibitions 
for employees of intelligence agencies if the administration 
would only negotiate with them 
but attorney general dick thornburgh said in a letter tuesday 
that he and other senior advisers to bush oppose any change in the 
51yearold hatch law and would recommend that the president veto 
the bill 
such a reversal in the role of partisan politics in the ethic 
of public service would permit virtually unbridled partisan 
activities by federal employees thornburgh wrote 
unlike the original house bill last year the measure that 
congress is sending to bush retains current prohibitions against 
federal workers running for partisan office or soliciting campaign 
funds from the public 
if enacted government employees could begin holding office in 
local state and national political party organizations for the 
first time and solicit campaign funds from coworkers on behalf of 
federal employee union political action committees but only when 
not working 
the original house version approved by an overwhelming 29790 
vote in april 1989 would have allowed government workers to take 
leaves of absence to run for partisan office and solicit campaign 
funds from anyone 
we are not advocating the grey masses rising up in a 
coup said rep william ford dmich a sponsor of the bill 
were only asking for the simple right to put up a yard sign 
display a bumper sticker send a check or stuff envelopes 
the hatch law was enacted at the height of the new deal to 
protect a thenemerging professional civil service from being 
coerced by political appointees to contribute to or work on behalf 
of candidates 
opponents of changing the law argued that its protections 
against a spoils system are still needed

the new rightwing government says it will 
spend more on jewish settlements in the occupied lands and wont 
promise not to settle soviet jews there positions bound to set it 
on a collision course with washington 
also tuesday a member of the cabinets defense committee said 
israel should deport the leaders of the 30monthold palestinian 
uprising in the west bank and gaza strip 
washington opposes both deportations and jewish settlement in 
lands captured from arab countries in the 1967 middle east war it 
also has urged israel to show restraint in dealing with the 
uprising 
in the latest uprisingrelated violence israeli troops pursuing 
palestinian stonethrowers fired tear gas into a un clinic in 
gaza city tuesday and 66 infants and toddlers were treated for 
inhaling the fumes the army said 
in jerusalem a 17yearold jewish seminary student going to 
prayers at the western wall was stabbed twice in the stomach he 
was reported in fair condition at a jerusalem hospital 
on the new governments first working day it was criticized by 
israeli newspapers across the political spectrum as well as by 
arab leaders 
the coalition is made up of 10 rightist and religious factions 
and led by the likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak shamir 
parliament approved the government on monday 
the independent haaretz daily wrote that shamirs proposed 
polices will only worsen israels international isolation the 
leftleaning al hamishar said they would cause further incitement 
among the palestinian population 
the conservative maariv daily wrote that no government in the 
countrys history was born of greater sin than the present one 
shamirs coalition was built with the help of defectors lured by 
promises of cabinet posts and money 
in cairo the egyptian government said in a statement that 
israel has apparently begun to prepare for aggression and war 
official cairo radio said president hosni mubarak telephoned 
president bush to discuss developments in the middle east but gave 
no further details egypt is the only arab state to have signed a 
peace treaty with israel 
in jordan king hussein called the new israeli government a 
dangerous threat and in syria israels bitter enemy 
president hafez assad warned of a new war with the jewish state and 
said such a confrontation would be bloodier than any of the 
previous wars 
relations between israel and washington have been troublesome 
since shamir prodded by foreign minister david levy and fellow 
hardliner ariel sharon rejected a proposal by secretary of state 
james a baker iii for preliminary peace talks between israelis and 
palestinians in cairo 
ties have also been burdened by the steppedup settlement 
activity fostered by shamirs outgoing caretaker government 
despite sharp objections from president bush 
the bush administration has demanded a halt to all settlements 
and specifically called for assurances that israel not settle 
soviet jewish immigrants in the occupied lands 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has also hinted he might 
slow jewish emigration unless israel promises not to settle soviet 
jews in the occupied lands 
more than 51000 soviet jews have arrived since last year and 
about 3700 of them have settled in the west bank and 
israeliannexed arab east jerusalem which were seized in the 1967 
middle east war along with the gaza strip 
sharon rejected the superpower demands tuesday saying israel 
was a democracy and could not tell its citizens where to live 
i dont think israel has to make any declarations israel 
doesnt need any document of honesty he said after taking office 
as housing minister and head of the ministerial committee on 
immigration 
levy a hardline likud member and a key campaigner against us 
middle east peace proposals said tuesday that he would try to 
patch up strained relations with washington but he did not 
elaborate 
also the director general of the interior ministry dov kehat 
met with jewish settlers in the gaza strip and promised his office 
would allocate more money to expand the settlements 
ministry spokeswoman tova eilinson said the money would go 
toward improving the infrastructure in gush katif area comprising 
15 settlements for 3500 people along the mediterranean coast 
agriculture minister rafi eitan a member of the cabinets 
defense committee told army radio that more palestinians should be 
deported 
i have said many times that the punishment of deportations is 
the most effective and most humane he said instead of 
shooting at children you have to deport those responsible the 
inciters the organizers 
israel has deported 60 palestinians since the start of the 
uprising drawing sharp criticism from the united states which 
says the practice violates international human rights conventions 
since the rebellion began 717 palestinians have been killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians and 45 israelis have also died in 
the violence

is the cold war over mikhail gorbachev and 
ronald reagan say yes george bush suggests no a difference of 
opinion more like a difference of semantics says bush 
humpty dumpty in lewis carrolls through the looking glass 
tells alice when i use a word it means just what i choose it 
to mean neither more nor less 
dumpty would fit right in as a speechwriter at the bush white 
house where words often mean only what the president wants them to 
convey if they mean more or less to somebody else he might 
dismiss the discrepancy as a matter of semantics 
i see this glass not half empty but half full and more 
bush said recently of ussoviet differences 
phrases like and more send aides scurrying to interpret 
embellish and put an official white house spin on the presidential 
remarks 
so is the cold war over or not 
gorbachev proclaimed after last weeks superpower summit that 
the cold war was indeed over even former president reagan who 
once referred to the soviet union as the evil empire appeared 
to agree 
in an oped page column in the new york times earlier this week 
reagan wrote let us assume the cold war is over although that 
in itself does not mean we can afford to dismantle our defenses 
bush however was not willing to go even that far he told a 
political audience in des moines iowa that agreements reached at 
his summit with gorbachev could lead to the beginning of the end 
of the cold war 
does that mean that bush thinks the cold war is still being 
fought and do he and gorbachev disagree on so central an issue to 
ussoviet relations 
i dont know the president said weve got a difference 
of semantics dont we 
bush would not be pinned down on whether he thought the cold war 
was over for his own reasons he was not joining gorbachev and 
reagan in their more upbeat assessments 
weve got to wait and see how we can resolve all these 
problems out here he continued there are plenty of them 
around 
just what did bush mean a reporter asked recently when he 
suggested that gorbachev had shown willingness to peacefully 
resolve the lithuanian crisis while saying officials of the 
rebellious baltic republic had only shown some willingness to 
compromise 
youre presenting me with some semantic difference that i did 
not intend to make the president replied 
in cases involving sensitive policy issues bush often chooses 
his words very carefully despite his reputation for fractured 
syntax either to clarify or obscure his meaning 
thus the candidate who told americans to read my lips no new 
taxes was able to convene a budget summit with congress by 
promising no preconditions 
surely that meant the administration was signaling it would 
consider tax increases or did it 
bush never did say even though he once scolded read all the 
tea leaves listen to the nuances its out there very clearly 
it was a matter of semantics too that enabled the president to 
defend his decision to send national security adviser brent 
scowcroft on a secret mission to china despite his own ban on 
highlevel exchanges 
scowcrofts visit soon after the tiananmen square massacre that 
produced the ban was not an exchange it was a contact and 
thus not covered by the edict bush said when the mission was 
disclosed last year 
the president also redefines almost daily his rule against 
answering questions at photo opportunities 
bush cites his rule as grounds for ignoring questions shouted at 
him by reporters except when he wants to answer a question then 
he modifies the rule recasts it or totally ignores it 
on tuesday bush added a new twist 
no answers only those wearing hats get their question 
answered he announced it was his 66th birthday and some 
reporters wore childrens party hats to a picturetaking session 
between bush and congressional leaders 
in the wonderland of presidential semantics its often up to 
chief white house spokesman marlin fitzwater to bridge the gap 
between what is said and what is meant 
for instance on monday he was asked whether bush was near a 
decision on cutting off talks with the palestine liberation 
organization to protest the may 30 attack by palestinian guerrillas 
on an israeli beach 
the president had no timetable for such a decision 
fitzwater said 
but moments earlier vice president dan quayle had condemned the 
plo and had told an audience of jewish leaders that bush would make 
the right decision and make it soon 
soon is totally consistent with no timetable fitzwater 
deadpanned

about half the american people believe the 
incurably ill and those hopelessly wracked with pain have a moral 
right to commit suicide according to a survey described as 
relevant to suicide doctor jack kevorkians case 
but an expert on the legal aspects of medical ethics says 
patients have absolutely no right to demand that a physician 
assist them in ending their lives 
thou shalt not kill still stands in this society 
especially for doctors susan m wolf a lawyer with the hastings 
center a research institute that studies medical ethics said in a 
telephone interview from briaircliff manor ny 
the poll conducted for the times mirror center for the people 
and the press showed that 49 percent of the public believe a 
person with an incurable disease has a moral right to commit 
suicide it said 55 percent believe in such a right for people 
suffering great pain with no hope of improvement 
the telephone poll of 1213 adults was conducted during the 
first week in may about a month before kevorkian touched off a 
furor by assisting in the suicide of a 54yearold woman who had 
been diagnosed as being in the early stages of alzheimers disease 
diane colasanto a researcher for the times mirror center said 
the survey did not include any questions about physicianassisted 
suicide but added i think what we found is relevant to the 
kevorkian case 
kevorkian a retired pathologist in pontiac mich created an 
intravenous device that he hooked up to janet adkins of portland 
ore at her request it allowed mrs adkins to press a button that 
fed coma and deathinducing drugs into her bloodstream 
kevorkian has not been charged and prosecutors say it may take 
up to two months to get results of toxicological studies of the 
dead womans brain to determine whether the alzheimers diagnosis 
was correct in the meantime circuit judge alice gilbert has 
ordered him to stop using his suicide machine and to refrain from 
doing anything else to help patients take their own lives 
the kevorkian case has demonstrated that there still is a lot 
of confusion among three very different things one being the right 
of a patient to commit suicide ms wolf said 
this question she said is distinct from whether a physician 
should be authorized to assist in a suicide and from the 
completely separate question of whether treatment should be 
terminated at the patients request 
the supreme court is expected to rule on the latter issue soon 
in the case of nancy cruzan 31 of carterville mo who suffered 
severe brain damage in a 1983 automobile accident her parents joe 
and joyce cruzan want doctors to remove a feeding tube from her 
stomach 
the feeding tube removal presented by the cruzan case has 
caused a lot of controversy in part because when you pull a 
feeding tube it is foreseeable often that the patient will indeed 
die said ms wolf 
however she said when a clinician honors a patients request 
to be free of an unwanted treatment he is essentially letting 
nature take its course 
there is a long history with ancient roots to the notion that 
people are entitled to be free of unwanted bodily invasion she 
said on the other hand people have absolutely no right to demand 
that a clinician assist them in suicide 
the times mirror poll showed that eight of 10 americans think 
patients should be allowed to die in some circumstances eight in 
10 also approved of state laws allowing medical treatment for a 
terminally ill patient to be withdrawn or withheld if that is what 
the patient wishes 
the poll was conducted may 15 the times mirror center an arm 
of the times mirror publishing and broadcasting organization said 
it was subject to a possible error of three percentage points 
either way because of sampling and other random effects

the united states could be damaging its world 
position in high technology by falling behind in development of 
highdefinition television congressmen say 
the message is clear congress and the administration get 
moving said rep mel levine dcalif we must recognize the 
huge significance of hdtv to our economy 
a report issued tuesday by the office of technology assessment 
a research arm of congress said the united states lags behind 
japan in development of hdtv japan considers hdtv to be an 
important step into the future information society it said 
highdefinition television promises motion picturequality 
images and compact discquality sound proponents say its 
development could help reenergize the us electronics and 
computer industries 
new consumer electronics have long spurred advances in other 
fields such as data storage and defense industries said levine 
and reps george brown dcalif and don ritter rpa 
little work has been done in the united states on developing 
hdtv the report said zenith is the only usowned company that 
still manufactures television sets 
but the japanese have been selling studio equipment for 
highdefinition television since 1984 and are gearing up for 
largescale production of hdtv sets for consumers the report said 
the little work done on hdtv in the united states has largely 
been by or for foreignowned consumer electronics firms or by 
small underfunded university programs and entrepreneurs it said 
a pentagon agency charged with hdtv development the 
highresolution systems task force received 10 million this year 
for advanced tv research the task force wants 100 million a year 
brown who requested the report said at a news conference we 
cannot afford to be left behind in hdtv development and the other 
technologies it can aid 
by our refusing to mount a national hdtv effort we are 
assuring ourselves a dangerously diminished global economic 
position levine said 
ritter said he believed the bush administration was starting to 
do a lot more listening to calls that it get behind hdtv 
development 
the federal communications commission has received a number of 
proposals by companies to set the national standard for hdtv 
broadcasts the systems are to be tested for 12 to 18 months before 
the government chooses the standard in 1993 
no one knows how well highdefinition tvs would sell in the 
united states the ota report said but the potential market value 
is large 
the electronic industries association estimates the market could 
total 12 billion a year in 1988 dollars by 2003 4 billion 
more than the market would be for standard tv sets 
commercial and industrial uses also could be important ota 
said manufacturing technologies developed for hdtv would aid 
producers of computers and telecommunications equipment it said 
the government also would benefit the report said noting that 
the federal aviation administration already has contracted with the 
sony corp to buy highresolution display screens to monitor air 
traffic

the nations shrunken wheat inventory is 
expected to increase sharply as farmers move into a bumper harvest 
according to the latest agriculture department forecasts 
but the important 1990 corn crop is still being planted and it 
will be a couple of months before firm yield estimates are ready 
winter wheat production was estimated tuesday at a nineyear 
high of 209 billion bushels that was down fractionally from the 
may forecast but still 44 percent more than last years 
droughtbattered harvest of 145 billion bushels 
figures released by the departments agricultural statistics 
board showed the decline from the may forecast was only about 01 
percent or less than 24 million bushels 
the average yield based on indications as of june 1 was 
estimated at 412 bushels per acre compared with 411 bushels 
indicated last month and the 1989 yield of 351 bushels 
farmers are expected to harvest fewer than 507 million acres 
down from 508 million indicated in may 
wet conditions have caused yield declines in the mississippi 
delta area the report said early harvested fields in arkansas 
had low test weights and diseases are a problem 
the missouri crop is developing late with about 23 percent 
turning color in the ripening process as of june 3 
approximately 10 days behind the usual pace the report said 
in kansas winter wheat production was estimated at 4602 
million bushels unchanged from the may forecast and more than 
double the shriveled 1989 harvest of 2136 million bushels 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the next year 
it accounts for about threefourths of the us total wheat 
production the remainder is planted in the spring 
the usdas first official estimate of 1990 production of all 
wheat will be issued july 12 the first estimates for corn 
soybeans and some other major springplanted crops are scheduled 
for aug 9 along with revised figures for wheat 
no official estimates of total 1990 wheat output based on field 
surveys were included 
however department analysts in a related report did project 
highly tentative 1990 production of all wheat at almost 269 
billion bushels up from fewer than 204 billion bushels last year 
and virtually unchanged from the may projection 
projections for all wheat and some other crops were based on 
yield trends and an assumption the crop would have normal weather 
the remainder of the growing season 
the 1990 corn harvest was projected at 81 billion bushels up 
from 753 billion harvested last year and unchanged from may 
soybean production was projected at 1925 billion bushels also 
unchanged from last month and virtually the same as the crop of 
1927 billion bushels in 1989 
according to the supplyanddemand report the us wheat 
stockpile was drained to a 15year low of 452 million bushels on 
june 1 the beginning of the new wheat marketing year but with the 
expected larger 1990 harvest the wheat stockpile could be rebuilt 
to about 772 million bushels a year from now 
the projected larger 1990 wheat harvest is putting pressure on 
market prices which were indicated in both may and june in the 
range of 290 to 330 per bushel in 199091 compared with an 
estimated 371 last season 
if corn production turns out at the projected level of 81 
billion bushels it still wouldnt be quite enough to match 
domestic and export demand the report showed thus the us corn 
stockpile which may be around 128 billion bushels next fall 
could edge lower by oct 1 1991 
corn prices were projected at 235 to 275 per bushel in 
199091 compared with the current seasons forecast of 235 to 
240 per bushel that was up 10 cents per bushel from last months 
199091 projection 
soybeans were indicated at an average of 625 per bushel in the 
199091 marketing year that begins sept 1 compared with 570 
this season that was unchanged from may 
other june crop estimates included 
oranges 184 million boxes up 3 percent from may prospects but 
down 12 percent from last season 
peach production including california clingstones 213 
billion pounds down 9 percent from last year the california 
clingstone crop at 1 billion pounds is up 1 percent from 1989 
barlett pear production in the pacific coast states 545000 
tons up 4 percent from last year 
sweet cherry production in the western states 131000 tons 
down 22 percent from last year 
almond output a record 670 million pounds up 37 percent from 
last year 
spring potato production 238 million hundredweight up 14 
percent from the 1989 harvest

with better reporting systems international 
health experts have a clearer view of the aids epidemic as it 
spreads around the world but they dont like what theyre seeing 
in developing countries 
the global balance of hiv infection is rapidly tipping toward 
the developing countries said michael merson director of the 
world health organization global program on aids 
these countries currently account for about half of the 6 
million to 8 million people worldwide infected with the 
aidscausing human immunodeficiency virus or hiv by the end of 
the decade their share will probably increase to 70 percent to 80 
percent and possibly to 90 percent in 2010 according to figures 
who released tuesday 
whats going to happen in this decade is that aids will 
continue to increase in africa primarily in countries that dont 
have large rates of infection now merson said in an interview 
in addition were starting to see considerable increases in 
asian countries and south american countries and also in the 
caribbean 
part of the reason for the fasterthanexpected spread of hiv in 
these countries is that the limited data available previously made 
accurate predictions difficult and better reporting systems are now 
in place said dr david brandlingbennett of the pan 
americanworld health organization 
however officials have documented an alarming increase in hiv 
infection in thailand and are unsure why it is spreading so 
quickly he said 
in that asian country the number of people who have been 
infected and their cases reported to authorities rose from about 
1000 in 1987 to 50000 currently merson said he added that only 
about onethird of actual cases get reported 
among prostitutes in thailand fewer than 1 percent were 
reported with hiv infection in 1987 now the rate is as high as 40 
percent in some cities merson said 
who had been projecting that by the end of the decade 15 
million to 20 million people worldwide will have been infected with 
hiv but officials now say that is a minimum estimate 
the forecast is expected to be pushed up by the startling 
increase of aids in the developing countries as well as by an 
increase in heterosexual transmission of the disease in 
industrialized countries 
new projections will not be ready until late this year or 1991 
merson said he declined to estimate how high the projection could 
go 
the virus is spread mainly by sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood and blood products 
and by pregnant women to their babies 
in the united states most of the people with aids have been 
homosexual men and intravenous drug users 
however merson said that in industrialized countries such as 
the united states with innercity poverty and high rates of 
intravenous drug use and sexually transmitted diseases 
heterosexual transmission is increasing 
about 60 percent of hiv infections worldwide have resulted from 
heterosexual intercourse but by the turn of the century that 
proportion is expected to rise as high as 80 percent merson said 
in africa the virus is being spread primarily through 
heterosexual intercourse and as many women are infected as men an 
estimated 35 million subsaharan africans have been infected with 
the virus accounting for more than half the global total of hiv 
infection 
since the first aids cases were reported in 1981 more than 
250000 have been reported to who from more than 150 countries but 
because of underreporting and delays in reporting agency 
officials believe that number is closer to 700000 
that number is expected to grow to about 55 million by the end 
of the decade 
as of april 30 aids had been diagnosed in 132510 americans of 
whom 61 percent or 80798 have died since june 1 1981 according 
to the centers for disease control in atlanta

the nations largest manufacturer of 
overthecounter menstrual relief medicine must pay 375000 to 
settle charges that it made unsubstantiated advertising claims 
sterling drug inc reached agreement on tuesday with the federal 
trade commission concerning a 1985 complaint that eventually 
encompassed advertising for all but one of the companys products 
the agreement is without admission of any wrongdoing said 
terry kelley spokesman for sterling drug inc which makes midol 
brand products 
we entered into the consent decree to avoid protracted costly 
litigation 
a court battle would have involved highly technical scientific 
issues said kelley noting that the agreement does not involve 
our current advertising 
sterling will continue to manufacture and market the midol 
brand products he said adding that all the questionable ads 
were halted by march 
the ftc said sterling had violated a 1985 order prohibiting 
product performance claims unless a company has competent and 
reliable evidence for those claims 
the complaint said sterling ran certain ads for original 
formula midol and maximum strength midol for cramps from 
march 1985 to january 1986 and in april 1988 that claimed or 
implied one of the ingredients was a muscle relaxant for menstrual 
cramps that would quickly help relieve muscle contractions 
the ingredient in question has been removed from the 
product according to sterling 
also cited were ads for maximum strength midol pms which 
claimed total or complete relief for the symptoms of 
premenstrual syndrome 
the ftc also said the company had no scientific evidence that 
original midol mutisymptom formula and maximum strength 
midol multisymptom formula relieved menstrual waterweight gain 
advertising for sterlings midol 200 was not included in the 
complaint 
sterling is based in new york city and is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of the eastman kodak co

record store managers pulled an album by the 
rap group 2 live crew from their shelves after police warned they 
risked arrest for obscenity 
detectives set out tuesday to notify 84 stores that the lyrics 
of the 17 millionselling album as nasty as they wanna be are 
obscene said vice squad commander lt jerry pittman 
the action extends what had been a floridabased campaign by 
antipornography crusaders upset by the albums references to sex 
acts and genitals a federal judge in florida last week declared 
the record obscene 
texas law requires that a defendant be aware material is obscene 
to be convicted of selling it pittman said the maximum penalty is 
a year in jail and a 2000 fine 
some record store managers and workers said they were asked by 
police to sign a statement saying they had been warned the lyrics 
are obscene 
its censorship and theyre starting it said greta colbin 
manager at a hastings records and tapes outlet its a violation 
of our rights 
she said stores in her chain dont sell r rated albums to 
anyone under 18 
another record store manager agreed with the police action 
im not one of the people for censorship but i think this 
music is ridiculous said mark christy branch manager of a sound 
warehouse 
pittman said a bexar county assistant district attorney mike 
schill reviewed transcripts and listened to the lyrics before 
determining some of the words violate the states obscenity law 
the prosecutor wrote to pittman may 29 that he was convinced the 
lyrics of put her in the buck and me so horney were obscene 
but that his office would not issue a letter telling merchants to 
remove the album 
we believe that such action might be considered prior 
restraint and unconstitutional by the appellate courts schill 
wrote 
police chief william o gibson said removal of the records was 
voluntary but that the district attorneys office has agreed to 
prosecute cases resulting from complaints by local antipornography 
groups schill said he would evaluate each case police bring him 
for prosecution 
the texas state courts would not be bound by the federal judges 
ruling which the rap groups attorney appealed monday in florida 
two members of the band were arrested on obscenity charges after 
performing material from the album and a record store owner was 
arrested for selling the album

semiautomatic assault weapons made in the 
united states would be subject to the curbs already applying to the 
imported variety under a bill approved by the house judiciary 
committee 
these are lethal weapons regardless of the country of 
origin rep william j hughes dnj said tuesday as the panel 
approved the bill 2115 
the measure would require the treasury secretary to issue a list 
of weapons that could not be sold because they lacked a sporting 
purpose 
the bill also would ban magazines and other ammunitionfeeding 
devices with a capacity of more than seven rounds bar the 
manufacture of firearms to which silencers or bayonets could be 
directly attached and halt the export of assault weapons to 
governments that violate human rights or aid terrorists 
people who already owned such weapons would be able to keep 
them but the bill calls for fresh regulations governing their 
transfer to new owners manufacturers could still produce them for 
the military 
the bill would double from five to 10 years the mandatory 
minimum penalty for using or carrying an assault weapon in a 
violent crime or drugrelated crime 
opponents said the bill would not cut down on crime much because 
the weapons of choice among criminals are mainly shotguns and 
38caliber pistols 
rep bill mccollum rfla said that in some cases the 
statistics concerning assault weapons have been construed in a 
somewhat misleading fashion making it appear they are the 
primary firearms of criminals 
supporters however pointed to multiple slayings in stockton 
calif and louisville over the last 18 months by criminals armed 
with semiautomatic assault rifles 
mccollum noted statements by authorities that there is no 
functional difference between traditional semiautomatic hunting 
rifles with their brown wooden stocks and militarystyle variants 
committee chairman jack brooks dtexas backed a mccollum 
amendment that would have made gun collecting and the plinking 
of tin cans and the like part of the definition of sporting 
purpose 
brooks said mccollums amendment would give bureaucratic 
regulators a little more guidance about what congress had in mind 
but the proposal was rejected 2016 with hughes saying that 
my colleague from florida who i love dearly is going to be 
considered a legislative grim reaper because he once again offers 
an amendment that would gut the bill 
in the senate sponsors of an omnibus crime bill containing 
restrictions on nine semiautomatic assault weapons searched for a 
way to salvage the measure which was withdrawn from the floor last 
week after lawmakers balked at cutting short a threatened 
filibuster 
senate judiciary chairman joseph r biden jr ddel fielded 
questions about the bill at a meeting of democrats aides said but 
they said he also had to prepare for committee action in the wake 
of a supreme court decision throwing out the nations law against 
flag burning

the east german prime minister is warning his 
countrymen against going on a shopping spree in their tender 
economy when they begin to enjoy the west german mark instead of 
their nearly worthless currency 
theyll use the new money in the summer months to travel where 
they havent been able to travel prime minister lothar de 
maiziere told the national press club on tuesday 
i hope their eagerness to buy will hold itself within bounds 
because otherwise there would be serious difficulties for the 
economy he added 
de maiziere addressed the club on his first trip to the united 
states which may be his last as the formerly communist east 
germany hurtles toward reunification in three weeks with west 
germany whose economy is quite healthy 
he said unity would be costly to west germany in the short run 
but that over a longer period it would bring an economic boom 
especially if west germans invest in east germany instead of just 
marketing their goods there 
if west germany saw its eastern neighbor only as new customers 
it would lead to great social tensions and reproaches he added 
on july 2 the nearly worthless east german mark will be 
replaced by highly valuable west german marks the exchange rate 
will be oneforone under communism east german black marketeers 
were willing to pay seven or even 10 to one 
klaus friedrich former head of german affairs at the federal 
reserve predicted that east germany will achieve west german 
living standards in 10 years as a result of unification 
friedrich now with the institute of international finance also 
foresaw east german unemployment skyrocketing from 1 percent to 11 
percent by the end of the year robbing 1 million people of their 
jobs he also predicted many formerly staterun factories unable 
to compete in a capitalist marketplace would close 
but in a speech to the national economists club friedrich said 
german prices would remain fairly stable 
i think that inflation which currently runs between 2 and 3 
percent in west germany will not be the dire consequence 
predicted he said 
even if it doubles which is unlikely it will still be within 
a tolerable range 
generous west german social security benefits to be granted to 
east germans are expected to cushion the effect of unemployment

defense secretary dick cheney says significant 
cuts in president bushs 1991 defense budget could force him to 
discharge more than 100000 military personnel than already planned 
facing growing congressional opposition to bushs 3033 billion 
defense spending plan cheney told a senate panel tuesday that 
proposed reductions of more than 8 billion would cause great 
violence to our most important military asset our men and women 
he estimated that if congress adopts budget totals passed by the 
house on may 1 he would be forced to discharge 140000 of the 21 
million men and women now in uniform about 103000 more than in 
the current defense plan 
the only place we can get those kinds of savings quickly in 
fiscal 1991 is our manpower cheney said theres no other 
place to go wed have to run a lot of people off throw people on 
the street freeze promotions 
white house officials and members of congress are negotiating an 
overall budget for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 that would 
determine the amount of money for defense 
the house approved a 12 trillion budget that earmarks 2955 
billion for defense 83 billion less than bush has proposed the 
senate budget committee has approved a plan to cut his request by 
94 billion 
cheney promised negotiators last week that by thursday he would 
submit armed forces personnel projections for the next five years 
if defense spending is cut by 25 percent 
the pentagon chief provided a hint of the impact on tuesday in 
testimony before the senate appropriations subcommittee on defense 
cheney said a 25 percent cut would result in a reduction of five 
to six army divisions and five to six wings from the air force 
deputy defense secretary donald atwood meantime directed 
pentagon personnel chief christopher jehn to coordinate a study on 
reducing the size of the officer corps in the 1990s in anticipation 
of a smaller force structure in light of changing world 
conditions and declining budgets 
during the hearing senators challenged cheneys plan to buy 75 
b2 stealth bombers which according to latest estimates could cost 
860 million each 
my view is that we probably ought to scrap the b2 or just buy 
the b2s in production said sen dale bumpers dark 
bumpers questioned whether the soviets would be able to detect 
the radarevading bomber if they develop a counterpart to the 
sophisticated aegis radar that the united states has in its naval 
fleet 
cheney said the air force has not tested the b2 against aegis 
radar and that low observability testing of the bomber is scheduled 
to begin this fall im confident the b2 can do the mission that 
its intended to do but theres still a lot of testing to do he 
said 
meanwhile the congressional budget office said that based on 
its inflation assumptions the overall b2 program of 75 planes 
would cost 649 billion more than cheneys estimate of 611 
billion and the air forces recent total of about 62 billion 
the cbo figures that increase the cost of a single bomber from 
815 million to about 860 million were included in a letter to 
sen patrick leahy dvt a b2 opponent 
the union of concerned scientists and members of congress on 
tuesday kicked off a nationwide advertising campaign to end 
production of the b2 bomber at the 15 currently in the pipeline 
it called the bomber a mistake were cannot afford

the crackdown on ribald rappers 2 
live crew is part of a morals wave breaking across floridas land 
of sand sun and fun 
its a rising tide that is becoming increasingly difficult to 
contain said robyn blumner executive director of the american 
civil liberties union in florida 
those supporting the crackdown argue that a tide of bawdy 
activity needed containment among the targets of their wrath 
cheeky thong swimsuits xrated videos nude bars and tv 
advertising for phonesex services 
us district judge jose gonzalez ruled here june 6 that the rap 
album as nasty as they wanna be is obscene that was followed 
by the arrest two days later of a record shop owner who sold the 
album and the arrests in the wee hours sunday of two 2 live crew 
members for performing songs from the record in concert 
the crackdown has been attributed to politics the influence of 
retirees and the increasing muscle of conservative groups it has 
taken place mainly in touristdriven beach areas associated with 
risque entertainment 
gonzalezs ruling which called the album with its graphic 
sexual content a violation of community standards in dade broward 
and palm beach counties followed similar rulings by a local judge 
and grand juries in five counties 
in a fourcounty area that includes daytona beach two video 
store owners were arrested and xrated videos disappeared from most 
shops after 100 store owners were warned by state attorney john 
tanner against tapes deemed obscene 
in sarasota where charges earlier were dropped against a 
19yearold clerk accused of selling the 2 live crew album to a 
girl not yet in her teens thong bikinis which have only a narrow 
piece of material covering the buttocks were banned the state 
cabinet on tuesday approved a rule that swimsuits at state parks 
must cover at least half of a womans breasts and everyones 
buttocks 
in the fort lauderdale area bars featuring nude dancing were 
banned last year unless they serve only nonalcoholic drinks 
in palm beach county commissioner ron howard is seeking a ban 
on tv advertising for 900number phone sex operations in which 
callers are charged 10 or more to hear a woman talk dirty to them 
gonzalez called the 2 live crew case part of the continuing 
confrontation between anything goes and enough is enough 
and anybody who lives in the land of miami vice as i do 
knows that just about anything goes down here john thompson a 
coral gables lawyer who helped lead the fight against 2 live crew 
said monday on abcs nightline 
but the days of anything goes appear to be going 
i havent seen anything like it down here it reminds me of 
the mccarthy era it shows that small minds arent limited to small 
towns said woody graber a miami beach publicist who represents 
the gold club an adult entertainment lounge that had to close 
because of restrictions such as requiring covering of nipples it 
is operating now in compliance with the law 
in nottoodistant days floridas beach areas were better known 
for wet tshirt contests spring break revelry and showings of 
porno flicks such as deep throat 
but first fort lauderdale three years ago and then daytona 
beach this year toughened spring break standards making arrest 
sweeps against drugs drunkenness and lewd behavior 
ms blumner of the aclu said such conservative organizations as 
the american family association have become wellorganized in 
florida in recent years ann brittain a university of miami 
anthropology professor noted that retirees make up nearly a fifth 
of floridas 12 million residents 
when they were raising their families she said they didnt 
want their children to watch elvis presleys undulating pelvis or 
listen to the rolling stones implore lets spend the night 
together they may be shocked to hear of 2 live crews raunchy 
lyrics she said 
the ones born in the 19051920 era they see a leggs 
commercial they get a little nervous said barry freilich of 
ormond beach a video store owner tanner has charged with obscenity 
serial killer ted bundy executed in floridas electric chair in 
1989 figures in some of the antipornography campaigning 
tanner a bornagain christian prayed with bundy on death row 
and recounts that bundy partly blamed his rapemurder rampage on 
hardcore pornography bundy discussed the effects of hardcore 
porn in his final interview with radio psychologist james dobson 
dobsons group focus on the family led thompson to go after 2 
live crew after focus on the family sent out transcripts of the 
albums lyrics 
blumner said bundy is a pawn for the antiporn groups the 
fact of the matter is there are more sicko murderers who say god 
told them to kill than those who read playboy she said 
she blames politics for the florida push 
republican gov bob martinez facing a tough reelection battle 
spoke out early against 2 live crew broward county sheriff nick 
navarro who ordered the 2 live crew arrests has been accused by 2 
live crew attorney bruce rogow and others of overzealousness 
civil libertiesminded politicians may find it hard to rush to 
the defense in such cases ms blumner said 
theyre hard issues for politicians to deal with in a 
constitutional way because the other side has commandeered the term 
profamily she said theyre easy issues for politicians who 
dont care about free expression rights 
the governor defended his position this week saying the 2 live 
crew album is audio pornography 
communities have the right to set a standard martinez said

for the last 21 years ron jacko has been 
afraid to cross the us border now the marine deserter has 
returned from canada to turn himself in 
jacko a native of cleveland left his toronto home on tuesday 
he said he would present himself at the marine base in quantico 
va this afternoon 
jacko 42 said he wanted to make peace with himself and be free 
to see his mother 
i wasnt able to go home for my fathers funeral he said 
my mothers still alive im an only child and shes about 74 
herself right now she just went through three operations in about 
the last six months 
i dont want to be in a similar situation with my mom i want 
to be able to be there 
jacko said he opposed the war from the outset but decided to 
enlist in hopes of fulfilling his duty without going to vietnam 
he first tried to join the navy but flunked the entrance exam 
the navy recruiter then referred him to the marine recruiter 
the 21yearold volunteer completed basic training and was 
assigned to communications school that assignment persuaded him he 
was likely to be shipped to vietnam so while on leave he went 
home said goodbye to his family and headed for canada 
it was a serious decision it was a painful decision he 
said 
hes been living for 21 years in toronto where he married and 
worked as manager of a health food store 
he said he didnt try to take advantage of amnesty programs 
during the ford and carter administrations because the first 
covered only draft dodgers and the second would have imposed a 
stigma and a status of clemency discharge 
looking back now i wish i would have taken advantage of that 
program jacko said life as a deserter was never carefree he 
said it was eating at me it was chewing at me 
finally his mothers failing health persuaded him to turn 
himself in and try to tell the marines that he deserves an 
administrative discharge rather than a courtmartial 
he returned to the united states on tuesday and with a lawyer 
from the group citizen soldier made the rounds of washington news 
offices jacko and his attorney planned to talk today with the 
staff of rep mary rose oakar dohio and try to get meetings with 
ohios two senators before heading for quantico 
oakar said jacko had not made an appointment but letters from 
his attorney arrived tuesday at her cleveland and capitol hill 
offices 
the letter says they want to talk to me if they come i want 
to talk to them oakar said 
jacko said he hopes attention from congress and the public will 
help his case hope springs eternal i guess and naivete springs 
eternal too 
his wife nadia did not accompany jacko but he said she would 
join him in his new home after his release

fbi agents would have more leeway to shoot at 
suspects under a proposed new policy sources say 
agents could shoot fleeing suspects of violent crimes who are 
armed and considered likely to commit another crime said the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
deadly force also could be used if the agent had a reasonable 
belief that the suspect could not be arrested without firing shots 
under current policy fbi agents may use deadly force only in 
selfdefense or to protect the life of another person 
the new policy has been under study since 1985 when the supreme 
court held that police officers could shoot a fleeing armed 
suspect if the officers believed the person posed a threat to 
public safety said the sources 
the increase in drugrelated violence prompted the drafting of 
the new policy said the sources 
the fbi is awaiting clearance from attorney general dick 
thornburgh before making an announcement of the policy change said 
the sources 
the bureau has also taken steps to replace its standardissue 
38caliber smith amp wesson revolvers with a 10mm automatic pistol 
which officials say is in the process of being tested at fbi firing 
ranges 
the new firepower was sought because fbi officials felt agents 
were outgunned on the nations streets officials say

the foreign minister of 
czechoslovakia says the crumbling warsaw pact should be preserved 
in some form to prevent the soviet union from becoming dangerously 
isolated 
for the first time the warsaw pact is useful to us jiri 
dienstbier said tuesday in an interview with the associated press 
and two other news organizations 
he said that as the warsaw pact moves away from its role as a 
military alliance it can still play a role in european affairs 
the warsaw pact created in 1955 to help the soviets keep their 
eastern european satellites in line sent tanks into czechoslovakia 
to crush the 1968 prague spring reforms 
now czechoslovakia wants to remain in the alliance so it can 
have a voice in negotiating disarmament and a new european security 
order dienstbier said 
dienstbier was considered certain to keep his post in the new 
czechoslovak government parliamentary elections held last weekend 
were won by the prodemocracy forces that led last years 
revolution 
recalling the isolation of germany between the two world wars 
dienstbier said of the soviets we should do everything to pull 
them into europe 
we dont want to create any versailles complex in russia he 
said referring to the treaty that punished germany at the end of 
world war i its even more dangerous because they have all those 
nuclear arms 
warsaw pact members met in moscow last week and the soviets 
agreed that the other six member nations should have command of 
their own armies 
they had nominal command before but never exercised it with 
the exception of romania refusal to join the 1968 invasion of 
czechoslovakia the alliances supreme military commander was 
always a top soviet general or marshal 
czechoslovakia east germany and poland want the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe to make its headquarters in 
prague the 35nation group includes the united states canada the 
soviet union and all european countries but albania under the 
threenation proposal a parallel center for arms control 
verification and confidencebuilding measures would also be 
established in berlin 
the three east european nations want their idea discussed at a 
meeting of the conference on security in vienna on july 10 that 
meeting is to pave the way for a paris summit in december 
dienstbier and president vaclav havel of czechslovakia have long 
advocated the eventual breakup of the warsaw pact and its western 
counterpart the north atlantic treaty organization 
unlike hungarys new leaders who want their country out of the 
warsaw pact dienstbier and havel say the east bloc alliance 
should break up only gradually in the meantime they want to 
remain members 
dienstbier said there are positive forces in the soviet 
union who want to work with czechoslovakia east germany and 
poland on transforming european security 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere told president 
bush in washington on monday that nato must be significantly 
changed to meet the soviet unions security concerns 
the west is insisting that a united germany be a full member of 
nato moscow opposes exclusive military allegiance to nato for a 
new germany 
the dispute has halted for the moment efforts to secure the 
removal from east germany of the 380000 soviet troops stationed 
there

putnam who had used ms smith as an informant in a bank robbery 
and auto theft case is believed to be the first agent in fbi 
history charged or convicted of a homiciderelated crime

putnams june 4 confession we had absolutely no evidence not

in the latest episode in the saga 
of president carlos menems marital troubles the first lady moved 
out of the presidential residence rather than face legal eviction 
mrs zulema menem wearing a light blue jogging suit stood 
tuesday outside the high brick wall that surrounds the compound and 
demanded a showdown 
if i cant go in let the president and no one else tell me 
so she said 
after a fruitless wait she drove with her two adult children to 
the couples apartment in buenos aires recoleta neighborhood 
leaving the 65acre suburban estate in nearby olivos vacant 
mrs menem had moved to the apartment on monday 
menem asked his estranged wife to leave the residence and this 
was accomplished without any kind of violence due to the fact that 
she already had left said raul granillo ocampo menems legal 
secretary 
air force brig andres antonietti chief of the presidential 
military staff had gone to the residence to persuade mrs menem to 
leave without incident and found that she already had left 
ocampo said 
menem himself moved out of the residence on may 8 by law the 
president has exclusive power to say who may live in the luxurious 
residence 
were leaving because the president has thrown us out son 
carlos told reporters tuesday though ocampo said the decree 
barring the wifes reentry does not apply to the two children 
carlos 21 and his sister zulemita 19 
in all menem and his wife have been apart for nearly as long as 
theyve been together in their 24yearold marriage 
according to observers a major factor in the discord is that 
mrs menem wants a government post and her husband says no 
mrs menem 46 told reporters last week she had no plans to 
leave the residence and hoped her husband would return home 
following a 12day foreign trip menem who arrived back in buenos 
aires on sunday instead went to his apartment 
the couples marital strife became news after menem 59 moved 
out of the residence amid reports he would seek a legal separation 
or divorce 
while there have been reports of marital troubles for years 
menem has refused to discuss the situation with the media 
mrs menem has publicly accused her husband of being a 
womanizer and has assailed his social policies his freemarket 
economic plan and his staff 
the presidential residence was donated to the government by a 
wealthy family in 1920 on condition it be used by the president if 
the president fails to live in the house for six consecutive 
months the donors have the right to request its return according 
to a presidential decree 
menem a former governor of the poor interior province of la 
rioja became president last july he and his wife are of syrian 
descent 
while both are members of the laborbased peronist party since 
becoming president menem has advocated the sale of moneylosing 
state companies to help right argentinas impoverished economy 
mrs menem has criticized this plan which is anathema to 
hardline peronists

a moslem fundamentalist group defeated 
the party that has ruled algeria since independence 30 years ago in 
the countrys first multiparty elections the interior minister 
said today 
interior minister mohamedsalah mohammedi said the islamic 
salvation front was preeminent in local elections tuesday for 
1541 municipal and 48 provincial council seats the voting was 
marked by a low turnout because of a boycott by much of the 
opposition 
mohammedi said the fundamentalists were followed by the ruling 
national liberation front and the anticlerical rally for culture 
and democracy he did not provide figures official results were 
expected later today 
the municipal and provincial elections do not directly affect 
the national legislative body the peoples national assembly 
the national liberation front was the sole political party in 
the north african nation of 24 million people until constitutional 
changes in february 1989 opened the way to competing parties 
leaders of the centrist opposition had claimed the election was 
rigged because the national liberation front controls nearly all 
the media has greater resources than other parties and has 
functionaries in local government offices where votes were counted 
the interior ministry said earlier that only 55 percent of 13 
million eligible voters participated in the election the turnout 
figures showed a considerable range from 73 percent in the town of 
eltarf to approximately 50 percent in the capital and just 16 
percent in the berber town of tiziouzou 
the turnout was lowest in districts dominated by the berber 
movement the front of socialist forces led by hocine ait ahmed 
he joined the leftleaning populist movement for democracy headed 
by exiled former president ahmed ben bella in urging voters to 
stay home 
police were deployed around the country as the nations official 
media urged algerians to vote in this first test of democracy 
it is a great day which is being added to the realization of 
the algerian revolution president chadli bendjedid said before 
the election 
the boycott organized by aitahmed and ben bella the leading 
opposition figures among the nearly two dozen parties that have 
sprung up since pluralism was legalized last year left the highly 
organized fundamentalists to challenge the ruling national 
liberation front which turned algeria into a oneparty state after 
winning a war of independence against france in 1962 
fundamentalist leader abassi madani a philosophy teacher 
declared in a widely reported speech last week that he expected his 
party to get 75 percent of the vote 
the statement was denounced as a troublemaking provocation 
by several hundred fellow university professors and lecturers 
for months fundamentalist supporters have been accused of 
harrassing single women and disrupting nightclubs in the algiers 
region prompting denunciations from other political groups 
in the algiers suburb of el harrach the national liberation 
front withdrew from the elections accusing the fundamentalists of 
exercising moral violence against the voters and committing 
serious violations against the election law the statement did 
not elaborate 
the official news agency reported several groups of islamic 
supporters tried to overrun some algiers voting stations alleging 
the vote counting was influenced by the government 
numerous voters in the algiers district were turned away from 
polling booths when they appeared without the necessary documents 
among those blocked were men who tried to exercise their right to 
vote on behalf of their wife or wives without written 
authorization 
the national liberation front was forced to give up its monopoly 
on power after soldiers killed scores of people in october 1988 
riots sparked by deteriorating economic conditions constitutional 
changes adopted in february 1989 legalized pluralism 
the islamic salvation front seeks to establish the islamic legal 
code the sharia as law and openly opposes the democratic process

the supreme soviet legislature has passed the 
countrys first press freedom law which gives any soviet citizen 
the right to found a newspaper and guarantees broad rights for 
journalists and publishers 
the new law which passed unanimously on tuesday intends to end 
decades of censorship of the soviet media by the communist party 
the government and a special agency established to kept the media 
under tight control 
the press and other mass media are free the law begins 
bluntly and censorship of the mass media is forbidden 
however the law does not address how those who want to publish 
their own newspapers will obtain newsprint which is often in short 
supply 
the soviet government controls all paper mills and the supply of 
newsprint and other materials needed to publish newspapers it also 
controls all radio and television stations 
after president mikhail s gorbachev came to power in 1985 and 
introduced the policy of glasnost or openess political pressure 
on the soviet media began to lighten but there was still no legal 
protection from interference 
technically freedom of the press is guaranteed by a declaration 
in the soviet constitution but tuesdays measure was the first law 
laying out detailed guarantees of press freedoms the tass news 
agency reported 
the law establishes procedures for creating media outlets and 
specifies journalists rights they include the right to attend 
meetings and be present at the scene of disasters the right to 
refuse to prepare reports that go against personal convictions and 
the right to interview officials 
the provision giving any individual the right to establish a 
media outlet created the sharpest debate in the supreme soviet 
tass reported 
however it was agreed that the right to establish a 
publication is one of the main democratic freedoms envisaged in the 
international covenants on human rights which the soviet union has 
joined and it is necessary to enforce them the staterun news 
agency said 
the law forbids publication of state secrets but tass said 
penalties would be imposed on the official who leaked them rather 
than the journalist who reported them 
it also forbids slander and use of the mass media to interfere 
in citizens private lives infringement on their honor and 
dignity 
pornography long outlawed in the soviet union remains illegal 
although soviet media including television have begun showing 
nudity fairly often 
the law a copy of which was obtained by the associated press 
does not specify the penalties for slander and other abuses of 
press freedoms saying they can be established by the courts 
according to existing or future laws

a study of premature babies of belownormal 
weight shows their iq can be boosted by special education in their 
first years 
loraine stern a pediatrician at the university of california at 
los angeles said the study in todays journal of the american 
medical association also showed the importance of parental 
involvement in a childs early years 
you cant recapture what you lose in the first few years 
she said 
in the fouryear study onethird of 985 babies born in 1985 in 
eight states received educational help researchers visited the 
home advised parents provided educational toys and arranged 
visits to a child development center 
infants who weighed between 44 and 55 pounds at birth and 
received educational help and medical care scored an average of 98 
at age 3 or 132 iq points higher than children who had been in 
the same weight range at birth but received only medical care the 
average iq is 100 
infants who weighed about 43 pounds or less at birth and were 
given the educational help scored an average of 91 at age 3 or 66 
iq points higher than similar infants getting only medical care 
wrote the researchers led by dr ruth gross of stanford university 
arnold sameroff a psychologist who teaches at brown university 
and practices at bradley hospital in providence ri said the 
children in the study got such multifaceted help other researchers 
will find it hard to tell what made the difference 
almost 7 percent of babies born in the united states or 250000 
a year weigh 55 pounds or less at birth though these 
lowbirthweight babies have a much better chance of survival than 
in years past they still are at risk of retarded development

usair says it should have detained and questioned 
gov michael s dukakis for joking as he boarded a plane that there 
could be a bomb in the luggage of a white house aide taking the 
same flight 
dukakis made the comment sunday night at logan international 
airport also on the flight was republican ron kaufman an aide to 
president bush said patricia goldman a usair spokeswoman in 
arlington va 
ms goldman said monday that dukakis joked about the possibility 
of a bomb in kaufmans luggage the supervisor on duty recognized 
the governor determined the comments were made jokingly and let 
it go she said 
ms goldman said allowing dukakis to board was an error in 
procedure according to federal aviation administration rules 
if he made a comment even in jest he should have been 
questioned that is our procedure ms goldman said 
the governor asked about the incident by reporters in 
washington said the humor of it was obvious to everyone who was 
there 
massachusetts democrats have charged that kaufman may have had a 
hand in a police union protest that disrupted the state democratic 
convention in springfield on june 2 
after going through the experiences that the democrats went 
through in springfield i can tell you we will always be concerned 
when mr kaufman is around the governor said 
kaufman in a telephone interview said of sunday nights 
incident given the psychological terror people have of bombs and 
flying it was irresponsible for a man in his position to joke 
about something like that 
he said he did not hear dukakis comments when he was boarding

a explosion that tore through 
the front of a historic mansion was believed caused by a bomb 
raising suspicions that animal rights extremists might be 
responsible police said today 
the 18th century west green house in this village 55 miles from 
london was unoccupied when the blast tore out brickwork and blew in 
windows shortly before midnight wednesday police said no one was 
hurt 
the mansion owned by the stateaided national trust was until 
last month the home of lord mcalpine a building construction 
millionaire and former deputy chairman of the governing 
conservative party 
mcalpine whose interests include a zoo in broome australia

south american guerrillas holding an 
american hostage rejected the 60000 ransom payment because they 
want it in colombian pesos not dollars his family says they also 
are doubting the familys plea of poverty 
heavy rains also have contributed to delays in obtaining the 
release of scott heimdal and negotiators must now wait a few days 
while the ransom is changed into pesos and the weather cooperates 
heimdals family says 
heimdals mother marge heimdal said tuesday a new date has 
been set for another jungle meeting along the colombiaecuador 
border with a gobetween and the guerrillas she would not disclose 
the date for security reasons 
roy heimdal the mans father said the kidnappers are doubting 
the familys claims of poverty after seeing tv coverage of their 
efforts last week to raise the ransom 
they saw pictures of our house heimdal said of the modest 
woodframe bungalow our house is no mansion but by their 
standards it is i guess they figure anyone who eats three square 
meals a day has 60000 laying around 
scott heimdal a 27yearold employee of an americann gold 
mining company was abducted while working in ecuador on april 28 
he was believed to have been taken hostage by guerrillas of the 
popular liberation army 
the kidnappers initially demanded 12 million but lowered the 
figure and the money was raised by donations that poured in to the 
heimdals including waitresses tips and proceeds from nursinghome 
bake sales 
the intermediary had problems getting up the river because 
theyve had heavy rain and the river is swollen the elder 
heimdal said 
then the guerrillas got upset because the ransom money came in 
us dollars instead of pesos when they tried to exchange it they 
had trouble finding enough pesos so things arent going so 
smoothly 
heimdal said the unidentified gobetween was trying to convince 
the kidnappers the workingclass family is financially strapped 
the family says its savings were wiped out by medical bills after 
mrs heimdal was seriously injured in a 1983 car accident

nine vietnamese boat people have 
given police the skeletons of 30 people stuffed in seven barrels 
that they claim were from americans killed in the vietnam war 
officials said today 
paul blakeburn charge daffaires at the us embassy said he 
doubted the bones were those of americans missing in action it 
is possible but it is not likely to be true 
embassy press officer meg gilroy said malaysian authorities 
would hand the bones over to the embassy soon 
she said an official from either the joint casualty resolution 
center in bangkok thailand or the us defense department 
forensic laboratory in hawaii would take them to hawaii for tests 
to determine if they belong to us troops she said the embassy 
did not know yet how the vietnamese obtained the bones which 
malaysian officials said had been handed over to police in the kota 
tinggi district 150 miles south of kuala lumpur 
the kota tinggi police station contacted by telephone said 
some vietnamese had landed monday with skeletons at a beach 40 
miles to the east but could not provide further details 
the newspaper new straits times said today that police had found 
metal tags on the skeletons it quoted deputy superintendent of 
police roslan dolah as saying the tags had the names and unit 
numbers and addresses of the dead men believed to have been killed 
during the vietnam war 
the refugees 52foot boat had the words usa remains in my 
boat and this boat have usa army remains written on its 
sides the paper reported 
it also quoted roslan as saying the nine vietnamese aged 
between 18 and 56 told police they had left vietnam on may 30 and 
had to land monday when their boat sprang a leak 
the refugees were sent to a refugee camp in nearby mersing 
we are investigating the reasons for the refugees bringing the 
skeletons with them we have not come across such cases 
before the paper quoted roslan as saying 
it added it is understood the refugees were en route to 
singapore to hand over the skeletons to the american embassy by 
doing so the refugees not only hoped to gain refuge to the us 
but also to get some monetary reward in exchange for the 
skeletons 
singapore is about 60 miles south of where they landed 
the united states now lists 2303 americans as missing from the 
indochina war these include 1678 in vietnam 
refugee officials said this was not the first time vietnamese 
refugees had claimed to have brought bones of american soldiers 
but the presence of metal tags would make this case different they 
said

the government rushed 3000 more 
soldiers today to the east coast where tamil rebels were attacking 
military camps and scores of people were believed to have been 
killed government officials said 
military officials said they feared the rebels had killed more 
than 100 police among 600 taken prisoner in eastern batticaloa 
district on monday 
in addition to the policemen residents and rebels in the east 
said as many as 90 people have died in the violence the worst 
confrontation between troops and rebels since peace talks started 
in may 1989 
the officials cited a report from an injured policeman who was 
among the 600 captured when rebels took command of 11 police 
stations in the east 
they said the policeman escaped the rebels and reached a 
military camp on tuesday reporting that 115 of his colleagues had 
been shot to death by rebels 
there was no independent confirmation of the alleged killings 
since government troops have been restricted to their camps and 
communication lines to the east are down officials said 
tamil rebels have been fighting for more political autonomy in 
sri lanka since 1983 they claim they are discriminated against by 
the majority sinhalese tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people while sinhalese make up 75 percent 
military officials today could only confirm that 16 soldiers 
were killed and 12 injured in the fighting up to 6 am this 
morning they said rebels were burning the bodies of soldiers and 
police officers 
the new attacks today on the camps at kiran kalavanchukudi and 
kalmunai all in batticaloa district came hours before a 
ceasefire was to take effect the officials said 
the ceasefire was supposed to begin at noon but fighting was 
still going on as the deadline passed 
throughout the night rebels seized an additional seven police 
stations seizing arms and ammunition 
reinforcements of government troops were rushed to the area the 
3000 fresh troops comprised three battalions military officials 
said 
the battalions were an addition to four companies totaling 
1200 soldiers that had been deployed tuesday to regions where 
fighting has raged for three straight days officials said 
the fighting apparently broke out when a tamil man told rebels 
of the dominant tamil militia the tigers that he had been 
assaulted by a sinhalese policemen at the batticaloa police station 
on sunday officials said 
the tigers on monday ordered policemen out of the station and 
took command 
the tigers took virtual control of the countrys northeastern 
districts after indian peacekeeping forces withdrew in march 
president ranasinghe premadasas government which has been 
negotiating with the tigers for the past year requested the 
indians departure 
at least 11000 people including 1200 indian soldiers have 
been killed in the tamil war since it started in 1983 
another 6000 have been killed since 1987 in a backlash to tamil 
demands whipped up by ultranationalist sinhalese guerrillas

faced with a splintering empire soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev is proposing to counter secessionist drives by 
transforming the soviet union into a looser federation of sovereign 
states officials say 
the soviet leader has also significantly softened his position 
on german reunification saying a united germany could be an 
associate member of the nato alliance while at the same time 
joining a new paneuropean security order 
he did not define exactly what associate membership would 
entail but the kremlin up to now has opposed a new germany whose 
sole military allegiance is to the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
gorbachev made his proposal about the soviet republics on 
tuesday the same day the parliament of the huge russian republic 
approved a resolution declaring its laws to carry more weight than 
federal statutes 
also tuesday gorbachev met with the presidents of latvia 
lithuania and estonia after refusing for weeks to negotiate with 
the secessionist baltic republics unless they agreed to abide by 
the soviet constitution 
president vytautas landsbergis of lithuania hinted that the 
kremlin might soon end the economic embargo imposed on his republic 
soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov who attended the session 
said today that it produced definite progress on the impasse over 
the baltic states independence declarations 
he said if the baltic republics went ahead and accepted the 
kremlin proposal that they suspend their independence moves and 
begin negotiations great possibilities for future talks will be 
opened 
ryzhkov was scheduled to meet today with lithuanian prime 
minister kazimiera prunskiene to discuss practical steps toward 
better relations he said ryzhkov said he was confident that the 
lithuanian question is finally getting off the ground 
gorbachev met with the baltic presidents after a session with 
the federation council an advisory body consisting of the 
presidents of all 15 soviet republics 
he said he had summoned the council to begin work on realizing 
the key idea of deeply reforming our federation 
gorbachev proposed that the countrys republics agree on a new 
looser union of sovereign states officials said after the 
meeting 
the 59yearold soviet leader has pledged repeatedly since last 
fall to work out a new union treaty some reformers would like to 
transform the soviet union into a confederation of independent 
countries like the european community or the british commonwealth 
tuesdays proposal for a union of sovereign states is the 
closest that gorbachev has come to publicly considering such a 
radical change 
the russian resolution has no immediate legal effect 
but if it takes hold it could bring a dramatic reduction in 
gorbachevs authority because russia includes 52 percent of the 
soviet unions population and threequarters of its land mass 
the russian congress of peoples deputies under the leadership 
of radical reformer boris n yeltsin voted 90713 for the 
declaration the statement was weaker than originally proposed 
because it says russias sovereignty and the priority of its laws 
ver national ones will be worked out in a new russian 
constitution and union treaty 
any new treaty that keeps the soviet union as a single country 
would be likely to shift substantial powers from the federal 
government to the republics gorbachev has promised repeatedly that 
a new federation structure would solve the republics grievances 
but independence activists have dismissed his assurances in the 
past for lack of a concrete proposal 
some reformers have suggested that the central government retain 
control over foreign policy and defense others have added control 
of some industries overall economic planning and other duties to 
the list 
landsbergis asked whether gorbachev would lift the economic 
embargo imposed on lithuania in april said the blockade will 
not be canceled tomorrow but the day after tomorrow we shall 
see 
gorbachev cut off shipments of oil and restricted supplies of 
natural gas and other raw materials to lithuania after the republic 
refused to repeal laws stemming from its march declaration of 
independence 
the other two baltic states have taken a less rapid course 
toward secession declaring indefinite transition periods to 
independence 
in an hourlong address to the supreme soviet legislature 
broadcast live on soviet tv gorbachev said huge results were 
achieved in arms control at his washington summit with president 
bush 
he reported on his talks with bush on a united germany joining 
nato west germany now belongs to the western military alliance and 
east germany to warsaw pact an instrument of soviet domination in 
eastern europe until last years string of revolutions 
gorbachev said our position is thus we could agree to the 
joining if you accept associative participation the principle of 
blocs coming together in conjunction with the unification of 
germany in the process of which mutual obligations are not changed 
neither from the side of west or east germany and if 
simultaneously the blocs are reformed in natural connection with 
vienna and the alleuropean process 
he did not spell out what associate membership for germany would 
entail vienna is the venue for arms reduction talks and the 
europewide conference on security and cooperation aimed at 
reducing tensions 
later official radio moscow said it might be possible to 
agree with germany being in nato as an associated member provided 
there are changes in the nature of the military alliances both 
nato and the warsaw treaty organization 
the soviet president seemed to be demanding that a united 
germany fulfill east germanys obligations to the warsaw pact only 
during a transition period

a study of whats eating americans has crowned 
eureka calif today as the nations heartburn capital 
the national rolaids heartburn index blames that searing 
sensation on sociology not spices it says eureka is full of 
newcomers with a burning desire for economic success 
el paso was named the most heartburnfree city in america 
despite its texmex cuisine the reason a stable population and a 
rebounding economy 
or maybe theyre stoics said jack levin sociology 
professor at northeastern university in boston 
however his heartfelt study points to other factors 
i think there is a tendency on the part of americans to blame 
heartburn on spicy foods mexican or szechuan for example said 
levin from a sociological standpoint it appears heartburn 
levels can be easily linked to the amount of population growth that 
a city is experiencing 
to reach his conclusions levin digested sales figures for 
various antacid brands tablet and liquid from 197 metropolitan 
areas then he ranked the nations heartburn hotbeds 
while the sales statistics were not revealed he found that on 
average americans experience heartburn twice a week in contrast 
the 25000 folks in eureka are plagued an average of four times a 
week 
other americans left their heartburn in san francisco chico 
calif santa barbara calif sacramento calif boise idaho 
reno nevada fresno calif bakersfield calif and seattle 
the happiest tummies were found in el paso fort smith ark 
ada okla colorado springs colo columbia mo st joseph 
mo lubbock tex panama city fla springfield mo and 
albany ga 
the most startling result in this analysis was that the 
northeast region did not have high heartburn on the rolaids 
index said levin new york city ranked 135th 
these results say heartburn occurs wherever theres gold rush 
fever where you get large numbers of newcomers transients 
rootless people who move to an area to make their fortune for a 
new beginning or a last resort 
perhaps to prove a point levin and company officials planned to 
belch forth their findings at a luncheon of chicken marinaded in 
tequila shrimp marinaded in chilli salad with cilantro dressing 
tacos and refried beans 
as a hedge therell be rolaids for everyone if necessary 
said spokeswoman ann forster 
it wasnt clear whether eureka citizens were pained by the study 
results however the mayor planned to be at the luncheon 
to the 40 million americans who sometimes suffer from heartburn 
levin offered this advice 
avoid a lot of important changes in their lifestyles all at 
the same time even the most positive changes like getting 
married moving to a nicer neighborhood getting a better job can 
create heartburn

penh at the time of the arrests 
this is a major new development in cambodia it quoted him 
as saying up until now political arrests have been largely 
linked to the resistance factions based in thailand 
these men were apparently trying to take advantage of a 
changed political climate and move cambodia towards a multiparty 
system it looks like they may have jumped the gun he said 
the statement said the six men were thought to have been among a 
group that included 15 to 40 other people they six were held in a 
villa in the capital it said more than one villa in the elite 
tuol kork district of the capital was known to house political

chairman of cambodias only law school the report said 
it said that on may 23 an official close to hun sen told asia 
watch that the arrests were a mistake and the men would be

went to japan for peace talks with guerrilla leader prince norodom 
sihanouk the talks were held june 45 and hun sen returned to 
phnom penh on june 10 after stopovers in moscow and hanoi 
authorities in phnom penh have substantially eased political 
restrictions in recent years and said they would support a 
government along western democratic lines when peace is achieved 
with the guerrillas 
the asia watch statement said the debate over a possible change 
to a pluralistic system was thought to have split the government 
between a reformist group led by hun sen and one of provietnamese 
hardliners

workers began tearing down the remainder of 
the berlin wall today starting with a street split down the center 
that symbolized the citys 29year division 
a huge crane smashed into a section of wall built into the 
fronts of houses on bernauer street in august 1961 when the wall 
was put up 
bernauer was the scene of the most escapes in the early days of 
the wall scores of east germans tumbled through windows and off 
rooftops as the wall was gradually built higher and windows were 
cemented shut 
i am full of hatred for that symbol of division said east 
german building minister ekkehard kraft as hundreds of people 
gathered to watch the ceremonial start of the destruction 
the decision to begin final demolition of the wall came tuesday 
in the first joint session of the city councils of both berlins 
we are already now one city said east berlin mayor tino 
schwierzina who was elected in east germanys first free local 
balloting in may 
one section of wall is to remain standing as a memorial to the 
people who were killed trying to flee from east germany to the west 
the demolition is to be completed by july 2 when the two german 
states are to merge their economies in the major step to full 
unification 
the meeting of the west berlin senate and the east berlin 
magisrat was the first involving local officials from both berlins 
since 1948 after germany and its capital were both carved in two 
by the victorious world war ii allies 
the two councils which meet individually each week plan to 
meet jointly every two weeks until full unification takes place and 
a single government is chosen in new local elections 
east germanys former communist government was toppled by mass 
protests in october and the wall was opened in november since 
then germans have been able to pass back and forth between the 
cities and the two nations 
border crossings still are staffed by guards on both sides of 
the wall and cursory passport checks are made foreigners can pass 
only through two points 
some of the most famous stretches of the berlin wall have 
already been demolished but most of the wall still snakes around 
west berlin 
berlin was divided into four sectors following world war ii 
with the soviets in control of the east and france britain and the 
united states in control of the west 
east berlin is the capital of east germany but west berlin is 
still technically under military occupation and not part of the 
territory of west germany 
the four allies are expected to negotiate an end to their direct 
involvement in the cities during the series of ongoing talks that 
also are dealing with the future strategic allegiance of a united 
germany

demonstrators halted traffic in much of 
the capital today to protest the apparent victory of the heirs to 
the longruling communists in bulgarias first free elections in 58 
years 
the protesters formed barricades with benches blocking traffic 
on main thoroughfares including an intersection demonstrators had 
blocked for several hours tuesday night some threatened drivers 
who did not honk their horns 
honking has become a common expression of protest over the past 
few days against the socialist party known until april as the 
communist party 
with half the official results tallied the socialists appeared 
to have won the first round of voting on sunday but final results 
were not expected before tonight an election official said 
runoffs are being held sunday in 81 constituencies where no 
single candidate received the required majority 
analysts said that based on the known results and projections by 
west german and bulgarian groups it was still possible that the 
opposition could gain a slight edge after the secondround voting 
but the official bta news agency said the opposition would have 
to win nearly all the seats at stake in the runoffs 
half of parliaments 400 seats are being filled by direct 
election the other 200 based on the percentage of votes each party 
receives 
supporters of the 16party opposition alliance the union of 
democratic forces and of an anarchist group say sundays elections 
were manipulated but most foreign observers said they saw little 
or no wrongdoing 
the opposition pledged tuesday to rally behind candidates not 
associated with the socialist party in the runoffs in 81 
constituencies in a lastditch bid to gain control of parliament 
according to final results for the individual constituencies 
released by the central election commission today the socialist 
party won 75 seats outright in the first round 
union of democratic forces candidates won in 32 constituences 
and the mostly ethnicturkish movement for rights and freedoms won 
in nine more state radio reported three more seats went to an 
independent and one each to two small opposition parties 
on tuesday students began a threeday protest strike at kliment 
ohridski university protesting the authorities delay in releasing 
election returns but the students distanced themselves from 
tuesdays demonstration at the intersection 
traffic was halted today on the entire 25mile lenin boulevard 
the main artery leading into downtown sofia angry citizens had to 
walk for miles to get to their jobs 
the demonstration tuesday night lasted into the morning hours 
when police pushed the demonstrators back and a heavy downpour 
reduced their numbers 
long live anarchy long live freedom shouted the crowd 
many of the demonstrators were of high school age 
the latenight protest extended to nearby television 
headquarters where protesters claimed that tv director pavel 
pisarev had manipulated election coverage 
socialist leaders say they would like to share power but may be 
faced with forming a singleparty government the party then would 
have to tackle alone the countrys deepening economic crisis 
including rising inflation a 10 billion foreign debt and consumer 
shortages 
the union of democratic forces favors faster reforms toward a 
westernstyle market economy than the socialists cautious approach 
the strong socialist showing seemed due in part to its 
nearcentury as a political presence in bulgaria another possible 
factor was the popularity of some current socialist leaders who 
figured prominently in ousting hardline communist strongman todor 
zhivkov last november and initiating reform in the country one of 
moscows closest allies during the brezhnev era

president corazon aquino today signed 
a bill banning the pernicious trade in mailorder brides which 
she said insults national pride and breaks the hearts of young 
women and their families 
mrs aquino hailed the new laws prohibition of the commerce 
in women under the guise of legitimate marriage 
the measure outlaws the solicitation or inducement of 
filipino women to become members of any club or association whose 
objective is to match women for marriage to foreign nationals 
either on a mailorder basis or through personal introductions for 
a fee 
it also bans the printing and distribution of material promoting 
the practice violators could face up to eight years in jail and 
870 in fines 
the mailorder bride business is a relatively new phenomenon 
in our society but its perpetrators are many said mrs aquino 
they are able to carry out their pernicious trade through the use 
of the media for personal profit 
mrs aquino said many poor young women from remote villges are 
lured through sweet talk and grandiose promises by the 
mailorder bride businesses 
although we come by success stories every so often most of 
the feedback is devastating not only to individual persons and 
families but also to our national pride she said 
sen ernesto maceda the chief congressional sponsor of the new 
law said he was spurred to action by the alarming rate of 
battered filipino wives married to foreign nationals through the 
mailorder bride business 
any foreigner convicted under the new law faces the same fine 
and jail time plus deportation afterward violators are barred 
permanantly from returning to the philippines

the bush administration is prepared to resume 
a military training program for lebanon once that country pays off 
more than 8 million in overdue loans to the united states us 
officials said today 
john kelly assistant secretary of state for near east and south 
asian affairs outlined the us position last week at a meeting in 
egypt with lebanese president elias harawi the officials said 
under law lebanon is ineligible for us assistance because of 
the repayment arrearages the suspell ahead of the schedule set in a ussoviet 
treaty 
signed during the superpower summit 
the agreement signed by president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev requires each side to reduce its stockpile to 
5000 tons by 2002 although the soviets have no active facility 
for destroying their weapons 
the united states says it has about 25000 tons of chemical 
agents the soviets say they have 50000 tons the two nations are 
the worlds largest holders of such weapons 
destruction is supposed to begin by dec 31 1992 but doubts 
have arisen over the soviets plans because the government last 
summer shut down its only destruction facility at chapayevsk on 
the volga river because of environmental protests 
the gao report raises serious questions about whether the united 
states will meets its goal 
as we try and rid ourselves of this dangerous legacy we learn 
that the army is behind schedule and over budget by billions 
said rep john conyers dmich one of three lawmakers to request 
the gao report 
in short with this effort the environment loses the federal 
budget loses and the american taxpayer loses 
the army said late tuesday it had not seen the report and had no 
immediate comment 
the gao said the army believes it will fall short of the april 
30 1997 deadline due to problems at the johnston atoll facility 
the agency also cited growing community opposition as a factor in 
delaying the armys schedule 
the johnston atoll plant in the pacific ocean was built to meet 
a 1985 congressional requirement to destroy all existing us 
chemical weapons by 1997 as a condition for approving a pentagon 
program to produce a new generation of such weapons 
the army announced in 1988 that it planned to build similar 
disposal facilities at each of the eight chemical munitions storage 
sites in the continental united states 
the sites are tooele utah anniston ala pine bluff ark 
umatilla ore pueblo colo newport ind lexingtonblue grass 
ky and aberdeen md 
the gao report said the army did not expect restrictions imposed 
by a utah environmental permit that require the service 
periodically to operate the disposal plant at 50 percent capacity 
while environmental test data is analyzed 
in addition purchasing of equipment for the utah plant was 
delayed by a 37 million shortfall in funds for fiscal 1990 
meanwhile the gao found that at johnston atolloperational 
delays at the initial plant have adversely affected the armys 
ability to incorporate lessons learned at this plant into the 
design and construction plans for the continental us disposal 
facilities 
the gao also said the army will likely face obstacles in 
obtaining environmental permits and community opposition in 
indiana kentucky and maryland will put the armys disposal 
schedule in jeopardy 
the gao said the army received information in march 1988 that 
showed the total disposal program will cost 34 billion double 
the october 1985 estimate for destroying the weapons at the eight 
storages sites and johnston atoll 
but the gao report said the total cost likely will increase 
because current construction equipment and personnel 
requirements are at least 300 million greater than estimated in 
march 1988 
sen john glenn dohio said the great irony here is that we 
developed these weapons because they promised deterrence on the 
cheap but we never took into account the cleanup disposal and 
environmental costs incurred by manufacturing these weapons 
rep earl hutto dfla chairman of the house armed services 
subcommittee on readiness also requested the report glenn is 
chairman of the senate governmental affairs committee while conyers 
is chairman of the house committee on government operations

an islamic fundamentalist leader 
demanded today that the government dissolve parliament and hold 
early national elections after his followers beat the ruling party 
in local balloting 
abassi madani president of the islamic salvation front thanked 
the government for allowing algerias first multiparty elections 
since independence in 1962 but he said parliament in which every 
seat is held by the ruling national liberation front should be 
dissolved to clear the way for legislative elections within three 
months there was no immediate government response 
by midafternoon today no official results had been announced 
but interior minister mohamedsalah mohammedi said madanis party 
won a majority of the 15000 seats at stake tuesday on 1541 
municipal and 48 provincial councils about 13 million people were 
registered to vote 
the voter turnout was about 60 percent because of a boycott by 
several parties opposed to the government and the fundamentalists 
in a constitutional referendum last year the turnout was 76 
percent 
mohammedi said the fundamentalists were followed closely by the 
national liberation front and the anticlerical rally for culture 
and democracy 
in france algerias former colonial ruler and home to hundreds 
of thousands of algerian immigrants youth and sports minister 
roger bambuck indicated the results would cause alarm in government 
ranks 
its with great sadness that i see the rise of fundamentalists 
in algeria he said in a radio interview every time one sees 
dogmatism on the rise whether political or religious its liberty 
that is in danger 
he said the results will be a source of worry for algerians 
and will create difficulties for our algerian friends living in 
france 
in iran staterun tehran radio said the results were part of 
the wave of islamization that has gripped northern african nations 
simultaneously 
the development of islamic feeling in these countries is 
similar to algeria but it is suppressed by the ruling regimes 
the radio said 
in tunisia one of algerias neighbors the main islamic group 
was barred from nationwide local elections sunday 
algerias national liberation front was the sole political party 
in the nation of 24 million people until constitutional changes in 
february 1989 opened the way to competing parties 
centrist opposition leaders had feared the election would be 
rigged because the national liberation front controlled nearly all 
media had greater resources and had functionaries in local offices 
where votes were counted 
madani a 59yearold philosophy professor thanked the public 
and government for the high level of political maturity that 
led to his partys majority the electorate knew how to choose 
its destiny by showing a profound confidence in us he said 
the islamic salvation front seeks to establish the islamic legal 
code the sharia as law but madani said he was prepared to 
cooperate with other factions and did not favor a oneparty state 
we guarantee the freedom of all who have ideas on algerias 
future he said the algerian people are not stupid they can 
tell truth from error 
for months fundamentalist supporters have been accused of 
harassing single women and disrupting nightclubs in algiers 
in the algiers suburb of el harrach the national liberation 
front withdrew from the elections accusing the fundamentalists of 
exercising moral violence against the voters the statement did 
not elaborate

sen dave durenberger made an emotional plea 
to the senate ethics committee today saying his life and 
reputation are at stake and asking for compassion in their 
judgment of his financial dealings 
in an intensely personal statement the minnesota republican 
said repeatedly he was deeply sorry for financial deals that he 
admitted violated senate rules 
the committees special counsel robert bennett recommended 
tuesday that the senate publicly denounce durenberger for 
reprehensible actions that brought dishonor and disrepute 
on the senate 
his conduct was clearly and unequivocally unethical bennett 
told the committee after describing allegations that durenberger 
broke senate rules and federal law through a book promotion deal 
and transactions involving his minneapolis condominium 
durenberger made no reference to the proposed sanction in a 
13page statement prepared for the committee today repeating that 
he was sorry for his actions four times durenberger described how 
he had thrown himself into his work because of the emotional trauma 
from his first wifes death and the daunting challenge of 
raising four young sons 
my life and reputation are at stake and i believe each of you 
will combine both good judgment and compassion in your decision 
durenberger said 
durenberger said he would not challenge the committees 
recommended punishment but he appeared to rule out resigning from 
the senate when this is done i intend to serve this body and my 
home state with a renewed conviction to exemplify the servant in 
public service he said 
durenbergers attorney jim hamilton told the committee today 
that durenbergers conduct was not reprehensible and the 
senator does not deserve a sanction as harsh as a resolution 
denouncing him 
he said reprehensible conduct conjures up venality and 
dave durenberger is not an evil reprehensible man 
he told the committee that durenberger was undergoing personal 
strain and impaired judgment during a number of the questionable 
financial transactions including marital problems chemical 
dependency of two sons and severe financial strains 
hamilton told the panel tuesday that durenberger feels that 
some sanction is appropriate because he was inattentive and 
unwise 
only the full senate can decide to punish one of its members if 
the committee and the senate followed the counsels recommendation 
a resolution would be passed denouncing durenbergers conduct but 
his position as a senator at least until his next reelection 
campaign would not be affected 
a lesssevere penalty such as admonishing or reprimanding 
durenberger would not require senate approval bennett said 
bennett reminded the panel it could consider stripping 
durenberger of his seniority and committee assignments as well as 
order him to make restitution 
he said the most serious punishment expulsion traditionally 
has been reserved for senators guilty of serious violations of the 
law 
the counsel said durenberger was guilty of a pattern of 
misconduct 
hamilton portrayed durenberger as a victim of mistakes and 
sloppiness who relied on a bevy of lawyers to handle his 
finances there were no venal motives or a grand conspiracy 
to violate the rules 
bennett accused durenberger of making fake promotional 
appearances in 1985 and 1986 for his two books so he could keep 
more speaking fees than allowed 
the speeches were a gimmick to magically turn honoraria 
earned from appearances before trade groups into book promotions 
allowing durenberger to make 100000 above his senate salary 
bennett said 
durenberger received the money from a minneapolis publisher 
piranha press in return for having trade groups he addressed send 
their speaking fees to piranha piranha earned 248360 from the 
speeches but only 15560 from sales of the two books 
this very hungry fish piranha press was allowed to engage in 
a feeding frenzy to make money bennett said durenberger he 
added allowed himself and his office to be used as the bait and 
he got 100000 for his trouble 
durenbergers attempts to change ownership of his minneapolis 
condominium were part of a convoluted scheme to collect 40055 in 
senate travel reimbursements improperly from 1983 through 1989 he 
knew he would have been ineligible for the payments if he had owned 
the residence outright bennett said 
bennett also said durenberger showed a pattern of 
insensitivity when he accepted free limousine rides in boston 
from people interested in legislation durenberger used the 
limousine service to get to regular appointments with a local 
marriage counselor

the soviet government said today that it would 
postpone unpopular bread price increases but lawmakers were 
considering a plan to speed up other elements of a radical economic 
reform plan 
bread prices will be raised but of course not by july 1 as 
originally planned a top official said when plans to raise the 
price of bread and other food and goods were announced last month 
they set off a wave of panic buying 
the official yuri maslyukov chairman of the government agency 
that plans the centralized economy spoke with reporters during a 
break at a session of the supreme soviet legislature 
lawmakers were debating a resolution on the economic program 
presented last month by premier nikolai i ryzhkov the resolution 
calls for faster and more radical steps to make the switch from 
central planning to a market economy 
we cant stretch the elastic we have to begin work now 
alexei boiko chairman of an economic reform commission told 
parliamentary deputies urging the speeding up of the program 
the draft resolution would instruct the government to cut 
spending immediately on the military and the state bureaucracy 
it would also give the government until september to make 
concrete proposals for faster economic reforms including drafting 
laws on creation of a stock market commercial banks and credit and 
a federal reserve bank 
but opposition surfaced during debate and the resolution was 
likely to change drastically by days end 
ryzhkov the economic plans architect told reporters he 
supported the resolution the project was worked on by 
commissions and is fairly objective and allows us to work 
further he said but he said it would be difficult to complete 
all the laws and practical measures by the autumn deadline 
todays proposal did not address the ryzhkov plans price 
increases for most consumer products which are due to take effect 
in january the ryzhkov plan was criticized for raising prices 
without freeing enough goods and prices from government control to 
allow a true transition to a market economy 
particularly unpopular was the proposal to at least double the 
price of bread the staple of the soviet diet currently bread is 
extremely cheap at about 30 cents a loaf 
ryzhkov admitted he was surprised at the swell of sentiment 
against the price increases he said he knew it would be difficult 
but to tell the truth i thought society was more prepared 
maslyukov said the plan for bread prices increases which would 
be linked to compensation for the public needed more work but he 
said nine of the 15 soviet republics had already agreed to raise 
their bread prices on august 1 with compensation beginning about 
two weeks earlier

israels supreme court accepted new evidence 
wednesday that the defense contends will support convicted nazi war 
criminal john demjanjuks assertion that he was a victim of 
mistaken identity 
demjanjuk a retired cleveland autoworker is appealing his 
april 1988 conviction and death sentence 
the justices admitted into evidence two affidavits from a former 
guard in the world war ii death camp in poland in which he stated 
that another ukrainian named ivan marchenko was posted with him 
there 
a man named ivan marchenko also is on a list from the main 
commission for investigation of hitlerite crimes in poland 
containing the names of some soviet prisoners of war who 
volunteered to join the nazis as guards the court also accepted 
that list 
demjanjuks defense lawyer yoram sheftel contends marchenko 
not demjanjuk is ivan the terrible a gaschamber operator at 
treblinka who tortured jews as they were herded in to die 
a week before the appeal hearing began may 14 the justices 
accepted testimony from a defense witness who identified marchenko 
as ivan the terrible the deposition came from kaziemiez dudek a 
liquor store owner whose wife was a prostitute who slept with ivan 
the terrible 
dudek identified ivan the terrible from a 1942 photograph that 
prosecutors allege is of demjanjuk but said his surname was 
marchenko 
these things are unequivocal they speak for themselves 
argued sheftel when they come and say ivan the terrible was 
marchenko the case is over 
marchenko is demjanjuks mothers maiden name which prosecutors 
claim demjanjuk used when visiting dudeks wife demjanjuk 
americanized his first name to john from the ukrainian ivan in 1958 
when he became a us citizen 
a threejudge trial court agreed with the prosecution that 
demjanjuk was the treblinka guard more than 850000 jews were 
murdered at the treblinka death camp in nazioccupied poland in 
19421943 
a ukrainian native demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistaken 
identity and says he spent those years in several german pow camps 
as a captured soviet soldier the 70yearold demjanjuk was 
extradited from ohio to israel in february 1986 
chief justice meir shamgar pressed sheftel on the significance 
of the different names in comparison with the identification by 
treblinka survivors of photographs of demjanjuk 
justice eliezer goldberg also questioned the importance of 
evidence coming more than two years after the trial ended 
today 100 witnesses could come here and tell stories he 
said

the forced return of burmese refugees 
to their homeland was condemned wednesday by a human rights group 
urging a halt to the deportations 
the usbased asia watch organization requested president bush 
to demand an end to thailands repatriation policy the group 
claims some burmese returnees are unwillingly pressed into military 
service and could be used as human mine sweepers 
thailands prime minister chatichai choonhavan is scheduled to 
meet with bush on thursday in washington 
thai police and troops last week forced about 1000 burmese 
civilians living in northwestern thailand to cross the moei river 
back into burma 
thai officials have said there is no danger for most refugees to 
return to burma since democratic reforms were endorsed in the 
nations first free elections in 30 years but there are still 
doubts whether the military will abide by the may 27 election 
results 
the thai government appears to be cynically exploiting the 
results of burmas elections in order to rid itself of a swelling 
population of refugees who have fled burma in fear of their 
lives said the statement seen wednesday in bangkok 
several minority groups in the rugged northern frontier area 
have been fighting the central rangoon government for autonomy for 
the past three decades 
the asia watch statement said there was no evidence that army 
soldiers have halted their systematic violations of human rights 
the group cited reports that thai police had burned the homes and 
belongings of those deported 
by late friday burmese authorities had received 766 people 
repatriated from thailand said government spokesman kyaw sann 
he said there were 27 camps along the border to receive the 
returnees and those resettled would be given plots of land 
but the asia watch statement said the returnees had been 
imprisoned in monasteries and temple compounds and only those 
with identity cards and able to pay 150 were freed 
others were forced into military service acting as porters or 
leading patrols through minefilled areas the group charges 
civilian porters compelled to serve as human mine sweepers for 
the army have offered numerous testimonies concerning the reckless 
disregard for human life routinely exhibited by the burmese army 
it added 
several human right organizations have accused the burmese army 
of murdering and abusing those it has pressed into its service

hours after oil began spewing from a burning 
supertanker in the gulf of mexico scientists in a windowless war 
room 2000 miles away scrambled to provide fast answers to 
salvage crews on the scene 
whenever poisonous explosive or otherwise dangerous substances 
are released into the nations waters telephones start ringing at 
the hazardous materials response branch 
we are by far and away the most experienced group in oil spill 
response worldwide no question said dave kennedy chief of 
scientific support coordinators at the war room which is the 
western regional headquarters of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration 
as fires raged aboard the mega borg off texas on saturday the 
research unit was already providing cleanup and coast guard crews 
with vital data predicting the course and effects of a slick from 
the norwegian supertanker 
two oceanographermodelers were sent to galveston to study 
currents and meteorological factors three experts from columbia 
sc assessed hazards to seafood beachgoers and shipping and two 
louisiana state university chemists analyzed the makeup of the 
vessels cargo of light crude 
tomes of information were being sifted by two information 
management specialists and a media specialist was sent to 
galveston on tuesday to field questions from reporters 
before the research unit was formed 14 years ago the coast 
guard and cleanup contractors were deluged with raw information 
and in many cases had no idea how to interpret it kennedy said 
were here basically to provide a formal mechanism for 
transferring scientific information to the operational response 
guys the coast guard 
the hazardousresponse team must answer a vast array of 
questions 
where would oil go if the vessel broke apart or sank how much 
would drift to the bottom how much would stay at the surface how 
much would be carried by currents beneath the surface 
what threat would the oil pose to shrimp oysters mussels and 
fish what would be the best way to minimize the damage would 
containment booms do any good if so where should they be placed 
how much air pollution has occurred what is the danger to 
corpus christi galveston and other populated areas along the coast 
what should be done about shipping traffic in the area 
while the threat of a catastrophic spill receded today the 
research unit still had plenty on its mind including spills in the 
arthur kill waterway between new york and new jersey buzzards bay 
in massachusetts and the connecticut river in connecticut 
the seattle control room is equipped with nautical charts and 
topographic maps for every coastline and major inland waterway 
theres a large map on one wall dotted with markings for offshore 
oil and gas drilling rigs weather monitoring platforms and buoys 
the latest location of the burning ship and the outer limits of the 
slick 
on a nearby bookshelf is an atlas listing shellfish and wetland 
areas industrial and shipping sites bathing beaches and other 
shoreline assets 
this is what we call our war room kennedy said 
i worked about 18 hours yesterday you worked what about 24 
hours he said to a woman poring over computer printouts 
the unit has grown from 10 people in 1976 to 60 today including 
about 35 specialists ready to fly out at any moment and eight 
regional coordinators stationed around the country 
practically every available staffer was assigned to prince 
william sound after the exxon valdez tanker hit a reef and spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons of heavy crude oil in 1989 kennedy said 
about eight staffers are still monitoring the cleanup 
this spill is not on a level of intensity with the exxon 
valdez kennedy said but his team learned from that disaster to 
anticipate the worst 
we all said the weather is good the currents arent too 
bad we ought to be able to keep the oil from reaching shore he 
said then we had a windstorm come up and drive the oil not just 
to the shore but far beyond where the tide would normally reach 
weve gotten more skeptical

the soviet union on wednesday briefed china about 
the ussoviet summit in the latest of a flurry of chinesesoviet 
contacts 
moscow and beijing normalized relations last year during a visit 
by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the two communist powers had split over ideological differences 
in the late 1950s and came close to going to war after several 
bloody border clashes in 1969 
the official xinhua news agency said the soviet deputy foreign 
minister igor rogachov met with chinese foreign minister qian 
qichen to discuss the ussoviet summit in washington at the 
beginning of june 
the report quoted qian as saying china supports efforts by 
washington and moscow to improse ties 
qian said china welcomed the strategic arms reduction agreement 
reached at the summit the agreement however was little more than 
a statement of what had already been accomplished and was not 
considered a breakthrough in arms reduction talks 
we hope that the soviet union and the united states will 
as soon as possible reach a detailed agreement and put it into 
practice qian said 
the two leaders also discussed sinosoviet relations cambodia 
and other international affairs xinhua said it said the two sides 
decided that the fifth round of sinosoviet border talks would 
begin on july 26 in moscow 
the two sides have been holding talks to resolve territorial 
disputes along the border since 1987 in february chinese and 
soviet military experts agreed both sides should cut forces along 
the 4300mile frontier 
rogachovs visit is the latest in a series of recent sinosoviet 
exchanges 
last month the soviet union sent its highestranking communist 
party delegation to china since the two nations normalized ties 
earlier this month the soviet national defense ministrys 
director of foreign affairs rear admiral v hujokov visited 
beijing to increase contacts between the two armies 
at the same time the vice chairman of chinas central military 
commission liu huaqing was in moscow 
soviet chief of general staff mikhail moiseyev said that during 
lius visit the two sides agreed to begin building their 
military relations on a new basis according to a xinhua dispatch 
moiseyev said the two sides also agreed to establish economic 
relations and added that improving military relations was a 
natural process

the government is dispatching more 
policemen and soldiers to the drug capital of medellin where 
cartelhired assassins have killed more than 100 police this year 
authorities said wednesday 
a medellin police spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
said 220 men from an elite antidrug police unit would join the 
4000member police force already in the city 
that follows word that another 350 soldiers would be sent to 
medellin gen jesus armando arias announced that mobilization at a 
news conference tuesday 
medellin colombias second largest city has about 3 million 
residents 
officials say 106 policemen have been killed in the city so far 
this year drug traffickers in april offered a 4300 bounty for 
each police officer killed 
the latest killings came tuesday night in western medellin 
three unidentified assailants opened fire with machine guns on a 
truck carrying the bodyguards of the regional police commander 
a medellin police spokeman told the associated press that two 
police agents were killed in the attack 
the medellin cartel boasted in a communique tuesday night that 
it has killed even more police than officials say 
the cartel which calls itself the extraditables said the 
murder of policemen is a response to the sackings the tortures 
and the murders of our companions and of innocent people in poor 
neighborhoods 
it blamed police for violence that has left 107 people dead in 
medellin authorities say most of the killings result from gang 
rivalry and scoresettling among opposing drug factions 
in their statement tuesday the extraditables said officials 
they have managed to frighten many police officers into quitting 
the colombian people should be told the truth about the 
resignations and desertions and it would also be nice if the real 
number of deaths suffered by the institution were not hidden or 
diminished the statement said 
the drug traffickers have been pressuring the government to end 
its war on drugs under which traffickers have been extradited to 
face trial in the united states

a white house move to ease immigration 
restrictions for an international aids conference has not swayed 
the more than 100 groups that plan to boycott next weeks event 
aids activists said wednesday 
the activists releasing the american edition of an 
international study on aids discrimination said the us 
immigration limits are part of a worldwide pattern thats spreading 
fear as widespread and destructive as the virus itself 
martin foreman author of the panos institute report said more 
than 100 groups are boycotting the conference despite a new 10day 
visa the united states announced in april for aidsinfected 
foreigners who want to attend the conference 
groups listed as boycotting the 6th international conference on 
aids include the international league of the red cross the 
european community the canadian public health association the 
world council of churches and the roman catholic churchs charity 
group caritas international 
the san francisco meeting is june 2024 
one of the purposes of the conference which is the free 
international exchange of information has already been defeated 
foreman said 
the immigration and naturalization service had denied entry to 
the united states to anyone with acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome one of a handful of diseases that bar entry to the 
country 
those applying for the new visa dont have to reveal whether 
they are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
which causes aids but aids activists said the limited visa sends 
the wrong message to those already facing discrimination 
carol wolchok director of the american bar associations 
immigration law implementation project said the aba believes those 
who have the hiv virus should not be barred entry to the country 
leaving hiv on the list of highly contagious diseases is 
counterproductive she said it fosters a false sense of 
security that the united states can isolate itself from hiv 
foreman said that although many groups are officially boycotting 
the conference some may send observers who wont attend in an 
official capacity 
the londonbased panos institute is a nonprofit international 
organization that studies environmental and development issues

the white house today hailed moscows decision 
to ease its economic blockade against lithuania we welcome this 
announcement president bushs spokesman said 
the statement was issued by marlin fitzwater after the tass news 
agency quoted lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene as 
saying the soviet union agreed to restore some fuel and raw 
material supplies 
the supplies were cut off two months ago to force lithuania to 
drop its declaration of independence 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev met in moscow on tuesday 
with leaders of the baltic republics bush said today he hoped that 
meeting was the first step toward ending the crisis over the 
secessionist republics 
shortly after bush made his comments at a news conference tass 
reported the easing the economic blockade 
fitzwater referring to tuesdays meeting and the easing of the 
sanctions said we welcome this announcement together with the 
beginning of the dialogue yesterday these are positive steps 
bush opened a news conference with outoftown reporters by 
applauding gorbachevs meeting on tuesday with the presidents of 
lithuania estonia and latvia 
i think it was good news i dont want to overstate it but i 
was very pleased to see this occur in the wake of what i think was 
a successful summit meeting bush said 
bush said gorbachevs decision to meet with the three presidents 
represents a very significant change thats occured in the soviet 
union 
we applaud president gorbachevs meeting with the baltic 
presidents he said 
i hope that what we saw yesterday is a first step in a 
dialogue that will lead to the selfdetermination that we strongly 
support bush said 
the president also renewed his call for moscow to lift its 
economic boycott against lithuania 
at the same time bush criticized moscow for its continued 
support of cuban leader fidel castro the soviets ought to stop 
spending 5 billion a year in cuba he said 
i would not accept the idea that this is the time to change 
our policy with regard to fidel castro bush said 
in a session that covered a range of subjects bush also 
promised again a decision within days on restricting oil drilling 
off the coasts of florida and california its a very hot item 
bush said 
he said he still had not gotten all the information he needs to 
make a final decision on the longdelayed administration policy on 
drilling on the outer continental shelf 
on another pending environmental issue bush said he was 
searching for a compromise that would result in protecting the 
northern spotted owl without throwing people out of work in the 
pacific northwest 
the administration must decide this month whether to declare the 
owl an endangered species such a designation would shut off vast 
tracts of forest to timber operations 
i am very much concerned about the potential loss of jobs 
bush said 
bush also underscored his policy against normalizing relations 
with iran until all our hostages are out bush said six 
americans continue to be held by proiranian factions in lebanon 
the president also voiced optimism toward resolution of the 
crisis in the baltics on tuesday both in a session with reporters 
in the rose garden and again at a republican fundraising dinner 
the president praised gorbachevs decision to discuss the 
impasse directly on tuesday with lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis and with the leaders of the two other baltic states 
i hope that out of that comes a further step towards 
selfdetermination for the baltics bush told reporters i 
think thats a heartening development bush said 
the audience of more than 4000 at the annual presidents dinner 
which coincided with bushs birthday stood and sang happy 
birthday mr president organizers said the banquet generated 
69 million for republican congressional candidates 
i feel it in my bones we can get the majority of the 
senate bush said 
the president took questions from reporters after a rose garden 
event to promote his campaign for a constitutional amendment 
banning flagdesecration 
bush said flag desecration is unacceptable and must carry a 
price and asked congress to pass the amendment in the aftermath 
of this weeks supreme court ruling striking down an 
antiflagburning law 
on another subject bush said theres quite a bit going on 
behind the scenes but he wasnt ready yet to announce his 
decision on suspending talks with the palestine liberation 
organization 
the administration has called on plo leaders to renounce 
specifically the may 30 attack on an israeli beach by palestinian 
guerillas and to punish those responsible for it 
bush said he had discussed the incident on the phone earlier 
tuesday with egyptian president hosni mubarak 
i want to see that terrorist act condemned and those who did 
it condemned he added 
the plo issued a statement on monday renouncing terrorism but 
did not specifically renounce the beach attack

retail sales fell again in may posting their 
first consecutive threemonth decline since the last recession the 
government said wednesday 
analysts saw the report as a reflection of fading consumer 
confidence 
consumer confidence was down in may said economist sandra 
shaber of the futures group a washington management consulting 
firm maybe the poor job market and very weak wage gains are 
having an effect 
the commerce department said sales skidded 07 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 14684 billion after falling 09 percent in 
april and 04 percent in march sales had not fallen for three 
straight months since the fall of 1981 
sales were even worse in april and march than first reported 
commerce had said originally that sales were down 06 percent in 
april and 02 percent a month earlier they were unchanged in 
february after rising 28 percent the previous month 
retail sales represent about half of consumer spending which 
has been a driving force since the 198182 recession overall 
consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of the nations 
economic activity 
but most economists believed the economy would continue to skirt 
a recession although its growth would be weak for months to come 
this does not necessarily indicate that the economy is in a 
recession or headed in that direction since there are signs of 
buoyancy elsewhere such as in exports and capital investment 
said economist gordon richards of the national association of 
manufacturers nevertheless the slackening of sales indicate a 
weak second quarter and probably an even weaker third quarter 
ms shaber also said the report was not the last nail in the 
coffin of recession and could lead to promotional activity such 
as lower prices she said that would be good news for inflation 
on the other hand s jay levy of levy economic forecasts in 
chappaqua ny said its an indication of a recessionary 
trend his organization contends there is a 60 percent chance the 
economy will slide into a recession this year 
levy and ms shaber both pointed to the weak job market where 
most recent gains reflected temporary government hiring of census 
workers while employment losses continued at factories and in the 
construction industry 
automobile sales a major component of retail sales dropped 06 
percent after a 16 percent decline in april 
the manufacturing sector including the automobile industry has 
been dampened by federal reserve efforts to keep interest rates 
high so the economy would not overheat and fuel inflation 
but even excluding automobiles sales were down 08 percent in 
may in fact sales were off in every sector except for clothing 
and ms shaber said that was on sale apparel and accessory 
sales rose 24 percent 
overall sales of durable goods bigticket items like cars that 
are interestsensitive because they often are made through loans 
fell 11 percent after sliding 17 percent in april building 
materials plunged 42 percent and furniture and other home 
furnishings fell 11 percent 
nondurable goods such as food and clothing slid 05 percent 
the same as in april declines were posted for general department 
and grocery stores both down 10 percent gasoline stations down 
16 percent drug stores down 13 percent and restaurants and 
bars down 05 percent

about nuclear research and other topics to east germany for 20

expected to hinge on the issue of whether the information he 
divulged was genuinely top secret

grant to study abroad but he said he would not have been allowed 
to accept it unless the secret service approved

authorization of the security services he said dont forget 
this was during the cold war they wanted to be able to contact me 
at any moment and i had to learn how to code and decode messages

west german woman while living in paris 
judge maurice colomb asked if dobbertin still considered himself 
a marxist as he was in his youth 
marxism doesnt have a big future in the east dobbertin 
replied

years during complex legal proceedings before being released on 
bail in 1983 he has resumed his post at frances national center

army as chief of civil aeronautics

hours earlier they contacted the plane carrying president 
violeta barrios de chamorro and threatened to strike before her 
flight from costa rica could land the workers eventually allowed 
the plane to land before their sandinistacontrolled union shut 
down air traffic 
the controllers are protesting the removal of alejandro 
arguello a major in the sandinistacontrolled army as chief of 
civil aeronautics 
the walkout represents the second time since mrs chamorros 
prous government took over from the leftist sandinistas on april 
25 that the air traffic controllers have struck the first time in 
midmay was in support of other civil servants who walked off the 
job demanding higher pay 
the strikes are occurring as mrs chamorro is struggling to 
solidify her power and improve the nations economy which was 
devastated by a decade of fighting between the usbacked contra 
rebels and the leftist sandinistas 
she was about five minutes from landing when we transmitted 
the message to the pilot controller daniel gonzalez said in a 
telephone interview 
the message was that the air traffic controllers wanted to talk 
to mrs chamorro but she couldnt come to the cockpit because 
of her knee he said mrs chamorro who suffered a recent knee 
fracture walks with a cane 
jorge saballos another controller said the controllers read a 
communique protesting arguellos dismissal and demanded the 
government abide by a may strike agreement promising not to fire 
public employees he said the controllers spoke briefly with 
interior minister carlos hurtado by radio 
they allowed the plane to land after being assured that 
government representatives would speak in person with the 
controllers gonzalez said 
once the plane landed hurtado and presidential spokesman danilo 
lacayo spoke to the controllers but nothing was resolved 
air traffic controller orlando ortega said passengers planes 
were allowed to leave nicaraguan air space tuesday 
as soon as they all left we proceeded to shut down the 
airspace until talks start ortega said 
the controllers want to talk with construction minister jaime 
icabalceta who fired arguello last week after civil aeronautics 
was transfered from the air force to the construction ministry 
ortega said the controllers let an iberia flight land today 
because it carried medicine ortega said four flights that were 
supposed to arrive in managua today had been canceled

airlines 
lacayo hurtado and icabalceta reportedly were in a cabinet 
meeting with mrs chamorro

the president has indicated he might 
suspend a plan to route soviet emigres through finland unless 
israel says it will not settle soviet jews in the occupied 
territories newspapers said wednesday 
president mauno koivisto on tuesday told 20 newspaper editors he 
had made the demands on jewish settlement to israeli president 
chaim herzog who visited in may koivistos remarks were printed 
in newspapers wednesday 
koivisto said israel had reacted somewhat inadequately to 
his demands the uusi suomi newspaper reported the daily quoted 
koivisto as saying negotiations between israel and finland over the 
plan had broken off 
finnish officials said in may they were completing a plan with 
israel to be a transit point for thousands of soviet jews 
president mauno koivisto had said the plan would go into effect in 
late may 
officially finland has not linked the transit of soviet jews 
with guarantees from israel but it is clear that the transfer can 
only begin when jerusalem has changed its current superficial 
attitude uusi suomi wrote 
in jerusalem iris benshahal spokeswoman for a jewish agency 
helping to settle jewish immigrants said the threat was 
significant because finland is one of four major routes to get 
soviet emigrants to israel 
the other three routes are through hungary romania and poland 
the israelis have said that israel is a free country which we 
dont particularly doubt but we dont see that it concerns the 
occupied territories helsinki sanomat the leading daily quoted 
koivisto as saying 
there is the possibility of interpreting this in such a 
way that israel considers the occupied territories as belonging to 
them the newspaper quoted koivisto as saying 
since the reform initiatives introduced by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev record levels of soviet jews have left the 
soviet union under freer emigration laws many have chosen to 
emigrate to israel 
but arab leaders have expressed concern that the soviet jews 
expected to number 750000 over the next years will be settled in 
the israelioccupied gaza strip and west bank the territories were 
taken from the arabs in the 1967 middle east war 
at a recent superpower summit in washington president bush and 
gorbachev asked jerusalem not to settle soviet jews in the 
territories home to 17 million palestinians and 700000 jewish 
settlers 
israel says jerusalem has no policy of settling jews in the 
territories but immigrants can live where they choose 
israels absorption minister yitzhak peretz said wednesday 
that 43128 soviet immigrants arrived in israel this year joining 
another 13000 who arrived in 1989 he said 318 have settled in the 
west bank

lithuanias prime minister said today the soviet 
government has agreed to restore some fuel and raw material 
supplies to the baltic republic easing an embargo imposed two 
months ago tass reported 
prime minister kazimiera prunskiene made the comment after 
meeting with kremlin officials today the soviet news agency said 
there are no doubts about the lifting of the economic 
blockade this was stated quite explicitly tass quoted 
prunskiene as saying after she met with soviet prime minister 
nikolai ryzhkov 
mrs prunskiene said she had reached an agreement with ryzhkov 
on a partial increase of the supply of natural gas and raw 
materials to some enterprises in the republic tass said 
she also said the soviet government intends to review the 
question of renewing the supply of fuel for lithuanian agriculture 
mrs prunskiene was quoted by tass as saying her republic would 
carefully discuss the question of freezing the republics march 
11 declaration of independence for the duration of negotiations 
with the soviet government 
tass quoted ryzhkov as describing todays encounter as the 
beginning of a concrete dialogue on the question of future 
negotiations 
the reported breakthrough in the impasse between lithuania and 
moscow was hailed today by the white house we welcome this 
announcement said a spokesman for president bush marlin 
fitzwater together with the beginning of the dialogue yesterday 
these are positive steps 
on tuesday president mikhail s gorbachev met with the 
presidents of lithuania latvia and estonia after having refusing 
for weeks to negotiate with the secessionist baltic republics 
unless they agreed to abide by the soviet constitution 
president vytautas landsbergis of lithuania hinted then that the 
kremlin might soon end the economic embargo imposed on his republic 
ryzhkov who attended the session said earlier today there was 
progress on the impasse over the baltic states independence 
declarations 
the republics want independence lost when they were forcibly 
annexed by the soviet union in 1940 latvia and estonia have taken 
more cautious steps toward independence than lithuania 
gorbachev stopped shipments of all oil most natural gas and 
other raw materials to lithuania on april 18 to pressure the 
republic into rescinding proindependence laws the embargo cut off 
all of lithuanias oil and much of its natural gas and certain raw 
materials and put 26000 citizens out of work 
before todays reported agreement lithuania had said it was 
willing to negotiate on rolling back its independence laws but 
steadfastly had refused to revoke its declaration of secession 
the united states became involved in the standoff when lawmakers 
in congress suggested they would not approve a trade pact signed 
during the superpower summit in washington until gorbachev opened 
negotiations with the baltic republics and lifted the economic 
embargo he imposed on lithuania 
the trade agreement would expand opportunities for american 
companies wishing to do business in the soviet union by reducing 
red tape and providing greater protections against copyright piracy 
the pact is important because it also could clear the way for 
the united states to grant mostfavorednation trade status to the 
soviet union a benefit that could help gorbachev in his efforts to 
reform the nations economy 
congress has indicated it will not stand in the way of the bush 
administration granting the improved trading status once the trade 
pact is approved and the soviets pass laws guaranteeing jews the 
right to emmigrate

the bush administration faced with growing 
furor over what some consider offensive art has begun talks with 
congressional republicans on restricting grants awarded by the 
national endowment for the arts a congressman said wednesday 
rep paul henry dmich said after a meeting with nea chairman 
paul frohnmayer that the administration had dropped its previous 
strong opposition to any type of content restrictions or standards 
in a bill to extend the life of the agency 
the change comes as congressional concern is increasing over 
federal subsidies going to arts projects that some consider 
obscene pornographic or sacrilegious 
i think weve reached a point that if youre going to rescue 
the nea you have to speak forthrightly about what receives public 
support henry said the members have gotten so much mail on 
this that theyre tired of the political baggage of it 
house speaker thomas s foley said he expected a bipartisan 
agreement on the issue and a house vote by midjuly 
both house and senate subcommittees considering nea bills sent 
the legislation to the full committees wednesday without making a 
decision on restrictions 
we will have to deal with this controversy in the full 
committee said sen orrin hatch rutah it will not be swept 
under the rug 
rep pat williams dmont said no agreement had been reached 
and that he understood the bush administration continued to oppose 
writing new restrictions into law 
all along the white house the nea and a majority in the 
congress have recognized the political reality that there will be 
some changes in the nea williams said what those are to be we 
dont know and theres no agreement 
the bush administration originally proposed a five year 
reauthorization or extension of the life of the nea without any 
restrictions on what types of art may or may not receive public 
support 
faced with growing republican sentiment for some kind of 
restrictions the administration last week proposed as an 
alternative an interim oneyear to threeyear extension while an 
independent commission studied the problem 
henry said the latest development was a recognition that leaving 
the matter to nea officials would not satisfy congress 
he said frohnmayer representing the bush administration 
acknowledged for the first time that there is a difference between 
censorship and deciding that some art may be inappropriate for 
taxpayers financial support 
the nea said in a formal statement that it would not comment on 
the deliberations or any proposals for content restrictions 
henry a republican moderate in the nea debate is a member of 
williams education subcommittee and has taken a leading role in 
recent days in negotiating between various factions 
henry declined to detail what he will propose but said he was 
continuing to talk with frohnmayer in private he said he hoped to 
come up with language that affirmatively states what types of art 
will be supported 
he said neither the nea nor white house had agreed to any 
specifics so far 
sen strom thurmond rsc warned the nea that people over 
there had better understand the feeling of the american people 
he said the public is sick and tired of promiscuous art 
some conservatives led by rep dana rohrabacher rcalf have 
been pressing for strong prohibitions on what they call 
antireligious or morally reprehensible art 
the controversy was triggered a year ago over the works of two 
photographers one whose images depicted homoerotic scenes and the 
other showing a crucifix in a jar of urine

communist party leaders are borrowing ideas from 
conservative and reformminded challengers for a new platform they 
hope will prevent the first major split in ranks since lenin a 
politburo member said wednesday 
but less than three weeks before the opening of the 28th party 
conference many party members and observers expect more breaks in 
the party structure as it tries to control a rapidly changing 
soviet society 
we are trying to develop the broadest possible platform 
politburo member vadim a medvedev told a news conference 
medvedev said the platform will include some reformist policies 
but not totally break with orthodox marxistleninist ideology such 
as social organizations and party cells among workers 
although he declined to outline the entire platform proposal 
medvedev said it will not accommodate the democratic platforms 
call to turn the communist party into a parliamentary body 
he said separate structures in the party are unacceptable 
if we are talking about such fractions there is no sense in 
being in the party it should splinter and set up its own party 
he said 
democratic platform the main reform group within the party is 
scheduled to meet this weekend to discuss strategy for the 
congress which begins july 2 
democratic platform leaders have predicted the congress will be 
dominated by moderates and that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev would not push through enough changes to recapture 
disenchanted party members 
the group is demanding the party give up control of newspapers 
and property and dismantle party cells in the army kgb the 
police and factories 
it also opposes one person serving as both party chief and the 
nations president as gorbachev now does 
party data released by medvedev on wednesday indicates 43 
percent of the congress delegates chosen so far are members of the 
party apparatus considered as among the most resistant to change 
because their jobs depend on the partys continued influence 
among the more than 4000 delegates already elected to the 
4700seat congress the number of workers and farmers has dropped 
drastically from the last congress medvedev said 
fortytwo percent of the delegates in 1986 were workers and 9 
percent were farmers medvedev said this years figures so far are 
116 percent and 48 percent respectively 
he said an extra 350 representatives for workers and farmers 
will be invited to the congress which will decide whether they may 
vote 
members of the apparatus likely will approve the proposed party 
platform obediently said vyacheslav shostakovsky a democratic 
platform leader and the rector of moscows higher party school 
shostakovsky however said he was pesimistic the congress would 
implement major changes 
democratic platform leaders say they expect support from about 
500000 of the communist partys 18 million members 
but they have only about 100 delegates so far for the congress 
philosopher igor chubais suggested democratic platform could 
hurt its own popularity by lambasting the increasingly unpopular 
communists 
an anticommunist mood is growing this is a fact he said 
the attitude to the very idea of communism is very negative 
i would appeal not for reform but for distancing ourselves 
from the soviet communist party

at least 3 million gallons of oil leaked 
from the fireravaged supertanker in the gulf of mexico but most 
of it has burned or evaporated the coast guard said today 
coast guard capt thomas greene said crews found a hole in a 
center tank in the 886foot mega borg 
a minimum of 3 million gallons has left the cargo tanks and 
im presuming that most of that has gone into the water greene 
told reporters i dont see any risk of losing cargo from the 
other tanks 
he said between 12000 gallons and 40000 gallons remained in 
the waters of the gulf of mexico today 
greene said an oil sheen stretching 12 miles from the mega borg 
had begun forming into tar balls he said he expected the balls to 
wash ashore but could not determine where they might land or how 
soon 
salvage boats and coast guard ships were skimming the water and 
using floating barriers to try to corral the slick 
the norwegian ship was loaded with 38 million gallons of light 
crude oil when it was rocked by a series of engineroom explosions 
early saturday official said they were not sure if 
flamesmothering foam would be used as planned 
on tuesday firefighters spraying water on the searing deck 
boarded the ship and declared the fire controlled nearly four days 
after the first of a series of explosions ripped through the vessel 
57 miles southeast of galveston 
theyre smothering the fire petty officer gene maestas said 
today there are occasional flareups on board and there is some 
steam coming from the water being pour on it but they are not 
using the foam yet and im not sure they will 
the blasts on saturday and fire left the ship with one deck 
awash and crews had feared it would break up or sink with its 
cargo 
in gaining the upper hand on the blaze firefighters solved one 
problem but may have created another 
what appears to be happening that since they are getting the 
fire under control is its not burning up as much oil and more oil 
is getting in the water said coast guard lt jg robert garrott 
the norwegian government opened a hearing today in galveston to 
interview crew members who were aboard when the tanker exploded 
while transferring cargo to a smaller vessel two of the 41 crewmen 
died two were missing and presumed dead and 17 were injured none 
seriously 
this will be purely fact finding norwegian consul general 
erik leikvang said 
the cause of the explosion is unknown 
five fireboats and a hose placed on the deck by firefighters 
continued dousing the burning stern aircraft dropped about 9000 
gallons of oil dispersant 
pemex the mexican government oil monopoly said that at the 
us governments request it sent the 146foot vessel that sucks 
up oil and water at the rate of 84000 gallons an hour separates 
out the oil and stores it 
thick gray smoke and steam surrounded the hulk replacing the 
balls of flame and towering columns of black smoke that had risen 
from the vessel 
ted hoskins who heads the salvage operation boarded the ship 
with a crew tuesday and declared the fire under control greene 
said 
our latest videos we got i can see no fire visible greene 
said tuesday he said there were still flames beneath the deck 
an 825foot britishregistered tanker stood by to begin 
receiving the remainder of the mega borgs cargo 
greene said that operation could be dangerous because the ship 
is listing and crews might have to pump water into the holds to 
keep the vessel balanced the ships rear has dropped more than 60 
feet and remained awash today 
were feeling fairly confident at this point but were not 
going to really breathe easy until the oil is back in a terminal 
petty officer todd nelson said 
the mega borg carried more than three times as much oil as was 
spilled by the exxon valdez off alaska in march 1989 in the 
nations worst oil spill 
coast guard officials said the light crude would disperse more 
easily than the exxon valdezs heavy crude but environmentalists 
said they still fear the oil will reach bays and estuaries where it 
will be toxic to birds and shellfish 
currents and winds were expected to push escaping oil toward a 
200mile stretch of coast between freeport and corpus christi but 
the coast guard said the currents also were expected to keep the 
spill from coming ashore 
the tanker operated by mosvolds shipping of farsund norway 
was bound from palanca angola it was scheduled to travel to aruba 
after galveston 
elf trading inc a houston subsidiary of a french oil and gas 
company owned the cargo and said it would participate in the 
cleanup

a west german businessman accused 
of helping build an alleged chemical weapons plant in libya 
testified wednesday that he was involved but didnt know the 
factory would make arms 
juergen hippenstielimhausen exdirector of the imhausenchemie 
company said he had suspicions the project would be in conflict 
with west germanys export laws but did not investigate because 
he didnt want to lose the business 
west german prosecutors government and security officials have 
said they have proof the plant in the libyan desert was made to 
produce poison gas libya denies it 
hippenstiel 49 whose trial began monday in mannheim district 
court is charged with violating west germanys export laws and 
evading taxes in connection with the 136 million project 
reading from a prepared statement hippenstiel said the project 
in rabta libya south of tripoli got its start in 1984 when a 
middleman contacted him about building a chemical plant to make 
pharmaceuticals and insecticides 
hippenstiel said that as head of imhausenchemie located in 
lahr in southern west germany near mannheim he participated in 
construction of the rabta factory by delivering production plans 
and equipment for the project 
the former company manager said he was sorry he had caused what 
he called diplomatic problems for west germany because of the 
deal with libya 
the responsibility and overall management of the project was 
in my hands hippenstiel said 
west germanys national television said hippenstiels statement 
appeared to confirm that he was aware poison gas could be produced 
at the rabta plant however hippenstiel did not admit that in his 
statement 
the trim bespectacled hippenstiel faces tax evasion charges in 
connection with payments for helping build the plant 
hippenstiel admitted not paying taxes on 117 million on 
profits from his transactions he said however that he did not 
keep the money for himself but used it to ensure the project in 
rabta would be completed 
the libyan plant scandal first came to light in december 1988 
when the united states government charged that west german 
companies were providing massive assistance for construction of a 
chemical factory capable of producing poison gas 
west german government officials at first denied any of the 
countrys companies were involved but later acknowledged the 
allegations were true 
hippenstiel headed the company that allegedly was the key 
supplier of equipment construction plans and technical expertise 
to develop the project 
a 100page indictment alleges that hippenstiel played a leading 
role in the project from 1984 to 1988 when he headed the chemical 
company 
in opening arguments prosecutor hansheiko klein said 
hippenstiel had delivered plans and documents as well as providing 
material valued at 12 million 
the primary allegations against the defendant revolved around 
violations of west german export laws designed to hinder any 
participation in such illegal projects abroad 
hippenstiel has been held in prison for the last 14 months 
awaiting the start of his trial more than 60 witnesses are 
expected to be heard at the trial which is not expected to be 
completed until sometime in september

a black businessman who gained the gop 
nomination for lieutenant governor during a runoff against a ku 
klux klan sympathizer said his victory shows how far the south has 
come since 1957 
kenneth muskie harris on tuesday drubbed ralph forbes a 
former american nazi who wound down his campaign with an appearance 
at a kkk rally saturday 
another black candidate south carolina state sen theo 
mitchell soundly defeated state sen ernest passailaigue in the 
democratic gubernatorial primary mitchell would be that states 
first black governor if he defeated popular republican gov 
carroll campbell 
in one other election tuesday with racial overtones the first 
black mayor of atlantic city nj james l usry was ousted by a 
white challenger in a runoff usry was recently indicted on 
corruption charges 
voters also elected the first black mayor of trenton nj 
chose congressional candidates in maine and rejected a sales tax 
increase in north dakota 
after his triumph in arkansas harris said everybody wants to 
live in 57 but 57s dead this is the 1990s 
federal troops were sent to little rock in 1957 to ensure the 
safety of nine black students who were admitted to central high 
school under a federal court order 
harris nonetheless is an underdog in his effort to become the 
first black elected to such an office in arkansas his opponent in 
the nov 6 general election is democrat jim guy tucker a former 
congressman and attorney general 
im glad that the election came out the way it did tucker 
said we need to send a message that the vote for mr forbes 
wasnt representative of the people of arkansas and thats good 
two weeks ago forbes got 46 percent of the 71000 votes in a 
threeway race harris got 36 percent to force a runoff and robert 
breaux of little rock got 18 percent 
the final breakdown tuesday was harris 27548 forbes 4432 
harris gained 1876 votes in 14 days forbes lost 28753 about 
38000 fewer voters turned out for the runoff than for the may 29 
primary 
we have finally rejected the old tactics of the kkk and the 
neonazis and white supremacists effort to deceive the public 
said harris who became the states second black in the 20th 
century to be nominated for a constitutional office 
the 36yearold former university of arkansas defensive back is 
a propertymanagement executive with jm products inc a little 
rock company that manufactures haircare products for blacks 
i believe arkansas future is secure by the wisdom of her 
public godfearing people who understand that our destiny should 
not be dictated by hatred power politics or oneparty domination 
but by the competent ideas of leadership said harris 
even forbes said wednesday that his loss had a lot to do with 
the fear of some voters that arkansas image would be tainted if a 
ku klux klan sympathizer won a statewide race 
i think thats part of it he said people fell for that 
arkansas image stuff we as a state have a real problem with 
selfimage i was hoping to counter that on the issues 
forbes refused to concede and threatened to challenge the 
election ill never concede he said i feel like a winner

a black militant leader on 
wednesday called african national congress talks with the whiteled 
south african government premature and a sellout 
bennie alexander generalsecretary of the pan africanist 
congress said the government must agree to a oneperson onevote 
democracy before meaningful discussions can take place 
if the government says it is against the principle of 
majority rule then there is no basis for talks alexander told 
a group of foreign journalists we do not see a democractic 
solution in the very near future 
president fw de klerks government held preliminary talks last 
month with the anc in a bid to resolve obstacles to fullscale 
negotiations on a new constitution and ending apartheid the anc is 
countrys leading black opposition group 
there is a perception among the masses that to talk to the 
government now is selling out alexander said the radical 
youth consider it a sellout 
asked if he agreed alexander said yes 
de klerk says he wants the 5 million whites and 28 million 
blacks to share power he opposes outright black majority rule 
saying it will replace white domination with black domination he 
envisions a mechanism that will give whites veto power on major 
policy decisions 
the government has said it is ready to negotiate a new 
constitution with the anc and other black opposition groups 
however the anc has set preconditions for formal negotiations 
that include the release of some 3000 activists convicted of 
politically motivated crimes and the return of an estimated 20000 
exiles 
the pan africanist congress broke away from the much larger anc 
in 1959 and is considered more militant and ideological although 
the policies of the two groups are similar 
both favor a oneperson onevote political system 
socialistoriented economic policies and both wage largely 
ineffective guerrilla campaigns 
the pan africanists draw much of their support from black 
intellectuals and radical youths their supporters often chant 
one settler one bullet a reference to whites whom the 
organization considers colonialists 
youthful supporters of the two groups have battled each other in 
several townships recently the organizations reached a peace 
agreement tuesday in the vosloorus township east of johannesburg

press freedom has been enshrined for the first 
time in soviet law but doubts remain about whether the long debate 
was worth it and whether it means much in a country that cannot 
produce enough newsprint to ensure it 
the supreme soviet legislature on tuesday approved a law that 
places in the legal code a key element of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs glasnost policy the medias freedom from any kind of 
censorship 
the press and other mass media are free the law says 
censorship of the mass media is forbidden 
strict control of the media was a hallmark of soviet rule for 
decades a journalists role was first to be an agitator for 
communist party policies and second to be a source of information 
the limited reports of the state or partyrun media defined what 
millions of people knew about their country and the outside world 
despite wide approval in the legislature the bill took months 
to be approved one prominent veteran of the dissident movement 
questioned publicly whether it even was necessary in an era of 
reform 
im afraid that my writing brothers will beat me with stones 
but is a law on the press necesary asked elena bonner in a 
recent edition of the weekly moscow news 
mrs bonner widow of human rights activist andrei d sakharov 
said press freedom could be guaranteed through changes that will be 
made in the soviet constitution 
in that case disputes can be settled by soviet courts in much 
the same way they are settled in the united states which 
guarantees freedom of press in its constitution 
the law guarantees the right for soviets to start their own 
publications but as soviets are finding in other cases the 
countrys poor economic condition places practical restrictions on 
their new legal rights 
production of paper and printing plants still are part of the 
staterun economy the economy cannot produce enough newsprint in 
the past couple of years subscriptions to many national newspapers 
and magazines have been restricted because of a lack of newsprint 
scores of unofficial papers have sprung up reflecting the 
countrys new thirst for poltics and debate their publishers must 
scramble to reach agreements with staterun printing houses to 
supply the paper they need 
rabochaya tribuna one dail newspaper said wednesday that 
shortages of newsprint place in question the single unarguable 
success of perestroika glasnost 
perestroika is russian for restructuring and glasnost means 
openness 
the newspaper visited a factory near gorky about 200 miles east 
of moscow where sakharov was exiled for almost seven years that 
produces about a third of the countrys newsprint 
it said the factory was built more than 60 years ago with 
foreign help and that foreign help is once again needed to 
modernize it 
but it accused the soviet bureaucracy of preventing the factory 
from keeping enough of the hard currency it earns to buy spare 
parts or new equipment 
wouldnt it be just to allow us to keep half of the hard 
currency we earn rather than 2 percent as is now done asked 
the factory director v lapukhin

the army expects to miss an april 1997 
deadline for destroying chemical weapons even though the bush 
administration says disposal of the arms will begin ahead of 
schedule a report released wednesday says 
the general accounting office said in the report that the armys 
disposal program has encountered several obstacles including 
environmental limitations community opposition and a shortfall in 
funds 
the investigative arm of congress found also that the projected 
cost of destroying the weapons has doubled from a preliminary 
estimate of 17 billion to 34 billion and will likely exceed the 
latest figure 
since current construction equipment and personnel 
requirements have continued to rise total program costs will 
increase even more the gao report said 
the agency attributed the cost increases to incomplete 
information the army used in its preliminary estimate and program 
changes to ensure safety 
the army said wednesday it had not reviewed the report and had 
no immediate comment 
the report came less than two weeks after a ussoviet 
agreement to reduce superpower chemical weapons stockpiles and the 
administrations announcement that it would begin destroying the 
weapons by the end of this year 
administration officials said the target date for the program is 
well ahead of the schedule set in the accord signed by president 
bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev during their us 
summit which ended june 3 
that pact requires each side to reduce its stockpile to 5000 
tons by 2002 although the soviets have no active facility for 
destroying their weapons 
the us and soviet union hold the worlds largest supplies of 
the weapons which can blister the skin or disturb the nervous 
system the united states says it has about 25000 tons of chemical 
agents the soviets claim to have 50000 tons 
destruction of the arms is supposed to begin by dec 31 1992 
the administration said destruction of the weapons now stored 
in west germany would begin at the johnston atoll plant on a 
remote pacific ocean island by the end of the year 
the plant was built to meet a 1985 congressional requirement to 
destroy all existing us chemical weapons by 1997 as a condition 
for approving a pentagon program to produce a new generation of 
such arms 
however the gao said that due to a ninemonth delay in the 
start of operational verification testing at johnston atoll the 
army believes that the overall program has slipped and that 
therefore the complete disposal of the chemical weapons stockpile 
by april 1997 is improbable 
in addition the army announced in 1988 that it planned to build 
similar disposal facilities at each of the eight chemical munitions 
storage sites in the continental united states 
the sites are tooele utah anniston ala pine bluff ark 
umatilla ore pueblo colo newport ind lexingtonblue grass 
ky and aberdeen md 
the gao said community opposition and environmental requirements 
could delay the construction of the additional sites 
in addition purchasing of equipment for the utah plant was 
delayed by a 37 million shortfall in funds for the fiscal year 
that began oct 1 1989 
the gao said also that the army faces community opposition in 
indiana kentucky and maryland that will put the armys disposal 
schedule in jeopardy

tamil guerrillas battled government 
troops in northern and eastern sri lanka on wednesday ignoring a 
ceasefire residents and military officials said wednesday 
unconfirmed reports reaching colombo said the tamil tiger rebels 
massacred at least 125 policemen who were among 600 officers 
captured when the tigers overran 11 police stations monday 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne said the report seems 
to be authentic but we have to doublecheck he characterized 
the situation as war 
in addition to the reported massacre of policemen as many as 90 
government soldiers tamil tigers and civilians may have been 
killed since monday according to reports compiled by residents 
military sources and the tigers officially the government has 
confirmed only the deaths of 16 soldiers 
the violence is the most serious since indian peacekeeping 
troops left sri lanka in march after an unsuccessful 32monthlong 
effort to disarm the tamil tigers 
it also raised the specter of a return to the allout war 
between the tigers and government forces that prevailed before the 
indians arrival on july 30 1987 
wijeratne said reports of the police massacre came from one 
policeman who survived and escaped he quoted the policeman as 
saying the tigers killed 150 of his colleagues military officials 
in colombo said the death toll could be between 125 and 150 
one of the officials quoted the policeman who escaped as saying 
the tigers on tuesday told him and his colleagues they were going 
to be released they then were taken by trucks into the jungle 
where they were forced to lie on the ground sprayed with machine 
gun fire and shot in the head the official said 
the policeman who escaped suffered a bullet graze on his head 
and apparently was left for dead the official said on condition of 
anonymity 
the accounts could not be independently verified because 
telephone communications broke down wednesday between colombo and 
the eastern batticaloa region as the fighting spread to the 
northern vavuniya and mannar regions 
a ceasefire announced late tuesday by the government and the 
tigers was to take effect at noon wednesday but military officials 
in colombo speaking on condition of anonymity said fighting 
continued past the deadline 
the officials also said about 3000 soldiers were rushed to the 
east coast on wednesday to reinforce the 1200 soldiers sent on 
tuesday 
residents in vavuniya 135 miles northeast of colombo said the 
tigers were still attacking police stations and army camps and 
government troops were returning fire the residents spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the government and the tigers opened negotiations in may 1989 in 
an effort to end the 7yearold tamil revolt against the 
sinhalesedominated government 
the latest fighting began monday when the tigers took control of 
police stations in the batticaloa and ampara districts along the 
east coast 135 miles across the island from colombo 
on tuesday the tigers spread their siege to four army camps in 
the east at the same time the governments chief negotiator 
justice minister shahul hameed was in the northern town of jaffna 
for negotiations with top tiger political leaders 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
tamil rebels demand an independent nation claiming their community 
is discriminated against by the sinhalese who make up 75 percent 
of the population and control the government and the military 
at least 11000 people including 1100 indian soldiers have 
been killed in the tamil insurgency

flight of the space shuttle endeavour 
the rescue of the unisured satellite is expected to cost 
intelsat more than half of the 1465 million price for a 
nongovernment shuttle mission 
nasa has the technological knowhow to reboost the satellite 
and we want to take advantage of nasas expertise so we can boost 
the satellite and it will have a 10year lifespan said company 
spokesman tony trujillo 
intelsats board of governors authorized the rescue attempt 
during a weeklong meeting in barbados that ended wednesday 
the satellite is orbiting at about 345 miles above earth 22000 
miles lower than intended it was even lower when it failed to 
separate properly from a titan 3 rocket on march 14 but intelsat 
ground controllers managed to boost it 
the national aeronautics and space administration said last 
month it would try to save the satellite if intelsat paid for the 
mission last week the federal office of management and budget 
approved nasas proposed 130 million pricetag in 1988 dollars 
for nongovernment shuttle flights that amounts to 1465 million 
for fiscal 1990 
intelsat will cover a sizable fraction of the expense since 
other cargos will be on board said nasa payload manager william d 
green 
the plan calls for endeavour to carry a 20000pound motor that 
will be attached to the satellite in the payload bay by 
spacewalking astronauts the motor will contain a safety device to 
prevent it from firing until the shuttle is at a safe distance 
intelsat ground controllers will send a command that will ignite 
the motor and boost the 5ton satellite to its proper stationary 
orbit 
the february 1992 date would not disrupt other shuttle flights 
green said 
generally speaking the reason were doing it is were in the 
business of providing space services when people ask for it he 
said 
nasa has twice repaired satellites in space in 1984 and 1985 
and brought back two other disabled spacecraft 
for this to be practical a satellite thats in trouble has to 
be within the reach of the shuttle in the altitude region green 
said 
discoverys flight in april with the hubble space telescope set 
a record altitude 380 miles for a shuttle a shuttle probably 
could reach 400 or so miles without any cargo green said 
intelsat a washington dcbased consortium of 119 countries 
that operates a global communications satellite system was not 
interested in having the satellite returned to earth for repair 
because of the expense and delay in getting it back up 
the intelsat vi satellite was to have replaced two older 
intelsat satellites over the atlantic once in proper orbit it 
will be capable of transmitting three tv channels and up to 120000 
telephone calls simultaneously 
intelsats service will not be disrupted by the threeyear 
delay trujillo said fourteen intelsat satellites currently are in 
orbit and a titan 3 is scheduled to carry up another one later 
this month 
martin marietta corp which makes the titan rockets said the 
engineering design error that led to the failed launch in march has 
been corrected

after a year on the loose a rooster that 
evaded traps and tranquilizer darts was finally captured by three 
pursuers working under the cover of darkness and armed with a 
flashlight and a fishing net 
henry the roosters owners moved away a year ago 
during the past few weeks animal control officials intensified 
their efforts with traps and the tranquilizer guns because henrys 
droppings were suspected of infecting a child at the playhouse day 
care center 
monday night daycare center director geri moton and her 
soninlaw kevin pike took matters into their own hands joining 
them was russell burkett grandfather of a child who was recently 
enrolled at the center 
this was their first day at the playhouse and mr burkett 
said honey ill help you get that rooster but well have to do 
it at night moton said 
they found henry in a tree taking advantage of roosters poor 
night vision pike climbed up and knocked henry to the ground 
the pesky bird made a dash for freedom but moton nabbed him 
with a fishing net 
hes gone and this morning i sang the hallelujah chorus 
moton said tuesday 
burkett is keeping the rooster as a companion for his grandson 
raymond shollanbarger 
i didnt want him shot moton said im just glad the 
rooster found him a good home 
she said henrys owners moved last year and left him behind 
gaston health officials wanted the bird removed because stray 
animals are a violation of daycare health standards 
the health department became involved two weeks ago when a 
pediatrician reported a case of campylobacter infection a 
bacterial disease that causes flulike symptoms animal feces is 
one source of the infection and officials said the illness might 
have come from the rooster

theyve been kicked out of motels forced to live 
on charity and lost their animals 
but members of the great circus bim bom who say a us business 
sabotaged their tour still want to perform for the americans who 
have opened their homes hearts and checkbooks to the stranded 
soviet performers 
we want to perform for you but we cannot get our equipment 
our animals said emil kio a magician known for his acts with 
fire that is a pity 
the 115member circus named for two famous turnofthecentury 
russian clowns came to the united states for a twoyear tour in 
march 
the group signed a contract with international showbusiness 
inc a newly formed company in clearwater fla with financing 
from kuwaiti investors it brought the troupe to the united states 
and scheduled performances 
the venture starting losing money because of poor publicity 
circus director yuri turkin said 
the circus came to atlanta where its trucking company is based 
to regroup and assess its plight only to be kicked out of a series 
of motels for not paying bills finally the tour was canceled may 
9 after only 12 performances 
lies lies lies thats all they told us a bitter leonid 
gordon technical director for kios magic act said of 
international showbusiness we waited two months for them to do 
something they didnt tell us anything until we were in trouble 
now we have nothing 
thirty performers stuck with isi and got lodging at a west 
virginia ski resort but no work 
turkin severed ties with isi and is frantically trying to 
arrange performances in kentucky before friday morning when the 
troupe must leave its latest home atlantas oglethorpe university 
to perform the circus must pay to free its equipment and 
animals 
night moves transfer of atlanta is owed about 165000 and vice 
president winfield ward said he must have a large percentage of the 
money before he will release the equipment im not a bank im a 
trucking company he said 
the 54 animals including a pregnant lion whose cub that kio 
said the circus wants to donate to atlantas zoo when it is born 
are being held by the alex nichols agency in newburgh ny 
federal officials meanwhile are threatening to seize the 
animals because wildlife declaration documents werent filed when 
they entered the country 
we know our soviet laws but we dont know all you americans 
require kio said blaming isi for not providing documentation 
this is not our debt this is international showbusiness debt 
because they wont pay we are here 
isi attorney robert bauer jr did not return calls seeking 
comment the companys president nikolaj vissokovsky has in the 
past blamed a kuwaiti father and son for withdrawing financial 
support but brooks savage a lawyer for waleed aa ahmad and his 
father khoorsheed ahmad said the investors gave the circus a loan 
and never intended to back the whole tour 
the performers have been biding their time at oglethorpe 
university which offered free housing during a student break most 
are frustrated that they cant practice 
vechislav anokhin who juggles large steel balls misses working 
with his own equipment i must stay strong for my work every day 
i go to the gymnasium but it is not the same he said 
they try not to appear ungrateful to atlantans who buy them food 
and spend time with them despite the language barrier 
some like trainer kalachov yevgeni are making good friends 
hes teaching me russian and im teaching him english said 
7yearold ryan haroldson as the two practiced boxing hes my 
droog friend 
ryan tells us whats happening yevgeni said in russian 
but the soviets are tired of waiting they want to send in the 
clowns 
we wait and hope wait and hope said musician mikhail

comment 
i want to officially apologize to all the christians for 
saying that turner said that was a very uncalledfor 
statement at one time or another ive offended just about 
everybody i was making a talk off the cuff when that just popped 
out and i feel very sorry for it

shen said shen sought the meeting after turner said the chinese 
government felt forced to quell democracy protests with 
military strength that left hundreds of demonstrators dead 
turners remark about christianity was first made last year and 
repeated last month at a convention of the american humanist 
association where he was named humanist of the year 
despite his apology turner said tuesday night he has problems 
with organized religion because of what he perceives as its 
inflexibility

scientists have discovered a specific genetic 
defect that causes the pale skin and white hair of people who are 
albinos 
the discovery should help doctors tell parents before birth 
whether their babies are likely to have this inherited condition 
doctors from the university of wisconsin studied a family in 
which four sisters were albinos but their parents and brothers had 
normal skin color 
they found that the sisters inherited two different genetic 
mutations one from each parent the defects were in a gene that 
makes a protein essential for skin color 
the researchers screened 15 other unrelated albinos but found 
that only one of them had the same defects they believe that many 
different mutations in this gene may cause albinism 
the research conducted by dr richard a spritz and colleagues 
was published in thursdays issue of the new england journal of 
medicine 
albinism results from defects in the gene that oversees the 
bodys production of tyrosinase tyrosinase is needed to make 
melanin the pigment that gives color to the skin hair and eyes 
in the severest form of the disease albinos have white hair 
milky white skin and pale blue eyes they are also likely to have 
poor vision 
about one in every 17000 people in the united states is albino

leaders of israels new 
rightwing government said wednesday they are willing to make peace 
with the palestinians but first want a new understanding with the 
united states 
foreign minister david levy and prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said they wanted american guarantees that israel would not have to 
speak to the plo or discuss any palestinian state in usproposed 
peace talks 
deal with us as allies first we have to reach an 
agreement on these things and then other things can certainly be 
achieved levy said at a ceremony in jerusalem formally 
installing him as foreign minister 
the new cabinet won parliamentary approval monday ending three 
months of political uncertainty that followed the collapse of the 
laborlikud coalition over us proposals for palestinianisraeli 
talks in cairo 
shamir said he wouldnt talk to palestine liberation 
organization representatives or arabs from israeliannexed east 
jerusalem on ending the palestinian uprising which began in 
december 1987 
at least 717 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians and 45 israelis have died in the violence 
levy insisted the new leadership would not torpedo peace 
talks 
this is not an extremist government but you have to 
understand us this is not an issue of experiments there is no 
people that makes experiments concerning its survival levy said 
another major irritant in usisraeli relations is jerusalems 
insistence on expanding jewish settlement in the occupied 
landswhich israel seized in the 1967 middle east war about 70000 
jewish settlers now live in the west bank 
about 750000 soviet jews are expected to enter israel over the 
next years as soviet emigration laws loosen so far about 300 
soviet jews have settled in the west bank 
defense minister moshe arens on wednesday supported the 
governments controversial settlement policy by visiting the west 
banks two largest jewish communities maale adumim and ariel 
i think its only proper that i should visit here on my first 
day of touring as defense minister arens told leaders of maale 
adumim a settlement of about 13500 just outside jerusalem 
ensuring the security of the settlers is one of the most 
important objectives of our government arens said 
but shamir in an interview published wednesday in the 
englishlanguage jerusalem post denied his government would build 
new settlements in the occupied lands 
the emphasis will be on the strengthening of the now 
existing settlements shamir said 
settlement leaders said maale adumim was expected to grow by 
6500 residents by 1992 another settlement located south of 
jerusalem efrat was to grow tenfold to 20000 people by the 
decades end 
shamir also told the post he would not discuss formation of a 
palestinian state in any peace talks 
speaking of the united states shamir said i want them to 
understand our intentions and i want to make it clear that a 
dialogue between israel and arab representatives cannot succeed 
without prior agreement between the parties that the goal is to 
advance within the framework of autonomy 
shamir said wednesday that peace talks with the palestinians 
could not succeed unless the arab world joined the dialogue in the 
past all arab states except egypt have refused to negotiate with 
israel 
the remarks by shamir and levy indicated that israels new 
government like the last one will refuse proposals made earlier 
by secretary of state james a baker iii for the dialogue in cairo 
hardliners in shamirs rightwing likud bloc including levy 
said the proposals were an attempt to bring the plo to the 
negotiating table 
in a may 1989 peace plan shamir called for elections in the 
occupied lands in which palestinians would choose representatives 
to negotiate limited autonomy after some years the final status 
of the west bank and gaza strip would be discussed

texans and oklahomans want to draw 
the line once and for all that determines an exact boundary of the 
lone star state and theyd rather do it sooner than later 
the red river has served an official divider between the two 
since spain and the united states signed a treaty in 1819 to set 
the southwest boundary of the louisiana purchase 
but theyve been wrangling in courtrooms and state capitals for 
years over which bank north or south sets the boundary along a 
110mile stretch of river 
the us supreme court tried to settle the question in the early 
1920s by issuing four opinions which set the boundary at the 
rivers south bank the texas side 
however each time the course of the rivers flow is altered 
usually by flooding new quarrels arise 
the confusion has caused disputes over taxes mineral rights and 
law enforcement jurisdiction 
so once again texas and oklahoma officials and the federal 
bureau of land management will try to resolve the issue 
the federal agency will present a proposal this summer to 
officials from both states paul tanner area manager for the 
bureau of land managements oklahoma city office said this week 
tanner predicts the boundary will be fixed at a permanent spot 
on the texas side of the river if that happens oklahoma stands to 
gain acreage and increase its tax base he said 
the stretch is in the central part of the boundary and runs in 
texas from about byers to oklaunion

organized labor leaders urged congress 
wednesday to ban the replacement of striking workers saying the 
practice has eroded the rights of employees to strike 
but some lawmakers said such a law would unfairly tilt the 
collective bargaining process toward unions by leaving companies 
with no means of surviving a strike 
talk about a level playing field if this bill passes one 
of the players wont even be invited to the game said rep cass 
ballenger rnc they wont have a ticket to get in 
rep harris fawell rill complained that the hearing before a 
house labor subcommittee was onesided because the only witnesses 
were labor officials 
committee chairman rep william clay dmo said opponents of 
the measure which he is sponsoring would be asked to appear later 
clay said he wanted corporate managers at eastern air lines and 
greyhound lines inc two companies that quickly hired 
replacements at the onset of labor disputes to tell congress 
why they would be so ruthless in replacing workers some who have 
been with them 25 years 
the house labormanagement relations subcommittee is considering 
a measure that would bar companies from keeping replacement workers 
if union workers with more seniority wanted their jobs back after a 
strike was settled a similar measure is pending before a senate 
committee 
those testifying included greyhound union president edward m 
strait who said the bus lines promise of permanent jobs for 
replacement workers was a major obstacle in the resolution of 
the 3monthold drivers strike 
straits amalgamated council of greyhound local unions 
represents the 6300 drivers who walked off their jobs march 2 over 
wages and job security he said the proposed change was needed to 
redress a fatal flaw in federal labor law that allows companies 
to replace workers who exercise their legal right to strike 
greyhound which filed for bankruptcy protection last week has 
been operating a reduced schedule with about 3000 replacement 
drivers 
in an interview from the bus lines dallas headquarters 
greyhound spokesman george gravley said the issue of replacement 
workers was a sideshow in the dispute he said contract 
negotiations have failed because of unreasonable wage demands by

taboo has become more widespread in recent years many in

the soviet legislature voted to further speed the 
nation toward a market economy wednesday but a government official 
told lawmakers that an threefold increase in bread prices would be 
delayed 
panicbuying has emptied many store shelves since late last 
month when the communist government proposed to cut many price 
subsidies by january 
prices on bread the main staple of the soviet diet also will 
be raised eventually but of course not by july 1 said yuri 
maslyukov chairman of the government agency that runs the 
centralized economy bread now sells for less than 30 cents a loaf 
the supreme soviet ordering the finetuning of a plan that drew 
widespread criticism as being too vague and tentative instructed 
the council of ministers to have drafts of all the laws needed for 
the switch from a planned to a market economy by october 
the measure also instructed president mikhail s gorbachev to 
issue a series of presidential decrees beginning july 1 to speed up 
progress on bringing new laws on ownership leasing farming and 
other key elements of a market economy into effect 
the main thing now is that now we can begin to work said 
leading economist and deputy prime minister leonid abalkin 
three years ago someone who called for a market economy was 
pointed at theres a man whos betraying the ideals of 
socialism he said today everyones talking about how to make 
the transition faster 
abalkin speaking to reporters at the supreme soviet said the 
government still intends to raise most prices on retail goods and 
raw materials in january as stated in its earlier plan despite 
consumer outcry 
the supreme soviet heard maslyukovs proposal wednesday to 
postpone the price increase on bread and was expected to vote on it 
thursday 
maslyukov recommended the postponement largely because the plan 
for compensating the population for the extra money they would have 
to spend on bread still needed work but he said nine of the 15 
soviet republics already have agreed to increase their bread prices 
aug 1 with compensation beginning about two weeks earlier 
wednesdays resolution did not reject outright the program put 
forth by premier nikolai i ryzhkov late last month which focused 
on price rises but it demanded quick concrete plans for creating 
a market and immediate spending cuts on defense the government 
bureaucracy and construction to cut the budget deficit 
we have to begin work now deputy alexei boiko who 
presented the resolution told lawmakers 
ryzhkov and his government were forced to rethink the plan after 
it prompted panic buying and drew nearly unanimous criticism by 
economists around the world for raising prices without freeing 
enough goods and prices from government control to allow a true 
transition to a market economy 
wednesdays resolution set an october deadline for gorbachevs 
administration to hammer out concrete reforms including bills to 
create a stock market commercial banks credit and a federal 
reserve bank deputies changed the draft to remove the specifics of 
which laws were needed but said the list still applied 
ryzhkov told reporters he supported the altered plan the 
project was worked on by commissions and is fairly objective and 
allows us to work further he said 
but he said it would be difficult to complete all the laws and 
practical measures by the autumn deadline 
ryzhkov admitted he was surprised at the swell of sentiment 
against the price increases he said he knew it would be difficult 
but to tell the truth i thought society was more prepared 
asked about calls for his resignation due to the outcry ryzhkov 
said its not a question of who works on this program im 
convinced this is the road we have to take 
opposition economist gennady filshin criticized wednesdays 
proposal as a compromise among government economists unwilling to 
take the radical steps needed his interregional group the 
opposition in the soviet congress proposed much more radical 
measures including liquidating all ministries and freeing up 
prices altogether 
other deputies took the floor wednesday to blast the proposal as 
well many speaking against the overall price increases but the 
resolution passed nonetheless in a series of votes on each article 
boiko said the parliament would keep a close eye on the 
governments fulfillment of the resolution and if by fall it had 
not made satisfactory progress we will be forced to make the 
corresponding verdict

the governments savings and loan bailout 
agency will run out of borrowing authority in the octoberdecember 
quarter bringing thrift rescues to a halt unless congress provides 
more money a top regulator said wednesday 
obviously if we dont have any money we cant continue 
said l william seidman previewing congressional testimony to be 
delivered thursday by treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
seidman is chairman of the resolution trust corp a 
10monthold agency responsible for closing and selling failed 
thrifts 
three weeks ago brady roughly doubled the bush administrations 
estimate of the cost of bailing out sampls to a range of 89 billion 
to 132 billion 
bradys latest disclosure that the rtc soon will run out of 
operating funds to be delivered to the house banking committee 
lends new urgency to negotiations between administration and 
congressional leaders on the budget for fiscal year 1991 which 
begins oct 1 
it means congress must provide substantial additional money in 
the budget or face a halt to thrift rescues within weeks of the 
start of the new fiscal year 
seidman responding to reporters questions at a news conference 
on an unrelated matter indicated his agency has at least enough 
borrowing authority remaining to rescue another 95 to 120 sampls 
that would leave as many as 500 failed institutions still open 
but under government control 
since it began operating in august the rtc has resolved 168 
failed thrifts by paying off depositors or by selling the 
institutions to new investors 
it plans another 45 resolutions by the end of june and expected 
to handle 50 to 75 in the julyseptember quarter seidman said 
at the end of last week the rtc had control of 295 failed sampls 
awaiting resolution thrift regulators have indicated at least 
another 299 institutions still operating independently appear 
headed for failure 
sampl legislation enacted in august authorized the rtc to borrow 
50 billion through longterm bonds to cover the losses in failed 
sampls the resolutions through the end of this month should use 
about 30 billion of that money 
the rtc has also been authorized to borrow an additional 45 
billion in shortterm working capital until it can sell the real 
estate securities and other assets it is inheriting from failed 
institutions 
seidman said the agency had not decided how much working capital 
it will borrow in the julyseptember quarter the total amount of 
shortterm borrowing is capped by a complex formula in last years 
law and seidman indicated that cap would be reached before the end 
of this year 
we will be out of funds enabling us to do transactions he 
said 
senate banking committee chairman donald w riegle jr said 
monday that congress probably would have to act later this year to 
provide new money probably in amounts comparable to the 50 
billion in longterm borrowing authorized by the law

german officials in the east and west teamed 
up to capture the second top leftist terrorist suspect in a week 
and news reports on wednesday said more such arrests were expected 
west german authorities hailed the joint effort that led to the 
arrest of 46yearold inge viett and east germanys interior 
minister called it an example of success in germangerman 
cooperation following decades of enmity 
the east german minister petermichael diestel also promised 
to investigate the extent to which his countrys former communist 
government particularly its hated secret police had harbored 
west german terrorists 
its a perverse situation that in the past terrorists were 
protected in the german democratic republic diestel told 
reporters in bonn 
the secret police once virtually omnipresent would have known 
the background of any west germans resettling in east germany many 
suspected the secret police or stasi had provided the terrorists 
with new identities and other help 
if so diestel said it was a diabolical connection 
the governmentrun east german news agency adn said ms viett 
wanted in several attacks was captured tuesday night in the east 
german city of magdeburg 
it immediately led to speculation that other members of the red 
army faction would turn up in east germany or that they once lived 
there 
east germanys chief prosecutors office is optimistically 
looking forward to the speedy capture of other terrorists said 
west germanys zdf television network 
zdf also said there are indications of ties linking east 
germanys secret police and west german terrorists with middle east 
terror groups 
law enforcement sources in bonn speaking to the associated 
press on the condition of anonymity said there were indications 
that ms viett had worked with palestinian terrorists in the 1970s 
ever since the two germanys started their rapid road to 
unification last fall the question of terrorism has become 
increasingly important 
officials on both sides of the crumbling barriers have warned 
that east germany could provide fertile territory for new leftist 
terrorist crimes 
joint efforts were stepped up to capture any red army faction 
members who may have slipped across the border after a series of 
attacks that rocked west german industry in the 1970s and 80s 
the west german federal police worked with their counterparts in 
east germany to capture ms viett unarmed in her apartment in 
magdeburg where she had lived for more than two years 
sources said ms vietts neighbors notified authorities after 
seeing west german wanted posters with her picture that had been 
put up throughout the city east german police carried out the 
arrest and west german authorities arrived in magdeburg afterward 
ms vietts capture and the june 6 apprehension of another 
suspect sussanne albrecht represent some of the biggest successes 
against west german terrorists in years 
the west german newspaper bild said that officials in east and 
west were close to arresting terrorist suspect silke maierwitt in 
east germany 
every day we are counting on seeing the news of her arrest 
bild quoted one unidentified west german official as saying bild 
is known to have close ties to government security officials in 
bonn 
earlier the morgenpost newspaper of dresden reported that ms 
maierwitt had lived in that east german city she is suspected of 
having taken part in the 1977 kidnapping and murder of prominent 
west german industrialist hanns martin schleyer 
ms vietts alleged involvement in terrorism goes back to 1972 
when she was accused of taking part in a bombing that killed one 
man at a boating facility in berlin 
west german authorities have accused ms viett of taking part in 
the slaying of prominent west berlin judge guenter von drenkmann in 
1974 
ms viett is also wanted in the kidnapping of west berlin 
christian democratic leader peter lorenz a year later among 
numerous other crimes 
in 1978 she allegedly took part in helping red army faction 
member till meyer escape from a berlin prison 
ms viett in 1981 allegedly shot a french policemen after being 
stopped by authorities in paris the policeman was seriously 
injured 
west german officials announced plans to seek the extradition of 
ms viett as they are doing in the case of ms albrecht 
ms albrecht is wanted in the 1977 murder of prominent west 
german banker juergen ponto

the mayor of eureka calif on wednesday 
sportingly swallowed his citys designation as the nations 
heartburn capital 
well long remember you and the occasion mayor fred moore 
gamely told company officials as he accepted a plaque placing 
eureka at the top of the national rolaids heartburn index 
the heartburn index blames that searing sensation on sociology 
not spices it says eureka in northern california is heartburn city 
because among other reasons its attracting newcomers with a 
burning desire for economic success 
isnt this bonkers said the mayors wife madelon moore 
everybody at city hall went crazy 
el paso texas had the lowest heartburn rate among 197 
metropolitan areas 
and how do el paso residents perceive this great honor 
with a certain bit of levity probably said city councilman 
gene finke who accepted his citys plaque 
the study chalked up el pasos tummytaming qualities to a 
stable population and a rebounding economy finke also credited 
strong family values and friendliness 
finke swore that nary a twinge has been blamed on his citys 
spicy texmex cuisine 
maybe theyre stoics said jack levin sociology professor 
at northeastern university in boston who did the study for rolaids 
actually levins heartfelt if theoretical findings did finger 
factors other than food for the nations 40 million heartburn 
sufferers 
i think there is a tendency on the part of americans to blame 
heartburn on spicy foods mexican or szechuan for example said 
levin from a sociological standpoint it appears heartburn 
levels can be easily linked to the amount of population growth that 
a city is experiencing 
he said there could be other factors such as the october 
earthquake in northern california 
levin digested sales figures for various antacid brands tablet 
and liquid then he ranked the nations heartburn hotbeds 
the sales statistics were not revealed but on average 
americans experience heartburn twice a week he said in contrast 
the 25000 folks in eureka 280 miles north of san francisco are 
plagued an average of four times a week 
after eureka the most seething cities were san francisco 
chico calif santa barbara calif sacramento calif boise 
idaho reno nev fresno calif bakersfield calif and seattle 
the least were in el paso fort smith ark ada okla 
colorado springs colo columbia mo st joseph mo lubbock 
texas panama city fla springfield mo and albany ga 
new york city ranked 135th 
the most startling result in this analysis was that the 
northeast region did not have high heartburn said levin 
levin also singled out midwestern cities characterized by 
stability and tradition like springfield mo 103 green 
bay wis 184 lansing mich 181 and sioux city iowa 186 
perhaps to prove a point the results were unveiled at a lunch 
of chicken marinated in tequila shrimp marinated in chili salad 
with cilantro dressing tacos and refried beans 
as a hedge there were postdessert rolaids for everyone

recent months to alleviate traffic flow and make way for new 
developments but most of west berlin still remains surrounded by 
fortifications 
the us military in west berlin said wednesday arrangements are 
not yet complete for the removal of the famed checkpoint charlie 
through the berlin wall the building had been scheduled to close 
thursday 
the berlin governments chose bernauer street for the ceremonial 
start of the walls final demolition because of the chilling images 
it gave the world 
shortly after the wall began going up some occupants of nearby 
buildings jumped into bedsheets held open by west berliners 
a 77yearold woman hung from a window ledge for 15 minutes 
while communist party functionaries tried to pull her back at one 
point throwing a smoke grenade at the crowd below they finally let 
the woman drop into a bedsheet 
in 1964 some west berliners dug a tunnel under bernauer street 
and 57 east germans escaped 
a 90yearold church that straddled the border which contained 
a plaque with the names of east germans who died while trying to 
flee was blown up by communist authorities in 1985 they cited 
border security as the reason 
helmut frankan ran a bar a block away when the wall was being 
erected in the first few weeks as the fortifications were still 
being built and strengthened one of his waitresses used to climb 
over the wall to visit her mother in west berlin 
one day the guards caught her and punched her in the face she 
spent a year and a half in prison said frankan 66 as he kicked 
through the gravel where houses once stood 
they tore down all of these houses they even moved a 
graveyard

a bomb blew a hole in the 
recently vacated home of a leading conservative party figure and 
police said wednesday that they suspected the ira carried out the 
attack 
prime minister margaret thatcher said the explosion tuesday 
night at west green house an 18th century mansion in this 
southern english village was very disturbing 
no one was hurt in the blast and no organization immediately 
claimed responsibility 
the irish republican army in a new offensive aimed mainly at 
british targets outside northern ireland has killed seven people 
in the past few weeks and mounted half a dozen attacks in england 
the explosion tore a threefoot hole in the front of the 
mansion which until three weeks ago was the home of lord mcalpine 
a former deputy chairman and treasurer of the conservative party 
and major fundraiser 
mcalpine 48 is a close associate of mrs thatcher and 
neighbors said she has been a guest at west green house 55 miles 
from london 
we are keeping an open mind hampshire police detective 
superintendent alan wheeler told a news conference but because 
of the size of the explosion there is only one organization i know 
of which causes such explosions and that is the ira 
mcalpine was on a target list of more than 100 prominent 
britons including judges found in a police raid 18 months ago on 
a apartment used by ira bombmakers in south london 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
the predominantly protestant province of northern ireland and unite 
it with the republic of ireland 
police said at first they suspected animal rights extremists 
but they focused later on the ira mcalpines interests include a 
zoo in broome australia

the committee will now weigh a recommendation by its special 
counsel robert s bennett that durenberger be denounced by the 
senate for financial improprieties 
in an emotional hourlong speech the senator told the 
committee his life and reputation are at stake and said he 
would rely on the committees good judgment and compassion 
the committee had scheduled up to two weeks of hearings but 
went along with a request from durenbergers attorney jim 
hamilton to end the hearings early because a prolonged proceeding 
would cost the senator too much in legal fees 
the panels vice chairman sen warren b rudman rnh said 
the committee would have no problem making a judgment based on 
written documents and statements by durenberger his lawyer and 
bennett 
there is not a great deal of dispute about the facts rudman 
said theres obviously a great deal of dispute about what those 
facts mean 
a decision is not expected for several weeks bennett said it 
would likely take him two weeks to submit his formal recommendation 
durenberger speaking softly in a voice that faltered but did 
not break attributed his lack of attention to ethics rules in 
part to the strains and vulnerabilities in my personal life 
standing at a microphone and often looking straight at the six 
senators sitting in judgment of him described the pain of raising 
four sons after his first wife died of cancer at the age of 31 and 
his marriage to his current wife penny whose first husband had 
died in the vietnam war 
but durenberger said in his address to the hushed hearing room 
these factors were not an excuse for breaking senate rules i 
accept full responsibility for errors which were made he 
said 
i recognize that real damage has been done by what has been 
perceived as my desire to push the limits and take advantage of the 
senate and for that i am sorry he said 
durenberger combined his appeal for compassion with a defense 
that he had made mistakes but that all the key decisions had 
been taken with legal advice 
as had been the case when bennett made his case against 
durenberger on tuesday the committee had no visible reaction to 
the senators presentation 
after he finished durenberger hugged his son dan his staff 
members and embraced fellow minnesota republican sen rudy 
boschwitz 
durenberger spoke on the second day of triallike hearings in 
answer to bennetts recommendation that he be denounced by the full 
senate because bennett said durenberger had intended to break its 
rules and the law 
the committee has found substantial credible evidence that 
durenberger committed violations of senate rules and the law 
bennett said durenberger abused his office by 
evading honoraria limits when he classified money earned from 
appearances before trade groups as his payment for promoting his 
two books 
hiding his ownership in a minneapolis condominium so he could 
collect travel reimbursements when he stayed there 
accepting free limousine rides from specialinterest groups in 
violation of a 100 annual gift ceiling from people or groups 
interested in legislation 
durenberger said he would not challenge the committees 
recommended punishment but he appeared to rule out resigning 
when this is done i intend to serve this body and my home 
state with a renewed conviction to exemplify the servant in public 
service he said 
if the senate follows bennetts advice it would pass a 
resolution denouncing him for reprehensible conduct an action 
that would not effect his senate standing or duties 
senators also could issue a mild rebuke strip him of seniority 
take away committee assignments or even expel him unlikely in a 
case without serious violations of criminal law 
i acted in good faith and with no intent whatsoever to violate 
the rules of the senate durenberger said i know that in my 
heart to be the case 
bennett listened to durenberger and began his rebuttal by 
stressing it was difficult to follow such an eloquent and 
touching moment 
no human being in this room can feel good right now he 
said certainly i dont but lets get back to the facts 
he then ripped into durenbergers arguments saying that the 
senator knowingly and intentionally committed acts that were 
unethical 
bennett repeating an allegation he made tuesday that 
durenbergers speeches were honoraria appearances and not book 
promotions told the committee 
sen durenberger knew when he spoke and didnt have any 
books with him this wasnt a book promotion so lets keep our 
eye on the ball here if there have been book promotions we 
wouldnt be here 
bennett said he asked durenberger and his attorney jim 
hamilton to show him one event where the senator was asked to 
promote his book i have not received that evidence 
political leaders in minnesota including state republican 
chairman robert weinholzer have said there could be pressure for 
him to resign if the senate gives him a serious punishment

science minister yuval neeman on wednesday 
proposed reviving a plan for a canal from the mediterranean sea to 
the dead sea that was shelved five years ago as impractical and too 
costly 
neeman a physicist who headed a project to plan the route of 
the proposed canal in 1981 said the decision to cancel the project 
was made too hastily and without depth 
the canal can solve the problem of the dead sea neeman told 
israel radio a big part of the dead sea is already desert 
the plan to build the 70mile socalled deadmed canal was 
announced in 1980 it caught the imagination of israelis because 
theodore herzl the visionary who conceived the modern jewish 
state urged building such a canal as early as 1902 
the 1980 plan had two purposes to generate electricity and to 
refill the evaporating dead sea actually a lake laden with salt 
and chemicals through which runs the israelijordanian border 
electricity was to be generated by using the force of the water 
as it flowed down to the dead sea which at 1097 feet below sea 
level is the lowest point on earth 
when the project was canceled in 1985 energy minister moshe 
shahal said the canal would be too expensive because falling oil 
prices had reduced the cost of generating electricity 
energy officials estimated then that the project would be 
feasible only if oil cost 32 a barrel today the price is about 
15 a barrel 
by 1985 the projected cost of the canal was estimated at 15 
billion 
the decision to stop the canal project also involved other 
considerations neighboring jordan claimed the project would 
threaten its chemical works on the east bank of the dead sea 
there were also fears that pumping ordinary sea water into the 
dead sea would change its unique quality that allows swimmers to 
float on the surface the oily chemicalladen water is also sought 
out by health enthusiasts who believe it has medicinal value in 
treating skin diseases

a house subcommittee approved legislation 
wednesday to scale back exemptions from federal antitrust laws the 
insurance industry has enjoyed for 45 years 
on a 96 partisan vote the judiciary committees subcommittee 
on economic and commercial law approved a bill to subject insurance 
companies to federal court lawsuits for price fixing and other 
antitrust provisions 
all democrats on the panel voted for the bill and all 
republicans voted against it 
insurance companies and their agents have enjoyed immunity from 
antitrust suits under the 1945 mccarranferguson act which 
delegated regulation of the now 500 billion industry to state 
governments 
the bill clearing its first legislative hurdle wednesday was 
prompted by the 1985 insurance upheaval in which companies quit 
writing liability coverage for various occupations because of 
massive claims and judgments against them 
a similar bill was approved by the subcommittee in 1988 but got 
nowhere because of intense opposition from the insurance industry 
this time however rep jack brooks dtexas the full 
committees new chairman is determined to bring a bill to the 
house floor 
citing opponents claims that the industry is so competitive 
that no antitrust laws are needed brooks said wednesday if 
thats so then there is nothing to fear from the bill 
in addition to price fixing the legislation would after a 
fiveyear transition make other alleged abuses by insurance 
companies grounds for federal antitrust lawsuits 
they include dividing up geographic territories among competing 
companies and tying requirements such as forcing a buyer to 
purchase home insurance in order to get auto coverage 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio has introduced similar 
legislation in the senate however the industry is counting on 
opposition from sens dennis deconcini dariz and howell heflin 
dala both along with metzenbaum members of the senates 
judiciary committee to prevent its passage

the department of energy will use money that 
once financed scholarships for university nuclear engineering 
students to help schoolchildren improve science and math skills an 
official said wednesday 
james decker acting director of the does office of energy 
research told a house science space and technology subcommittee 
that the shift resulted from tough budget decisions made for 
fiscal year 1991 
the administration decided to move about 6 million from 
university nuclear engineering research programs and scholarships 
to place greater emphasis on precollege science and 
mathematics programs he said 
there is a growing consensus that one of the most serious 
problems facing the nation over the next 10 years is the declining 
number of young americans including women and minorities 
interested in pursuing careers in science and engineering decker 
said 
doe is uniquely positioned to provide major assistance to the 
national effort to strengthen science and engineering education 
he added 
the energy department has traditionally supported science 
education at the graduate and postdoctoral levels its university 
research in fiscal year 1990 totals about 480 million 
richard stephens director of does university and industry 
division said the department had worked closely with 57 
universities that have nuclear engineering programs providing 
degrees ranging from bachelors to doctorates 
there are 36 active projects with an average of three graduate 
students each receiving the scholarships stephens stressed that 
none of the current scholarship recipients will be affected by the 
budget switch because for each of the three years of the program 
threeyear awards were granted 
besides developing precollege mathematics and science education 
programs at the doe laboratories around the country decker said 
there also will be a travelling museumbased science education 
program consisting of exhibits on major energyrelated scientific 
programs increased research appointments for teachers and minority 
high school students and an expansion of special engineering 
programs for middle school students 
decker said that special emphasis for the new fiscal year will 
be on the development of partnerships between doe laboratories and 
innercity and rural schools mainly middle and high schools with 
high drop out rates

the house on wednesday overwhelmingly approved 
a 4 billion aids bill that would provide emergency money for 
cities and states to deal with the deadly disease 
the bill approved on a 40814 vote is more expensive than the 
29 billion senate version passed last month a conference 
committee will be appointed to work out differences 
bush administration opposes the house bill both because of its 
cost and the precedence set by passing legislation aimed at one 
specific disease 
rep charles schumer dny likened aids to natural disasters 
that have prompted congress to appropriate money to local 
governments 
this bill says to cities like new york which has 25 percent 
of the total aids cases in the country that we understand your 
problem and we are going to help schumer said hospitals 
are collapsing with the financial burden placed on them by aids 
the house bill authorizes 400 million in each of the next five 
fiscal years for grants to provide a variety of aids preventative 
health services half the money would go to state governments and 
the rest directly to health care facilities 
it authorizes another 275 million a year for two years and 
such sums as may be necessary for the next three fiscal years 
to go directly to cities with the largest number of aids cases 
besides new york other cities expected to receive emergency 
grants under the bill are atlanta boston chicago dallas 
houston jersey city nj los angeles miami newark 
philadelphia san diego san francisco san juan puerto rico and 
washington dc 
the bill authorizes smaller amounts for a series of other aids 
projects including 20 million a year for research into helping 
pediatric patients and state grants to buy drugs for treatment of 
aids and related conditions 
the house adopted amendments that scaled back the estimated 
fiveyear cost of the bill from 46 billion to about 4 billion 
as estimated by the congressional budget office 
however it rejected amendments that would have required states 
to test all citizens annually for the aids virus and that would 
have required institutions that test for the virus to report to 
state health authorities anyone who tests positive 
the bills narrow diseasespecific approach sets a dangerous 
precedent inviting treatment of other diseases through similar ad 
hoc arrangements the white house office of management and budget 
said in a written statement 
this approach also runs counter to the governments existing 
health care financing system which will provide more than 870 
million in federal medicaid payments for hiv disease in 1991 it 
said 
the administration statement said the bills cost was excessive 
and doesnt target funds to the needy 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread most often through 
sexual contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers 
infected blood or blood products and from infected pregnant women 
to their offspring

the white house on wednesday applauded 
moscows decision to ease its economic blockade against lithuania 
and president bush said he hoped the soviet union was beginning to 
defuse the crisis over the baltic republics 
bush said it was good news that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev had met tuesday with the leaders of lithuania latvia and 
estonia which are trying to break away from the kremlins control 
i hope that what we saw yesterday is a first step in a 
dialogue that will lead to the selfdetermination that we strongly 
support bush said at a news conference 
he said the united states hopes for a peaceful resolution of 
this confrontation one that will result in dialogue negotiation 
in lifting of this economic blockade against lithuania 
the economic sanctions imposed two months ago to break 
lithuanias drive for independence have been a stumbling block in 
ussoviet relations 
after bush spoke the white house received news of an easing of 
moscows pressure on lithuania its encouraging said brent 
scowcroft the presidents national security adviser 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene was told by 
soviet prime minister nikolai ryzhkov that 15 percent of the 
republics natural gas needs would be restored rita dapkus a 
parliamentary spokeswoman said 
ryzhkov made no promises on restoring other supplies ms dapkus 
said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said we welcome 
this announcement together with the beginning of the dialogue 
yesterday these are positive steps 
however sen lfonse damato rny blasted moscow i think 
15 percent is a slap in the face youre trifling with people he 
said the embargo remains in place 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said i am 
hopeful that the soviet union will lift its economic blockade 
against lithuania and i welcome soviet steps toward that end both 
sides should exert every effort to ensure that negotiations are 
conducted in an equitable and respectful manner 
bush declined to comment on the eported easing of economic 
pressure when questioned during an afternoon photo session 
earlier bush opened a news conference with regional reporters 
by praising gorbachevs meeting with the baltic leaders he said it 
was a significant change thats occurred in the soviet union 
he said i dont want to overstate it but i was very very 
pleased to see this occur in the wake of our what i think was a 
successful summit meeting 
reporters diverted the news conference to other subjects and 
did not ask bush any questions about gorbachev and lithuania two 
environmental subjects offshore oil drilling and the fate of the 
northern spotted owl were addressed by bush 
he said the longdelayed decision on restricting oil drilling 
off the coasts of florida and california would be made within days 
bush said he wanted to make sure he had all the information he 
needs were still getting opinions the president said its 
a very hot item as you know 
bush said that protection of the northern spotted owl under the 
endangered species act left him very much concerned about the 
potential loss of jobs 
vast tracts of forest would be shut to timber operations if the 
owl is deemed endangered and the president said the law gives the 
administration very limited control in making such a 
determination 
on other subjects bush said 
the soviet union should stop subsidizing the government of 
cuba which he said receives 5 billion a year if that 
totalitarian and brutal society were not propped up by an enormous 
subsidy from the soviet union i have every reason to believe that 
cuban people would have a right to achieve the freedom that other 
countries have achieved 
the united states will not normalize relations with iran until 
all of our hostages are out of lebanon six americans remain 
captive on a related question bush said we arent sure where 
the guilt lies in the bombing of pan am flight 103 that killed 
270 people in december 1988 
he was concerned about the financial problems suffered by 
greyhound but said the problem of supplying transportation to rural 
american should be resolved by supply and demand not federal 
intervention 
one questioner said bushs son neil had contributed to the loss 
of 106 million by taxpayers through his involvement with a failed 
savings and loan and asked how the son should make restitution 
bush said i dont accept your premise at all and i dont think 
the congress does either 
neil bush was on the board of silverado banking savings and 
loan association in denver from october 1985 to august 1988 the 
office of thrift supervision alleges that loans from silverado to 
bushs business partners were a conflict of interest for him he 
has denied wrongdoing and is contesting an effort by the thrift 
office to discipline him silverado collapsed in december 1988

the arab league expressed anger wednesday at 
vice president dan quayle for calling israelioccupied lands 
judea and samaria the biblical names used by israeli 
nationalists seeking to rule those territories 
in a speech monday to the annual convention of the 
americanisrael public affairs committee a major proisrael 
lobbying group quayle described two trips he took to israel on 
one quayle said he was taken by helicopter to the west bank of 
the jordan river an area which israel captured from jordan in the 
1967 arabisraeli war 
from the hills of judea and samaria you can see the land of 
israel stretched out before you quayle said in his prepared 
remarks he was referring to the strategic location of those hills 
which command a view of israels most populated area and the 
mediterranean sea beyond 
israel cites the narrowness of the corridor between the hills 
and the mediterranean as one reason why it needs to control the 
west bank whose palestinian population wants independence from 
israeli and jordanian control 
clovis maksoud the ambassador of the 21nation arab league 
said he had asked president bush to clarify quayles remarks 
maksoud said he had asked whether the bush administration now 
accepts the definitions of israeli hardliners such as prime 
minister yitzhak shamir for the occupied territories 
us officials generally refer to the west bank as well as to 
the gaza strip which israel captured from egypt in 1967 as the 
occupied territories the united states does not recognize israeli 
sovereignty over those lands and urges negotiations on their 
future it views jewish settlements in those areas as an obstacle 
to peace 
there has been no change in policy said quayles spokesman 
david beckwith the vice president was just using the biblical 
names of those hills 
if the us administration is to hold the plo responsible for 
any and all statements and actions by its representatives we also 
hold the bush administration responsible for statements made by its 
vice president maksoud said 
the administration has demanded the palestine liberation 
organization condemn an aborted may 30 raid by one of its factions 
on israels coast

the rapper says its racism and the sheriff swears 
it isnt but the obscenity crackdown on 2 live crew is sparking a 
national debate about selective prosecution 
this has nothing to do with racial overtones of any kind 
said broward county sheriff nick navarro whose deputies have 
arrested two members of the rap group and a recordstore owner on 
obscenity charges in connection with the album as nasty as they 
wanna be 
a third member mark ross was served with court papers 
wednesday the group which was taping talk show appearances in new 
york also has come under fire by authorities in texas and georgia 
its just an attack on my company and on me as a black guy 
said 2 live crews leader luther campbell who also owns the 
miamibased groups record label 
i think the role that race plays is really indirect and it 
might work in any number of ways said john leland music critic 
for newsday in new york he was an expert witness at the federal 
trial in fort lauderdale that resulted in last weeks obscenity 
declaration by us district judge jose gonzalez 
leland noted there were no complaints about the crews music 
until the groups first pop radio hit me so horny which 
brought them to the attention of mainstream audiences last fall 
the sexually explicit album is the groups third 
in order for something to be declared obscene it has to be 
declared lacking in serious artistic value the critic said 
wednesday i think that what you have with 2 live crew is really 
a new art form that presents all sorts of creative possiblities 
that people who arent sympathetic to the music arent able to 
understand 
he said the lack of understanding cuts across age lines as well 
as racial ones 
part of the reason 2 live crew has been singled out and 
persecuted is because theyre relatively powerless said robyn 
blumner executive director of the american civil liberties union 
in florida 
this is an independent record company which is disaffected in 
part from the record industry establishment so theyre an easy 
target part of that is because theyre a minority business 
leland agreed 
the popular music industry left luther campbell and 2 live 
crew out to hang the critic said 
the groups raps have been criticized for sexist prurient and 
violent references 
members of the black group and some of its supporters maintain 
that the songs spring from life as theyve known it on innercity 
streets 
theyre expressing resentment theyre expressing anger fear 
emotions that are projections of their own culture said peter 
thall a new york attorney who represents entertainment figures 
all artists write out of their experiences said university 
of florida media law professor colleen sullivan who is writing a 
book on rock lyrics and the first amendment i think its 
appalling that this is their experience 
navarro says his department has had no other complaints about 
the group not even since last weeks ruling whose effects is 
limited to three south florida counties 
but in san antonio texas police this week began notifying 84 
record stores that the lyrics of as nasty as they wanna be are 
obscene said vice squad commander lt jerry pittman 
police said no arests would be made for at least five days but 
stores have begun removing the albums 
in gwinnett county ga police chief wayne bolden said 
wednesday he and about 15 officers will monitor two thursday 
concerts by the group 
theyre talking about arresting us the club owner and the 
managers said chris lyons one of the promoters i dont think 
gwinnett wants to fool with this its bordering on racism 
look at all the rock groups who get away with slurs of 
homosexuals and immigrants lyons said and nobody says 
anything about that

the us government has illegally hidden from 
manuel noriegas lawyers thousands of secret intelligence documents 
seized in panama a defense attorney charged wednesday 
a fivepage list found by a private investigator shows that 
during the us invasion in december the army confiscated dozens 
of file cabinets said michael okane attorney for noriega 
codefendant daniel miranda 
okane said the file cabinets contained panamanian g2 
intelligence files weapons importexport records confidential 
correspondence and files on noriega foes who plotted a coup 
the list is far more extensive than an inventory turned over to 
the defense by the us attorneys office okane said 
this government inventory is a fabrication okane said 
before he filed a motion wednesday in federal court to force the 
government to hand over a revised list 
he called the government inventory a coverup effectuated in 
panama by unknown elements within the government of the united 
states 
noriega is being held on drugsmuggling charges 
attorneys for the ousted panamanian dictator have insisted that 
many of his activities were sanctioned by the united states they 
have said that us and panamanian intelligence records would show 
he cooperated with the cia and the drug enforcement administration 
the prosecutions shortened list violates an order by us 
magistrate william turnoff for the government to provide the 
defense with a complete list of documents seized during the 
invasion okane said 
okane said there was no indication the us attorneys office 
in miami knew its list was sanitized he said prosecutors also may 
have been misled by us officials in washington or panama 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the prosecutors office said she 
would not have any immediate comment on the motion 
jon may an attorney for noriega said the generals defense was 
eager to examine the lists and documents when the question of their 
fees is resolved the defense attorneys say the government must 
free noriegas frozen funds to provide adequate resources for his 
defense 
us district judge william hoeveler has scheduled a hearing for 
june 20 on the question of noriegas legal fees 
the disputed records are in the custody of the us southern 
commands 470th military intelligence group at a warehouse in 
corozal panama okane said he sent a private investigator to the 
warehouse to rummage through boxes of documents listed by the 
government 
we found wadded up in one of the boxes as garbage what we 
think is the real inventory okane said 
the fivepage list submitted with the motion included about 40 
items taken to the warehouse most of the items were file cabinets 
apparently packed with secret documents he said 
the government inventory lists only one file cabinet okane 
said 
he said it appeared some of the documents such as records of a 
coup attempt and panamanian defense force payroll records were 
removed from the cabinets and submitted in a pile of evidence to 
the defense team 
the defense never heard of thousands of other documents 
however he said 
a file cabinet containing g2 target files and another with 
g2 interrogation detention reports were listed on the 
waddedup inventory but missing from the official government 
version he said 
also missing were records of cabinets that included files of 
arms importexport and explosives companies although the defense 
did get separate records of israeli arms sales to panama okane 
said 
the attorney said many of the missing documents appeared to be 
essential records not marginal items 
from the label it seems these are sensitive things okane 
said 
okanes client miranda is out on bond on charges of helping 
to fly drug money from fort lauderdale to panama if convicted he 
could be sentenced to five years in prison 
noriega confined at the metropolitan correctional center 
outside of miami faces up to 145 years in prison if convicted of 
accepting 46 million in bribes from colombias medellin drug 
cartel to turn panama into a safe haven for usbound drugs

nelson mandelas call for continued 
sanctions on south africa drew applause wednesday from the european 
parliament but his visit also prompted a brawl among parliamentary 
members in the chambers restaurant 
the black nationalist leader on a tour of europe and north 
america said profound and irreversible changes had not yet 
occurred in south africa despite recent moves toward reform he 
said even a partial lifting of sanctions would be disastrous 
we commend this parliament for the role it has played in 
the struggle to isolate apartheid south africa mandela said 
mandela also told reporters the african national congress needs 
money in buckets to continue its bid to end south africas 
racial segregation policy 
mandela is deputy president of the anc and many parliamentarians 
decorated their desks with the ancs black green and yellow flag 
but not all the 518 parliamentarians heard mandelas 45minute 
address absenteeism was highest on the assemblys rightofcenter 
benches notably the liberals the conservatives and extreme 
rightists 
french rightists and belgian socialist jose happart later came 
to blows and namecalling in the membersonly restaurant over 
mandelas visit 
witnesses said happart was first spat at by jeanmarie le pen 
leader of frances far right national front then hit by bernard 
antony another french far rightist they said happart replied by 
kicking antony in the groin 
the incident began when luxembourg socialist robert krieps 
commented to a table of ultrarightists on their absence from the 
chamber when mandela spoke 
happart said later that krieps wondered aloud if mandelas 
speech had not ruined their appetite 
one witness french socialist bernard thareau said le pen did 
not recognize krieps and asked a guard to remove him 
thareau quoted le pen not a frequent attender of the 
parliaments monthly sessions as asking about krieps who is 
that dog 
happart objected and called le pen names 
le pen then spat twice at happart who returned to the table he 
shared with krieps and others 
thareau said antony then came over demanding krieps identify 
himself he said happart replied that both he and krieps were 
parliamentarians at which point antony grabbed happart by the 
collar and hit him 
so i kicked him in the groin happart told reporters 
antony was said to be short of breath for a while but finished 
his meal mandela who was freed in february after 27 years in 
prison begins his us visit next week he was convicted of 
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the whiteled government 
in brussels last month president fw de klerk of south africa 
was hopeful the 12nations european community will soon end its 
sanctions because of the dynamic changes occurring in his 
country 
ec foreign ministers will discuss the issue next week the 
european parliament whose members are elected by voters in ec 
nations has little daytoday power 
in 1986 the ec banned imports of iron steel and gold coins 
from south africa and also banned new investments there 
since mandelas release britain has unilaterally lifted the ec 
ban on new investment 
the european commission the european communitys independent 
executive with powers of proposal on wednesday asked the ec to 
maintain and increase its program of aid to victims of apartheid in 
south africa but to adapt it to the changes now taking place there 
the ec has spent 1176 million on the program since it began in 
1986 
the commission proposed to spend 508 million on it next year

the nation should pump 5 billion over the 
next five years into social services to stem drug abuse among 
pregnant women and to keep families in crisis from falling apart a 
congressman said wednesday 
we cannot allow the budget crisis to overwhelm the crisis of 
americas families said rep thomas downey dny acting 
chairman of the house ways and means human resources subcommittee 
downey said his family preservation act introduced with several 
cosponsors would build on existing programs to prevent drug abuse 
among pregnant women help boarder babies left in hospitals by 
crackaddicted mothers and expand social services to help find ways 
to keep families together 
he estimated it would cost 500 million the first year sounded 
undaunted by the intense competition over scarce federal funds 
the timing of the bill he said was intended to take advantage 
of upcoming budget talks between congressional leaders and the bush 
administration to ensure that if taxes are increased the money 
will not be used just to defray the budget deficit 
the bush administrations budget to fund the national drug 
control strategy calls for about 350 million for prevention and 
treatment for pregnant women who use drugs and for their children 
said daryl kade of the office of national drug control policy 
legislation cosponsor rep george miller dcalif said the 
bill responds to problems unanticipated 10 years ago such as 
widespread drug use aids child abuse and neglect that have 
come together to overwhelm the child welfare system to overwhelm 
the foster care and adoption system in this country 
the announcement of the legislation coincided with the release 
of a congressional study requested by downey called the enemy 
within crackcocaine and americas families 
the report compiles findings of previously reported studies and 
notes that 
an estimated 375000 children born each year are exposed to 
some drug while in the womb 
more than 100000 cocaineexposed babies were born in 1988 and 
studies have said that number could reach 500000 to 4 million by 
the year 2000 
about 360000 children were placed in foster care in 1989 a 29 
percent increase over 1986 with the largest increases in cities 
hit hardest by crack 
despite the publicity over boarder babies the problem may 
not be as severe as the media coverage would indicate affecting 
only certain hospitals in certain cities in addition studies have 
found that many mothers remain in contact with their children and 
are prevented by authorities from taking them home

reluctant democrats pushed a constitutional 
amendment against flag burning past its first congressional hurdle 
wednesday just two days after the supreme court threw out the 
federal flagprotection law 
rep robert w kastenmeier dwis complained its unseemly 
that were rushing to judgment as the proposed amendment whisked 
though the house constitutional and civil rights subcommittee 
supporters of the amendment called the flag a symbol of all 
that america stands for and deserving of special protection 
while critics said that the plan would mutilate the bill of 
rights and the entire issue smacked of electionyear politics 
both sides said if the house were to vote today on the amendment 
it would be close the proposal would have to win twothirds 
majorities in both houses and approval by 38 state legislatures to 
take effect 
wednesdays subcommittee session relaunched in a fiery burst 
of congressional rhetoric the proposed amendment that was set 
aside last year as congress passed the statute overturned by the 
supreme court on monday 
the house panel voted 53 to send the measure to the full 
judiciary committee with an adverse recommendation a symbolic 
dark cloud that will have no effect on its chances of eventually 
being adopted 
the three republicans on the subcommittee all of whom favor the 
amendment voted no on the roll call because they wanted a 
favorable recommendation 
you dont see that very often said panel chairman don 
edwards dcalif an outspoken critic of the plan 
president bush passed up a chance to restate the vigorous 
support of an amendment that he voiced on monday after the court 
ruling and again on tuesday but his wife barbara endorsed his 
views on the subject saying youre darn right im always with 
the president 
bush himself addressed a number of topics with a group of 
reporters but didnt bring up the flag 
retired supreme court chief justice warren e burger who often 
has cautioned against adding amendments to the constitution 
declined to give advice to his former colleagues or anyone else on 
the subject as he appeared with mrs bush on the white house lawn 
along with students who won a poster contest honoring the 
constitution 
retired justices shouldnt have any thoughts as to what 
present justices should do burger said 
at the house subcommittee supporters and critics alike said the 
final decision would be made on the house floor most likely before 
lawmakers go on recess at the end of the month and perhaps much 
sooner 
i dont think its going to be an overwhelming vote but we 
will get the twothirds said rep james sensenbrenner rwis 
the ranking minority member of the panel edwards merely said it 
would be very close 
the amendment would allow the federal government and the states 
to pass laws outlawing burning or other mutilation of the flag 
the supreme court threw out last years statute barring flag 
mutilation saying it violated the right to free speech 
bush had urged a constitutional amendment last year and renewed 
that call after the court rejected the statute on a 54 vote 
the first planned senate action is a judiciary committee session 
tentatively set for june 21 
edwards was asked if democratic critics of the measure were 
hurrying it to the floor before veterans groups and conservative 
organizations could mount lobbying campaigns we ought to get it 
behind us so we can go on with the countrys business he replied 
he said he was in the navy in world war ii and a lot of my 
friends were killed and i feel very strongly about it he told of 
passing out copies of the constitution to students in prague on a 
recent trip and how eagerly those young people snatched up the 
document 
i hate to think that id have to stand before the same 
students and say yes heres the bill of rights but weve just 
weakened it weve just mutilated it edwards declared 
sensenbrenner said we all love the flag we all love the 
constitution we all love the bill of rights he scoffed at 
complaints about the amendment saying i dont believe it to be 
the outrageous attack on free speech that its opponents believe it 
to be 
it doesnt restrict anyone from saying anything they want to 
say about an issue about a public official about a candidate for 
office he said 
rep craig james rfla said the flag deserves special 
protection 
the flag represents all that america stands for it embodies 
all the america means he said 
but rep pat schroeder dcolo said for 200 years as a 
nation we have been mature enough to bite our lip when we saw flag 
burnings and cross burnings one of the first things hitler did 
was make flag burning a crime in nazi germany 
rep john conyers dmich said that there was no line i know 
of anywhere in the united states waiting to burn the flag 
this is about the politics of reelection this is about the 
politics of hypocrisy this is about manipulation of this symbol 
for political advantage

there is growing uneasiness about global 
prices of corn and other coarse grains because of wet spring 
weather in the united states an agriculture department report said 
wednesday 
while the outlook for the 1990 world wheat crop continues to 
be generally favorable heavy rains across the major corngrowing 
areas of the united states have delayed corn planting the report 
said 
that is causing concern in the marketplace about prospects for 
the 1990 us crop and because of the united states dominance 
the worlds coarse grain price outlook as well the report said 
in addition analysts said there had been rather strong 
lateseason import demand for coarse grains that will result in 
a large drawdown in world coarse grain stocks during the 
remainder of the 198990 season 
on tuesday the usda projected 1990 corn production at 81 
billion bushels up from 753 billion bushels harvested last year 
despite the increase in production total exports and domestic use 
are even larger meaning that the nations stockpile will dwindle 
further in 199091 
also the projections are highly tentative and were based on 
yield trends and planting indications derived from march surveys 
wet weather however has delayed spring planting and prompted 
concern about reduced yields and acreages 
the departments first official corn estimate wont be released 
until aug 9 along with prospects for soybeans sorghum cotton 
and other 1990 springplanted crops 
looking further at the global coarse grain situation which 
includes sorghum barley and rye as well as corn the report said 
shifting trade patterns are beginning to affect the outlook for 
the 199091 marketing year 
crop shortfalls especially in brazil are already influencing 
import patterns the report said in addition foreign 
exportable supplies will be limited until newcrop output is 
available for export 
thus it said there will be continued greater reliance on the 
united states for coarse grain particularly as the 1990 crops 
develop 
according to the projections corn prices at the farm may 
average in the range of 235 to 275 per bushel in the 199091 
marketing year that begins sept 1 prices in the current season 
are forecast to average 235 to 240 per bushel

a bush administration official acknowledged 
wednesday that great lakes cleanup programs have lagged and 
promised to quicken the pace skeptical senators said they had 
heard it all before 
f henry habicht ii deputy administrator of the environmental 
protection agency said a heavy workload and the complexity of 
developing and implementing cleanup programs for the polluted lakes 
were chiefly to blame for the lack of progress 
we have to develop a longterm strategy that is based on good 
science and investment habicht said its a big undertaking 
he told the subcommittee on oversight of government management 
that the bush administration opposes writing into law deadlines for 
getting cleanup initiatives under way 
we do want to set goals for ourselves but sometimes deadlines 
can have us focus on areas that may not be the top priority of 
agency experts habicht said our experience indicates that 
codifying deadlines does not assure high quality results and raises 
unreasonable public expectations 
sen carl levin dmich the subcommittee chairman said 
deadlines were necessary because of epas lack of progress in 
implementing the 1987 great lakes water quality agreement between 
the united states and canada 
levin is a sponsor of pending legislation that would set 
deadlines for the epa to complete cleanup plans for 42 polluted 
areas of the lakes the provisions are part of a comprehensive 
coastal protection bill that cleared the environment and public 
works committee on tuesday

could it be that the hated zebra mussel isnt 
all bad 
soviet scientists apparently think so says an environmental 
protection agency official who is planning to visit moscow next 
month in search of ideas for battling the tiny mollusks 
officials are frantically searching for a way to prevent 
infestation of the great lakes by the pesky mussels with their 
zebralike stripes 
valdas v adamkus the epas national program manager for the 
great lakes said wednesday he had received some papers from soviet 
scientists who earlier notified him they had developed a biological 
method of attacking the pest 
zebra mussels breed rapidly and attach themselves to municipal 
water intake pipes 
much to his surprise however the papers said nothing about 
ways to eradicate the mussel adamkus said instead they described 
the creature as useful because it can help control water pollution 
they proved through their scientific work that zebra mussels 
can be a cleansing agent he said so instead of trying to 
reduce them they are actually trying to increase their 
population 
we were surprised he said were trying to eliminate the 
zebra mussels and they are actually using them as an agent for 
purification of water 
how the mussels could clean dirty water isnt clear adamkus 
said but the report has made him all the more eager to visit the 
soviet union 
im going to call on all the available scientists over there 
meet with them get any information or whatever scientific work or 
literature is available he said 
last summer the mussels clogged the water intake pipe of 
monroe mich restricting the flow through the 6000foot pipe by 
nearly 24 percent 
zebra mussels originated in eastern europes freshwater seas and 
are believed to have entered the great lakes in the ballast water 
of oceangoing vessels 
they showed up in lake st clair in 1987 and rapidly infested 
lake erie they have been spotted from duluth minn to new york 
in a related development the house appropriations committee 
voted wednesday to spend 1 million for zebra mussel research at 
the great lakes research laboratory at ann arbor 
another 3 million for zebra mussel study was reserved pending 
completion of legislation to authorize the sea grant program said 
rep bob carr dmich a committee member 
the panel also set aside 14 million to combat the sea lamprey 
another great lakes pest

terence oneill a former prime minister of 
northern ireland who attempted to reconcile protestants and roman 
catholics in the 1960s has died the government said wednesday he 
was 75 
oneill who served as the provinces prime minister from 
196369 died tuesday at his home in lymington hampshire 
britain suspended northern irelands parliament in 1972 in the 
the face of growing sectarian and political violence and instituted 
direct rule in 1973 
oneill was named a lord in 1970 and spoke frequently in 
britains house of lords on northern ireland 
irish prime minister charles haughey said of oneill he was a 
good man who meant well and perhaps if he had succeeded in the 
things he undertook the whole course of events in northern ireland 
might have been different 
irish deputy prime minister brian lenihan added he will 
always be remembered as the terence oneill in the 1960s who with 
irish prime minister sean lemass initiated certain historic 
attempts at reconciliation between all irish people 
oneill was born on sept 10 1914 into an aristocratic 
angloirish family 
he fought with the irish guards during world war ii and in 1946 
entered northern irelands parliament as a member of the 
predominantly protestant unionist party 
he succeeded lord brookeborough as prime minister in 1963 
soon after taking office he introduced reforms aimed at 
accommodating the growing political aspirations of the roman 
catholic minority he also worked to strengthen trade with ireland 
in january 1965 after a surprise visit by irish prime minister 
lemass to parliament angry protestant extremists who opposed a 
rapprochment with the predominantly catholic irish republic began 
an oneill must go campaign led by the rev ian paisley 
in 1968 friction between catholics and protestants escalated 
into violent riots in northern ireland convincing oneill of the 
need for reform 
he faced opposition from his home secretary william craig who 
demanded strong police action against civil rights demonstrators 
oneill fired craig and instituted a number of reforms to aid 
the catholic community including changes in local administration 
frustrated by critics who feared the loss of british 
sovereignty oneill called a general election in february 1969 he 
managed to win leadership of his badly split party but resigned 
two months later 
jack lynch irish prime minister from 196673 described oneill 
as a man of courage and vision 
its a great pity that he was unable to bring the majority of 
his cabinet along with him in his reforms he clearly wanted 
to see the people of all ireland north and south live in peace 
friendship and economic well being lynch said 
oneill is survived by a wife the former katherine jean 
whitaker and a son and daughter

the differences between menem 59 and his 46yearold wife have

demonstrators tore down barricades that 
tied up traffic in downtown sofia on wednesday after an opposition 
leader said it was not the right way to protest election results 
favoring the former communists 
the leadership of the main opposition alliance the union of 
democratic forces issued a statement asking that public order be 
maintained it said such action as blocking main streets turns 
the citizens against the udf 
the 16party udf alliance trailed the governing socialist party 
formerly the communist party in sundays firstround voting for 
parliament bulgarias first free elections in 58 years 
final results were expected thursday election officials said 
traffic halted in much of sofia on wednesday because of the 
barricades 
udf leader zhelyu zhelev appealed to protesters to unblock the 
streets and disperse saying your reaction is not adequate to 
the situation we ask you in the name of our political cause to 
remove the barricades 
after about an hour the barricades came down and traffic resumed 
political analysts said it was still possible the opposition 
could gain a slight edge after secondround voting next sunday 
given the partial results from the first round and projections by 
west german and bulgarian vote experts 
leaders of the udf and of other opposition groups agreed to back 
each others candidates in runoffs to be held in 81 constituencies 
where no candidate received mpore than 50 percent of the vote 
in other protest developments 
television employees complained that state tv failed to 
accurately cover the elections and backed a student demand that the 
director of tv pavel pisarev resign the state bta news agency 
reported up to 300 people continued a protest near the tv station 
pressing demands for pisarevs resignation 
sofia university students kept up a sitin strike begun tuesday 
at the main university building demanding publication of alleged 
electoral abuses exams were suspended as faculty joined students 
in demanding lifting of the news blackout bta said it said 
students in at least three other cities supported the strike as 
did the independent trade union podkrepa 
podkrepa asked its supporters to show their feelings about the 
elections by peaceful civic means by rallies demonstrations 
and human chains 
bulgarian state radio reported demonstations in yambol ruse 
veliko tarnovo vratsa and varna bta said about 30 people in 
yambol went on a 24hour hunger strike tuesday 
varna protesters held up a banner declaring the black sea port 
a zone free of communism 
this was apparently a spinoff of the communist free zone 
declared in university square in bucharest by anticommunist 
protesters who blockaded the square for 53 days before police 
roughly dispersed them early wednesday 
half of parliaments 400 seats are being filled by direct 
election the other 200 based on the percentage of votes each party 
receives 
the socialists won 75 seats outright last sunday according to 
final results released wednesday by the central election commission 
udf candidates won 32 seats and the mostly ethnicturkish 
movement for rights and freedoms won in nine state radio reported 
one seat went to an independent and one each to two small 
opposition parties 
the socialists apparently won easily in four of the 28 regional 
districts and the udf won in a fifth as well as in sofia 
sundays runoffs will mostly pit the socialist party against the 
udf 
the udf favors more rapid reforms toward a westernstyle market 
economy the socialists are more cautious 
some of the current leaders of the socialist party renamed 
from the communist party played a decisive role in ousting 
hardline communist strongman todor zhivkov last november and 
initiating reform

a kidnapped us gold miner may not be 
released because the 60000 his family and community scraped 
together for what it thought was his ransom is only onetenth what 
his captors are demanding 
the last we know the demand still stands at 350 million 
pesos which is about 612000 jeffrey fino general manager of 
the iminco mining company in ecuador that employed scott heimdal of 
peoria ill said wednesday 
fino has been closely involved in negotiations with the 
communist guerrillas who kidnapped the 27yearold heimdal in late 
april and took him to neighboring colombia he said the family had 
been under the impression if they paid 60000 their son would be 
freed 
however the 60000 that heimdals workingclass family 
collected from community donations was money the guerrillas were 
demanding simply to guarantee his life fino said 
the guerrillas have demanded the higher figure all along said 
fino who added it was not clear how the family came to 
misunderstand the demand 
the captives father roy heimdal said fino had not told him 
the guerrillas were demanding the higher amount though they talked 
repeatedly 
my understanding is the demand was brought down to 60000 
said roy heimdal they said we want 60000 or we will show 
you where the body is 
he said he interpreted the threat to mean 60000 would win 
freedom for their son 
in comments wednesday from peoria he also said there had been 
confusion throughout the negotiations and problems in translation 
this is a complete surprise to me its just like a seesaw 
that keeps going up and down roy heimdal said 
his wife marge said they could raise no more money for the 
guerrillas we sold everything we had and had to get help from 
strangers to raise 60000 we dont have anymore im on the verge 
of losing my sanity 
fino 39 said a meeting with rebels monday where part of the 
60000 was delivered ended in failure 
their leader was not there there were about eight guerrillas 
there was no negotiator they were yelling and screaming at our 
intermediary reaching an agreement is very difficult and dangerous 
under these circumstances 
the guerrillas were upset because the gobetween tried to 
deliver the payment in dollars instead of colombian currency even 
though they originally demanded dollars fino said 
to make clear how irrational and unlogical these guys are 
they told our intermediary to take the dollars from the middle of 
the jungle and be back within three hours with colombian pesos or 
they were going to kill scott 
he had to get back in a canoe go back to the little river 
port he had left from grab a taxi and go into the main town of 
lago agrio he cleaned out the town of pesos fino said 
but there was not enough colombian currency in lago agrio a 
tiny ecuadoran oil town 25 miles southwest of the rendezvous site 
to make the full payment 
the guerrillas set a date later this month for the balance of 
the payment fino would not reveal the date 
at that time we will demand scotts release for that amount 
of money he said they need to understand thats all the money 
theyre going to get 
heimdal had been working with iminco helping dredge river beds 
for gold deposits in the ecuadoran jungle when he was abducted 
armed men wearing camouflage uniforms attacked a canoe heimdal 
was aboard the boat was traveling the bermeja river in thick 
jungle about five miles from the colombian border and 100 miles 
northeast of quito 
the boats driver was killed in the attack the attackers who 
identified themselves as members of the peoples liberation army a 
colombian guerrilla group freed an ecuadoran geology student also 
in the boat and sent him to quito with the ransom demand 
fino described the latest contacts with the kidnappers in an 
interview in his oneroom office in quito 9300 feet high in the 
andes 
spread across his desk were photos taken by the guerrillas at a 
camp inside colombia the photos showed heimdal sitting in a 
hammock or beside a campfire beneath the jungle canopy 
close by were guerrillas pointing machine guns at him 
he said in their first meeting the guerrillas demanded 15 
million in ransom then came down to 12 million in two 
minutes 
we have been trying to convince them that theyve got the 
wrong person fino said the company is not wealthy we have 
been running up a debt not a profit the family is not rich 
they still believe there is money if we could convince them 
that this 60000 is all there is we feel they would understand 
that and release scott 
heimdals friends in peoria describe him as an adventurer they 
say he saved up money from a job as a computer technician in boston 
to go to south america 
heimdal with iminco since october operated electronic 
equipment that located gold deposits on the river bottom he also 
was overseeing construction of a large dredge 
fino said he has received reports heimdal was suffering from a 
problem with his feet and he thinks it most likely is an infection 
from flea bites 
he sent in antibiotics and says the guerrillas promised to 
provide medical treatment for heimdal 
fino says he remains distrustful of the kidnappers 
one part of me is extremely optimistic he said but 
another part of me is extremely scared because these people are 
irrational theyre unpredictable that makes them very dangerous

the united states will stop its efforts to set 
up mideast peace talks unless israel agrees to proceed without 
delay secretary of state james a baker iii said wednesday 
the phone number for the white house switchboard is 
2024561414 when youre serious about this call us baker said 
in comments directed to the israeli government 
baker testifying before the house foreign affairs committee 
urged the new government of prime minister yitzhak shamir to accept 
the us plan for talks with palestinians those talks could lead 
to elections among the 17 million palestinians in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
if the new government which includes some of israels most 
hawkish politicians puts unacceptable conditions for palestinian 
participation in the talks there wont be any dialogue there 
wont be any peace baker said 
the united states cannot get the talks going unless israel shows 
willingness he said 
meanwhile shamir and foreign minister david levy said they 
wanted american guarantees that israel would not have to speak to 
the palestine liberation organization or discuss any palestinian 
state in usproposed peace talks 
deal with us as allies first we have to reach an 
agreement on these things and then other things can certainly be 
achieved levy said at a ceremony in jerusalem formally 
installing him as foreign minister 
bakers comments are expected to exacerbate tensions with the 
israeli government which already has embarked on a collision 
course with washington by pledging to spend more on jewish 
settlements in the occupied lands and by refusing to promise to 
refrain from settling soviet jews there 
that issue will be raised in the next few weeks when the united 
states begins discussions with israel about implementing a bill 
granting the israelis 400 million in housing guarantees for the 
influx of soviet jews 
baker said he didnt know what assurances the administration 
would seek except for the standard pledge to use us money only 
in the lands it held before the 1967 mideast war 
the united states does not recognize israeli sovereignty over 
land seized during the war 
shamir in an interview published wednesday in the 
englishlanguage jerusalem post denied his government would build 
new settlements in the occupied lands 
the emphasis will be on the strengthening of the now 
existing settlements shamir said 
bakers public lecture was met with dismay by the israeli 
embassy and the powerful jewish lobby 
an embassy statement said the new government was willing and 
eager to promote the peace process which it said was best served 
by direct communications between the us administration and the 
new israeli government 
seymour reich chairman of the conference of presidents of major 
jewish organizations said bakers remarks were both surprising and 
disturbing 
the bush administration has shown patience perhaps 
excessive patience with the plos refusal to condemn the 
attempted terrorist raid against the tel aviv beaches and to 
discipline abu abbas who claimed credit for it similar patience 
with the new government in jerusalem might have been a wiser course 
than conducting diplomacy in public as mr baker did today 
reich said in a statement 
in february baker said it appeared that 11 months of us 
mediation were about to bear fruit with a historic 
israelipalestinian dialogue 
but israels coalition government refused to take the final step 
of accepting the formula for composition of the palestinian 
delegation leading to the march 15 collapse of the government 
baker told the committee that he had asked israel to accept a 
list of palestinian delegates made up of residents from the 
occupied territories as well as some who had been deported from 
the territories and palestinians with addresses both in east 
jerusalem and the territories 
the complicated formula was designed to appease israel and the 
plo with which israel refuses to negotiate 
its very hard for us to understand why we didnt get a 
yes answer baker said 
however he said the administration was willing to let bygones 
be bygones 
the challenge for all sides is to try to put the peace 
process back on track and to see if we cant create a better 
environment for peacemaking baker said 
for palestinians he said it means looking beyond the tragic 
human losses that they have suffered and recommitting themselves to 
the political process 
at least 717 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians and 45 israelis have died in an uprising in the 
territories that began in december 1987

military leaders said wednesday they 
should not be held responsible for atrocities following a 1973 
coup but the countrys roman catholic bishops urged the courts to 
determine guilt 
the clash over past human rights abuses intensified last week 
with the discovery of at least 20 wellpreserved bodies in a mass 
grave in the northern fishing town of pisagua used as a detention 
camp for antigovernment leftists in late 1973 and early 1974 
an interior ministry subsecretary belisario velasco said 
wednesday that of the 20 bodies 17 had bullet wounds two were 
mutilated and one was beheaded he said 15 bodies have been 
identified and their remains will be handed over to relatives 
former military ruler augusto pinochet led the sept 11 1973 
coup that ousted an elected leftist government during a period of 
political and economic upheaval his 16year authoritarian rule was 
stained by charges of widespread rights abuses 
pinochet handed over the presidency to an elected successor in 
march but retains command of the 60000member military 
pinochet sat in the front row his face grim and brow lowered 
when an army declaration was read at a gathering of the generals 
corps wednesday 
looking at things from the perspective of the peace we now 
enjoy it may appear that the military reaction was exaggerated 
it said but this overlooks the fact that sept 11 1973 was a 
military operation that is a war action 
it said chile was being torn apart by an internal war 
provoked by foreign ideologies 
war is never bloodless and always brings pains hates 
injustices and inhumanities the army statement continued thus 
we demand respect for our institution and for those who carried out 
in our ranks the tough chores of war 
while in power pinochet decreed an amnesty for all rights abuse 
that occurred before march 1978 
a statement issued by chiles bishops released at almost the 
same hour as the armys said that trying to elude responsibility 
for atrocities attempted to justify the unjustifible 
it will be the job of the justice system to clear up events 
and determine guilt the bishops said the country needs to 
know what happened 
they also said anyone with information on the whereabouts of 
missing victims should step forward at least 700 people 
disappeared during the wave of political repression that followed 
the coup according to rights groups 
president patricio aylwin has created a special commission to 
investigate and report on the rights violations that occurred 
during pinochets rule the army has expressed fears of a political 
witch hunt

president bush said wednesday he would oppose 
legislation providing federal payment for workers who lose their 
jobs in the northwest because of efforts to protect the rare 
northern spotted owl 
but leaders of the northwests timber industry came away from a 
meeting with interior secretary manuel lujan jr optimistic that 
plans are in the works to minimize the economic hardship on the 
region if the owl is listed next week as a threatened species 
bush said during a white house news conference he is very much 
concerned about the potential loss of jobs as a result of this 
spotted owl problem 
the president said however his administration opposed a senate 
amendment that would have compensated workers displaced by the 
clean air act and would follow the same logic in the case of the 
owl 
i opposed that and i would oppose a similar amendment bush 
said 
the us fish and wildlife service is expected to declare the 
owl as a threatened species by june 23 one panel of government 
scientists has estimated that timber harvests on federal lands in 
the northwest will have to be cut nearly in half to save the owl 
from extinction a move the government projects would cost more 
than 28000 jobs by the end of the decade 
i want those 30000 families to understand that we care very 
much about that but i cannot say that i would support the very 
kind of amendment that i opposed bush told reporters 
but i hope that we can have a resolution of this problem that 
will not result in throwing 30000 families out of work he said 
rep denny smith rore and a delegation of oregonians 
representing the timber industry are scheduled to meet at the white 
house on thursday to discuss the issue with chief of staff john 
sununu and other presidential advisers 
sununu said wednesday he is hopeful the fish and wildlife 
service will issue a listing decision that doesnt gut the 
economic vitality of that region 
the oregon delegation met on wednesday with lujan agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter and forest service chief f dale

the bush administration will ask congressional 
negotiators at highlevel budget talks to give special treatment to 
nasa one of the presidents chief domestic priorities officials 
said wednesday 
the officials who spoke on condition they not be identified 
said the white house would propose that negotiators work out a 
specific spending figure for next years nasa budget 
in budget summits of past years administration and 
congressional officials have agreed to a single spending amount 
covering thousands of domestic programs including nasa the 
budgets for individual agencies were then determined by congress 
during the regular legislative process 
president bush would thus greatly enhance his role in 
determining nasas budget if it is negotiated directly between 
white house and congressional negotiators 
that would be important to bush and nasa because congress does 
not want to increase the space agencys budget by as much as the 
president would like 
the administrations proposal to consider nasa separately would 
also leave the thousands of remaining domestic programs vulnerable 
to cuts that may be agreed to by budget bargainers negotiators 
meeting wednesday for a seventh time are looking for ways to 
shrink next years federal deficit by 45 billion to 60 billion 
many lawmakers would be likely to reject bushs proposal to 
negotiate separately over nasa said aides who asked to not be 
identified 
they said bushs idea would provide protection to his pet 
project while leaving their favorite programs exposed to potential 
spending cuts 
in his budget for fiscal 1991 bush proposed giving nasa 152 
billion a 24 percent increase over this years 123 billion that 
was the largest increase bush requested for any of the governments 
major agencies 
the exploration of space has benefits for the united states 
that go far beyond the quantifiable bush said in his budget 
which he presented in january 
congress has so far been less generous with the space agency 
nasa would receive 14 billion next year under a fiscal 1991 
budget approved in may by the house a separate spending plan 
approved by the senate budget committee last month would give the 
agency 142 billion 
both congressional budgets were written by majority democrats 
asked to confirm the administrations intentions one official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said you can say 
administration sources wouldnt deny it

about 120 prospective jurors in the trial of 
three teenagers accused of raping and nearly killing a central 
park jogger were given questionnaires wednesday asking their 
attitudes on race and crime 
all three defendants are black teenagers who live in harlem 
the victim is a 29yearold white investment banker 
the 54question 17page form was handed to those from a pool of 
382 who told state supreme court justice thomas galligan they would 
be able to stay for a six to eightweek trial 
the questionnaire asks if the prospective juror or his or her 
children attended an integrated school whether the person has 
lived in a racially mixed community and whether he or she has 
friends of a different race 
it also asks whether the individual would prefer help from a 
police officer of his or her own racial or ethnic group if in need 
of assistance 
the questions were agreed on by all parties in the case said 
michael joseph attorney for defendant antron mccray 15 
members of the guardian angels community patrol group marched in 
front of the manhattan courthouse passing out leaflets that said 
the case is not a question of black and white its about whats 
wrong and whats right 
mccray and five other youths are charged with gang raping and 
beating the woman as she jogged through the central park the 
evening of april 19 1989

a coma and being treated at a connecticut rehabilitation hospital

sodomy sexual abuse assault robbery and riot the other three 
youths are to be tried later also as adults 
if any in the first group were to be convicted they would be 
sentenced as juveniles and would face a maximum of 10 years in 
prison 
the questionnaire also asks potential jurors if they have a 
particular bias against people accused of sex crimes whether they 
or any of their relatives jog and whether they use central park 
often 
in addition there are the usual questions about whether the 
prospective juror has relatives in law enforcement or has been a 
crime victim

leaders in the disposable diaper industry said 
wednesday that cloth competitors and consumer misunderstandings 
likely accounted for recent survey results indicating strong 
support for banning their product 
its not a simple issue of environment vs paper diapers 
said scott stewart a spokesman for procter amp gamble co 
the roughly 16 billion disposable diapers sold every year have 
become an environmental and health issue as local governments try 
to deal with mountains of used bacterialaden dirty diapers and 
rapidly filling landfills 
bans or taxes on disposable diapers are being considered in at 
least 20 states nebraska for example has generally banned the 
sale of new nondegradable diapers effective oct 1 1993 
a national media generalassociated press poll on environmental 
concerns found that 71 percent of respondents supported a ban on 
disposable diapers 
in a recent wall street journalnbc news poll respondents 
favored a ban on disposable diapers by a 31 ratio in a gallup 
organization poll 43 percent of respondents supported a ban and 
38 percent favored a tax 
but stewart said the criticism is misleading he said disposable 
diapers account for only about 1 percent of trash in the nations 
landfills 
furthermore he said cloth diapers were not necessarily 
environmentally safer because they take more energy to make and 
need water for cleaning 
we dont get rattled about surveys because they dont tell us 
anything we dont already know stewart said our competition 
the cloth diaper industry has been relatively successful in 
painting this as an environmental problem 
theres no dispute that disposables contribute to solid waste 
but its a relatively small part and its unfair to say it is a 
major contributor 
procter amp gamble says its pampers and luvs have about half of 
the nations 35 billionayear disposable diaper business the 
other major manufacturer is dallasbased kimberlyclark corp 
which makes huggies 
kimberlyclark spokeswoman jean allen said it was unfair to 
blame disposable diapers for all landfill problems she said 
consumers who used disposables simply weighed convenience against 
environmental costs 
if you were to ban disposable diapers and use cloth you would 
not come up with no environmental cost she said an individual 
has to balance that cost water is a limited resource there are 
chemical and detergent wastes to be considered and air pollution 
this way the consumer has the right to weigh what they 
consider the best alternative against the environmental cost 
jack mogavero president of general health care corp of 
piscataway nj said his company delivers nearly 29 million 
cloth diapers a week in 14 states 
i dont know anything about any poll but i know what the 
consensus of the people is based on the number of customers we 
serve weekly mogavero said by telephone weve experienced 
tremendous growth and i have to attribute that to the ecology 
issue 
mogavero said his company processes cloth diapers for softening 
and to inhibit bacteria growth 
that along with home delivery and the ecology issue is 
turning the business around he said i think the public is 
extremely concerned with the ecology issue not just diapers 
the national association of diaper services estimated in october 
that 750000 households used cloth diaper services a 385 percent 
increase in a year 
some hospitals are switching to cloth after years of using 
disposables 
while wellintentioned the perception that has driven that 
decision is that disposables are an environmental hazard and they 
are not stewart said some small companies have developed 
disposables they say are degradable but neither of the big 
producers have such plans both said actual disposal conditions 
tended to limit any breakdown of a degradable diaper over time 
at this time we dont see the socalled biodegradable diaper 
as a real solution ms allen said nothing degrades in a 
landfill to say a diaper degrades in a landfill is a marketing 
claim you can dig up a newspaper 25 years later and read it

liberian government and rebel 
delegations met for six hours wednesday and agreed to an appeal 
from liberias religious leaders to end attacks on civilians 
a joint statement signed by both sides made no reference to

5monthold civil war but it said an end to attacks on 
noncombatants will go a long way in enhancing the peace process 
now successfully under way 
more than 1000 people have been killed many of them civilians 
since the rebel national patriotic front moved into liberia from 
the ivory coast on dec 24 and began a drive on monrovia the

council of churches at a us embassy auditorium in the sierra 
leone capital talks will resume thursday 
both sides signed the statement which called for an immediate 
end to the killings molestation and destruction of properties and 
innocent civilians and other noncombatants 
it said the government and insurgents strongly condemned the 
killing harassment and destruction of properties of unarmed 
civilians as such acts will not benefit any side since there can 
be no winners in this fracticidal war 
the statement also said negotiators approved an agenda for 
substantive talks leading to the peaceful resolution of the 
confict 
no mention was made of the demand by rebel leader charles taylor 
that president samuel doe resign and leave liberia before 
negotiations could proceed 
the insurgents have charged does government with human rights 
abuse economic bungling and corruption in the 10 years since doe 
seized power in a violent coup 
most fighting in liberia appeared to have stopped wednesday a 
week after government troops retook a rubber plantation outside the 
capital from the rebels 
but hundreds of americoliberians fled their suburban homes 
wednesday for monrovia they said soldiers accused them of being 
dissidents and supporting taylor 
taylor and thousands of liberias 25 million people are the 
descendants of freed american slaves who founded the west african 
nation in 1847 they oppose doe whose coup ousted other 
americoliberians 
diplomats said the fleeing liberians are trying to leave the 
country by road or air for ivory coast guinea and sierra leone 
they just want to get out and are worrying about getting to 
the united states later said one western diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
a military trial began in monrovia on wednesday of three 
soldiers charged with killing four civilians although hundreds of 
civilians are believed to have been killed by soldiers since the 
insurgency began it was the first known prosecution 
a major and two lieutenants were accused of leading an attack 
saturday on the americoliberian settlement of clay ashland and 
killing the towns mayor and three others 
liberias diplomatic corps on wednesday condemned ethnic 
killings by both government troops and rebels 
the diplomatic corps is dismayed that murders of innocent 
civilians are continuing to occur daily because they belong to 
certain ethnic groups mano gio mandingo krahn 
americoliberians the statement said 
human rights organizations accuse soldiers of killing gios and 
manos many rebels are of those ethnic backgrounds rebels 
retaliated by killing krahns doe is a krahn and mandingos 
accused of supporting doe 
more than 1000 americans mostly liberians carrying us 
passports and hundreds of other european asian and lebanese 
nationals remain in monrovia

protesters stormed state tv offices and burned police headquarters 
witnesses said 
state radio reported four people killed and 93 hospitalized 
four in a very grave state two of those killed were shot to 
death the broadcast added quoting the health ministry 
the soviet news agency tass in a dispatch from bucharest said 
many cars near the interior ministry and police headquarters 
were overturned and set ablaze and two buildings nearby were also 
on fire 
the violence was the worst since the december revolution that 
ousted communist dictator nicolai ceausescu who was executed with 
his wife on christmas day 
the interior ministry now occupies the building that was 
formerly the headquarters of ceausescus despised secret police 
presidentelect ion iliescu accused extremist elements of 
organizing an iron guard rebellion and trying to overthrow the

that supported the nazis 
the violence was touched off by a predawn police raid that 
ended a 53day anticommunist protest in university square in 
downtown bucharest police clubbed and dragged away protesters 
the protesters were demanding that former highranking 
communists like iliescu be banned from holding public office for 10 
years and that independent television stations be established 
in washington the state department said it deplored the use 
of excessive force by the authorities in clearing the square 
we are concerned that this action by the romanian authorities 
may set off a cycle of violence president iliescu and his 
government must now exercise restraint the statement said 
one witness said she helped carry 12 bodies from outside the 
interior ministry and another reported seeing at least two bodies 
but these reports could not be confirmed officially 
demonstrators halted broadcasts for about 45 minutes at state 
tv scene of fierce fighting and dramatic onair appeals for an end

iliescus appeal for responsible people to protect government 
buildings rompres said 5000 miners and thousands of other

an opposition leader liberal party chief sen radu campeanu 
said such action would only aggravate the situation 
the rampage came weeks after romanias first free elections in 
44 years on may 20 tainted by allegations of campaign and 
electoral irregularities

salvation front in power since december and the overwhelming 
winners of last months elections 
demonstrators fought police in the afternoon in university 
square then fanned out to police headquarters the interior 
ministry the tv station and victory square 
we are now facing an organized planned attempt to overthrow 
through force and violence the leadership elected in a free and 
democratic way iliescu said in a communique wednesday night 
iliescu the first excommunist to win a popular presidential 
election in eastern europe pleaded for support for the army and 
security forces to liquidate this iron guard rebellion and 
reinstate calm

ammunition and police uniforms from the interior ministry it said 
a filling station near the ministry was attacked and gasoline 
stolen to make firebombs 
rebecca doina cercel said she and others helped carry 12 bodies 
to ambulances outside the ministry she said the bodies were taken 
to the morgue 
mrs cercels 4yearold son was killed in decembers 
revolution she had been in university square since the protest 
began in april 
mrs cercel 25 told the associated press police clubbed her 
she had bruises on her face and abdomen 
scottish freelance photographer jeremy suttonhibbert said he 
saw soldiers shooting from inside the ministry and the body of a 
man shot in the head 
ap reporter gabriel paslaru said demonstrators who tried to 
force the main gate of the building were met with rifle fire or 
single shots 
i saw one man with an injured hand who fainted before he was 
rushed into a car and another man who was hit in the neck his face 
was a red mask of blood it is hard to believe he could survive 
paslaru said 
police said earlier about 260 people were detained 
state television was stormed by protesters who occupied one of 
the main studios an announcer said they might not be able to 
transmit any longer 
minutes later the picture was cut and then the sound but the 
station went back on the air threequarters of an hour later 
a bunch of people who were drunk got into the tv and it is a 
grave situation which we hope will never again occur said the 
televisions director razvan teodorescu 
earlier demonstrators carrying gasoline cans some armed with 
clubs stormed the regular police headquarters in central 
bucharest then set fire to nearby cars and trucks and a wing of 
the building 
fire trucks arrived to fight the blaze 
about 1500 people gathered outside and booed when helicopters 
flew overhead some protesters marched toward victory square

two other crew members and richard obarry best known as a trainer 
for the flipper television series were detained briefly 
tuesday for allegedly crossing into a restricted zone at key west 
naval station 
they were warned off and in fact crossed the lines anyway 
ensign robin perkins said they were apprehended because they 
were in a restricted naval area 
no charges were filed but she said a report on the incident 
will be referred to the us attorneys office for review 
they werent booked on any kind of charges the films were 
confiscated and they were escorted off base perkins said 
the crew for the nationally syndicated tabloid television show 
and obarry were in a chartered boat about 150 yards away from 
the pens 
there were no signs saying offlimits obarry said we 
were told to get out of there and then ordered to hand over the 
film we were surrounded by 15 navy frogmen 
he said the same thing happened last week to a crew for abcs 
2020 newsmagazine show 
we stand behind our investigative reporter craig rivera as he 
was within the parameters of the law and certainly within the 
parameters of journalistic ethics said program publicist marcy 
baron in new york she would not say whether efforts were being 
made to recover the tape 
obarry has been arrested twice this year in protests at a 
florida keys resort where two recently captured dolphins were being 
held for a marine park 
a pair of navytrained dolphins are in pens at the navy base as 
part of a swimmer nullification program training the marine 
mammals in key west san diego and kaneohe bay hawaii 
the dolphins reportedly are fitted with nose guns and taught to 
kill enemy frogmen to protect submarines armed with trident nuclear 
missiles 
the navy has used dolphins sea lions and beluga whales in 
classified programs since the 1960s 
the program was criticized in 1988 after several trainers 
charged the animals suffered physical abuse and that the program 
suffered from mismanagement rapid employee turnover and pressure

in life and death thousands of pounds 
of atlantic herring have been eating up the oxygen in block 
islands old harbor and stinking up the local lobster industry 
local officials wednesday sought state help for lobstermen who 
lost an undetermined amount of catch when the herring depleted the 
small harbors oxygen supply about 1015 commercial lobstermen 
operate from the harbor 
restaurants on the tourismdependent island also lost lobsters 
stored in tanks that circulate harbor water 
andrew hunt an aide to lt gov roger begin said he was trying 
to arrange relief funds or lowinterest loans for those affected 
experts believe a large school of small fish entered the 
harbors inner basin on the islands east side on june 4 
what we think happened is a school of atlantic herring 
possibly was chased into the basin in the old harbor area by 
predators it could be bluefish or striped bass said joseph 
migliore a scientist with the state department of environmental 
management 
the small fish has a fast metabolism and consumes a lot of 
oxygen the school estimated to weigh 15000 to 50000 pounds 
apparently overwhelmed the sevenacre basin and its oxygen supply 
such fish kills are relatively common in enclosed bodies of 
water but block islanders cant remember such a large kill on 
their isolated dot 12 miles off the rhode island coast 
as far as i know and ive talked to people whove been 
fishing out of that harbor all their lives 15 to 30 years this 
has never happened said chris littlefield harbor master for new 
shoreham the islands only town 
first warden edward mcgovern new shorehams equivalent of a 
mayor said the smell got really bad last week but is improving 
as the fish began dying lobstermen collected about 50 barrels 
for bait but most of the dead fish sank to the bottom and began to 
rot further depleting the oxygen 
unsuspecting lobstermen left their catch in cages filled with 
harbor water for storage until shipment to market and some think 
the lobsters suffocated 
lobsters in restaurant tanks suffered similar fates at least 
some eateries were seeking an alternative storing method until the 
harbor oxygen is restored 
experts could not estimate the extent of the damage or predict 
when the harbor would return to normal 
littlefield said some of the dead fish were beginning to be 
swept out with the tide but most were staying on the bottom

parliament has made drug use a crime in italy in an 
effort to stem an increasing number of overdose deaths and 
narcoticsrelated crimes opponents said the new law infringes on 
personal liberties 
since 1975 italy has had a much more permissive attitude toward 
drug use than most western european countries that law allowed 
possession of a moderate amount of drugs for personal use 
it also left a loophole that permitted many sellers caught by 
the police to claim drugs in their possession were for personal use 
the new law adopted by parliament on tuesday makes it illegal to 
use drugs in all amounts though it remains lenient for those 
caught with no more than a daily dose 
in the case of such small amounts no penalties will be applied 
for those who choose to undergo rehabilitation the precise amount 
of a daily dose will be defined later 
if the user refuses treatment however his drivers license and 
passport can be suspended up to three months further abuse can 
bring jail up to three months 
the new law also stiffens penalities for drug dealing those 
convicted of trafficking in heroin or cocaine can be sentenced to 
eightto20 years in prison and fined up to 420000 the old laws 
maximum penalty was 15 years and 83500 
the new law was adopted to combat a wave of social problems 
related to drug use 
overdose deaths roughly doubled from 1987 to 1989 this years 
total is expected to be even higher about 1000 
also worrisome has been the spread of aids through contaminated 
needles throwing a syringe away in a public place now can bring a 
fine of up to 835 
also under the new law marijuana users caught for the first 
time will be issued a warning 
the list of prohibited drugs includes heroin cocaine 
hallucinogens marijuana and hashish as well as amphetamines and 
barbituates in amounts above medical doses 
opponents say the new law violates their civil liberties

un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar said wednesday he will dispatch a delegation to the 
israelioccupied territories to investigate violence including 
alleged abuses of palestinians 
he said the group would go early next week 
the un chiefs announcement came one day after israels new 
conservative government invited him to send a special envoy but 
perez de cuellar said he was already planning to send a team 
un officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
delegation might depart for israel as early as monday night the 
group will be headed by jeanclaude aime a director in the un 
secretariat 
un officials said the secretarygeneral had been planning for 
several weeks to send an investigative team to the west bank and 
gaza strip where violence has escalated recently 
on tuesday evening perez de cuellar summoned israeli ambassador 
johanan bein to inform him of the plans bein told reporters 
beforehand that israel would initiate an invitation to the un 
team 
he later said israel would fully cooperate with the delegation 
perez de cuellar told reporters the timing of israels 
invitation was a coincidence 
arab states had sought to dispatch a threemember team from the 
security council israel opposed the move and the united states 
vetoed the plan in the security council 
arab league envoy clovis maksoud on wednesday called the israeli 
statement that the invitation was its own initiative a deliberate 
attempt to hijack the mission and rob it of its credibility and 
relevance 
he also said the secretarygenerals mission was independent of 
arab efforts to convene an emergency session of the general 
assembly or the security council on the deteriorating situation in 
the occupied territories 
arab diplomats said they wanted the security council to give its 
blessing to the secretarygenerals mission and wanted to ensure 
that the council would take action on the missions report 
in the past arab diplomts complained reports by the 
secretarygeneral on the occupied lands have not generated security 
council action 
the invitation by israel was the first action in the 
international arena of the new israeli government 
the government of israel on our own initiative extends to 
the secretarygeneral an invitation to secretariat director 
jeanclaude aime to visit israel as an envoy in the framework of a 
visit to the region bein told reporters 
arab nations have said the policies of the new israeli 
government and the escalation of violence in the territories make 
it imperative that the united nations take emergency action to 
protect palestinians 
the new government has said it will take tough measures to quell 
the 30monthold uprising 
the territories were captured by israel in the 1967 middle east 
war and are claimed by the palestinians as a future state

islamic fundamentalists who won a 
majority of local council seats in algerias first multiparty 
elections demanded wednesday that parliament be dissolved so they 
can move to take national power 
the victory by the islamic salvation front in the nationwide 
local elections marks a stunning triumph for islamic hardliners 
and their 16monthold party 
a day after the vote the fundamentalists called on president 
chadli bendjedid to hold national elections within three months 
instead of february 1992 as scheduled the government had no 
immediate response 
the national liberation front had been widely expected to win 
tuesdays voting because of its grip on government machinery and 
the media as well as its greater financial resources it holds 
every seat in parliament 
but on wednesday before any official results were released 
interior minister mohamedsalah mohammedi announced the 
fundamentalist islamic salvation front had won a majority of the 
15000 seats at stake on 1541 municipal and 48 provincial councils 
first official results released later wednesday more than 24 
hours after the voting ended showed the fundamentalists captured 
327 of the 612 municipal council seats counted so far the 
governing party won 208 seats or 33 percent 
the interior minister said the partial official returns 
indicated the anticlerical rally for culture and democracy had won 
51 seats in tuesdays voting with independents and the tiny 
national party for solidarity and development taking the rest 
the interior minister said complications had delayed the count 
and full results would be unavailable before thursday 
the french news agency agence francepresse citing sources 
said the fundamentalists captured councils in algerias four 
largest cities algiers oran constantine and annaba and swept 
45 of the 48 provincial councils 
abassi madani the philosophy professor who heads the islamic 
salvation front denied his movement wishes to turn the country 
into a oneparty religious state 
we guarantee the freedom of all who have ideas on algerias 
future he said 
the algerian people are not stupid added madani 59 the 
truth is the best way to answer all questions 
algerias islamic salvation front seeks to establish the islamic 
legal code the sharia as law 
the party assigns women to a subservient role none of the 
fronts 12000 candidates for office in tuesdays voting were women 
for months fundamentalist supporters have been accused of 
harassing single women and disrupting nightclubs in algiers 
the fundamentalist party boasts 650000 members many are drawn 
from the ranks of unemployed youth attracted by its fiery mix of 
islam and politics 
madani thanked the governing party for holding the elections 
the first multiparty voting since the north african country won 
independence from france in 1962 
the centrist front of socialist forces headed by berber leader 
hocine ait ahmed and the populist leftleaning movement for 
democracy led by former president ahmed ben bella had charged that 
the governing party would rig the vote 
from exile in switzerland ben bella on wednesday called the 
fundamentalist win a vote of noconfidence in the governing party 
and urged really free elections for parliament in the near 
future 
officials of all parties complained wednesday of widespread 
irregularities including multiple voting missing ballots and 
interference at polling places by outsiders and election officials 
the official aps news agency reported that about 40 percent of 
the voters had abstained according to the partial count about 13 
million people were registered to vote 
in france algerias former colonial ruler and home to hundreds 
of thousands of algerian immigrants youth and sports minister 
roger bambuck indicated the results would cause alarm in french 
government ranks 
its with great sadness that i see the rise of fundamentalism 
in algeria he said in a radio interview every time one sees 
dogmatism on the rise whether political or religious its liberty 
that is in danger 
in iran state tehran radio said the results were part of the 
wave of islamization that has gripped northern african nations 
simultaneously 
the development of islamic feeling in these countries is 
similar to algeria but it is suppressed by the ruling regimes 
the radio said 
in tunisia one of algerias neighbors the main islamic group 
was barred from nationwide local elections sunday 
the official news agency reported several groups of islamic 
supporters tried to overrun some algiers voting stations alleging 
the votecounting was influenced by the government 
a number of voters in algiers were turned away from polling 
booths when they appeared without required documents 
the governing party was the sole political party in the nation 
of 24 million people until constitutional changes in february 1989 
opened the way to competing parties 
the party was forced to end its monopoly on power after soldiers 
killed scores of people in october 1988 riots sparked by 
deteriorating economic conditions

premier giulio andreotti said tuesday his government 
was withdrawing venice as a candidate for expo 2000 a worlds fair 
the bureau of international expositions headquartered in paris 
was expected to select the host city on thursday with venice out 
of the running the choice was narrowed to hanover west germany 
and toronto 
critics cited the mess the touristswamped lagoon city was left 
with last summer after a pink floyd concert drew 100000 young 
people to st marks square they argued that the fair would 
further strain venice whose canals cant handle the sewage that 
spills out of hotels and restaurants 
under the proposal venice would have been the centerpiece of 
the international showcase of cultural and scientific exhibits 
other cities in the immediate region would have acted as host for 
some of the attractions 
last week andreotti went before parliament to defend the 
candidacy and promised that parliament would have the last word on 
the plan should venice get the goahead from paris 
andreottis government like venice itself was divided over the 
candidacy some argued that the fair would help relaunch the city 
which has seen venetians flee to solid ground leaving venice to 
tourists and realestate speculators 
last month the european parliament voted overwhelmingly against 
the project and asked italy to withdraw the candidacy 
a senseless plan has failed and venice can thus breathe a sigh 
of relief said italian carlo ripa di meana the european 
communitys environmental commissioner 
on monday 300 members of the 630seat chamber of deputies 
signed a petition against the candidacy following opposition 
expressed by 180 senators in the 324member upper house 
andreotti announced the withdrawal in a meeting with senate 
leaders 
a communique from his office took note of the parliamentary 
opposition but added it goes without saying that the great 
problems of crowding renewal and utilizing the abandoned quarters 
of venice remain even leaving out the exposition 
by the late 1980s venice had 80000 people compared to 175000 
in the 1950s butchers grocers and plumbers have been closing 
their shops along the narrow zigzagging streets of the carless 
city and souvenir vendors are taking their spots a study 
presented two years ago predicted there could be as few as 20000 
venetians left by the year 2015 
many buildings are uninhabitable the lagoon lapping at their 
ground floors and salty sea air wear away foundations and beams 
the lagoons blackgreen waters have also been plagued by 
badsmelling algae which feed on detergents and other chemicals 
dumped into the sea

faced with a splintering empire soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev is proposing to counter secessionist drives by 
transforming the soviet union into a looser federation of sovereign

on german reunification saying a united germany could be an 
associate member of the nato alliance while at the same time 
joining a new paneuropean security order 
he did not define exactly what associate membership would 
entail but the kremlin up to now has opposed a new germany whose 
sole military allegiance is to the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
gorbachev made his proposal about the soviet republics on 
tuesday the same day the parliament of the huge russian republic 
approved a resolution declaring its laws to carry more weight than

president bushs string of successful vetoes 
remains unbroken but democrats are maneuvering for a second chance 
to force an amtrak aid bill into law over his objections 
bush emerged tuesday with the 11th veto of his term intact after 
democrats failed by three votes to muster the twothirds majority 
needed to override the presidents veto of a bill to support the 
rail service 
the president vetoed the 2 billion authorization bill last 
month because it also would have required that the interstate 
commerce commission approve acquisitions of major freight railroads 
by nonrailroad companies 
republicans promised during tuesdays debate that bush would 
support a substitute bill continuing support for the passenger rail 
service as long as the regulatory provision is omitted

1989 turned a profit of 164 million in the first quarter of this 
year it was their first quarter in the black since the last

and when is a freebie golf trip considered a gift only when 
lawmakers say so 
in 1988 the pennsylvania manufacturing association spent a 
reported 20000 entertaining seven lawmakers at a florida golf 
resort only one reported the outing although three others said 
they went but didnt consider it a gift 
lawmakers can get free movie passes in pennsylvania free lift 
tickets at ski resorts in utah race track tickets in maryland 
college basketball tickets in kentucky and all sorts of freebies to 
professional sports 
take a ticket in wisconsin however and youll be criminally 
prosecuted wisconsin is the only state that bars lawmakers from 
taking anything of value even a cup of coffee 
four wisconsin senators were fined for accepting free lodging 
from a special interest while attending a chicago bearsgreen bay 
packers football game in a separate case the tobacco institute 
was fined for giving tickets to a state senator for the los angeles 
lakersboston celtics basketball game during a legislative trip to 
boston 
thirteen states set limits on the value of gifts a legislator 
can accept from a single lobbyist ranging from a 10 per month in 
california to 100 per gift in west virginia 
but theres plenty of room for ambiguity despite nebraskas 
limit of 25 per gift a lobbyist onced hauled a senator around 
with a private plane until state officials intervened 
dannie trautwein executive director of the states 
accountability and disclosure commission said the lobbyist was 
lectured on the intent of the states lobbying law but no one was 
prosecuted because of the vagaries of defining a gift 
he looked me right in the eye and said the plane was just 
going in the same direction as the senator and anbyody could have

the telephone message slips were 
piling up on lobbyist loren smiths desk the callers were state 
legislators and their message was written between the lines they 
wanted money 
smith looked across the big wooden desk across his spacious 
modern office and out the windows that framed the state capitol 
gleaming in the sun after 25 years as a lobbyist he was troubled 
by what he saw 
like most lobbyists smith helps his clients dole out campaign 
contributions to legislators its a role that empowers lobbyists 
guarantees their telephone calls will be returned and their faces 
remembered when they argue for their clients interests it can 
give them influence beyond that of the voters whom legislators 
ostensibly serve 
but increasingly it is giving them pause 
legislators appetites for campaign funds are insatiable and 
lobbyists say they cant fill the lawmakers plates fast enough 
ive never had to buy a vote in my life nor do i intend to 
said smith whose clients include such corporate giants as dow 
chemical and pillsbury 
and yet he feels intense pressure to give money to legislators 
the unspoken implication is that hell lose his influence if he 
doesnt 
the pressure for money doesnt come from us he said im 
not running over there he gestures toward the capitol 
saying can i give you some money for a vote im saying 
and now he slaps his forehead oh god another request 
other lobbyists say the same thing and not just in sacramento 
across the nation legislative campaign spending is careening out 
of control and lobbyists cant or wont stop stoking the 
engines 
the problem is that the legislators have gotten as greedy as 
the lobbyists said state sen julian l lapides of maryland 
the cost of running for public office has risen ever faster in 
the past decade pulled by the lure of television advertising and 
pushed by the stick of competition 
legislative campaign expenses in california rose 180 percent 
between 1978 and 1988 the average race cost 610000 by the end of 
that period no other state is so costly but campaign spending is 
the talk of statehouses from coast to coast 
campaign expenses rose 442 percent in alaska between 1976 and 
1988 costs doubled in new jersey between 1983 and 1987 quadrupled 
in illinois between 1980 and 1988 and quintupled for washington 
state senate races between 1976 and 1986 
it is out of hand theres no question about it said h 
donald stewart a new jersey lobbyist who formerly served in that 
states assembly when he first ran for office 25 years ago 
25000 was considered a huge campaign warchest 
today they make that on one fundraiser stewart said and 
then they have a long way to go 
in the trade route of campaign finance moneyed interests are on 
one coast and politicians on the other lobbyists navigate between 
the two they advise clients on how much to give and to whom and 
they frequently deliver the money 
maryland lobbyist bruce bereano figures hell have a hand in 
dispensing 150000 in campaign funds this year thats a 
conservative figure he added it depends on how the races 
shape up 
those with money arent necessarily picky about who gets it 
frequently lobbyists will recommend that clients give to both 
candidates in a close race just to make sure they help out the 
winner 
its like going to the racetrack and making a bet after the 
race said barry kauffman of pennsylvania common cause which 
lobbies for open government and is critical of lobbyists influence 
lobbyists in most states also buy tickets to legislative 
fundraising parties which have become almost nightly events in 
most state capitals 
in sacramento or albany ny tickets to fundraisers are 
frequently 500 or 1000 each and lobbyists can be invited to as 
many as five or six in an evening richard dugally a lobbyist for 
ford motor co in sacramento figured he could have spent 105000 
in 1988 by buying one ticket to every fundraiser he was asked to 
attend he bought none because its fords policy not to do so 
in some states lobbyists are asked to do more than just buy 
tickets theyre expected to sell them too lapides the maryland 
legislator said some of his colleagues expect lobbyists to sell as 
many as 200 tickets each to fundraisers 
a lobbyist can then become the prime fundraiser for a 
legislator lapides said a legislator would find it impossible 
to view them or legislation that the lobbyist has before that 
legislator objectively 
that gets to the heart of the issue that lobbyists exert 
influence beyond that of an ordinary voter 
most say their influence derives from the interest groups they 
represent not the money they spend and at least some of the time 
thats true 
in california environmental lobbyists exert a powerful 
influence despite being outspent by wealthier opponents in 
delaware legislators say the most powerful lobbyists are those who 
represent volunteer firefighters whose ladders of influence extend 
to nearly every home in the state 
lobbyists say campaign contributions dont buy votes they buy 
access or a friendly relationship or a sympathetic ear 
yet there is sometimes a fine line between access and influence 
last year oregon state sen wayne fawbush disappointed 
environmentalists by voting against a bill to protect a stand of 
oldgrowth trees a bill that fawbush considered a leading 
preservationist had sponsored 
later it was revealed fawbush had received 12000 in campaign 
contributions from the timber industry the previous election year 
it tells us that the thousands of dollars he took from the 
timber industry counted when the chips were down said terry 
nelson the former executive director of oregon common cause 
fawbush denied he had sold his vote but conceded campaign 
contributions buy influence 
if you have a large contributor its only human nature that 
youre going to listen to them he said but listening cant be 
equated to being bought 
in new mexico state sen shannon robinson said he hadnt been 
getting contributions from oil and gas companies until he 
introduced a resolution calling on the state to study them right 
away the money started flowing in he said 
i had to express an interest in an industry in order to get 
that industrys support robinson said 
in that instance the resolution didnt benefit the industry and 
had no binding effect robinson said he always has the best 
interest of voters at heart and hasnt changed a vote because of 
the financial influence of a lobbyist 
still he said you get that kind of money and you think twice 
about the commitment those people made and you try to help them 
with your vote when you can 
nevada assemblyman jim banner said he cared deeply about what 
his constituents had to say but constituents were rarely among his 
major campaign donors and aside from a few zealots he rarely 
heard from the people in his district 
i like to feel clean about it banner said before he retired 
this year but hell a lot of times i push that button and i have 
no idea what my constituents want

there are no college degrees in legislative lobbying no 
entrance exams and no written qualifications but there is one sure 
way to become a lobbyist become a legislator first 
in nearly every state the ranks of the most successful 
lobbyists are filled with former legislators former legislative 
aides and the occasional former governor or congressman just as 
those with money are attracted to the power of legislators so are 
legislators attracted to the allures of money 
its hardly surprising the highest paid legislators those in 
new york state earn under 60000 a year the lowest paid those 
in new hampshire earn a token 100 a year 
good lobbyists in almost any state can earn more than 100000 a 
year in the biggest states they can become millionaires 
we resent it said alaska state senate president tim kelly 
who earns about 30000 a year the disparity between the 
legislator and the lobbyist is outrageous 
but many legislators swallow their resentment and walk through 
the revolving door 
there are more than two dozen former legislators working as 
lobbyists in oklahoma at least 50 in texas 35 in illinois 28 in 
new mexico when the north carolina center for public policy 
research ranked lobbyists in that state according to their clout 
six of the top 10 and eight of the top 15 were former legislators 
in some states such as oklahoma and south carolina former 
legislators have at least one advantage over other lobbyists they 
are allowed onto the floor of the legislature during sessions 
these other guys have to stay out there in the foyer said 
south carolina rep herb kirsh these guys can come in sit down 
kneel by your desk and talk to you 
beyond that former legislators bring a wealth of advantages to 
the lobby they know the names and faces they know how laws are 
made they know how the political game is played 
when hiring lobbyists people ask who has special ins with the 
legislature said lester brann president of the illinois state 
chamber of commerce well former members of the legislature have 
special ins with the legislature 
few states have restrictions on how soon legislators can become 
lobbyists after giving up their seats although some public 
interest groups support a coolingoff period between jobs 
the most common path from legislator to lobbyist is the one 
followed by former assemblyman roger bremner of nevada who became 
a lobbyist after running for the state senate and losing 
bremner didnt go hunting for clients the news of his loss was 
as good as a work wanted ad although his background didnt 
guarantee success for his clients it didnt hurt either 
i know a lot of the players bremner said i know where 
the mens room is i know how the system works

nearly everyone complains about the high cost of campaigning 
but state legislatures have been unable or unwilling to adopt 
regulations that would control the campaign arms race 
common cause among other groups has argued that public 
financing is necessary if candidates are to be freed from the leash 
of special interests thats because courts have ruled that states 
may not limit campaign spending unless they offer candidates public 
money 
yet only four states have any form of public financing of 
legislative races and it hasnt put a lid on campaign spending in 
all of those states 
many people also worry about the propriety of legislators 
receiving contributions when they are actively considering 
legislation but only six states bar candidates from receiving 
contributions during legislative sessions 
states can limit the size of contributions however and many 
have 
twentyseven have set a maximum on how much an individual can 
contribute to a single legislative candidate these range from 220 
per year in arizona to 40009092 per election for senate 
candidates in new york 
seventeen states limit how much individuals can give to 
political action committees ranging from 1000 per year in 
connecticut and massachusetts to 150000 per year in new york 
california voters set a limit of 1000 per contribution in 
1988 that rule is getting its first test this year some fear it 
will put even more pressure on legislators to raise funds because 
theyll have to get more individual contributions to raise the same 
amount of money

if ronald reagans new federalism did nothing 
else it taught washingtons lobbying corps that there is life 
and politics outside the beltway 
a surge of activity in state capitols has set off a political 
equivalent of the gold rush washington lobbyists flocking to 
lucrative diggings in jefferson city and juneau sacramento and 
santa fe boston and baton rouge 
they have worked quietly often unseen but they have brought a 
new sophisticated style of politics to state capitals where 
oldfashioned shoeleather lobbying is now augmented by television 
ad campaigns and computergenerated grassroots organizing 
theres been a huge explosion of interest in the state 
level said paul hallman one of the founding partners of 
multistate associates a lobbying firm with offices in washington 
and great neck ny 
multistate which may be the largest firm of its type maintains 
a roster of 1500 local lobbyists in all 50 states it hires them 
out to such clients as apple computer bristolmyers citicorp 
johnson amp johnson metropolitan life nabisco playtex procter amp 
gamble and union carbide 
you can come to us and we can reach out anywhere in the 
country said steve markowitz the firms other founding partner 
multistate established in 1984 was among the first national 
lobbying firms to capitalize on the state legislative bonanza but 
it is not alone 
hill amp knowlton the huge public relations firm recently 
entered the competition by buying out an established lobbying 
company hoog amp associates of boulder colo 
tom hoog a former aide to sen gary hart who founded the firm 
now works for hill amp knowlton as a senior vice president so far 
this year he said hill amp knowlton has been active in 34 or 35 
states and monitors legislation in all 50 he wouldnt name the 
companys clients 
hill amp knowlton has offices in only two state capitals denver 
and tallahassee fla but hoog said that will change soon as i 
look down the road a couple years i see us opening offices in 10 
to 15 capitals minimum he said 
special interest groups and corporations too are sending their 
own lobbyists into the states in growing numbers the states are 
the battlefield said florida lobbyist lee moffitt the real 
power is in the legislature 
the actual number of bills considered by legislatures has 
remained about the same the past decade it hovers around 200000 
a year for all 50 states according to the national conference of 
state legislatures 
but the nature of the bills has changed the issues are bigger 
the stakes higher smoking abortion assault rifles toxic waste 
tort reform aids all are issues that once might have fallen 
solely under the purview of the federal government now each can be 
found on the agenda of nearly every legislature 
some credit president reagans new federalism with stimulating 
statehouse lobbying by restoring power and responsibility to the 
states 
by that yardstick youd have to say he was a major success 
because issues did move to the states said hoog 
not that the federal government withered it grew larger than 
ever in the reagan years but the reagan administration certainly 
relinquished responsibility for some domestic tasks and many 
critics say the congress became a more difficult place to do 
business more politically charged less open to consensus 
richard gardiner head of state government relations for the 
national rifle association calls the new federalism a lot of 
baloney 
i think that the answer is that those who believe in more 
regulation have decided that the states are the next fertile field 
the federal government cant do anything more theyve regulated so 
much theres nothing left to regulate he said 
gardiner speaks with some bitterness his group has lost some 
tough battles over the right to own semiautomatic weapons still 
the nra can claim one of the most impressive track records of any 
lobbying group it combines the tactical savvy of nine seasoned 
lobbyists with the grassroots clout of nearly 3 million members 
the nras legislative lobbyists are the paratroopers of 
politics there are seven in washington covering the eastern 
twothirds of the nation and two in sacramento calif covering 
the western third they spend their days zooming from one capital 
to the next in a neverending war against gun control 
our lobbyist for new england for example will go up to 
albany new york for an afternoon take a flight over to portland 
or augusta maine spend the next morning there and then go down to 
rhode island that afternoon and then zip over to connecticut 
and come home gardiner said 
nra lobbyists are backed up by a grassroots organizing machine 
that is the envy of lobbyists everywhere the nra spends millions 
of dollars sending mail to its members who respond with letters 
telephone calls and personal visits to legislators 
that kind of support is what other lobbyists are trying to 
cultivate 
once grassroots suggested a brand of politics that was 
unsophisticated unplanned and inexpensive a spontaneous movement 
on behalf of a candidate or cause 
now with the help of the imagemakers grassroots lobbying can 
be slick calculated and costly 
its aim is to persuade legislators that a lobbyists position 
has popular support the techniques can be as simple as a letter to 
citizens asking them to call or write their legislators they can 
be as sophisticated as television commercials that subtly shift the 
public mood 
i hate for anybody to refer to me as just a lobbyist anymore 
because i dont think theres a market for just straight 
lobbying said hill amp knowltons hoog i think you have to 
provide a base of support for your position 
gary nordlinger is a specialist in drumming up that support his 
washington office is dominated by a large wooden bookcase filled 
not with books but with audio and video tapes they represent his 
most tangible product 
one videotape is a commercial produced for the nevada state 
education association several years ago to bolster its clout at the 
legislature viewers were shown images of state prison inmates the 
point nevadans could spend money on schools now or prisons later 
its now becoming increasingly common to do in a state capital 
whats been done in congress which is not only to use your 
lobbyist but to rally public support to run advocacy media to do 
grassroots lobbying as well to get people to contact their 
legislators nordlinger said 
legislatures can be a lot more fun to work than the congress 
too you know if the congress is a fullblown railroad a 
state legislature is much more like a model train much easier to 
have a big impact

nordlingers firm is just one of several that assist lobbyists 
nationwide without actually doing any lobbying themselves they are 
an unregulated and potentially potent force that is one part of the 
future of legislative lobbying 
another glint of things to come shines in the 27th floor offices 
of trw inc in arlington va from this steel and glass aerie 
overlooking washington ernie labelle shapes trws sophisticated 
approach to state legislative lobbying 
labelle who directs state and constituent relations for the 
huge space and defense contractor talks about government as a 
partner and says business must do more than respond to 
legislation it must shape it 
trw employs a vice president for public policy analysis 
whose fulltime job essentially is to think deeply about 
important issues it doesnt matter whether they have anything to 
do with trw directly the company sees benefits in the most 
tangential things 
on a more downtoearth level trw sends lobbyists into 15 or 20 
states a year it also has designed a computerized constituent 
network that allows labelle to instantly tap into the companys 
50000plus employees in the united states and get them on the 
phone to their legislators 
its a very structured focused disciplined systems approach 
to grassroots lobbying he said

when seneca county farmer william smith gets 
up at dawn he looks out a window at his rich farm land and wonders 
about his familys future 
in recent years hes seen a soilparching drought that withered 
crops in the field and rains that left farm land a muddy mess 
delaying planting and cutting yields 
he has watched friends lose their farms and helped comfort 
their families while their possessions were sold at auction 
through such uncertainty smith and his family find strength 
through jesus and the way of the cross for those in rural life 
a 32page religious pamphlet written by farmers and others involved 
in agriculture 
we make mistakes and we fall jesus fell three times on his 
way to the cross and every time he fell he got back up thats the 
way we look at trouble weve having on the farm you have to pick 
yourself back up when you fall the 39yearold father of two 
said in an interview 
this is the second year the pamphlet has been published by the 
roman catholic diocese of toledos rural life ministries an 
organization that helps farmers and migrant farm workers 
sister christine pratt ministries director said the booklet 
is popular with people engaged in agriculture it is used in many 
rural parishes for devotional services 
it is a spiritual walk with jesus along the traditional 
stations of jesus trial sufferings death and resurrection but 
includes meditations written by growers dairy people and others 
who are sensitive to the dependence on the growing cycles of 
nature sister pratt said 
the idea of publishing the pamphlet came to her in the summer of 
1988 when a drought threatened the livelihoods of many farmers 
farm couples or individuals involved in food issues and migrant 
farm workers were asked to write their feelings based on scripture 
involving jesus walk to his crucifixion 
the booklet is popular with farmers because the passages are 
written by people who understand the pain they go through she said 
they are written by our brothers our sisters our neighbors 
our friends people who have been able to help us see how we can 
take the passion of jesus and identify with it in a way that is 
close to our own experience she said 
i have given them to individual farmers whether they be 
catholic or protestant many of them are in the middle of 
foreclosures and i give it to them to pray over so they know that 
someone else is sharing what theyre going through she said 
smith and his wife jane 37 wrote a passage for the booklet 
based on when jesus starts on his way to calvary 
jesus silently accepted the rough wooden cross though he had 
committed no wrong consider the farmer and the farm family who 
depend on variables out of their control the weather 
international trade and government policies have all affected the 
farmer the smiths wrote 
as a result many farmers or their spouses have been forced to 
find work off the farm to supplement their income in dealing with 
this stress some farmers withdraw from family and friends and face 
the loneliness that jesus must have felt when betrayed by peter 
mrs smith 37 recalls when she and her husband wrote the 
passage 
it was during the drought when farmers were having so much 
trouble through a variety of things i saw several friends 
experience anguish i sat down and prayed about it and this is 
what i thought of and decided to contribute she said 
whenever the smiths feel depressed about problems on their 
800acre dairy farm they take solace in the pamphlet 
its beautiful because of the contributions from so many 
people it helps us pray to the lord we can all associate with the 
sufferings of christ she said 
farmers in the past decade contended with foreclosures land 
depreciation inflation low commodity prices bad weather and 
shrinking markets 
agricultural experts say conditions should improve in the 1990s 
but more for commercial farmers than the small part time or family 
farmer 
its rough for many farmers smith said some dont think 
things will get much better but you always have to have hope when 
you fall you have to get up

arguments about water are complicating 
relations with arab neighbors that turkey spent a quartercentury 
building 
a conflict over the waters of the euphrates river has soured 
relations with syria and iraq reports that turkey planned to sell 
water to israel have angered the arab world generally 
libya refuses to pay 250 million it owes turkish construction 
companies citing increased friendliness between turkey and israel 
a diplomatic source said privately 
economists and scientists say rapidly growing populations in the 
middle east could cause a disastrous water shortage 
turkey has plenty of water much of it running unharnessed into 
the surrounding seas 
it averted one dispute over the precious resource by backing off 
a proposed project with medusa inc of canada for moving water from 
the manavgat river in southern turkey to other countries 
government and company official said 
medusa has developed a technology for transporting water in 
huge balloonlike plastic containers pulled by ships 
italy showed interest in using the method to transport water to 
the islands of sicily and sardinia and israel also was looking 
into it the officials said 
turkish officials described the project requiring an investment 
of about 200 million as a private venture with no political 
dimension they said private firms would buy and ship the water for 
other countries 
arab nations apparently did not accept that explanation which 
ignored the fact that the turkish government would be selling the 
water and turkey did not go through with the deal medusa worried 
about possible terrorist action also was said to be having second 
thoughts 
foreign minister ali bozer said in a recent statement that 
there is no project to sell water to israel 
he also said turkey had not received a positive reply to a 
proposal to provide friendly arab countries with water 
his reference was to the peace pipeline proposal put forth 
several years ago by turgut ozal then premier 
under it a 1500mile pipeline would carry water from the 
seyhan and ceyhan rivers in the south to the arabian peninsula the 
project would require an investment of 21 billion 
shelving the water transport project may have averted a 
political crisis but no simple solution is possible in a dispute 
over euphrates water 
turkey blocked most of the rivers flow in january to raise the 
water level in the reservoir of the ataturk dam being built as the 
centerpiece of a huge irrigation and power project in southeastern 
turkey 
syria and iraq protested the action which demonstrated turkeys 
stranglehold on the vital waters 
the euphrates originates in the mountains of eastern turkey and 
flows 1460 miles through syria and iraq to a confluence with the 
tigris river that empties into the persian gulf the two rivers 
have been the lifelines of one of the cradles of world civilization 
water disputes have threatened to undo a generation of turkish 
efforts to improve relations with the arabs turkey has supported 
arab causes in international forums joined the islamic conference 
organization and demoted relations with israel from the 
ambassadorial to ministercounselor level 
syria and iraq now demand talks with turkey on an agreement to 
specify the exact amount of water each will receive from the 
euphrates turkey has suggested a ministerial meeting in ankara 
but turkish officials say privately they have no intention of 
accepting a quota system 
there are no international rules to force turkey into a sharing 
agreement government officials say and they describe the demands 
of the two southern neighbors as excessive 
at a meeting last year iraq demanded 25 billion cubic meters of 
water and and syria 14 billion from the average annual flow of 32 
billion cubic meters the turkish officials said 
instead turkey has offered free electricity to syria and joint 
irrigation projects to both countries

panamas justice system once 
considered the lapdog of a corrupt military now is accused of 
being a glacially slow institution whose prosecutors take bribes to 
bury cases 
of more than 5000 cases received by the attorney generals 
office in the first four months of 1990 after the us invasion 
that ousted gen manuel antonio noriega none had gone to court by 
early june 
edgardo molino mola a supreme court justice told reporters 
more than 13000 cases were pending in one judicial district where 
the number of judges was fixed by law at 53 
opinions on how to change the situation range from revising the 
law on judicial procedures to requiring that all judges have some 
legal training 
deputy prosecutor rosa de contreras told the associated press 
the problem is not with the prosecutors but with the law that 
establishes court terms we must follow the law has not been 
changed 
juan materno vasquez former chief justice of the supreme court 
said the law is fine but complained of inexperience and a lack 
of technical preparation of appointed judges some of whom have 
never even been lawyers 
molino mola said more judges and courtrooms were needed 
in san milguelito a workingclass suburb of panama city he 
said there are 1200 cases pending before just one judge as for 
justice people are disgusted with notorious criminals going free 
on bond 
they worry about the slow pace of the judicial process the 
lack of prosecution of embezzlers and torturers and that because 
of bungled prosecutions the courts have had to free some people 
he said in a statement 
his remarks were published by the civic crusade an organization 
of business and professional people that led the panamanian 
opposition to noriega 
some officials of the noriega regime face specific charges of 
torture but the public prosecutors office has not said how many 
they include felipe camargo accused of torturing crusade members 
military officers involved in unsuccessful coups against noriega 
have said they and other conspirators also were tortured 
the civic crusade declared it is the responsibility of the 
attorney general and the prosecutors that the cases they bring 
be careful and complete and meet legal requirements to avoid having 
them dismissed for lack of evidence or for defects 
molina mola claimed the government of guillermo endara which 
took over after the invasion was allowing cronies of noriega to go 
free pending trial the general is in the united states facing 
charges of drug trafficking 
ricardo bermudez a crusade official said the justice system 
is the first national emergency the government should attend to we 
are aimlessly turning criminals free something that unnerves and 
angers people 
if this continues the democratic longings panamanians fought 
so long for could be in danger because the will of the people will 
not be met 
former chief justice vasquez who supported noriegas democratic 
revolutionary party said in an interview in criminal justice 
processes are slow justice has been interrupted judicial terms 
were interrupted from dec 21 1989 when the invasion began until 
jan 29 1990 
the attitude of the prosecutors hasnt changed they were on 
the take from the military and they are on the take from the people 
in office now he said referring to former supporters of noriega 
who still are in the government and hope to avoid being charged 
eusebio marchosky in charge of recovering state property stolen 
by noriega and his followers has claimed publicly his 
investigations were being undermined by officials still still loyal 
to the ousted genral 
there is interference in the investigations attacks on 
depositories of goods considered to be illgotten and there are 
political and economic links to the deposed gen manuel noriega 
he said 
marchosky added that investigations were hampered by lack of 
evidence and the americans still have 15000 boxes of judicial 
documents 
return of the documents is one of several matters being 
discussed by the united states and panama 
the united states seized tons of documents during the invasion 
hoping they would help track noriegas alleged involvement in 
narcotics trafficking 
what seems to worry panamanians most as revealed by letters to 
editors and comments on callin radio shows is balancing justice 
with the need to reunite the country 
in suggesting solutions vasquez mentioned expelling offenders 
for a time because a politician in exile is harmless a 
practice followed in brazil the total amnesty nicaragua used to 
bring contra rebels back into society or the colombian method of 
collaboration among political groups 
his own solution vasquez said would be to separate the 
handling of serious and lesser crimes ease tensions and bring 
about a climate of calm

in the united states war and 
remembrance lasted 39 hours and was considered one of the 
longest miniseries ever but how about one lasting more than 18 
months 
there is such a maxiseries its called the mahabharata and 
its still running on indian television it wont end until july 8 
based on a mythological hindu epic that is the longest poem in 
world literature the mahabharata is the countrys hottest 
show even though it airs at an hour that would amaze us networks 
each onehour episode of the indian drama starts at 9 am on 
sundays 
despite that early hour doordarshan the government department 
that controls indias only nationwide tv channel estimates the 
show attracts an average audience of 90 million people each week 
or more than onetenth of indias population of 880 million 
the serial is in the hindi language but doordarshan officials 
say its appeal reaches far beyond the northern hindispeaking 
regions of the country 
in the southern state of kerala for example newspapers publish 
a transcript of each weeks show in malayalam the local language 
people here are highly involved in the mahabharata says 
ig venugopal a resident of trivandrum the capital of kerala 
they read the newspaper to get to know the outline and then watch 
the serial 
the mahabharata also appears to have transcended religious 
barriers in india where 82 percent of the people are hindu but 
there are large communities of moslems sikhs and christians 
in one new delhi house two moslem carpenters installing new 
windows threatened to take sunday off unless they were given access 
to the television set 
i watch the serial every week if i miss an episode now i 
wont understand anything said one of them naseem ahmed 
his remarks would be familiar to american viewers of abcs 
surreal convoluted twin peaks 
that series is set in a small logging town in the pacific 
northwest 
the mahabharata has a somewhat wider scope its a 
kaleidoscope of court intrigue and fierce battles between two sets 
of feuding brothers tempered with religion philosophy and the 
virtues and vices of princes and aspiring kings 
many hindus learn the story in their childhood when it is 
retold as the victory of good over evil with the five good pandava 
brothers defeating the 100 bad kaurava brothers 
but now as the show begins to peak the 99th kaurava brother 
recently was killed in battle several twists and nuances are 
beginning to come through the pandavas arent pure they have used 
every trick in the book to win 
and some on the kaurava side arent totally bad their army 
chief the illegitimate son of the mother of the pandavas is 
chivalrous in battle and the guru of the pandavas another good 
guy was on the kaurava side until he died 
most of this we didnt know says shailendra chopra an 
employee of indian airlines and another avid viewer its like a 
crime thriller what will happen next 
it will take a long time for us to get another serial like 
this said abdul sattar tatari the doordarshan official in 
charge of television programs both in terms of audience appeal 
and revenue 
doordarshan plans to bring out a serial on indian war heroes in 
the mahabharata slot after the current epic ends next month 
tatari said 
it definitely wont be as popular he said people seem to 
prefer going back to mythological serials and we are also trying 
to get one of those for telecast within a few months 
i have to feed my kids in front of the television set on 
sundays grumbled gurmeet kaur a new delhi housewife when told 
of the program that will replace the mahabharata next month 
she said she doubted things would improve at home 
war heroes she said i guess its back to eating 
breakfast at the dining table

looking for omens in californias vote to 
increase the state gasoline tax politicians in both parties are 
reading the signals that suit them they arent checking the fine 
print though 
the administration sees the referendum vote for higher gasoline 
taxes as proof that president bushs national transportation policy 
took the right route in recommending that state and local 
governments pay a bigger share of the cost of rebuilding roads 
bridges and other facilities 
democrats who had criticized that approach said californians 
showed that people are willing to accept higher taxes so long as 
they know in advance that the money will be spent on real needs 
and wont be wasted 
that argument could be tailored to fit demands that the 
president renounce his campaign vow to block any new taxes and 
tell the voters that it has to be done to deal with the budget 
deficit 
an increase in the federal gasoline tax is among the options 
that budget negotiators are likely to consider rep dan 
rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and means 
committee proposed boosting it sharply to help balance the budget 
and at the same time reduce us dependence on imported oil 
but deficit reduction is a general goal not a specific one like 
the highways and bridges that are to be rebuilt with the proceeds 
of the california gas tax boost 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner said that if the 
federal gas tax were to be increased from the current 9 cents a 
gallon a step he carefully avoided endorsing the money should 
be earmarked for the transportation infrastructure and nothing else 
skinner said the june 5 vote in california shows that state and 
local governments are willing to take on a greater share of 
transportation costs and that the voters will back them so long 
as new tax revenues are used for that specific purpose 
he said people distrust the way governments spend money but are 
less reluctant to accept tax increases when they know exactly how 
the revenues will be used 
i think it validates one of the principles that has been 
somewhat contentious skinner said 
its time to act bush had said in presenting the 
transportation plan earlier this year and promising the states 
more flexibility in the use of less federal aid at the time 
critics in both parties said it set national goals and assumed the 
states would pay the bill read my lips raise your taxes said 
gov james r thompson jr of illinois a republican 
skinner said the states should be increasing their 
transportation taxes that 18 have done so in the past year and 33 
in the past two years 
until the voters agreed to raise the california gas tax from 9 
cents to 18 cents a gallon over the next five years the rate there 
had been held at bargain level the california tax had been 
increased only 2 cents a gallon since 1963 
while there is a tendency to look at the california vote as 
another bellwether from the state that began the tax revolt a dozen 
years ago this time the message may be that there is none 
the political circumstances are not going to be matched 
elsewhere 
after an intensive campaign for the measure the voters agreed 
by a relatively narrow margin to ease a state spending ceiling 
dating from the tax revolt and to begin phasing in the gasoline 
tax boost 
according to the national journal california ranks last among 
the states in per capita spending on transportation its gasoline 
tax was the fourth lowest in the country the national average is 
163 cents a gallon even with the increase the tax wont pass the 
current national average for three years 
republican gov george deukmejian and state democratic leaders 
joined in support of the measure so did interest groups business 
to labor unlikely allies unanimous this time about 6 million 
was spent to support the measure in a campaign with no major 
organized opposition 
the freeway casualties of the october 1989 earthquake and 
chronic gridlock on urban highways served to dramatize the problem 
the revenues are tightly earmarked 155 billion to build and 
improve freeways over the next decade 
for all that the referendum was approved with only 52 percent 
of the vote in a lowturnout primary election 
the only significance i see is that californians were smarter 
than i thought they were said sen warren b rudman rnh he 
said there was no national message in a state decision that higher 
gas taxes were preferable to hourslong traffic jams

americas colleges increasingly concerned about 
gang and acquaintance rape are starting to teach students a more 
elemental lesson than english lit and geology 101 that it takes 
two to say yes to sex 
at campuses around the country schools are sponsoring hotlines 
courses and workshops to counter the widespread conviction that 
when it comes to sex its every man for himself 
many campus males feel you should always be ready to have sex 
even if you dont want to says toby simon assistant dean of 
student life at brown university dont ask a woman how far you 
can go just start making moves 
four years ago simon surveyed students to learn if theyd ever 
had sex against another persons will ten percent of the men at 
a school where students have a tendency to be politically 
correct admitted they had 
that to me was a real trigger that we had to do something 
said simon who also is director of health education 
at the time few schools admitted a problem existed but simons 
efforts put brown in the forefront of sex crime education 
now slowly other schools are following that lead and as 
awareness grows it appears more victims are coming forward and 
are being taken seriously 
bernice sandler director of the association of american 
colleges project on the status of women has documented about 100 
campus gang rapes nationwide over the past five years 
for every one thats publicized there must be easily more 
than a hundred that are not publicized said sandler ive 
asked students does this happen on your campus and im told 
just about every week 
rape by solitary acquaintances also is common studies show 15 
percent to 25 percent of all women undergraduates have been 
physically or psychologically intimidated into having sex against 
their will sandler said 
i dont know if many more instances are occurring now than 20 
years ago its just that the females are more willing and capable 
of speaking out and bringing charges which i think is good 
said durward owen executive director of the pi kappa phi 
fraternity headquartered in charlotte nc 
pi kappa phi which has 6500 members at 142 colleges and 
universities voted six years ago to take a stand against sexual 
abuse owen said a growing number of fraternities have begun 
discussing the problem in the past two years 
we noticed so many instances of athletic team rapes and dorm 
rapes and date rapes being reported he said it appeared that 
many times these things had gone on in the past and were accepted 
at face value 
pi kappa phi mails literature to its chapters and examines the 
issue at regional meetings its chapters often offer seminars with 
other campus groups 
colleges are taking many other tacks 
at brown victims can count on a campuswide help network 
including 24houraday telephone counseling 
simon works to prevent both assaults and sexual misadventures 
bad results that occur because people do not know how to talk about 
sex because they do not make their needs known and because they 
drink too much 
simon repeats the message at freshmen orientation and in a 
sexuality course she addresses student groups including 
fraternities in extremely candid graphic ways using students 
to do role playing using students language 
in 1984 two women at swarthmore college in pennsylvania told a 
dormitory assistant that they had been abused by acquaintances in 
response students produced a consciousnessraising video to be 
shown to freshmen in dorms discussions follow 
since the tape was produced swarthmore has sold about 100 
copies to other schools and organizations 
awareness was heightened at the university of 
californiaberkeley in 1986 after a student said she was raped by 
four ootball players in a dormitory 
no charges were filed and the football players were not 
suspended but they were forced to move out of the dorm do 100 
hours of community service and write apologies to the woman said 
university spokeswoman pat mcbroom 
amid the resulting uproar a facultystudent task force 
investigated womens safety and the campus climate in january 
1987 chancellor ira michael heyman sent a letter to some 30000 
students condemning sexual abuse and noting that no means no 
now rape prevention workshops are held for various campus groups 
there are indications that other schools will be following in 
the footsteps of brown swarthmore and berkeley the association of 
american colleges has issued about 100 recommendations to its 
members on how to prevent rape respond to victims and discipline 
rapists 
in 1987 californias legislature voted to suggest that the 
states colleges and universities adopt codes prohibiting rape and 
setting penalties including suspension or expulsion on conviction 
the resolution also suggests rape prevention seminars for freshmen 
fraternities and sororities 
building on the resolution california assemblywoman lucille 
roybalallard has introduced a bill requiring essentially all 
colleges and universities to follow specific procedures in the 
event of sexual abuse including calling the police when the victim 
allows it 
in new york a report of the governors task force on rape and 
sexual assault has recommended the state university of new york and 
city university of new york develop strong prevention programs 
campusbased surveys have indicated that many students lack an 
understanding of or deny what constitutes a rape said the 
report 
ignorance is only one aspect of the problem mob psychology 
peer pressure and alcohol abuse also contribute 
sandler of the association of american colleges said most gang 
rapists are fraternity brothers or team athletes 
very often these men are simply raping for each other she 
said theyll do something they might not do if they were by 
themselves 
women who report campus attacks often are harassed by the 
rapists and their friends sandler said many drop out or switch 
schools after their attackers start using sexual slurs or other 
intimidation tactics 
shawn johnston a forensic psychologist at the university of 
californiadavis who treats sex offenders said there are times 
such as when alcohol is involved when the line that 
differentiates the consensual or voluntary from a forcible act is 
fairly thin that say womens advocates contributes to a 
blame the victim attitude even by the victim herself 
i dont care if a woman walks into the room raving drunk and 
stark naked its not an excuse to be raped said claire kaplan 
executive director of the washingtonbased national coalition 
against sexual assault 
browns simon agrees but still urges caution she says booze 
can lead men to push themselves on women misread the cues 
theyre getting from a potential partner then an inebriated 
woman might not be able to fight off an attacker 
this attitude exists with men give them enough to drink and 
theyll be easy she said ive had men tell me if she 
passes out then we have sex is that rape i say to these men 
what kind of a lover are you sex is something that happens with 
two alert conscious people 
owen of pi kappa phi said it took about 30 years to reach the 
obsession with alcohol that often triggers campus rapes 
we cant do all that much to make it turn around in hurry 
he said but i think an amazing turnaround is starting to occur

after the stock market bonanza of the 1980s 
many savers and investors seem bound and determined not to miss out 
on the promise of the 1990s 
in particular they have been pouring money into stock mutual 
funds both on their own and through retirement programs such as 
companysponsored 401k savings plans 
their inspiration comes from many sources the apparent end of 
the cold war and the perceived triumph of capitalism over communism 
in many parts of the world opportunities in fields like health 
care technology and the environment and not so coincidentally 
the recent rise of the us stock market itself to record highs 
much of this optimism may prove justified says a financial 
advisory firm long known as a staunch advocate of investing in 
stocks 
but it also cautions that anyone hoping for a replay of the 80s 
in the next decade is bucking some long statistical odds 
we are not doom and gloomers says norman fosback at the 
institute for econometric research publisher of a series of 
newsletters on investing but the percentage returns from stocks in 
the 90s he declares will almost certainly fall far short of 
those earned in the 1980s 
while there are no absolute limits on the gains stocks can 
achieve fosback observes there are a few constants that can 
be used in assessing their possibilities and probabilities 
for starters he notes the 500 stocks that make up standard amp 
poors composite index produced a total return appreciation plus 
dividends in the 1980s at an average compound annual rate of 
about 18 percent 
that ranks far above the historical trend rate after all the 
booms and busts are figured together of about 10 percent 
stocks and the economy furthermore began the 1980s at a very 
low point which fosback says effectively magnified the 
opportunities for gains 
in financial matters he says when there is a lot of room for 
improvement and little room for further discouragement the path 
of least resistance is to the upside 
when wall streets bull market began in 1982 the stock of a 
typical company sold at a price about seven times its annual 
earnings today priceearnings ratios are more than double that in 
the neighborhood of 15 to 1 or 16 to 1 
for another doubling of pes to occur in the 90s fosback 
notes they would have to soar to their highest levels in history 
similarly he argues there is less room for growth in business 
activity and corporate earnings with an unemployment rate around 5 
percent starting the 1990s than there was in the early 1980s when 
unemployment stood near 11 percent 
it is likely that unemployment is already close to its lowest 
possible level right now he says 
this means that real national growth will probably increase 3 
percent or less per annum in the 1990s not the 4 percentplus 
rates of the last eight years 
irrespective of political social and economic forces 
investors will probably earn a much lower return in the 1990s than 
the 18 percent perannum total return recorded in the 1980s 
fosback concludes 
does all this mean that the dow cant reach 3000 3600 or 
5000 of course not at some point during the decade the market 
will probably again sell at 20 times earnings 
what our analysis does indicate is that longterm buy and hold 
investors will not find the stock market to be the sure thing that 
it was in the 1980s

from time to time the economy goes through a 
phase in which longterm goals are abandoned fundamentals are 
forgotten and only the next hour day or week seems to count 
the economy becomes volatile stock prices gyrate inflation 
erupts quick killings are sought and often achieved in real estate 
and securities getrichquick schemes abound and corporations 
wheel and deal 
and then it all evaporates although not until warning signs and 
omens bankruptcies scandals prosecutions become too numerous 
to ignore the old ways come back basics are rediscovered the 
vision is again long term 
like now 
these phases of the cycle are never so sharply defined that they 
produce headlines there are always frayed edges and exceptions to 
the generality but still the pattern can be discerned 
on wall street for example where analysts now talk about a 
companys pricetoearnings ratio rather than the possibility that 
it might be taken over by a larger company with a sudden and 
spectacular rise in price 
in the housing markets where prices are more sensible than they 
were a year ago and where the buyer now buys a house as a place in 
which to live rather than a place in which to invest money for a 
big return 
in corporations where managers are fed up with the destructive 
practice of draining everhigher shortterm profits by refusing to 
waste money on research and capital improvements that make for 
a stronger future 
and where boards of directors are withdrawing those management 
incentives tied to shortterm profits and demanding instead that 
companies be made more competitive in the global marketplace 
at the federal reserve where economic manipulation is in 
disfavor and the goal now is to achieve modest longterm economic 
stability even if it means walking a tightrope over the chasm of 
recession before that goal is achieved 
in organized labor where workers join management to raise 
corporate productivity even if it means forgoing big wage 
increases the notion being that a stronger company conveys greater 
longterm benefits 
in consumer markets where people have begun curtailing their 
propensity to borrow as if there were no tomorrow and are tending 
to save a bit more forgoing purchases that once were almost 
automatic 
these patterns can be discerned over varying lengths of time 
and sometimes patterns of calm and then excitement occur within 
larger patterns but in the marketplace the past two decades 
certainly qualify as a period of volatility 
the stock market erupted time after time then collapsed in cold 
ashes rumors pervaded the market and every day stocks with a 
story were promoted takeovers buyouts new products or demoted 
when they fell into debt 
fundamental analysis often was ignored in the new marketplace 
there was no time for such things why settle for 7 percent annual 
dividends when you might make that in a day on price appreciation 
volatility and change invite creativity new ways of doing 
things short cuts junk bonds trading shenanigans computer 
manipulations taxavoidance schemes a new immorality arises 
until the culprits are caught 
enough of these culprits have been caught in the past couple of 
years to suggest that the easy way the shortcut route doesnt 
pay either on wall street or in corporate management or among 
consumers 
indicative of this is an announcement from a large benefits 
consulting firm after it polled corporations on the types of 
incentives they were offering it offered this report 
longterm incentive plans may be the way of the future 
according to a recent survey 
findings revealed 28 percent of participating companies 
offered longterm incentive plans to executives in 1985 while 40 
percent plan to offer such programs by 1995 
just as it used to be back before all the shortterm business 
began

its fitting the little statue labeled st 
expedite should end up at our lady of guadeloupe the old roman 
catholic church on the edge of the french quarter with its shrine 
to st jude has long been a haven to the homeless the helpless and 
many of lifes misfits 
on a bright spring morning a young man kneels in prayer at the 
altar an elderly woman lights a candle at the statue of st jude 
and an old man in ragged clothes sits in a patch of sunlight by the 
door his shopping bags around his feet 
people come here from all over the city but we have a lot of 
people who come from the french quarter and here on rampart street 
and from the iberville housing project directly behind us said 
the rev william zapalac who has been at the church eight years 
we see a lot of life in this location things are always 
hopping 
called the mortuary chapel for many years the church was built 
in 1826 to handle the funerals of victims of the an outbreak of 
yellow fever 
in those days they thought it was spread by the dead so they 
didnt want to have them in the quarter said millie brown an 
80yearold parishoner theyd bring them here and then zip them 
right across the street to the cemetery they say there would be 
hundreds of wagons with coffins lined up on them outside the 
church 
st expedite showed up about the turn of the century legend 
has it the statue arrived at the docks without paperwork or address 
the only thing they saw was the word expedite on the side of 
the crate said tom finney spokesman for the new orleans 
diocese in those days there were a lot of firstgeneration 
italians and irish on the new orleans docks and they didnt read 
english very well they thought expedite was the name of a saint 
so they delivered the statute to the church 
today it stands by the door a cross in one hand and a sheaf of 
wheat in the other the name on the statue is in quotes st 
expedite 
there really is a st expedite i dont know if this is him or 
not but he fits in here anyway said zapalac 
four times a year the little church is host for a nineday st 
jude novena that draws 3000 to 4000 people a day st jude the 
patron saint of lost causes spends the rest of the year dealing 
with a variety of people and pleas from the local community there 
is no lack of work zapalac said 
being right here by the french quarter we get a lot of the 
more unusual people from there in new orleans i find people are 
much more tolerant of unusual people some places people would be 
afraid of many of the people we really enjoy here the priest 
said 
rampart street with its seedy hotels and cheap bars has become 
a mecca for the homeless zapalac said 
were seeing more and more homeless people all the time some 
of them we get to know very well he said 
some of them like a mother and daughter who lived on the 
streets are puzzles without solutions he said 
the church found housing several times for the mother who was 
in her 50s and her daughter in her 30s but they always returned 
to the streets zapalac said 
i dont know what happened to them they finally disappeared 
i think they were afraid of being trapped somehow if they stayed in 
the housing we found for them he said 
iberville a vast collection of decaying brick buildings is 
home for many of the citys poor including many of the churchs 
parishioners 
but on saturday nights its not problems that are the focus of 
the early mass its the city and its music that come to the 
forefront in the churchs jazz mass the jazz mass is the only one 
in the world zapalac believes 
theres always piano and organ and drums and trumpet and 
sometimes other instruments depending on whos here he said 
its really something when we get going

john sununu wields his clout in washington 
these days but his influence still is felt in the state he governed 
for six years before being tapped as george bushs chief of staff 
new hampshires immediate past governor is seen as a smooth 
operator who does favors for his adopted home state but leaves few 
political fingerprints 
some state republicans express concern that sununu is meddling 
in local politics but most consider his presence in the white 
house to be an asset for the state 
sununu makes certain new hampshires place on the political 
map is not forgotten said gop strategist tom rath 
it was not an accident that the first place outside of 
washington that the president visited was new hampshire rath 
said referring to a bush stopover in manchester not long after he 
became president 
as new hampshires governor sununu sided early with bush in the 
1988 presidential race he helped engineer a bush victory in the 
states earliestinthenation primary and continued the national 
campaign with attacks against democratic nominee michael dukakis 
governor of neighboring massachusetts 
sununus political work continues even now he had a guiding 
role in easing the white houses handsoff policy toward party 
primaries putting the oval office behind candidates such as rep 
bob smith rnh who hopes to replace retiring gop sen gordon 
humphrey 
state gop chairwoman rhona charbonneau wishes sununu had stayed 
out of the primary race between smith and rye lawyer tom christo 
its good to have a friend in the white house rather than a 
foe she said but i truly wish they had kept out of the 
primary i dont believe anybody not even the white house should 
be involved 
sununu whose influence also can be seen in some state races 
brushes off the criticism 
were not trying to pick candidates he says were trying 
to help the process 
his wife nancy hasnt kept silent either she said she 
considered challenging us rep chuck douglas for the gop 
nomination in new hampshires 2nd congressional district because 
she never appreciated his values and his morals 
sununu and his successor in the governors mansion republican 
judd gregg have what insiders consider a civil relationship at 
best at a recent new hampshire business dinner sununu sat next to 
senate president william bartlett who was considering challenging 
gregg 
sununu 50 is described as bushs righthand man part of a 
white house troika with secretary of state james baker and budget 
director richard darman 
many doubted the abrasive sununu would last long in the white 
house job after an admittedly rocky start but now even his critics 
have had to admit he appears to be effective and may wield more 
power than any other recent chief of staff 
most republican politicians believe it is to new hampshires 
advantage to have sununu in the white house 
we may not get everything from the white house but people at 
the white house have the ear of new hampshire said bill zeliff 
a sununu ally who is seeking the gop nomination for smiths 
congressional seat 
sununu is seen as helping to place new hampshire operatives in 
federal positions promoting the seabrook nuclear power plant and 
ensuring that important promises are fulfilled 
when the navy threatened 1000 jobs by canceling a 128 million 
submarine overhaul at the portsmouth naval shipyard maine and new 
hampshire governors and congressional delegations won a pledge by 
the navy to find replacement work 
humphrey credits sununu with making the navy deliver 
when those promises started to filter down the navy 
bureaucracy was sidestepping it so i called sununu and he got them 
to do what they said they would do humphrey recalls 
humphrey said sununu is clearing similar hurdles for a proposal 
the senator is championing to make a wildlife refuge out of some of 
the land to be abandoned when pease air force base closes 
a string of people with new hampshire connections have been 
appointed to federal posts since sununu moved to washington most 
recently wally stickney a sununu friend and associate was 
selected to head the federal emergency management agency 
a highly placed republican who agreed to discuss sununu only if 
not quoted by name said sununu is adept at maintaining a low 
profile in the state 
he hasnt left any fingerprints or left anyone with a story 
that they can tell that sununu sidled up to me and so on 
seabrook the republican said falls into that category sununu 
champion of the nuclear power plant when he was governor didnt 
just go to the nuclear regulatory commission and say give them 
the license the source said 
hes been very cautious but seabrook got the license didnt 
it he made sure his feelings on the topic were well known in the 
appropriate places 
sununu plays down his role in the licensing of seabrook 
i was a patient man he said recently i knew the right 
thing would happen

attacks by sunni moslem zealots on banks 
breweries and night clubs underline the growing influence of 
islamic fundamentalists in one of the most secular arab states 
in may an islamic court convicted journalist ibrahim abu naab 
59 of apostasy or abandoning islam and ruled that he be divorced 
from his wife and separated from his children 
abdullah shamayleh prosecutorgeneral of the islamic court 
urged it during abu naabs trial to permit the shedding of his 
blood 
that would not appear necessary since anyone who kills an 
apostate is immune from prosecution under islamic law 
jordans civil law does not grant immunity however and the 
civil appeals court probably will overrule the islamic tribunals 
verdict 
the crime abu naab committed was attending a meeting in 
britain of the breakaway qadiani sect which is outlawed in many 
moslem states and allegedly converting from the mainstream sunni 
sect 
his case reflects the increasing strength of fundamentalists 
who became the largest legislative bloc after the november 
parliamentary elections jordans first in 22 years the moslem 
brotherhood won 22 of the 80 seats and islamic independents got 12 
they have pledged to work for strict application of sharia the 
islamic religious law but have said they will work within the 
constitution and not challenge king hussein 
arab leaders worry about increasing fundamentalism among the 
worlds 1 billion moslems recent moves toward greater democracy in 
some arab states are largely an outgrowth of that concern 
khalil abdulrahman khalifa a 28yearold engineer said the 
islamic tide is growing these days because the people have lost 
trust in their governments which have not moved so far to solve 
the central arab issue the palestinian problem 
we want liberation and we want to have an effective role in 
the world we want the arabs to be respected not ignored the 
islamic parties attract us because they match our outlook 
jordans fundamentalists are not having it all their own way a 
government ban on male hairdressers working in womens beauty 
salons imposed in may because of islamic pressure was canceled in 
two weeks after strong public protest 
the fundamentalists sought to enforce a koranic law that a woman 
cannot be touched by a man who is not her husband or a relative 
even though the fundamentalists ultimately lost many jordanians 
are disturbed about the government of prime minister mudar badran 
bowing to the pressure in the first place 
when the prohibition was imposed the englishlanguage jordan 
times declared it is clear that such a ban will lead to other 
decisions that will limit the freedom of the individual 
it said the sole purpose was to cater to the whims of some 
religious or conservative groups which do not represent the 
majority of the population 
during street protests in may after an israeli civilian killed 
palestinian workers in israel fundamentalists attacked businesses 
considered unislamic 
mobs raided banks the dutchowned amstel brewery and night 
clubs that serve liquor causing damage worth millions of dollars 
charging interest and drinking alcohol are forbidden by the koran 
the moslem holy book 
several amman night clubs were attacked in february and march 
state television has been affected scenes of actors kissing or 
even holding hands are deleted because the fundamentalists 
consider them lewd 
newspaper or poster advertisements showing scantily clad women 
have disappeared 
attendance at prayers on friday the moslem sabbath has grown 
considerably 
the area covered by prayer rugs on the sidewalks around ammans 
husseini mosque in the teeming bazaar district has been extended to 
accomodate more people 
fundamentalist strength is on the rise in the israelioccupied 
territories across the jordan river challenging the palestine 
liberation organization a movement called hamas or zeal has 
played a major role in the 30monthold palestinian uprising and 
made major gains in municipal elections in israels arab towns 
in egypt moslem militants have attacked christian churches and 
in clashes with police this year 34 people have been killed and 
more than 70 wounded fundamentalism is spreading in tunisia 
in turkey moslem but secular fundamentalist violence is 
increasing and several outspoken champions of secularism have been 
assassinated 
earlier this year the turkish government was forced to lift a 
rule against women university students wearing islamicstyle 
headscarves on campus

a secret security agency created by the 
military regime still operates five years after the generals 
relinquished power to civilians despite the new presidents pledge 
to abolish it 
the national intelligence service a sort of combined fbi and 
cia was synonymous with spying torture censorship and midnight 
knocks on the door under the military governments of 19641985 
its decline accelerated when agents were linked to terrorist 
bombings carried out in an attempt to forestall a return to 
democracy 
when president fernando collor de mello took office mar 15 he 
promised to dismantle the hated agency known as the sni and burn 
its secret files 
the security of the state cannot become the insecurity of the 
citizen said collor who won brazils first direct election for 
president since 1960 
he gave the agency a new name the secretariat of strategic 
affairs and a new civilian director but critics say it still 
collects information about citizens despite laws prohibiting it 
from doing so 
in place of the sni the government created the embryo of a 
political police said walder de goes a political science 
professor at the university of brasilia and an expert on the agency 
the ideological archives were joined with financial 
information about individuals and their police records anywhere in 
the world thats the beginning of a political police 
luis eduardo greenhalgh a lawyer who represented political 
prisoners during military rule said the sni was not 
extinguished just modified some of its agents were returned to 
their military units but most are still spying 
if the government needs dirt on somebody the agency gets it 
everything continues the same 
in 1965 the sni was created as a superintelligence service to 
safeguard national security it spied on citizens tapped 
telephones and tailed alleged leftist opponents of the regime 
as repression increased in the 1960s and early 1970s the agency 
ran covert operations and collected damaging information about 
enemies of the ruling generals 
thousands of brazilians lost their jobs were imprisoned or had 
to flee the country because their names apeareed on the sni list 
the impunity enjoyed by sni agents created disciplinary problems 
within the armed forces and gen golbery do couto e silva who 
formed the agency and was its first director said at one point 
i created a monster 
brazil returned to civilian rule in 1985 but president jose 
sarney chosen by an electoral college under military control did 
not try to curb the armed forces behindthescenes influence 
collor promised a change 
during the 1989 campaign the 40yearold presidential candidate 
referred to the agencys director as a tinpot general the job 
job was a cabinetlevel post 
once in office collor decreed the sni abolished clandestine 
operations would cease he said sni agents would return to the 
regular military and secret archives would be opened to the public 
and destroyed 
to replace the service as insiders called it collor 
created the secretariat of strategic affairs and turned it over to 
pedro paulo leoni ramos a 30yearold businessman and longtime 
friend 
its job was exclusively to provide the president with 
information for political and government policy according to the 
official orders 
the old agency did not die however its files were not 
destroyed and even grew fatter with data from the federal police 
and the internal revenue service 
goes said the new secretariat is more sophisticated than the sni 
ever was 
information and intelligence now are a department of the 
secretariat and continue under the aegis of the military he 
said the other departments of the new agency are strategic policy 
and national defense 
if a crisis were to develop there are now authorities who 
could act like a secret police goes said 
he complained of a lack of outside control over the agency 
noting there is no congressional committee that checks its budget 
or personnel 
like his military predecessors at the sni director ramos is 
highly secretive 
he will not speak to the press and is rarely photographed or 
seen in public several requests by the associated press for an 
interview went unanswered 
the job creates the habit said goes who knows ramos and 
described him as a very capable young man in collors strictest 
confidence and one of the few with direct access to the presidents 
office 
in recent years former members of the sni have revealed some of 
the agencys inner workings and past mistakes 
retired gen helio lemos 74 a former top official said the 
sni had informants in every brazilian embassy and consulate but it 
still didnt even suspect that argentina would invade the falkland 
islands in 1982 
lemos said the sni did not foresee the oil crises of the 1970s 
or the iraniraq war both of which were of great strategic 
importance to brazil an importer of oil and exporter of arms 
adm maximiano da fonseca a former navy minister recalled that 
we got our information from the newspapers 
some generals have grumbled publicly about collors decision to 
put a civilian in charge but goes said the armed forces and 
secretariat now make up a new intelligence network 
the military was worried at first he said but soon the 
spy services of the army navy and air force were expanded and many 
files were duplicated in the event of possible destruction 
he described the combined network as a web so tangled that 
nothing and nobody can escape

in the sprawling suburbia of new jersey 
nearly an hours drive from times square the big broadwaystyle 
musical is alive and flourishing 
it has found a receptive home at the paper mill playhouse a 
onetime summer theater that forsakes conventional strawhat 
offerings for more innovative theater fare produced on a yearly 
budget that now tops 10 million 
the paper mills prominence has risen steadily in the last few 
years primarily because of its savvy mixture of musicals both old 
and new among its productions were a revival of mack and 
mabel a rarely seen jerry herman musical about movie director 
mack sennett and his star mabel norman and a musical version of 
james micheners sayonara 
but the show that gained paper mill a national audience was 
show boat taped at the theater last summer for public 
television and then shown on great performances in the fall 
the revival which starred richard white and eddie bracken will be 
repeated later this year on pbs 
during its current season which ends june 24 paper mill 
produced an opulent revival of fanny with george s irving and 
jose ferrer playing the roles originated on broadway in 1954 by 
walter slezak and ezio pinza and it took on gilbert and sullivan 
in a bigbusiness reworking of one of the duos most famous works 
the mikado rechristened mikado inc it was the theaters 
final offering of a 10month season 
mikado inc which was conceived directed and choreographed 
by robert johanson the theaters artistic director was loosely 
inspired by the gilbert and sullivan operetta the words are all 
new the music was largely reworked for example melodies sung by 
one character in the original are now given to another character 
we try to do an eclectic year says angelo del rossi the 
theaters executive producer and a 27year veteran of the 
playhouse we dont try to do things that are too similar those 
two shows are perfect examples we have no philosophy whatever 
excites us is what we want to do 
paper mill which also does dramas and comedies began mixing 
new musicals with revivals about five years ago 
there wasnt really very much new out there think back to 
what broadway was like then del rossi recalls we do musicals 
well and thought we were in a perfect position to develop new 
musicals 
out of their deliberations came paper mills musical theater 
workshop 
it works like this 
the theater does a reading two performances with script in 
hand of a new work the public is invited and feedback is 
encouraged from both audience and staff 
paper mill does six readings of new material a year its most 
recent reading done in early june was a musical version of the 
jimmy stewart classic its a wonderful life with music by joe 
raposo and lyrics by sheldon harnick 
out of those readings we usually find one show that we like 
and bring it to the next phase the workshop or laboratory phase 
del rossi added at the conclusion of the workshop if we feel it 
deserves a main stage production then we go ahead and do it weve 
done that with sayonara and mikado inc 
del rossi and johanson choose their revivals with care looking 
for good shows that somehow have been neglected 
i try to do things that havent been done continuously like 
my fair lady del rossi says we breathed new life into the 
desert song and the new moon in fact beverly sills saw both 
those productions and picked up our whole artistic staff our 
director our conductor our choreographer and our star brought 
them to city opera and did both of those shows 
i love shows that are romantic have a beautiful love story 
and really have a book as well as something of an epic feeling to 
them johanson said fanny certainly did plus its fun to 
work on something that has no real history people dont know the 
classic production of fanny like they know the classic production 
of a my fair lady or fiddler on the roof 
the paper mill playhouse originally was a paper mill built in 
1790 the long narrow shoebox of a building was turned into a 
theater in 1938 it remained in operation until january 1980 when a 
fire destroyed the stage and auditorium 
we were not quite sure we were going to come back said del 
rossi about the dark days following the fire i didnt want to 
come back as the old paper mill playhouse i wanted to return as a 
new theater with new ideas 
reconstruction wasnt easy in 1980 the interest rate was 165 
percent the theater had no money and was surviving from show to 
show 
it took a year for the trustees to approve rebuilding and then 
almost two years to actually do it the final cost was nearly 9 
million much of the money raised by del rossi and his staff from 
corporations foundations and from the state 
from a meager subscription base that would vary between 2000 
and 6000 paper mill today has 43000 subscribers for its 10month 
season plays run five weeks and musicals are booked for sixweek 
engagements 
paper mill now has a permanent staff of 40 people who help put 
together each show the scenery is designed and built there and 
although costumes are often rented the theater is developing 
facilities to do its own costumes 
del rossi encourages creators of new work not to be be 
intimidated by size 
we are one of the few theaters when we put the search out for 
new material that say dont restrict yourselves because of size 
we want anything that is good and not to have authors afraid to 
send us something that has a cast of 24 people most of our musical 
casts at paper mill are 30 to 40 people 
the theater is also commissioning new works for the stage 
mikado inc was one such commission among other commissioned 
projects which could turn up in a year or two are a science 
fiction musical and a musical about the last princess of hawaii 
next year were thinking about doing an opera but not like the 
met or the new york city opera would do it del rossi said but 
we want to do it the way a musical theater would do it we just 
take different approaches to things

so whats a nice young jewish doctor doing in 
the wilds of alaska 
thats the premise of the cbs summer series northern 
exposure in which dr joel fleishman who financed medical 
school by promising to practice in the far north for four years 
arrives in alaska and starts paying his dues 
hes stuck in this little town in alaska said josh brand 
cowriter and producer with john falsey he doesnt like the 
place he doesnt feel comfortable he feels hes been tricked 
because they had promised him anchorage 
in the first episode fleishman played by rob morrow learns 
hes being sent into the wilderness other regulars in the 
eightepisode run which starts july 12 are barry corbin john 
cullum janine turner john corbett and cynthia geary 
this isnt a medical show this isnt about the disease of the 
week said brand who also created st elsewhere with falsey 
this is about a fish out of water its a show about people 
brand and falsey became partners as writers for the white 
shadow they also guided st elsewhere as producers in its 
first year later they created and produced a year in the life 
they also helped steven spielberg create the amazing stories 
series and were its supervising producers the first year 
northern exposure had its origin in several sources 
including brands doctor friend who suggested the original idea for 
st elsewhere a series set in a teaching hospital 
wed read about the state of maine paying for medical school 
to get doctors to practice in small towns brand said the 
genesis of this series was the movie cry wolf which was about a 
city man going into the northern woods to study wolves and a 
script wed written about a friend of mine who was a doctor and 
joined the new york police department he now practices in rural 
new york 
the show is being filmed on location in roslyn wash a small 
town about 60 miles east of seattle just off interstate 90 east of 
the cascade mountains 
its a onestreet town a little farther out than we wanted 
but its great brand said the mountains and the lakes are 
magnificent the skies can be dark and filled with billowing 
clouds its very clear youre not in los angeles 
brand said they discovered a huge mural painted on the wall of a 
cafe in roslyn showing a camel and a palm tree we made up a 
story that it was roslyns cafe and roslyn had been one of the 
founders of the town he said 
the home for corbins character is a spectacular log cabin with 
40foothigh ceilings a 15footlong buggy hangs on one wall 
the idea of filming on location is fun but youre always so 
busy you never have time to see anything brand said i think 
ive been in to seattle once id love to get to the san juan 
islands but theres no time working on location is a twoheaded 
monster no matter where you are theres another place you need to 
be we have to do all the postproduction work in los angeles 
northern exposure is one of a several summer shows the 
networks particularly cbs are mounting this year in hopes of 
retaining viewers until the fall season premieres brand said 
the summer placement has has its advantages he said 
the networks have been losing viewers every fall brand 
said theyre hoping they wont lose as many this year if they 
can keep viewers over the summer i think cbs is putting more money 
into this show than all the summer shows of the past few seasons 
we get to introduce a new show without the intense competition 
of the regular season if it catches on itll be back later

for the sixth time in the short history of 
aids the top minds in the fight against the disease will gather to 
brief each other and the world about their triumphs and 
setbacks 
the sixth international conference on aids which opens 
wednesday will be a sort of aids marathon five days of terse 
reports on almost every aspect of the disease no dramatic 
breakthroughs are likely to be announced but experts say the 
meeting should turn up signs of progress in medicines effort to 
understand and defeat the virus 
an estimated 11000 doctors scientists and other aids 
professionals will hear about 2500 presentations ranging from the 
results of experiments with new drugs and vaccines to reports on 
the spread of aids from mothers to children and from prostitutes to 
their customers 
such meetings are a staple of medical research but ordinarily 
pass in peaceful obscurity last month for instance 7000 doctors 
gathered in washington for the american society of clinical 
oncology the major us cancer meeting about 100 reporters 
chronicled the proceedings 
twentyfour times more americans die of cancer than of aids each 
year but aids is clearly different 
organizers of the aids meeting expect 1800 members of the news 
media to attend drawn both by the newsworthiness of aids research 
and the possibility of demonstrations and other street drama in san 
francisco the city with the nations highest aids rate 
some scientists might find the publicity unseemly but many seem 
to relish the intense if fleeting attention 
all of us recognize that we are in the business of 
dissemination of information and there is simply no better forum 
in the world for doing that it is unmatched said dr robert m 
wachter of the university of california at san francisco the 
meetings program director 
inside the moscone convention center vaccine development is 
likely to be one of the hottest topics of discussion 
at this meeting you will see a lot more positive news about 
successes in the vaccine field testing in chimpanzees and rhesus 
monkeys and perhaps some encouraging news in human beings also 
said dr david ho an aids researcher at the university of 
california los angeles 
while none of these reports is likely to suggest a vaccine is 
close to being ready for widespread use they at least should hint 
that such a preventative measure is possible 
in the first five years of hiv aids virus research anything 
related to vaccine research has been very discouraging said ho 
over the past year we have seen a lot more positive results 
much of this work still is at the most basic stages scientists 
will update their search for instance for vulnerable spots on the 
surface of the aids virus that a vaccine can exploit to attack and 
destroy it 
scientists also will report on the uses of azt and 
stillexperimental drugs by people who are infected with hiv but 
not yet sick 
the goal of such treatment is to keep them healthy but the new 
studies show people quickly grow resistant to the helpful effects 
of the drugs 
whether such treatment should be reserved for later stages of 
the disease when victims might benefit more is expected to be a 
major topic of the conference 
many reports also are planned on new aids drugs still in the 
testtube stage of development researchers are creating these 
medicines to attack the virus at various points in its life cycle 
it will be some time before they get to the clinic but there 
has been a tremendous amount of progress in the past year in 
understanding the virus and translating that information into 
designing new drugs said dr william haseltine of the 
danafarber cancer institute in boston 
while much of the research will be new information a good deal 
also will be stale at least to aids insiders because of the 
intense interest in aids major developments rarely remain secret 
for long 
we hear about events almost as they happen rather than in the 
artificially contrived schedule of meetings said dr clifford 
lane of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
the way communication goes these days theres no time delay 
anymore 
other expected topics include the effect of aids on sexual 
practices the risk of passing on the aids virus during pregnancy 
aids hazards among health care workers and the cost of paying for 
the epidemic 
the conference will include about half as many presentations as 
last years meeting in montreal largely because it will pay 
significantly less attention to social issues 
nonscientific subjects explored last year but not this time 
include erotica aids coping strategies aids in the arts and the 
religious response to the disease 
montreal made a conscious effort to emphasize the social side 
of the epidemic said wachter we heard from a number of 
scientists that they didnt get as much out of the conference as 
they would like this encouraged us to be as sensitive to the needs 
of people working in the lab looking for new vaccines as we were to 
people working in the community

a new york stock exchange report clears program 
trading as the major villain in market turmoil and gives ammunition 
to officials seeking a superregulator for stocks and their spinoff 
products 
the report is the latest study into wild price movements blamed 
for scaring off small investors it was written by a blueribbon 
panel formed after the market plunged last october in a nearrepeat 
of the 1987 crash 
the panels conclusion that the most popular program trading 
strategy index arbitrage is a natural feature in stock and 
stockindex futures markets is likely to reignite a simmering 
debate 
the nyse group was composed primarily of representatives of wall 
street large corporations and big insitutional money managers 
which largely have opposed placing restrictions on program trading 
its simply an affirmation of the fact that the nyse has 
surrendered all of their hopes and dreams to the institutions 
said charles wohlstetter chairman of contel corp and a program 
trading opponent 
in its main proposal the panel supported coordinated circuit 
breakers in the cash futures and options markets that would stop 
trading during wide market fluctuations 
the system would place a 400point cap on the possible daily 
rise or fall in the dow jones industrial average and allow for the 
stock market to close for nearly a full day in the case of rapid 
price movements the average plummeted 508 points in the record 
crash of oct 19 1987 
general motors corp chairman roger smith who led the 19member 
panel said the circuit breakers would provide a breathing spell 
in the market in chaotic times 
the panel proposed halting trading for one hour if the dow jones 
average moves up or down 100 points from the previous days close 
another 90 minutes if it moves 200 points and two hours each if it 
moves 300 points and 400 points stoppages would be coordinated 
with the nations futures markets 
but opponents have said such a measure a less restrictive form 
of which already exists would limit individual investors ability 
to get out of the market during a downturn there were no circuit 
breakers in effect at the time of the 1987 crash 
the big board panel took the view that index arbitrage and other 
forms of program trading are here to stay index arbitrage involves 
rapid trading of stocks in new york and stockindex futures in 
chicago to profit from momentary price discrepancies between the 
two markets 
critics blamed the practice for worsening the markets freefall 
during the 1987 crash and again last oct 13 when the dow jones 
industrial average fell 190 points many large wall street 
brokerages pulled back on program trading after last years 
minicrash but their customers did not 
in february the nyse proposed restricting stockindex arbitrage 
when the dow jones average is up or down 50 points or more that 
proposal still is pending before the securities and exchange 
commission and wasnt affected by the new report 
at the time the nyse said program trading strategies may 
create excess volatility that undermines investor confidence in the 
fairness and orderliness of the securities markets and may in fact 
constitute a threat to the viability of americas capital markets 
but the blueribbon panel report endorsed by nyse chairman john 
j phelan jr concludes that there is little evidence that index 
arbitrage causes an increase in volatility as usually measured 
the closest the report comes to criticizing the practice is a 
statement that it is possible that program trading and index 
arbitrage exacerbate shortterm volatility 
the panel also called for creating a single agency to regulate 
the nations stock and stockindex futures markets that finding 
rankled the chicago mercantile exchange which would be likely to 
lose authority under a superregulator and is sure to deepen the 
debate 
the bush administration already has endorsed legislation that 
would give the securities and exchange commission control over the 
markets 
sec chairman richard s breeden said he was extremely 
pleased with the nyse panels recommendation he said it in 
essence fully confirms the proposed legislation 
but chicago merc chairman leo melamed a panel member attached 
a dissent to the report a majority of the panel simply mirrored 
a popular perception that consolidation of regulation seems 
desirable it said 
some of the conclusions in the latest report overlap findings in 
more than a dozen studies undertaken following the 1987 crash 
including the governments brady commission report that endorsed 
circuit breakers the brady commission however placed more blame 
on program trading as a source of volatility 
phelan said the report would be voted on by the exchanges board 
and its recommendations discussed with other financial markets

a threemonthold banana battle has 
ended with united brands agreeing to let the irishenglish firm 
fyffes buy honduran bananas and gain a toehold in the central 
american country for the first time 
the agreement between new yorkbased united brands and more than 
600 independent producers affects about 1 million of the 47 million 
boxes of bananas honduras exports annually but the dispute 
ballooned to far greater proportions 
united brands which had exported all of the bananas from the 
independent producers will buy 60 percent until march 31 1991 
and let fyffes buy the other 40 percent after that date the 
independents who wanted to accept fyffes higher prices will be 
free to sell to the highest bidder 
the agreement announced tuesday by the economy ministry was 
reached on sunday 
the dispute arose in march after independent producers sold to 
fyffes which has 26 european subsidiaries 
united brands argued that the sale violated its exclusive 
contract with the producers which expires in 1991 with a judges 
consent the company had employees go to the dock where a fyffes 
shipment was waiting and throw tens of thousands of boxes of 
bananas into the sea give them away to local people or stomp on 
them 
united brands which has operated in honduras since 1912 argued 
that it invests in the country while fyffes wants only to buy 
over the past 50 years united has accounted for 60 percent of 
honduran banana exports san franciscobased castle amp cook exports 
the other 40 percent 
the two companies also produce all but the 1 million boxes grown 
by the independents united employs about 8000 people and castle amp 
cook 4000 on their plantations 
honduras is the worlds fourth largest banana producer after 
ecuador costa ricaand colombia 
as a result of the fray the government said tuesday it was 
studying the possibility of rejoining the union of banana exporting 
countries and would change its banana policy 
the country withdrew from the marketing union four years ago 
saying it could not pay the 500000 dues it owes the organization 
12 million in back dues half of which the union has forgiven 
the unions seven members and honduras account for half the 
worlds banana production 
the new honduran banana policy will be directed toward 
protecting the national activity to impede the resurgence of 
monopolies local as well as international assistant economy 
minister ramiro figueroa said at a news conference

the securities and exchange commissions 
attempt to prevent corporations from creating different classes of 
stock with unequal voting rights has been thwarted by a federal 
appeals court 
a threejudge appeals panel in washington ruled unanimously that 
the sec exceeded its authority when it imposed a socalled one 
share one vote rule 
that supported the contention of the business roundtable an 
association of the nations top corporations which claimed the sec 
rule interfered with the traditional role of the individual states 
in regulating corporate governance 
the sec had contended that its federal mandate to protect 
investors in publicly traded companies gave it the right to impose 
the one share one vote rule 
but the us circuit court of appeals for the district of 
columbia said the sec went beyond its congressionally mandated 
authority to oversee the financial markets 
because the rule directly controls the substantive allocation 
of powers among classes of shareholders we find it in excess of 
the commissions authority the panel said in a 21page opinion 
written by circuit judge stephen f williams concurring with 
williams were circuit judges james l buckley and harry t edwards 
i was disappointed said richard g ketchum head of the 
secs division of market regulation sec officials will have to 
review the opinion before deciding whether to appeal he said 
the united shareholders association a washingtonbased 
stockholders rights group founded by t boone pickens also 
bemoaned the decision as a major blow to americas 47 million 
shareholders and the entire freeenterprise system 
usa director ralph whitworth urged the sec to appeal the ruling 
to the supreme court 
the head of the roundtables corporate governance task force 
hailed the decision though 
american shareholders won an important victory today said 
bruce atwater who is also chief executive officer of general 
mills the court has resoundingly affirmed their right to 
determine for themselves what kinds of equities best serve their 
interests 
the business roundtable argued that the sec had overstepped its 
authority and was trying to regulate how companies are run a 
traditional role of the states the states of ohio delaware 
kentucky michigan idaho pennsylvania wyoming nebraska north 
carolina missouri georgia and west virginia had filed court 
papers supporting the groups stance 
the roundtable is an association of 200 companies that includes 
american express co xerox corp citicorp and general mills 
its a very important decision that limits the secs attempt 
to regulate corporate governance said attorney robert d 
rosenbaum who represented the group in oral arguments last 
november before the appeals court 
the appeals court found that sec authority to compel full 
corporate disclosure to shareholders doesnt extend to what 
shareholders can decide rosenbaum said 
the sec rule in question rule 19c4 was adopted in july 1988 
it prohibited publicly traded corporations from weakening the 
voting power of existing stockholders by issuing new classes of 
stock with superior or supervoting rights 
in filings with the appeals court last fall the sec claimed 
that without the curb shareholders could be stripped of their 
ability to participate in management and confidence in the 
securities markets could be impaired 
rule 19c4 allowed the sec to bar an offending companys stock 
from being listed on any stock exchange that it regulated or with 
the national association of securities dealers stock quotation 
system nasdaq 
the sec claimed congress intended it to have such authority to 
ensure that exchanges didnt lower their listing standards to 
attract more corporate stock listings 
but the appeals court said that intent only concerned the secs 
authority to govern exchanges and quote systems not corporations 
to argue that congresss equal regulation mandate supports 
sec control over corporate governance through national listing 
standards is to gamble that the court will accept a commission spin 
on a statutory fragment without even a glance at its context 
said the court adding wrong court bad gamble 
the secs ketchum said he did not think the ruling would cause 
the nations stock exchanges to lower their listing requirements

royal dutch shell group the worlds biggest oil 
company said it will stop docking its crude and fuel oil tankers 
at all but one us port because of what it said were huge 
liability risks 
the exxon valdez made it clear what happens when you have a 
spill and the enormous liabilities you can face said norm 
altstedter a new york spokesman for the anglodutch company 
the decision has no relation to the fire on the mega borg 
supertanker some 57 miles offshore from galveston altstedter said 
it was made solely as a commercial decision he said 
under the decision shipments of crude and fuel oils in tankers 
owned or operated by the royal dutch shell group will be limited to 
the louisiana offshore oil port 
about 80 percent of the companys us shipments of some 180000 
barrels a day involve such oils but only 40000 barrels a day will 
be affected by the decision altstedter said the rest of the 
shipments already go to the port about 20 miles offshore louisiana 
he said 
the remainder of the companys us shipments involve light oil 
products such as kerosene and gasoline and wont be affected by the 
decision he said 
the suspension came after a review of the risks and rewards to 
such trading in the united states the spokesman said 
the us has not yet ratified the international conventions 
which limit liability altstedter said and theres no 
limitation on liability or the magnitude of legalities 
exxon corp was indicted in february on five federal charges 
stemming from the grounding of the valdez in march 1989 the 
government said it would seek at least 700 million in penalties 
from the oil company under a law that allows recovery of twice the 
amount of proven losses 
exxon also has spent more than 2 billion to clean up the 11 
million gallons of crude released in the nations worst oil spill 
the marine activities of shell oil co usa the us subsidiary 
of royal dutch shell are not affected by the decision officials 
said 
we dont own ships said hr hutchins shell usa spokesman 
at the companys houston headquarters we charter everything from 
groups royal dutch shell is one of many groups we use this will 
have little or no effect on shell oil usa

chrysler corp may go ahead and produce a new 
small jeep on its own after it and french automaker renault backed 
out of a deal to jointly make the vehicle a company official said 
the automakers said tuesday they were calling off a planned 500 
million project to jointly develop the vehicles for european and 
north american production in the mid1990s chrysler spokesman tom 
houston said the joint project was no longer attractive 
economically 
the collapse of the deal comes as chrysler and other automakers 
worldwide eye economic developments in western and eastern europe 
which represent the worlds biggest auto market 
analyst chuck brady said he was surprised by the announcement 
i dont see what has changed to make it uneconomical said 
brady of oppenheimer amp co in new york it doesnt make any 
sense 
last week general motors corp announced a joint venture with 
volga auto works of the soviet union gm executives said the 
project to provide fuel system components represented their 
entrance to a potentially huge marketplace 
although houston said the planned joint venture was no longer 
attractive he indicated chrysler is considering developing the 
vehicle codenamed jj by itself or with another partner 
chrysler intends to continue with the jj project and is 
reviewing various implementation alternatives houston said 
declining to disclose details 
the two companies said last february the vehicle would be 
produced in valladolid spain and that a north american site would 
be chosen later 
chrysler has been negotiating with public officials in ohio and 
the united auto workers union over the fate of the companys jeep 
plant in toledo 
there has been intense speculation that chrysler wanted to 
transfer production of the jeep wrangler now made in canada to 
toledo and add jj production later 
on monday members of uaw local 12 in toledo approved by a wide 
margin a new labor agreement seen as key to bringing production of 
the jj and the wrangler to the toledo factory which is 
approaching 70 years old 
chrysler has been getting the lions share of its profits from 
sales of its minivans and its jeep line which it acquired with the 
purchase of american motors corp in august 1987 
but recently chryslers profits and sales have been falling 
the companys profits fell 80 percent in the first quarter to 71 
million and its vehicle sales tumbled 128 percent in the first 
five months of this year

home television viewers will be 
able to match wits with nfl quarterbacks and win prizes by calling 
plays in an interactive football game popular in sports bars 
taverns and hotels 
interactive network inc of mountain view national football 
league properties inc in new york and ntn communications inc of 
carlsbad calif jointly announced tuesday an agreement to make 
ntns qb1 game available to home tv viewers 
david lockton president and chief executive officer of 
interactive network said in new york that the game will cost 400 
to 500 for the control unit plus a subscription fee of about 15 a 
month for access to a family of programs 
the system will be available in northern california in 1990 and 
will begin to be rolled out nationwide in 1991 
he predicted that 400000 to 500000 homes would have the system 
in 1991 and that the market would grow substantially in future 
seasons 
more than 1 million people have played qb1 in sports bars since 
its introduction four years ago said ntn president patrick j 
downs and about 50000 played it during this years super bowl 
the game is played on a cordless wireless terminal with 
simulcasted data of the action all the information required to 
play along is received by the fm receiver in the control unit much 
like a stereo simulcast 
players watching the game on tv or listening on radio make 
judgments on whether the next play will be a pass or a run and get 
points for their decisions they can gain extra points by 
predicting whether the play is to the left right or middle or 
whether the pass is long or short 
a lockout signal is sent instantaneously to all players to 
prevent entering calls after the ball is snapped then the correct 
answer is sent out by an nfl referee who sits at a computer console 
punching in the types of plays 
as the players go along their scores are continually updated 
after each play at the end of the game players can compare their 
scores to other players by plugging a phone to the back of the unit 
for a few seconds the score is transmitted to interactive 
networks computer ranked and rebroadcast over the fm 
within five minutes even if millions of players are playing 
interactive network will be able to tell who won the game lockton 
said 
since the game is considered one of skill rather than luck ntn 
and the games sponsors are legally able to offer prizes including 
trips to winners the sports bars charge varying amounts to play 
some offering the game for free to patrons who consume a certain 
amount of food or drinks 
for home players interactive network is considering a variety 
of awards to recognize winners 
the game uses interactives patented technology which was 
developed by lockton in the early 1980s and licensed to ntn for the 
sports bar game interactive holds the patent on the only practical 
working technology that permits home competition and scoring 
without engaging the telephone line throughout the contest 
interactive networks system not only adds a new dimension to 
television viewership but it provides the television industry an 
opportunity to offer interactive advertising couponing 
sweepstakes and other promotional activities in conjunction with 
commercials run in this interactive environment said tom rogers 
head of business development for nbc and president of nbc cable 
interactive network has been testing a baseball game licensed 
with major league baseball properties inc and has deals in the 
works with the nhl and nba 
in addition to contests based on live televised sports the 
system will permit home television viewers to play along 
simultaneously with game shows as well as interact directly with 
television news programs educational programs and special event 
broadcasts

the chief executive officers of delta air lines 
singapore airlines and swissair say their yearold alliance is 
flying high with several new joint projects in the works 
but the ceos emphasized in a meeting with reporters tuesday that 
the three airlines continue to maintain a certain distance and 
that their relationship is not likely to evolve into anything more 
formal such as a merger 
each one is proud of our own personality said cheong choong 
kong chief executive officer of singapore no one seeks to tell 
the other parties how to run their airline 
the three got together last year joining through crossequity 
investments for a number of projects 
cheong along with ceos ronald w allen of delta and otto loepfe 
of swissair said tuesday that the alliance so far has produced 
such tangible gains as deltas recent loan of 70 flight attendants 
to swissair to help with a personnel shortage and an agreement 
between delta and singapore for blocked space on traffic between 
singapore and dallasfort worth and new york 
the three airlines also have joined in expanded frequent flier 
programs coordinated global flight schedules and joint fares 
the airline chiefs said tuesday they are working on plans for 
joint purchasing aircraft interchange flights global tour 
packages and a global small package delivery service 
cheong said the three executives during meetings monday and 
tuesday in atlanta accomplished quite a lot on the tour package 
project as well as joint fare and advertising plans but he said 
the aircraft interchange will take more time to develop 
kevin murphy who follows delta for morgan stanley amp co in new 
york said such alliances which open international doors for 
airlines are the order of the day for the 1990s 
he said the strength of deltas alliance with singapore and 
swissair is the compatibility of the three carriers operating 
styles 
as far as equality of service if there are three airlines 
that should run like a swiss watch these are they murphy 
said 
murphy said it is notable that delta established its global 
alliance during the heightened airline takeover activity of last 
summer when the atlantabased carrier was frequently mentioned as 
an attractive target 
they also act as white squires for delta murphy said of 
swissair and singapore 
deltas allen said the three airlines continue to be 
competitors however friendly 
we will all keep our individual identities we will continue 
to be competitive with one another he said the success of the 
alliance he added doesnt preclude our deltas continued 
expansion internationally nor does it preclude expansion by 
singapore or swissair

rescue crews working on air bagequipped 
cars should disconnect the vehicles batteries to assure the safety 
devices dont accidentally deploy a fire official says 
automakers began installing air bags en masse late last year 
because of governmental regulation requiring passive restraint 
systems on 1990 and later model cars 
the devices are standard equipment on all of chrysler corps 
us made cars about half of ford motor cos and about 15 percent 
of general motors corps 
this week firefighters from around the united states and canada 
are at the gm proving grounds west of detroit using crashtest cars 
to practice roadside rescue techniques and learn about new 
technology in cars including air bags 
some of firefighters said tuesday there was concern about armed 
air bags deploying during rescue operations 
you dont put yourself between an undeployed air bag and the 
victim said ken jones of owen sound ontario and a member of 
the ontario fire marshals office the information about the 
new technology of the cars hasnt been disseminated to us 
the big three automakers have issued owners and dealer service 
manuals describing how the devices work precautions to take while 
working near them and disclaimers saying failure to follow 
directions could result in injury 
if somebody is there with their nose against the bag and the 
thing goes off i guess somebody might get injured said gm 
spokesman don postma 
the cardinal rule automakers say is to disable the cars 
electrical system which powers the air bag the device designed 
to be used with manual lap and shoulder seat belts is a large 
pillow flattened and stored in a steering wheel or dash board it 
inflates in a tenth of a second and begins deflating immediately 
other passive restraint systems include an automatic shoulder 
belt on a track used with a manual lap belt and an automatic lap 
and shoulder belt system 
in a garage disabling a cars electrical system along with the 
air bag is simply a matter of unbolting battery cables at a crash 
scene things are more complicated 
if it is difficult to locate the battery or determine if its 
cables are intact then automakers recommend mechanics and rescuers 
go under the steering column to disconnect the air bag

smithkline beecham has filed a law suit 
accusing two competitors of lying to obtain government approval for 
generic versions of smithklines antihypertension drug dyazide 
bolar pharmaceutical co inc of copiague ny and vitarine 
pharmaceuticals inc of springfield gardens ny both 
manufactured and sold generic versions of dyazide until the past 
year when allegations of false reports to the food and drug 
administration surfaced 
the suit filed in federal court tuesday accuses bolar of 
falsifying evidence that its generic drug is dyazides 
bioequivalent that is the generic drug achieves the same effect 
in the same dosage 
the suit accuses bolar of backdating testing studies to make it 
appear the companys tests were performed on a batch of dyazide 
when in fact they were performed on a batch that was not prepared 
according to federal procedures 
bolar took its generic version of the drug off the market in 
january after acknowledging that the company had faked lab tests to 
win fda approval 
vitarine when taking their version off the market in june 1989 
admitted its substituted dyazide for its product in tests required 
to win fda approval 
smithkline was injured because those schemes and 
representations enabled the companies to obtain fda approval 
to sell their generic versions of dyazide to persons who otherwise 
would have bought dyazide from smithkline the suit claims 
dyazide is one of smithklines bestselling products with 
annual sales exceeding 300 million in 1987 according to the suit 
in 1988 after the generic substitutes entered the market sales 
fell to 153 million 
the suit characterizes the companies actions as a violation of 
the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act and asks for 
unspecified damages 
also named in the 12count suit are bolars president robert 
shulman and port washington nybased schein pharmaceutical 
inc the company that developed marketed and sold bolars version 
an assistant to bolars general counsel who did not give her 
name said she could not comment on the suit late tuesday because 
the company had not received a copy of the complaint 
officials at vitarine did not return a message left at their 
offices tuesday afternoon 
smithkline beecham plc is the big pharmaceutical company formed 
last summer in the merger of smithkline beckman corp and britains

retail sales slumped 07 percent in may 
posting their first threemonth decline since the last recession in 
1981 the government said today 
the commerce department said sales decreased to a seasonally 
adjusted 14684 billion from 14793 billion in april 
after remaining unchanged in february retail sales fell a 
revised 04 percent in march and 09 percent in april that was 
worse than the 03 percent decline first reported for march and the 
06 percent dip in april 
many economists had expected a slight improvement in sales in 
may 
it was the first time since september october and november 1981 
that retail sales had fallen for three straight months 
retail sales represent about half of consumer spending which 
has been a driving force for the economy during much of the last 
eight years overall consumer spending accounts for about 
twothirds of the nations economic activity 
retail sales had jumped 28 percent in january when automobile 
purchases spurted after cash rebates and lowinterest financing 
were restored to attract buyers 
each of the automakers continues to offer incentives but fewer 
cars are covered as companies try to wean consumers from the 
profiteroding practice 
commerce said automobiles slipped 06 percent in may following a 
16 percent drop in april through may 31 car sales had dropped 
103 percent over the comparable period of 1989 manufacturers 
reported last week 
excluding autos retail sales were off 08 percent in may after 
dropping 07 percent in april and 06 percent in march 
the manufacturing sector including the automobile industry has 
been dampened by federal reserve efforts to restrain credit to 
avoid overheating the economy and thus fueling inflation 
economists also question the effect of a slowing job market and 
declining consumer confidence on future retail sales 
most recent job gains reflected temporary government hiring of 
census workers while employment losses continued at factories and 
in the construction industry 
economists will be watching for thursdays business inventory 
report to see whether any drawdown would be sufficient to increase 
production and thus create more jobs 
sales of durable goods usually costly items like automobiles 
which are expected to last at least three years fell 11 percent 
in may after dropping 17 percent in april 
in that category building materials plunged 42 percent after a 
32 percent drop a month earlier furniture and other home 
furnishings were down 11 percent on top of a 05 percent gain in 
april 
sales of nondurable goods such as food and clothing slipped 05 
percent the same as in april 
gains were posted by only by apparel up 24 percent and 
offsetting a 24 percent decline a month earlier

the us dollar closed mostly lower against the 
major currencies in european trading wednesday but rose against the 
west german mark 
gold prices fell 
foreign exchange dealers said the main factor affecting the 
dollar was the unexpected decline of 07 percent in us retail 
sales in may the slide which suggests us economic growth is 
continuing to slow sparked anxiety that the federal reserve may be 
tempted to lower domestic interest rates which would make the 
dollar less attractive for investors 
two more us indicators this week also may affect the dollar 
producer prices on thursday and trade figures on friday 
further signs of softer us economic activity would send the 
dollar lower dealers said 
the dollar was firm against the mark because of continuing 
concern over the impact of the monetary union between the two 
german states in july investors and dealers say they are not 
convinced that the transition will be smooth despite official 
assurances that it will be

sterling was trading at 17107 at midday in new york

the chinese laundry the italian produce stand 
the jewish delicatessen the irish bar are old cliches of american 
life more recently the korean greengrocer has joined the list 
aspiring to business ownership to be ones own boss to be 
independent to control ones destiny to create a future for ones 
family all are deeply rooted in the american ethic 
but what happened to black entrepreneurship 
blacks and hispanics make up nearly 20 percent of the 
population but they own less than 5 percent of the countrys small 
businesses and many of them are extremely small 
but a report by the businesshigher education forum made up of 
chief executives of major american colleges universities and 
corporations suggests the opportunity for minority entrepreneurs 
now may be better than at any time since the turn of the 
century 
they view the racial climate as having changed sufficiently and 
the economic climate as now favoring smallbusinesses that can 
adapt to quickly changing markets meanwhile the black 
middleclass market has swelled 
throughout the 87page report however it becomes clear that 
still another factor might be at work a new sense of urgency by 
the establishment educators and executives included that black 
entrepreneurship should get a helping hand 
in tracing the history of black enterpreneurship the report 
cites the work of bart landry a stanford university sociologist 
who describes the existence of blackowned enterprises even before 
the emancipation 
after the civil war such businesses flourished the report 
states 
building on skills acquired during slavery black 
entrepreneurs worked metal repair harness and leathergoods 
managed hotels and rooming houses catered and operated grocery 
stores 
but it states these enterprises were almost completely 
obliterated during the reconstruction or the period of economic 
and governmental rebuilding after the civil war 
still when the fourth atlanta university conference on the 
negro in business met in 1898 more than 1900 black businessmen 
participated and two years later booker t washington founded the 
national business league 
but the report relates thrift and individual enterprise were 
weak reeds on which to rely in the year 1900 blackowned 
business encountered selective white racism and the north 
industrialized while the south was held back 
only certain enterprises remained open to blacks the report 
describes how black business owners cut hair provided meals 
cleaned and pressed clothes and buried the dead all required 
little capital 
now almost a century later the forum which many people will 
identify as the establishment believe the causes of the problem 
and its solution is clear minority business problems it says are 
often 
problems of access to financial institutions and to 
community networks that might provide financing to begin a 
business finance an initial inventory andf obtain equipment and 
space 
many ethnic minorities avoided some degree of these problems 
even financial ones because of strong family and community 
structures and because of institutions brought from the old 
country blacks have not always had them 
the forum makes many important recommendations in educational 
and business areas few of which seem more important than in the 
area of capital development 
in particular it suggests that corporations investigate three 
related strategies of capital assistance 
1 creating partnerships with local banks and community 
developoment groups to bring business back to the inner city 
2 depositing a small percentage of corporate assets in the 
banks that form the cornerstone of these venture to be available 
for mortgage and business loans 
3 investing for profit directly in the venture capital efforts 
of community development efforts 
every little bit will help according to the report signed by 
task force cochairmen steven mason of the mead corporation and 
clifton wharton of the teachers insurance and annuity association 
indeed it might take very little 
the report stresses that investing a very small amount of the 
capital controlled by major corporations a fraction of one 
percent can exert an enormous force for good in supporting these 
community based organizations

dick tracy the comic book detective with a twoway 
wrist radio would be pleased 
a japanese company says it plans to introduce a wristwatch with 
a pager capable of carrying short messages on a liquidcrystal

already provide similar services for beepers but these devices 
arent contained in a wristwatch 
the wristwatch pager is manufactured by seiko epson co a

the us has asked west germany to 
speed work on measures designed to tighten export controls a top 
aide to chancellor helmut kohl said wednesday 
allegations that a west german company helped outfit a factory 
in rabta libya to make poison gas prompted the legislation 
us ambassador vernon walters sent a letter june 8 to west 
german finance minister helmut haussmann urging parliament to pass 
the laws before the summer recess begins in late june said kohl 
aide lutz stavenhagen 
the measures would increase sentences for violations broaden 
the list of materials for which shippers must obtain government 
approval and reduce the number of countries that could receive 
sensitive exports without government approval 
stavenhagen appealed to parliament to approve the proposed 
measures despite calls by the opposition for even tighter 
restrictions 
stavenhagen said the proposed german measures were linked to 
washingtons good will regarding easing cocom export restrictions 
on certain products for eastern europe including east germany 
cocom or the coordinating committee on multilateral export 
controls agreed in paris last week to ease restrictions on what 
goods could be exported to eastern europe and the soviet union 
a us embassy official confirmed walters had sent a letter to 
haussmann but called it very straightforward and denied there 
was any suggestion of quid pro quo between the cocom decision and 
passage of the proposed new west german export laws 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
united states wanted quick passage because were hoping to be 
able to stop the proliferation of dangerous technology and 
because it feared the proposed laws could get bogged down in 
committee over opposition demands 
the two germanys are moving toward economic merger next month 
the eased cocom regulations will allow countries access to 
previously restricted products such as machine tools 
telecommunications or computer equipment that could help revitalize 
their economies

sales of north americanmade cars and trucks 
slipped 131 percent in early june mainly because there were fewer 
incentive packages in the period than during the same time last 
year automakers said wednesday 
the sales rate during june 110 last year wasnt particularly 
strong even though generous incentive packages initiated two 
months earlier had been extended this year incentives covered 
fewer cars and trucks and rebates were lower 
incentives used to reduce newvehicle inventories cut directly 
into automakers profits 
wards automotive reports a trade journal said that at the end 
of may newcar inventories among the 10 major automakers with us 
plants stood at 59 selling days considered good for this time of 
year 
the reason they are cutting back on incentives is that they 
havent overstocked the dealers said economist tom webb of the 
national automobile dealers association in mclean va 
but he said demand seemed to be softening beyond the falloff 
caused by reduced incentives 
the commerce department reported wednesday a 07 percent drop in 
retail sales in may the third straight month of decline some 
analysts interpreted the figure as an indication of sagging 
consumer confidence 
the automakers reported they sold vehicles at an average daily 
rate of 30412 during the earlyjune period this year compared 
with a rate of 34994 during the same period last year 
car sales fell a 155 percent and truck sales were off 88 
percent 
sales of the domestic cars made by general motors corp ford 
motor co and chrysler corp dropped 192 percent while sales of 
usmade cars with japanese company nameplates rose 348 percent 
the big three held 891 percent of the car market and the japanese 
transplants held 109 percent 
for the year so far domestic car and truck sales were 44 
percent behind last years pace with car sales down 56 percent 
and truck sales down 22 percent big three car sales tumbled 108 
percent compared with last year and transplant car sales were up 42 
percent 
chryslers earlyjune overall sales were 18 percent lower than 
last years car sales dropped 167 percent and sales of light 
trucks which provide much of the companys profits were off 191 
percent the companys vehicle sales so far this year declined 13 
percent from last year 
gm said its combined earlyjune car and truck sales were 167 
percent behind last years pace with car sales down 192 percent 
and sales of light trucks off 113 percent so far this year gm 
has sold 48 percent fewer vehicles than last year 
ford reported a 124percent drop in earlyjune car and truck 
sales with a 202percent decline in car sales blunted by a 
05percent increase in truck sales ford spokesman joel pitcoff 
credited sales of the companys new explorer sportutility vehicle 
as the main reason for the increase 
since jan 1 fords vehicle sales are down 88 percent

first world cheese inc with the help of the 
21 clubs chef introduced a line of fatfree lowcholesterol 
cheese wednesday described as the first of its kind to begin 
national distribution 
the small but fastgrowing firm hopes to expand on the success 
of its lowsalt and lowcholesterol cheeses sold under the pre 
monde alpine lace label 
we feel there is a small segment of the population who gave up 
cheese and dairy products due to health concerns said carl wolf 
first worlds president and chief executive officer the consumer 
is ready for this 
alpine lace lean n free cheeses will appeal to nutritionminded 
consumers keen to trim fat from their diets wolf said in remarks 
before lunch was served at the famous manhattan restaurant 
the menu featured dishes prepared with the fatfree cheese by 
the 21 clubs executive chef michael lomonaco the meal from 
the cheddar corn chowder to the cheddar stuffed peppers 
accompanying the main course drew favorable comments from diners 
however when eaten uncooked the cheeses lack the full flavor of 
their fatty cousins 
the new cheeses will be widely available in grocery stores 
around the country by july in american cheddar and mozzarella 
varieties prices will range from 189 for packages of shredded 
cheese to 499 per pound at the delicatessen counter 
the existing alpine lace brands are carried in about 30000 
retail outlets nationwide according to wolf alpine lace is the 
bestselling cheese brand at the countrys delis 
all three new varieties have about 35 calories in a oneounce 
serving they contain less than 05 gram of fat per serving 
compared with about six to nine grams in traditional cheeses a 
serving has about 5 milligrams of cholesterol vs about 20 to 30 
milligrams for regular american cheddar and mozzarella 
aly gamay who holds a doctorate in food science developed the 
fatfree cheese over years of trial and error working independently 
at a company he founded 
he told reporters that most skim milk cheeses taste like 
cardboard and thousands of his early formulations were no exception 
gamay an egyptian native who came to the united states 11 years 
ago said his wife sampled all his experiments and after thousands 
of taste tests screamed enough enough i cant take it 
anymore 
finally gamay said he arrived at a process that produced a 
tasty but lean cheese using skim milk cheese as a base the 
addition of enzymes and flavorings compensate for the absence of 
fat giving the cheese the smoothness and mouth feel that people 
expect 
gamays creation was test marketed under the cheese smart name 
in detroit charlotte nc and detroit sales were strong he 
said 
first world bought gamays cheese technology including three 
pending patents and cheese smart in may gamay said he will act as 
a consultant to first world and help develop new products 
wolf said first world eventually will bring out additional 
cheese varieties such as brie and gorgonzola in fatfree versions 
first world hopes to carve out a big slice of the growing market 
for socalled nutritional cheeses now running about 550 million a 
year at retail wolf said retail sales of these reduced calorie 
fat and cholesterol cheeses could grow to about 4 billion by the 
mid1990s 
by being the first to roll out its cheese nationally the 
maplewood njbased company has an advantage over its larger 
competitors who food industry analysts say are developing fatfree 
cheeses philip morris cos incs kraft division has been testing 
such a cheese in phoenix analysts said 
how does a food professional rate the taste and cooking 
properties of the new cheese 
chef lomonaco said it was easier to bake it into recipes than to 
broil it it worked well in soups muffins and even souffles and 
would make an excellent sauce he said 
as for taste lomonaco said its unrealistic to expect fatfree 
cheese to taste like its traditional counterpart it has its own 
unique good taste he said

gold futures prices flirted with 350 an ounce wednesday 
dropping to within 50 cents of that psychologically important level 
before rebounding to 352 the lowest daily settlement on new 
yorks commodity exchange in nearly four years 
silver futures also fell sharply in new york reflecting 
investor preference for stocks and bonds over precious metals 
analysts said 
on other commodity markets grains and soybeans retreated oil 
futures rose and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 370 to 490 lower with the contract for 
delivery in june down 370 at 352 a troy ounce the lowest

ounce the lowest silver futures price since may 19 1986 
the more actively traded july silver contract finished at 4933 
an ounce 
don tierney an analyst with the commodities brokerage stanley 
bell amp co traced golds decline to expectations that the 10 am 
edt closing gold price fix from london would come in at 350 or 
lower following heavy middle eastern selling of bullion just prior 
to the london close 
instead london dealers fixed their closing price at 35050 
which eased selling pressure in new york he said 
the magic psychological level held at least for today 
tierney said he added though that the gold market still looked 
weak from a technical standpoint 
a move below 350 an ounce probably would spark further selling 
possibly pressing golds price as low as 335 or even 320 before 
significant buying surfaces said bernard savaiko senior metals 
analyst with painewebber inc 
savaiko said strong bond and stock markets are siphoning 
investor interest away from the metals 
as long as you have strong interest in paper assets youre 
going to have gold sagging as investors forego precious metals or 
sell them he said 
in other trading corn futures fell steeply on the chicago board 
of trade amid profittaking after a government report confirmed 
perceptions of a shrinking national corn stockpile 
most other grain and soybean futures finished slightly lower 
after hovering near unchanged for most of the session

offset gains in the cash hog market

americans are increasingly worried about their 
ability to pay their longterm bills and as far as their 
pocketbooks view the 1990s with pessimism according to a survey 
to be released thursday 
especially anxious about money are the nations baby boomers 
according to the study conducted by the gallup organization for the 
atlantabased international association for financial planners 
the survey results confirmed concerns financial planners have 
seen developing over the last few years said robert a hewitt 
chairman of the iafp 
according to the survey 46 percent of the respondents expressed 
worry about their ability to meet all of their financial 
responsibilities and 52 percent said they were concerned about 
outliving their retirement savings 
but among those between the ages of 35 and 44 59 percent were 
worried about their ability to meet financial responsibilities and 
62 percent were concerned about outliving their savings the survey 
said 
eightysix percent of the all respondents said college costs 
have risen beyond the reach of most american families and 86 
percent said they believe severe inflation is likely to be a 
problem in this decade 
because of these type of concerns the survey said 61 percent 
of the overall respondents said they were less inclined to take 
financial risks than during the 1980s 
the survey conducted in april among 1058 households in a 
random sample and an additional 600 with incomes of at least 
50000 had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent 
hewitt called the 3544 age group triple squeeze boomers 
because they are increasingly having to deal with the costs of 
raising children and taking care of their aging parents as well as 
tending to their own needs 
all of a sudden they have this discretionary income and 
discover gosh im going to have to pay for college for little

john a mulheren jr took the stand at his 
securities fraud trial wednesday and denied making an illegal stock 
parking transaction with ivan boesky 
mulheren a former business associate of boesky said he balked 
when boeskys chief trader michael davidoff said boesky wanted to 
sell 330000 shares of unocal corp stock in 1985 with an agreement 
to buy it back at a later date 
mulheren said he told davidoff you can stop right there i 
dont do those trades 
mulheren also described his first meeting with boesky in 1976 at 
a dinner at an expensive manhattan restaurant dinner which had 
been arranged by stock speculator sandy lewis he said boesky 
ordered six to eight entrees and decided which one to eat after 
they arrived at the table 
he seemed like someone out of a movie mulheren said he 
seemed to be very smart a little outlandish 
boesky once one of wall streets most powerful stock 
speculators paid 100 million in penalties and pleaded guilty to 
one felony to settle wall streets biggest insider trading case 
ever in exchange he gave government investigators incriminating 
information about a number of his associates 
mulheren 40 is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy 
securities fraud mail fraud and recordkeeping violations 
involving his friendship with boesky 
he is accused of scheming with boesky to manipulate the stock 
price of gulf amp western inc and concealing the ownership of other 
stocks including unocal to help boesky cheat on his taxes and 
evade federal securities laws 
mulheren said he bought the unocal shares after his discussion 
with davidoff and sold them on the open market at a loss about 
three weeks later 
he said he had never agreed to sell the securities back to 
boesky or davidoff his account of the transaction contradicts 
previous testimony by key prosecution witnesses including boesky 
and davidoff 
mulheren who was known as a daring trader who wore jeans to the 
office carried over his casual style to the witness stand he wore 
an opennecked shirt sports pants and topsiders with no socks and 
often answered questions by his attorney thomas puccio by saying 
yeah 
puccio also elicited from mulheren that he has been diagnosed as 
manicdepressive and has taken the prescribed drug lithium as 
treatment 
prosecutors objected to the testimony but us district judge 
miriam cedarbaum allowed it as long as puccio did not use it to 
argue that the illness may have affected mulherens judgement 
in february 1988 police arrested mulheren leaving his rumson 
nj mansion with a loaded assault rifle according to court 
documents mulheren intended to shoot boesky because of his 
cooperation with prosecutors 
mulherens doctors later said the episode happened because 
mulheren had stopped taking lithium new jersey authorities dropped 
weapons possession charges in exchange for three years of probation 
mulheren was expected to continue his testimony thursday

raising a new red flag over californias 
thrift industry homefed bank said its bad loans and foreclosed 
properties rose by 81 million in may 
homefed reported similar news in april and on tuesday it said 
more problems are likely in coming months mainly because of 
outofstate loans 
homefed is the chief subsidiary of san diegobased homefed corp 
and californias seventhbiggest thrift 
nonperforming assets now total 579 million or 31 percent of 
its 18 billion in assets bad loans rose 72 million to 315 
million in may foreclosed real estate by 9 million to 264 
million 
homefed reported a 44 million increase in nonperforming assets 
in april mainly because of loans on a florida apartment complex 
robert f adelizzi homefeds chief executive said the biggest 
problem in may was a default on 54 million in loans on california 
commercial property the loans to an individual adelizzi declined 
to name already had been restructured he said 
it is not indicative of any weakness in the california 
economy although its pretty clear that certain portions of 
commercial market are problems in california as well as 
nationwide adelizzi said in a telephone interview 
in spite of the states strong economy californias sampls have 
racked up some big losses in the past few years with outofstate 
lending and junk bonds at the top of the list of bad investments 
adelizzi said homefed had been making headway in paring its 
level of bad loans and foreclosures which peaked at 592 million 
in september 1989 
but the last two months results combined with weakness in 
commercial markets nationwide and apartment markets outside 
california have tainted the outlook he said 
it is probable that the level of nonperforming assets will 
increase further in june and our goal of reducing these assets 
below 400 million by yearend 1990 will be extremely difficult to 
achieve adelizzi said 
all big loans at homefed are under a special review he 
suggested there may be more problems particularly with 
outofstate loans saying another 140 million in loans are 30 
days or more overdue loans are classified as nonaccrual or bad 
when they are 90 days overdue 
campbell chaney a thrift analyst with sutro amp co in san 
francisco said the disclosures raise questions about all of 
californias banks and sampls particularly those with out of state 
loans 
i think what it tells me is that california is not infallible 
despite what people say about how well its economy is doing and its 
insulation chaney said

the former owner of vernon savings amp loan accused 
of illegally using bank funds to raise money for jim wright was 
indicted wednesday on bank fraud charges in the collapse of his 
thrift three years ago 
a 38count indictment was handed up by a federal grand jury 
accusing don dixon of conspiracy misapplication of funds making 
false statements and false entries and interstate travel in aid of 
racketeering 
five other former officials of the defunct thrift have pleaded 
guilty to various crimes former president patrick g king and 
former chairman woody f lemons have been sentenced to prison for 
their part in the thrifts collapse which cost the government 13 
billion authorities said 
government attorneys have pointed to the thrifts collapse as a 
prime example of abuse in the savings and loan industry 
wednesdays indictment is the most significant case developed by 
savings and loans investigators in the dallas area said us 
attorney general dick thornburgh 
these complicated whitecollar crime cases take time to 
develop but the justice department is committed to the 
investigation prosecution and incarceration of those who ripped 
off our financial institutions and have left the taxpayers of the 
united states holding the bag thornburgh said in a statement 
us attorney marvin collins said the 3 years it took to indict 
dixon is typical for savings and loans cases 
dixon is scheduled to surrender himself to federal authorities 
on thursday collins said 
the indictment alleges that dixon conspired with other vernon 
officials to use savings and loan funds to make illegal political 
contributions to 13 candidates including wright the former house 
speaker and texas democrat and thenrep jack kemp rny 
the indictment said dixon encouraged employees to make political 
contributions and then reimbursed them with expense money or phony 
bonuses prosecutors have said the candidates did not know the 
contributions were illegal 
wright was not named as a defendant in the indictment an 
administrative assistant in fort worth said wright was unavailable 
for comment 
dixon also misapplied funds for pleasure trips for vernon 
officials the indictment said 
if convicted of all the charges dixon faces 190 years in prison 
and a fine of up to 95 million dollars his attorney william 
ravkind did not immediately return a phone call to the associated 
press on wednesday 
former thrift executive vice president patrick malone testified 
in kings 1989 trial that he solicited contributions from king and 
other top thrift executives for the 1986 gubernatorial primary 
campaign of former rep tom loeffler rtexas and the reelection 
bids of wright who resigned after a house ethics committee 
investigation kemp now secretary of housing and urban 
development sen jake garn rutah and sen alan cranston 
dcalif 
dixon threw parties for other sampl operators aboard his yacht 
high spirits when it was docked on the potomac river in 
washington to raise money for the democratic congressional campaign 
committee chaired by thenrep tony coehlo dcalif 
at coehlos request wright intervened with federal thrift 
regulators to determine if there were any plans to shut down vernon 
savings and loan according to a report to the house ethics 
committee by the outside counsel hired to investigate wright 
in december 1986 coehlo told an aide to wright john mack that 
regulators were going to shut down vernon and asked if the speaker 
could get the thrift a grace period according to the report by 
richard j phelan the ethics panels outside counsel 
phelan reported that wright telephoned edwin gray the chairman 
of the federal home loan bank board and asked if vernon were going 
to be shut down 
gray told wright he did not know but later told mack that the 
bank board would seek to merge it with another financial 
institution according to phelans report 
wright told the ethics panel he did not know dixon but phelans 
investigation produced a picture of wright and dixon aboard the 
yacht the photograph bore the inscription my best personal 
regards jim wright 
phelan concluded that it is clear that wright was willing to 
intervene on dixons behalf without even performing a rudimentary 
investigation of dixons dispute with the bank board or the 
legitimacy of his request 
the ethics panel overruled phelans recommendation that it 
discipline wright over the episode 
dixon was the lead defendant in a 540 million federal fraud 
lawsuit brought after the vernon shutdown but had never faced 
criminal charges in the case until wednesday 
the lawsuit alleged that dixon and other thrift officers 
fraudulently caused vernon to grossly overstate its profits and net 
worth in order to pay 221 million in illegal dividends to dondi 
financial corp a holding company headed by dixon 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp lawsuit said top 
officials began to loot vernon for their personal financial 
benefit and defraud its depositors creditors and the fslic 
under dixon who moved the thrift to dallas from its home in the 
north texas town of vernon vernon assets grew tenfold until 1987 
when federal regulators shut it down 
when regulators seized vernon they found it owned 17th century 
castle doors various expensive art objects and even a 
silverstudded saddle purchased by dixon on various shopping trips

the securities and exchange commission wants 
to know if the laws governing mutual funds and other investment 
companies should be overhauled and if so how 
the sec which regulates stocks bonds and the exchanges that 
trade in them voted unanimously wednesday to seek public comment 
on updating regulation of investment companies 
the last significant amendments to those regulations were made 
in 1970 
investment companies manage pooled funds of small investors 
money for a fee some like mutual funds are openended investors 
can buy into or sell out of these funds when they wish and 
depending on those investment flows the funds managers buy or 
sell stocks and bonds 
others are closedend funds such as investment trusts these 
funds have an investment pool of a fixed size and issue shares 
backed by that pool that can be traded like a corporations 
the commission voted to ask for public comment on several topics 
including the internationalization of the securities markets 
distribution of openend companies closedend funds and 
repurchases of shares it also asks the public to put in its own 
two cents about what changes should be made 
in other matters the sec voted to seek public comment on 
proposed rules that would 
close a loophole in the investment company act of 1940 and 
require investment companies dealing in foreign securities to 
either maintain records in english or at least in the united states 
allow investment companies to save time and money by sending 
out summary prospectuses initially to investors who would then 
request the entire prospectus often numbering a hundred or more 
pages if they were interested

and set aside 673000 acres as a protected area in alaskas huge 
tongass national forest 
the bill would modify two longterm harvesting contracts to 
protect old growth timber and end a 40 million annual incentive to 
high levels of harvesting 
the unanimous vote came after senators set aside a disputed 
amendment that would have required the us forest service to trade 
mining rights in the greens creek area of admiralty island in 
southeastern alaska 
the exchange with the nativealaskan owned sealaska corp would 
have given the government other mining rights and land including 
the last 6000 acres of oldgrowth timber on admiralty island 
under an agreement worked out among senators the secretary of 
agriculture will try to speed up negotiations on a voluntary land 
and miningrights trade also the senate energy and commerce 
committee will hold hearings beginning june 28 to find out if the 
items to be traded are of comparable value 
backers say the overall bill is necessary to protect the 
167millionacre forest which is larger than west virginia the 
forest is one of the few remaining temperate rain forests in the 
world 
the oldgrowth portions host large concentrations of bald eagles 
and grizzly bears the forest also is home to valuable salmon 
spawning grounds 
critics said changes will cost jobs in the timberdependent 
local economy but they say they prefer the senate version to the 
stricter version adopted by the house almost a year ago 
alaska gov steve cowper said wednesday the senate bill was a 
balanced solution and described himself as especially pleased 
with a provision for nologging buffer strips along fishbearing 
streams 
this is a national forest not a national park said sen 
ted stevens ralaska when debate began tuesday people live and 
work in this forest and a good number of them almost 3400 people 
make their living solely from cutting and processing the trees that 
are harvested in the tongass 
their interests should be balanced against the desire to leave 
this forest uncut 
wednesdays debate centered on an amendment by sen jake garn 
rutah to give sealaska owned by descendants of alaskas original 
inhabitants mining rights to 18000 acres at greens creek 
in exchange the forest service would have received mining 
rights to 10000 acres on admiralty along with 1860 acres of 
surface lands and 10 percent of sealaskas income from the mining 
venture 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio tried to block the amendment 
saying the government might be giving away rights to land rich in 
silver gold lead and zinc he said the real beneficiaries would 
be mining companies such as kennecott in garns home state which 
run a successful mine for sealaska within greens creek 
metzenbaum called the 18000 acres the donut around a highly 
profitable hole the existing mine 
lets not tie up tongass reform with this giveaway 
metzenbaum said 
an amendment on the exchange will be taken up again when house 
and senate negotiators work on a compromise 
the bill would leave 14 million acres or about 8 percent of the 
total forest available for logging rather than the current 17 
million acres about 10 percent 
the house bill would cancel rather than modify the 50year 
contracts the government has with alaska pulp co and louisiana 
pacificketchikan 
critics say the two companies have monopolized timber and 
violated antitrust and labor laws they say canceling the 50year 
sweetheart deals would open the area to competition from other 
firms 
the senate bill would 
delete a 40 million appropriation for roadbuilding and other 
timber sale preparation activities 
end the requirement that the forest service provide for sale 
45 billion board feet of tongass timber each decade instead the 
service would be obligated to seek to meet market demand for 
timber 
protect hundreds of thousands of more acres of land from 
logging including buffer zones along streams

sorting out responsibility and liability for 
the oil tanker explosion off the texas coast illustrates the 
problems of policing a global industry 
the norwegian owned and registered mega borg was staffed by 
indians and chartered by a french oil company to carry crude from 
angola to the united states for processing 
the series of explosions that ripped the 886foot tanker early 
saturday focused attention on us legislation to improve oil 
tanker safety which has bogged down in a housesenate conference 
committee the accident occurred as some of the mega borgs cargo 
was being loaded onto another tanker in the gulf of mexico 
but even if the pending oil tanker legislation became law it 
might not have any effect on accidents like that on board the mega 
borg though the tanker is sitting less than 60 miles off the coast 
of texas it is in international waters 
that means the borgs norwegian owners may not be legally held 
liable for any damage to the us coastline lawsuits over such 
liability and how far a countrys jurisdiction extends sometimes 
get held up for years suits over the 1979 amoco cadiz spill off 
the french coast are still mired in courts 
the us legislation crafted after last years exxon valdez 
accident in alaska includes a provision requiring us tankers to 
have double hulls to prevent spills but some house factions want 
to exempt the huge tankers that unload cargo offshore onto smaller 
vessels a procedure used at nearly every us oil port 
also any us legislation will be effective only in the united 
states and its waters unlike the airline industry which is 
subject to regulations recognized around the world the shipping 
business isnt scrutinized by central government agencies 
the shipping industry in general is not many peoples top 
priority in terms of capitol hill and other places said paul 
henning a spokesman for omi corp an independent tanker owner in 
new york its difficult to get attention focused on issues at 
times because of that 
as the fire raged on the mega borg monday one of the worlds 
oil giants royal dutch shell group announced that it would use 
only one louisiana port for all the crude oil it ships to the 
united states in tankers it owns 
the louisiana offsore oil port an offshore terminal known as 
the loop is the oil terminal in the lower 48 states capable of 
handling very large crude carriers 
at other oil ports supertanker cargoes must be transferred to 
smaller ships the process that was underway when the mega borg 
exploded but at the louisiana facility big tankers can unload 
without ever coming ashore 
shell said it took the action because of the liability risks 
the exxon valdez made it clear what happens when you have a spill 
and the enormous liabilities you can face said norm altstedter 
a spokesman in new york for the anglodutch conglomerate 
following the alaska spill the nations worst exxon was 
indicted in february on five federal charges they included 
violating the port and waterways safety act the dangerous cargo 
act the clean water act and the migratory bird treaty act and 
illegally discharging oil 
prosecutors said they would seek at least 700 million in 
penalties from exxon under a law that allows recovery of twice the 
amount of proven losses 
though other oil companies are studying shells decision the 
initial impact appears to be negligible the new policy does not 
include any shipments by shell oil co the groups us 
subsidiary or cargoes carried by tankers that royal dutch shell 
charters from other companies about 75 percent of its shipments 
to the united states 
exxon corp which has been under fire for the valdez accident 
has no current plans to restrict the movements of its tankers 
spokesman bill smith said 
elf aquitaine petroleum co the french company that had 
chartered the mega borg is considering adopting a policy similar 
to shells said a spokesman in houston who asked not to be 
identified further 
some shipping insiders said they believed the shell move was an 
attempt to pressure congress which is considering the use of 
international agreements to determine liability in a spill 
those agreements which have not been ratified by the united 
states provide up to 260 million from an international 
compensation fund to clean up a spill according to house backers 
of the measure 
the us has not yet ratified the international conventions 
which limit liability said altstedter the shell spokesman 
and theres no limitation on liability 
top transportation department officials the head of the coast 
guard and members of congress from texas urged congress to 
subscribe to the international limits which is a chief point of 
disagreement between the two houses over the pending legislation 
the house wants the limits the senate version of the bill would 
let state law govern such situations 
the house and the senate have to reach agreement on this 
legislation and this nation is exposed until that is done said 
transportation secretary samual skinner 
the commandant of the coast guard rear adm william kime said 
the united states dodged the bullet in the texas accident 
because the owners of the mega borg were cooperating in the cleanup 
and the investigation

the bush administration has decided not to 
impose economic sanctions against india for its barriers to 
american investment and sales by us insurance companies an 
administration official said wednesday 
the official speaking on condition that he not be named said 
the decision had been made to continue pressing for removal of the 
barriers as part of global freetrade talks rather than imposing 
economic retaliation now 
us trade representative carla hills met with indias new 
ambassador to washington abid hussain on wednesday to inform him 
of the action sources said 
the administration was facing a deadline of deciding by june 16 
whether to boost tariffs on imports from india into the united 
states or take some other form of trade retaliation because of 
indias refusal to negotiate over the issue 
the case against india involves that countrys barriers to 
foreign investment and its refusal to allow american insurance 
companies to do business in the country 
india was one of three countries placed on a trade hit list 
last year by the bush administration for erecting the most 
offensive trade barriers against american products 
the other two countries japan and brazil both negotiated on 
the issues which landed them on the list and reached agreements 
with the united states to remove the offending barriers 
however india has refused to negotiate under threat of us 
sanctions which are provided by a section of the 1988 trade law 
known as super 301 
while the decision removes the possibility of economic 
retaliation for this year the administration has already announced 
that it was naming india for its offending trade barriers under a 
second round of the super 301 process that will not conclude until 
june 1991 
that decision announced on april 27 triggered an avalanche of 
criticism in congress because of the administrations refusal to 
cite japan once again 
the administration contended that japan had negotiated in good 
faith to remove barriers to sales of american satellites super 
computers and wood products in japan 
the administration also pledged to press forward with separate 
discussions on broadranging structural trade barriers with japan 
however there have been complaints in recent days that the 
talks with japan on structural impediments to trade had bogged 
down a final report on these talks is scheduled to be issued in 
july 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
accused japan on tuesday of stonewalling on the trade issue and 
warned that his committee which has jurisdiction over trade 
matters wold insist that more be done 
sens max baucus dmont bob packwood roregon and john 
danforth rmo were even more blunt writing a letter to hills 
warning that congress may have no choice but to respond with 
retaliatory legislation if japan is not more forthcoming 
the structural barriers talks are focusing on such various ways 
the japanese can make their economy more receptive to imports as 
well as ways the united states can dampen its appetite for foreign 
products
