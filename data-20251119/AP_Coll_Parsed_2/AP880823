in a ruling that could expand the duty of 
police to protect individuals a federal appeals court tuesday 
reinstated a suit by a woman who said officers derided her 
complaints about her husbands violence and failed to help her 
although police normally cannot be held liable for injuries to 
crime victims the 9th us circuit court of appeals said a 
special relationship may be created when a victim gets a 
restraining order against another person and repeatedly tells 
police of continuing threats 
restraining orders which generally forbid a person to approach 
contact or harass another person have become common in domestic 
violence cases 
in this case the restraining order may have been an 
affirmative state commitment to protect the woman from her 
husbands harassment said judge betty fletcher in the 21 
decision 
judge mary schroder concurred with fletcher in the decision 
in dissent us district judge laughlin waters said the 
existence of a restraining order created no legal right to police 
protection at least without proof that the order had been 
violated he also asked whether the court was telling police that a 
person with a restraining order was entitled to preferred status 
in terms of police response 
todd roberts a lawyer for police in the san mateo county 
community declined comment on the ruling 
the woman jena balistreri said in her suit that she was 
severely beaten by her husband in 1982 she said police removed her 
husband from the home in pacifica a suburb of san francisco but 
refused to arrest him did not offer medical help and were rude and 
unsympathetic to her complaint she quoted one officer as saying he 
didnt blame her husband because of the way she was carrying on 
the court quoted ms balistreri as saying she told police 
throughout 1982 about vandalism and hundreds of harassing phone 
calls and named her nowdivorced husband as the suspect 
she got a restraining order in late 1982 prohibiting her 
exhusband from contacting or harassing her in the following 
months she said he crashed his car into her garage and a firebomb 
was thrown through her window police refused to arrest her 
exhusband and suggested after the firebombing that she move or 
hire a private investigator she said 
she said police responded to her telephone complaints with 
ridicule and refused to investigate a series of harassing phone 
calls she got between 1983 and 1985 
ms balistreris suit against the pacifica police and chief al 
olsen said the failure of police to protect her violated her rights 
to due process and equal protection of the law and contributed to 
her physical injuries bleeding ulcer and emotional distress 
us district judge samuel conti dismissed the suit saying 
police had not violated her rights even if everything she said was 
true but the appeals court disagreed and reinstated the suit

sharp differences between allies and foes 
of syria lebanons main power broker over the election of a new 
president threaten to rekindle this countrys bloody 13year war 
between moslems and christians 
lebanons fate is at stake parliamentary deputy joseph 
skaff a christian said this week 
parliamentary deputies representing the 80 percent of lebanon 
controlled by syria and its moslem militia allies want a president 
willing to crush syrias main foe the rightwing lebanese forces 
the lebanese forces is the christians main militia it has 
links with israel and is blocking reelection of former president 
suleiman franjieh a christian branded by political rivals as 
syrias candidate 
franjieh 78 governed from 1970 to 1976 he is the frontrunner 
in a lackluster field of candidates that includes dany chamoun son 
of the late camille chamoun another former president 
behind the friction lie old hatreds 
franjieh holds lebanese forces leader samir geagea responsible 
for killing his son tony tonys wife and 3yearold daughter along 
with 30 others in a raid on the familys summer mansion in june 
1978 
geagea opposes syrias strategy of seeking political reforms 
that would give moslems equal power with the christians who have 
dominated the government judiciary and army since independence 
from france in 1943 
back then the christians were considered the majority 
now moslems comprise about 55 percent of lebanons 4 million 
people and christians make up 45 percent 
last month just 38 of the 76 members of parliament attended a 
session to elect a new president far short of the quorum needed 
all but two of the deputies who turned up were moslems they 
accused the lebanese forces of physically preventing christian 
deputies from attending no date for a new session has been set 
there have been no parliamentary elections in lebanon since 
1972 the 99seat house has simply renewed its mandate every two 
years 
the lebanese forces pledged there will be no quorum so long 
as franjieh is a candidate but the syrians declared they still 
back franjieh 
syrias staunch support for franjieh against local regional 
and international powers is a very risky move that could plunge 
lebanon into allout violence a foreign diplomat said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
a moslem politician who asked not to be identified said if 
the spirit of challenge persists we might not have a president by 
sept 23 
thats when the sixyear term of the incumbent president 
maronite catholic amin gemayel expires under constitutional 
rules gemayel 46 cannot run again for a consecutive second term 
the politician noted franjieh whether candidate or 
president means war if elected hell launch war on the lebanese 
forces and if not elected hell launch war on them 
after more than a decade of war and the fragmentation of lebanon 
into a cluster of sectarian cantons gemayels authority is limited 
to his own stronghold in the metn mountains 
the lebanese forces control the rest of the shrunken christian 
enclave 
syria and its moslem allies have boycotted gemayel for 2 years 
since he torpedoed a syrianbrokered peace accord under which the 
christians would surrender some of their power 
despite their differences most lebanese factions believe a 
constitutional vacuum will be disastrous 
under an unwritten national covenant dating back to 
independence the president has to be a maronite the prime 
minister a sunni moslem and the house speaker a shiite moslem 
beiruts independent annahar daily said gemayel would form an 
interim government headed by a maronite prime minister if a 
president is not elected before sept 23 
the 1943 covenant allows a maronite to be named prime minister 
if the presidential post is vacant 
but 10 syrianbacked leftist and moslem factions warned they 
will prevent such a government from running the country 
outside of franjieh a warlord whose private army controls north 
lebanon none of the other halfdozen christian contenders is 
considered to have much of a chance 
the syrians angered by last weeks parliamentary fiasco have 
accused the americans of seeking to sabotage franjiehs election 
us assistant secretary of state richard murphy asked about 
parliaments failure to achieve a quorum said in new york when 
theres a better understanding among the deputies as to likely 
consensus candidates im sure a quorum will be arranged 
but with lebanon sliding ever deeper into political limbo with 
both sides digging in the prospects of that look slim

after 19 years of painstaking effort workers 
are only now making headway in repairing the damage caused when an 
australian sheep shearer set fire to al aqsa mosque one of islams 
holiest monuments 
precarious wooden scaffolding towers into the dome laborers are 
still cleaning fireblackened stone behind the pulpit while skilled 
craftsmen are carefully reconstructing mosaic panels with 
inscriptions from the koran islams holy book 
isam awad the palestinian engineer in charge of the project 
blames lost skills and modern politics for the slowness of the work 
the fire damaged some of the oldest parts of the mosque 
suddenly we had to work with gypsum mosaics stucco and lead all 
these were lost skills and we had to find people who knew and 
relearn them said awad who supervises a team of 40 workers 
al aqsa which marks the place where the prophet mohammed 
ascended to heaven to receive the word of god was built in the 7th 
century after the caliph omar conquered jerusalem it is considered 
islams third holiest site after mecca and medina 
the 36acre site known in arabic as the haram al sharif noble 
enclosure was originally the site of the jewish temple built by 
king herod and destroyed by the roman tenth legion in 70 ad 
awad said the renovations for the mosque and the nearby dome of 
the rock have been slowed by the arabisraeli conflict we have 
to be careful because of politics 
awad added that the recent decision of jordans king hussein to 
sever ties with the west bank put question marks on whether money 
would still be available for the restoration he said more than 
15 million had been spent so far on fixing damage from the fire 
awad said repeated strikes and boycotts by palestinians 
protesting israeli occupation on the west bank made it impossible 
to complete the change from the mosques goldtinted aluminum dome 
to a new a reddishhued copper top before rains start in september 
perhaps the greatest loss in the fire which took hours to put 
out was a carved wooden mindab or pulpit presented to the 
mosque by saladin the moslem warrior who defeated the christian 
crusaders in the 11th century ad 
replacing the pulpit requires special woodworking skills 
unavailable locally a number of countries are vying for the honor 
of carrying out the work but choosing one country over the other 
is proving to be a delicate political exercise 
officials of the waqf the jordanianfunded moslem trust that 
oversees the al aqsa complex said turkey or egypt would probably 
be awarded the job of reconstructing the pulpit 
on april 21 1969 moslem guards spotted flames coming from al 
aqsa the fire burned out of control for hours with flames reaching 
the windows just below the dome 
israeli authorities arrested michael denis william rohen a tall 
blond sheepshearer from sydney australia who belonged to the 
protestant church of god sect he was judged insane and deported to 
australia 
hassan tahboub a member of the moslem supreme council in 
jerusalem questions whether the act was the work of a deranged 
individual 
he said moslem investigators believed a group may have been 
involved because rohen called london the night before the attack 
and may have received instructions but tahboub added we refused 
to give evidence to the israelis because we considered the court to 
be illegal 
much of the fire damage has now been repaired including about 
75 feet of fatamidstyle mosaics 750 square feet of gypsum 
moldings 30 new stain glass windows and new marble columns 
the most painstaking work is being done by adel jabari 38 who 
said it took two months to place the 20000 pieces of glass and 
stone in each square meter 076 square feet of mosaic 
some of his work represents new designs inspired by jabaris 
stay in italy where he was sent to study restoration methods and 
became enthused with the sistine chapel in rome 
i was inspired by the spirit of michelangelo said jabari 
cleaning fireblackened stone and mosaic panels behind the 
pulpit restoring some decorations in the al aqsa domes interior 
and building a new pulpit remain to be done 
awad declines to predict when work will be complete noting the 
mission has expanded to include other repairs needed because of age 
and neglect 
it is a lifetime job he said

they plunder etruscan tombs in the dead 
of night loot ancient greek statues from archaeological digs and 
steal priceless works from museums and churches 
officials say thieves and tombaroli grave robbers are 
sacking italys art treasures at the rate of 130 objects a day 
experts say theres little that can be done to stop it 
only a fraction of the artworks are recovered and some of the 
most valuable wind up in the united states 
for example a 5th century bc greek statue now on display at 
the j paul getty museum in malibu calif was allegedly stolen in 
italy 
italian authorities say the case of the 7foot getty statue 
allegedly taken from an illegal excavation in sicily is just one 
slice of a thriving multimillion dollar business involving 
thievesforhire shady middlemen and wealthy collectors 
according to figures compiled by a special carabinieri arttheft 
squad 1466 robberies involving the loss of 23128 art objects 
were reported in the first half of 1988 about half of the thefts 
were from churches which generally have little security 
authorities recovered 8469 stolen objects and made 417 arrests 
during the six months 
the figures do not include artifacts illegally unearthed in 
places such as cerveteri 30 miles north of rome site of one of 
the most important etruscan cemeteries in italy 
the situation in cerveteri is dramatic and catastrophic 
said archaeologist daniela rizzo who monitors the problem in 
etruria the region north of rome where the etruscan civilization 
thrived from the 8th century to 4th century bc 
cerveteri was at the center of one of the biggest art scandals 
in decades a 6th century bc terracotta vase by the greek artist 
euphronius known as the calyx krater was bought in 1972 by new 
yorks metropolitan museum where it remains italian authorities 
want the vase back claiming it was removed from cerveteri in 1971 
illegally sold and smuggled to the united states 
the 670acre cerveteri cemetery like the tombs in nearby 
tarquinia and vulci is a prime hunting ground for tombaroli they 
locate unexcavated tombs during the day using long pointed rods to 
probe the earth and return at night to dig up pots vases and 
tombs 
the damage is incalculable said ms rizzo flipping through 
a stack of reports on recent illegal excavations in the area 
its not just the loss of the items but the damage to the tomb 
itself that is devastating 
italian police now use helicopters and mounted patrols to watch 
archaeological zones and motorboats help track undersea treasure 
hunters 
its difficult to stop these illegal excavations because all 
of italy is covered by archaeological sites many of these are in 
isolated areas where it is impossible to maintain surveillance 
said a senior carabinieri investigator speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
in tarquinia and vulci the government has posted hired guards 
since october 1987 when floods uncovered unexcavated tombs in 
april four tombaroli in tarquinia were caught and arrested after a 
chase through the cemetery 
its possible to put a brake on the tomb robberies but its 
impossible to stop it said paola pelagatti the archaeological 
superintendent for southern etruria we need more means money 
and personnel 
tombaroli are only one part of a sophisticated network many 
artworks are stolen on commission to meet orders from rich 
collectors in italy and abroad 
ms rizzo said many stolen etruscan artifacts are smuggled into 
neighboring switzerland where it is easy to obtain papers showing 
legal ownership many pieces then are brought back into italy 
winding up in romes antique shops 
tombaroli are also active in southern italy and sicily italian 
authorities suspect an illegal dig in morgantina sicily in 1979 
yielded the magnificent greek statue that recently went on display 
at the getty museum an italian magistrate and interpol are 
investigating the origin of the statue believed to be of the 
goddess aphrodite and valued at 20 million 
getty said it checked with the italian government before 
displaying the work which it said it received on loan from a 
private collector 
some people in italy after seeing pictures of the getty statue 
have questioned its authenticity but no one in italy has 
determined it is a fake 
ms rizzo believes one way to stop the plunder would be to 
create a legal open market for trade in archaeological objects 
this would reduce the activity of the grave robbers she 
said but right now what we need is more cooperation from abroad 
especially from those countries who dont have the ancient history 
of italy and tend to accept the material legal or illegal

jose sanchezs vocal 15pound rooster won a court victory when the 
owner was convicted of illegally harboring the animal in a 
residential area 
sanchez may now find himself in jail because of the pet rhode 
island red rooster named travis who ruffled too many feathers with 
his predawn wakeup calls in the tranquil neighborhood 35 miles east 
of los angeles 
sanchez 26 who fought the city over its antirooster law for 
two years was convicted monday on four misdemeanor counts he could 
be ordered to serve six months in jail and pay a 1000 fine for 
each count 
sentencing is scheduled sept 23 
deputy city attorney frank rhemrev said he doubts the maximum 
sentence will be assessed 
can you believe it i might end up in county jail with 
burglars and thieves and ill be there because of a chicken 
sanchez said before mondays decision 
many people have told sanchez he shouldnt risk going up the 
river for a rooster but he remained adamant 
you can get warm and cuddly about a rooster just like you can 
about a cat or a dog sanchez said travis is real friendly 
hes a companion just like any other pet 
he just happens to be a chicken he said of the 7yearold 
bird 
rhemrev said neighbors began complaining about the rooster calls 
in 1986 
sanchez said he thinks the 1984 law banning roosters but not 
hens is wrong and vowed to go all the way for his bird even 
if it means jail 
the pet owner said because travis was 3 years old and living in 
his backyard when the law was passed the rooster should be the 
beneficiary of a grandfather clause

the use of a properly trained police dog to 
seize a felony suspect does not constitute deadly force under the 
law a federal appeals court ruled monday 
a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
unanimously upheld a lower courts ruling in favor of the 
nashville tenn metropolitan government in the july 1984 death of 
a man suspected of robbing a business who died after he was bitten 
in the neck by a police dog 
nashville police investigator ronnie barnes said he released his 
police dog casey into the building after twice calling out to warn 
suspect daniel briggs to surrender or face the dog 
barnes said he found briggs neck in the dogs mouth briggs did 
not move and was later pronounced dead on arrival at a nashville 
hospital police said 
dorothy robinette administrator of briggs estate sued barnes 
the metropolitan nashville government and police chief joe casey 
charging that use of the police dog amounted to unnecessary deadly 
force in violation of briggs constitutional rights 
us district judge thomas wiseman of nashville dismissed her 
lawsuit and ruled in nashvilles favor leading to the appeal 
barnes and his police dog were trained according to national 
standards established by the us police canine association and 
have participated in periodic retraining programs since january 
1984 nashville police said

one man one vote one vice presidential 
candidate and george bush has chosen himself a problem a 
distraction from the themes of his republican campaign for the 
white house 
it may be unfair it may be as bush supporters contend a 
creation of the news media but the dan quayle issue is undeniably 
a campaign detour just when the republicans wanted to build on the 
sendoff of their national convention pageantry 
thats a problem for bush and his strategists and for sen 
quayle who can hardly be enjoying his new line of work very much 
it has brought him denunciations and ridicule he is in fact an 
intelligent man who works diligently if selectively on his 
legislative issues he got less than a day to celebrate his sudden 
leap from junior senator to vice presidential nominee then the 
nagging persistent questions about his military service and now 
his educational record emerged to divert the gop running mates from 
their chosen agenda 
instead of taking the offense coming out of new orleans bush 
and quayle find themselves snarled in a damage control operation 
the question is whether and when it will end 
according to a friend of the vice president one who watched him 
make his vice presidential selection bush chose quayle on his own 
with minimal input from his advisers 
james a baker iii who resigned as secretary of the treasury to 
run the bush campaign was said to have been opposed to the 
selection of quayle before it was announced he has since been a 
loyal supporter although hardly a cheerleader 
quayle 41 was supposed to be the fresh face the man who would 
symbolize the republican future a young conservative with no 
political baggage he was picked to offer a positive comparison to 
the democratic nominee sen lloyd bentsen of texas 67 who has 
his own political scars notably the admitted blunder of setting up 
a highpriced breakfast club at which lobbyistdonors would dine 
with the chairman of the senate finance committee bentsen called 
that off after his fundraising plan was disclosed 
his refunds and apology quashed the issue by the time gov 
michael dukakis the democratic presidential nominee picked him 
for the ticket it was history 
not so with quayle who was fresh new business in new orleans 
when he began by fumbling early questions about the way he got into 
the indiana national guard in 1969 his student deferment was 
expiring and the guard was a soughtafter alternative to the draft 
and the likelihood of duty in the vietnam war the question still 
pending is whether the influence of his newspaperowning family got 
him a guard slot or whether as quayle insists the unit he joined 
was seeking recruits for vacancies 
quayle joined the guard when his student deferment was about to 
lapse with his graduation from college 
dukakis was draftdeferred as a student during the korean war 
he volunteered for the draft prior to his graduation in 1955 and 
served just under two years in the army 
he said the quayle matter would be an election issue how we 
make our decisions how we make the presidential selections who we 
select whether or not that person should be a heartbeat away 
from the presidency obviously will be an issue he said 
bush said the matter should subside after all not many people 
vote on the basis of vice presidential nominations the contest is 
between two men the presidential nominees 
after a weekend of campaigning defensively with bush quayle 
went back to washington for some basic training on national 
politics bush said his running mate had to get his staff schedule 
and personal affairs organized this hit him out of a clear blue 
sky bush said 
thats part of the problem 
a system that subjects presidential candidates to almost 
inhumane scrutiny doesnt do a thing to check out the vice 
presidential nominees one man the nominee gets to pick the vice 
presidential half of the ticket by fiat 
to compound the problem presidential candidates act as though 
choosing a running mate is a piece of business that has to be left 
for the last minute 
bush has known since late last winter when his presidential 
nomination was assured that he would need a running mate he even 
knew the deadline aug 18 
there was time for a careful thorough search of the field and 
for close scrutiny of the people in that field that kind of search 
might have led bush to the same conclusion dan quayle but he 
would have known the man and the record the time and the resources 
were there to avoid unpleasant surprises for bush and for quayle 
who obviously didnt see anything like this in his two campaigns 
for the house and two for the senate 
then too its just possible that in the case of the vice 
presidency the choice shouldnt be one vote by one man 
despite the oftenrepeated fact that no incumbent vice president 
since martin van buren in 1836 has been elected president being 
no 2 is a very good way to become no 1 thirteen of the 43 men 
who have served as vice president eventually have become president 
those are better white house odds than youll get in any other 
line of work

republican leaders are trying to dismiss the 
flap over vice presidential nominee dan quayle as much ado about 
nothing but many also are questioning whether george bush made 
the best possible choice for a running mate 
i think quayle should assess and if he feels like hes hurting 
the ticket he ought to be man enough to step aside tommy 
thomas chairman of the bush steering committee in florida said 
monday 
this thing has to be over before labor day one way or the 
other said thomas who joined the marines in world war ii on his 
17th birthday 
when gov thomas kean of new jersey was asked if he had any 
reservations about quayle as a potential president he replied i 
want to get to know a lot more about him 
gov john r mckernan of maine said that when quayles name 
first surfaced at the republican national convention as a possible 
bush choice i said i thought it would be a mistake and 
unfortunately ive been borne out to be right 
kean who delivered the keynote address at the gop convention 
said this was quayles first time on the national stage 
its not unusual that he may make a few mistakes but you 
dont make them two or three times you make them and you move 
on said the new jersey governor we have yet to see whether or 
not he grows into the stature that the vice presidential candidate 
should have 
georgia gop chairman john stuckey said personally speaking 
there are other people i think who would have made a better vice 
presidential selection but that wasnt my decision to make 
questions have centered on whether quayle used his wealthy 
familys connections to avoid being drafted for combat in vietnam 
at the height of the vietnam war in 1969 quayle was called by 
his local draft board for a preinduction physical before he could 
be drafted however he joined the indiana national guard a former 
employee of one of the newspapers owned by quayles family has said 
he interceded with the guard on quayles behalf 
quayles admission to law school also has drawn attention he 
was admitted to indiana university law school in 1970 despite being 
by his own admission a proverbial cplus student in college 
first rejected for admission quayle was admitted after meeting 
with the admissions dean a republican judge in a city where 
quayles family owned the local newspaper 
while few republicans went as far as thomas in suggesting that 
quayle ought to consider quitting the ticket some republicans were 
wary that there could be additional disclosures 
asked if he thought bush should consider dropping quayle house 
gop leader bob michel of illinois said if there was something 
additional that came up that was a distraction or disqualification 
well the options always there but i dont see it at this 
juncture 
everybodys kind of waiting to see if theres anything else 
out there said michelle davis executive director of the 
republican governors association she called the questions about 
quayles military service and law school admission mere ruffles 
and said if this is all there is to be had that aint bad 
but even republicans who expressed second thoughts about the 
choice of quayle stood behind the vice presidential nominee and 
rejected suggestions he be dropped from the ticket 
from what i can tell he is going to survive this said 
mckernan who described his initial hesitation as based on a belief 
that the problem with picking an unknown is that everyone puts 
that person under a microscope and you lose some momentum that you 
would otherwise have 
it seems to me much ado about if not nothing at least very 
little said stuckey he called the controversy about quayles 
military record a bit overblown 
much ado about nothing was how virginia gop chairman donald 
w huffman described the controversy 
several republicans blamed the media for the controversy 
seven out of 10 people feel it is a media hype created by the 
media for the media said john stabile new hampshire gop 
chairman 
it is a mediadriven issue said fred logan jr kansas 
republican party chairman i think if the press continues to push 
it theres going to be an enormous backlash in favor of quayle 
its been blown totally out of proportion said burton 
kruglick arizona republican chairman theres been nothing 
proved that anything was done wrong

the air force has a number of options if it 
wants to improve the b1 bomber and some of the plans could cost 
up to 34 billion according to a report by the nonpartisan 
congressional budget office 
the cbo report released monday was the newest entry in the long 
debate over the plane which is defended by the air force and 
attacked by critics who say it cant do the job for which it was 
designed 
a chief critic is rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house 
armed services committee who said the study would be a primer 
for the debate to come on the expensive airplanes future 
we have to decide first if its worth it to fix the b1bs 
problems and then we have to decide what if anything to do about 
the expected air force requests for enhancements aspin said in a 
statement 
two weeks ago aspin said it might be necessary to halt spending 
on the bomber rather than pay for expensive repairs 
but the air force saw the report in a different light 
capt jay defrank a spokesman for the service said the cbo 
addresses a shopping list of possible enhancements the vast 
majority of which were not requested by the air force we 
constantly evaluate all systems including the b1b for their 
ability to meet evolving threats and request enhancements as 
necessary 
the b1s chief problems concern electronic countermeasures 
the highly sophisticated system used to defend the plane against 
attack 
aspin and other critics say there are questions about whether 
the b1 could perform adequately its mission of flying into the 
soviet union and delivering a load of nuclear bombs but the air 
force says the b1 will be a success 
the cbo noted that a sophisticated weapons system like the 
b1b bomber is never really complete even as the air force seeks 
to correct problems in the original b1b design the service is 
considering enhancements to improve the bombers capability 
the cbo study spelled out four possibilities one would improve 
b1 navigation and communications and redesign other electronic 
systems and would cost between 12 billion and 17 billion 
another choice the cbo said is simply to outfit the b1 to 
carry longrange cruise missiles meaning the plane would never 
have to enter the soviet union that would cost 90 million 
the third option costing up to 34 billion chiefly consists 
of new electronics for jamming or deceiving enemy radars 
a fourth choice involves purchasing different electronics and 
would cost 27 billion 
president carter killed the b1 in 1977 but president reagan 
resurrected it four years later 
the air force has bought 100 b1s and will use the plane in 
conjunction with the socalled stealth b2 bomber as the b52 
replacement in the nations arsenal of longrange atomic weapons 
the b2 nicknamed stealth for its capability to evade enemy 
air defenses will have its first public flight in november 
the last b1 was delivered april 30 the air force said the 
total cost of the program was 273 billion but that figure 
doesnt include any improvements

the uss stark blown apart at midship by two 
iraqi missiles 15 months ago has been repaired at a mississippi 
shipyard and will be returned to the navy in two weeks 
the guidedmissile frigate has been laid up at the yards of 
ingalls shipbuilding in pascagoula miss since last november it 
is scheduled for sea trials aug 29 and 30 and then final delivery 
to the navy said lt barbara kent a navy spokeswoman 
although the cost of repairs has not been tallied precisely the 
us government is preparing to submit a bill to iraq for the 
damage the navy and ingalls managed to hold the repair costs 
under 90 million compared to an original repair estimate of 142 
million kent said 
iraq has accepted responsibility for the attack on the stark 
describing the may 17 1987 incident as a case of mistaken 
identity it has promised to compensate the united states and the 
relatives of the 37 sailors who died in the attack although no 
money has changed hands to date 
the stark was almost lost as a result of the nighttime attack 
an iraqi mirage jet fighter fired two exocet missiles at the ship 
both of which struck although only one exploded 
the fuel from the first unexploded exocet contributed to a fire 
that produced temperatures as hot as 3500 degrees fahrenheit 
starting an inferno that has been described as unique in naval 
warfare the blaze was so intense it literally cooked the decks 
above spontaneously igniting equipment in those upper decks and 
spreading the fire vertically rather than horizontally 
ultimately the fire destroyed the entire combat information 
center the electronic heart of the ship as well as crew berths 
radar equipment rooms and other compartments 
in repairing the ship ingalls had to cut the front half of the 
old superstructure away and replace it along with a 50foot 
section of the steel hull down to the second level below the main 
deck 
inside the superstructure ingalls installed a new computerized 
combat system built by the unisys corp 
according to kent the starks crew has almost completely 
changed due to routine rotations since the ship returned from the 
persian gulf the new crew is grooming the ship for its return to 
the us atlantic fleet and its home port in mayport fla she 
added 
aug 31 is still our completion date the spokeswoman said 
were on schedule and running under cost

americas young people are the most educated 
in history but not necessarily the best educated and theyre 
taking longer to become selfsupporting adults a new government 
report indicates 
assistant education secretary chester e finn jr who released 
the report monday said the percentage of 18 to 24yearolds 
living with parents increased from 43 percent in 1960 to 536 
percent in 1985 
american young people seem to be staying younger longer he 
said they seem to be becoming autonomous selfsupporting 
individuals at a slower rate than was once the case 
the report entitled youth indicators 1988 was compiled 
from existing data dating back to 1950 from federal agencies and 
private organizations 
during that time the percentage of college graduates among 
americans age 25 to 29 increased from 77 percent in 1950 to 224 
per cent in 1986 the 1986 total of those with some college 44 
percent is greater than the percentage with only a high school 
education 421 percent for the first time in us history 
but finn said falling sat and act scores plus the lastplace 
ranking of us students in recent international science and 
mathematics tests are reason for concern 
i have to say that while a lot more kids are getting more 
education measured in the number of years of schooling they dont 
know very much he said they make me worry about the future of 
a country thats raising up people with a number of years in school 
but that dont know anything 
the 134page report was prepared by the departments office of 
educational research and improvement 
among other findings 
median income for women aged 20 to 24 fell from 12517 in 1980 
to 12192 in 1986 using constant 1986 dollars the comparable 
figures for young men fell from 16113 in 1970 to 14152 in 1986 
the number of first marriages per 1000 nevermarried women 
aged 20 to 24 fell from 2201 in 1970 to 1044 in 1984 
the study said the trends may be related since late marriage 
is a reasonable response to lower earnings 
it added that living with parents is a reasonable arrangement 
for those not earning enough to support themselves

many veterans applauded vice president george 
bushs defense of his embattled running mate monday and said the 
controversy over sen dan quayles military record was political 
mudslinging 
but several others who fought in the vietnam war while quayle 
served in the indiana national guard said they felt he had 
intentionally dodged combat duty and shirked his obligation to his 
country 
i dont like this mudslinging i dont think he would have 
turned his back on the good old usa said otto lunacek a 
veteran from batavia ill who fought in the korean war 
but fredy champagne a veteran from garberville calif who 
fought in vietnam in 196566 saw it differently 
i dont believe the mans qualified to serve our country if 
hes shirked his military duty champagne said noting one way to 
avoid the draft at that time was by getting into the national guard 
i dont think he represents the vietnamera generation in any 
stretch of the imagination he said i dont think he can be 
counted on in a time of crisis 
bush the republican presidential nominee met the controvery 
headon monday during an appearance at the 89th annual national 
convention of the veterans of foreign wars delivering an 
impassioned defense of the indiana senators record 
dan quayle served in the national guard signing up in a unit 
that had vacancies at the time and now he is under shrill partisan 
attack bush told about 4500 veterans attending the conventions 
opening session 
he served honorably true he didnt go to vietnam but his 
unit wasnt sent 
but theres another truth he did not go to canada he did not 
burn his draft card and he damn sure didnt burn the american 
flag im proud to have him at my side bush said as the crowd 
cheered and gave him a standing ovation 
a smaller crowd of about 2500 cheered and whistled quayle when 
he made a hastily arranged appearance in which acknowledged his 
debt to the older generation that served in world war ii and other 
conflicts 
many veterans leaving the auditorium at the mccormick place 
convention center said they were impressed by bushs remarks 
i think in a way quayles military service is kind of blown 
out of proportion said billy stansberry of joplin mo who 
served in vietnam in 196768 if the mans qualified thats all 
that matters to me 
i would say theyre trying to give quayle the shaft added 
oakey smith a veteran from stroudsburg pa who was in the army 
during world war ii serving from 194245 in burma china and 
india like bush said he was in the national guard and his unit 
never went overseas 
you cant blame him for that i would say its a lot of todo 
about nothing its just politics you know cut the other guys 
throat if you can smith said 
louis green a chicago veteran who also served in the pacific 
during world war ii said he believes quayle probably enlisted in 
the national guard to avoid being sent to vietnam and possibly into 
combat 
but he said it doesnt bother me that much it is a hell 
of a lot better than going to canada and not joining anything 
about 600000 of the vfws 21 million members are vietnam 
veterans organizers say 
but an official of the washington dcbased national vietnam 
veterans coalition said monday the vfw had not addressed many of 
the concerns of veterans from that conflict 
jerry kiley said coalition members were upset that bush had 
chosen to defend quayles record at the vfw convention 
we believe bush and his people are sandbagging on the quayle 
issue said kiley vice president of the vietnam veterans group 
in a telephone interview from new york 
the issue is how he got in to the guard by doing that 
quayle bumped somebody off that list and its likely the person he 
bumped went to vietnam 
but what makes this worse is heres a hawk a man clamoring to 
send our boys into battle but who did not have the courage of his 
own convictions to go himself said kiley of garnerville ny

many voters harbor doubts about sen dan quayle 
of indiana as the gop vice presidential nominee although the 
republican ticket emerged from its national convention with a 
narrow lead a new poll has found 
george bush and quayle led democratic nominee michael dukakis 
and his running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas by 46 percent to 
40 percent in the cbs news poll of 1221 registered voters across 
the country 
the survey released monday was the first done entirely after 
the republican convention in new orleans which ended thursday with 
a wellreceived acceptance speech by bush and it found improvement 
in ratings of his leadership and popularity 
but half the respondents did not believe the 41yearold quayle 
has the experience to be a good president and 28 percent were 
unsure thirtynine percent wished bush had chosen someone else 
quayle has faced questions about whether he used his wealthy 
familys connections to get into the national guard and avoid the 
draft and combat in the vietnam war in the poll 40 percent said 
phone calls made to the guard on his behalf represented an unfair 
attempt to ease his admission 40 percent said such calls were 
acceptable and 20 percent were unsure 
among the seven in 10 who had heard of the issue 48 percent 
said they believed quayle had joined the guard to avoid the draft 
just 29 percent thought that was not his main reason and 22 
percent said they didnt know 
also among those who had heard about it just 50 percent 
believed quayle was telling the truth about the national guard 
issue while 26 percent said he was not and 24 percent didnt know 
quayle also did not do well in comparison to bentsen fortyone 
percent said bentsen would be a better vice president to 28 
percent for quayle the rest didnt know 
still support was up for the republican ticket as a whole 
dukakis enjoying his own convention bounce had led by 17 points 
in a cbs newsnew york times poll early this month 
the 6point spread in the new poll was just within its margin of 
error of plus or minus three percentage points but other polls 
have found bush gaining allowing the conclusion that the 
republicans lead slightly in a gallup poll this weekend they led 
by 9 percentage points 5142 
bush was expected to gain in popularity following the publicity 
from his convention just as dukakis did after the democratic 
convention such bounces in the polls generally settle as the 
campaign progresses 
on bushs personal ratings 51 percent said they had faith in 
his ability to deal wisely with an international crisis while 37 
percent said they would be uneasy his rating on this question 
earlier this month was the opposite 
bush was rated favorably by 39 percent and unfavorably by 25 
percent in the new survey much improved from his 
favorableunfavorable rating of 2733 in the previous poll 
dukakis did worse on the confidence measure with 53 percent 
uneasy about him in a crisis 29 percent confident and his 
favorableunfavorable rating dropped from 3819 before the gop 
convention to 3225 after it 
efforts by republicans at the convention to paint dukakis as a 
liberal had little effect 34 percent saw him as a liberal 
compared with 35 percent in the earlier poll but 34 percent said 
dukakis was more likely than bush to raise taxes up from 27 
percent in early august 
the poll was conducted friday through sunday

of art believed to be the work of douglas tilden a deafmute 
sculptor who the san francisco chronicles architecture critic 
allan temko has commended for producing san franciscos greatest 
single legacy of public art 
the crates contained scale models for giant statues 
largerthanlife plaster casts busts of famous men a life mask of 
three noted california artists drawings diplomas and prizes from 
expositions and old world fairs there were 70 pieces in all 
after some investigation the libertis concluded the materials 
were found in tildens berkeley studio the day he died in 1934 
they were packed up and put in storage by a relative who paid the 
bills until 1987 or so when the checks stopped the storage 
company had the right to sell the crates 
if this is authenticated it could be one of the greatest 
finds in the history of california art temko said 
mildred albronda author of a book about tilden has inspected 
the materials in the liberatis crates but said she is not sure of 
their value she noted they are mostly plaster and some are 
not in pristine condition 
there is no question of its authenticity none at all she 
said sunday 
oakland museums curator of sculpture harvey jones also 
examined the work he was out of town on monday and couldnt be 
reached for comment 
tilden who studied in paris produced the baseball player 
sculpture which stands in golden gate park in 1889 
he specialized in monumental bronze sculptures three of his 
public works the mechanics monument the admission day monument 
and one of a heroic group commemorating the spanishamerican war 
highlight major intersections on san franciscos market street 
he planned a giant piece called the bridge of a young man 
and woman kneeling in an embrace across san francisco bay the 
monument was never cast in bronze but the ninefoot plaster cast 
for it was found in the crates by the liberatis 
i had produced masterpieces and enthroned san francisco in the 
art world tilden wrote but in 1920 he gave up art and became a 
machinist california has forsaken art he said 
his style of art went out of style and by 1930 he was broke the 
electricity and water service was cut off to his studio and 
neighbors reported he was starving he died alone in his studio at 
the age of 75

awake feast on a diet of bamboo a sevengrain panda bread and 
apples 
but theres no plan to put the portly pandas on a diet the 5

despite the ceasefire in the persian 
gulf war the main iranian opposition group says it has not 
abandoned its bloody campaign to topple ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis islamic government 
under no circumstances will we halt our struggle against his 
government said alireza jaferzadeh spokesman for the 
iraqbased national liberation army of iran we will fight until 
its downfall 
but the ceasefire that began saturday will test the ability of 
the rebels led by massoud rajavi to maintain a challenge to the 
fundamentalist islamic government in tehran that began with 
hitandrun guerrilla raids and escalated to fullscale military 
offensives 
yet even as tehran appears to be taking the national liberation 
army more seriously than it has for years the rebels admit the 
unsponsored ceasefire poses problems for continuing their 
private war against the islamic republic 
iraq is unlikely to allow the rebels composed mainly of 
fighters from the mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors to 
continue launching attacks across the border into iran and risk 
being blamed for violating the truce 
iranian and iraqi negotiators are expected to seek assurances 
that both sides will curb opposition groups from operating from 
their territory the negotiators are scheduled to meet in geneva 
thursday to discuss a formal peace agreement to end the 8yearold 
war 
jafarzadeh interviewed by telephone at rebel headquarters in 
baghdad conceded the ceasefire will halt their attacks into iran 
but he said the rebels will find alternatives to continue the 
struggle against khomeini 
asked what these were he said without elaboration we have 
suitable tactics to implement our strategy we believe we can cope 
with this new situation 
weve always called for peace peace operates to our benefit 
because it will hasten the downfall of khomeinis government 
the rebels argue that the tehran government after recent 
military setbacks and the unexpected unconditional acceptance last 
month of the un ceasefire resolution is the most vulnerable it 
has been since the 1979 revolution 
last month the rebels launched the most ambitious attack in 
their 18monthold campaign capturing the towns of karand and 
eslamabad 65 miles inside iran 
president ali khamenei condemned the rebels as a group of 
hypocrites twofaced and evil people may appear in the country 
supported by foreign propaganda to try to break our national 
pride and make trouble 
tehran claimed its forces killed 4800 rebels in a threeday 
battle and drove them back across the border 
the rebel group said it lost 1000 fighters but claimed to have 
killed or wounded 40000 of khomeinis revolutionary guards 
it is not possible to verify either sides claim but diplomats 
in tehran and baghdad are skeptical of the rebel claims and there 
have even been suggestions baghdad deliberately allowed the group 
to be mauled to rid itself of what could become an embarrassment in 
any peace deal 
irans official media monitored in nicosia has reported scores 
of mujahedeen prisoners and collaborators in western iran have been 
executed since late july 
the rebels claim the iranians have executed thousands of 
captured fighters and political prisoners to stifle resistance 
the financial times of london reported from tehran last week 
that scores of prisoners have been executed in detention centers in 
the capital and buried in mass graves 
the rebels believe nevertheless that their position will be 
strengthened as many iranians question why their government 
accepted a ceasefire with iraq now than a year ago when iran held 
the military advantage 
diplomats in tehran told the associated press there does not 
appear to be any imminent internal threat to khomeinis government 
one reason they said was that many iranians who may have been 
sympathetic to the rebels were appalled by rajavis alliance with 
iraq 
the mujahedeen were allies of khomeini against shah mohammad 
reza pahlavi during the revolution but the fundamentalists turned 
on the mujahedeen and other leftist factions in a purge in which 
thousands were killed or imprisoned

theyve been unlucky in love and had their 
problems with booze but george peppard and ernest hemingway found 
each other and now peppard is bringing hemingway back home 
the 59yearold actor known as hannibal smith of televisions 
the ateam has brought his oneman play papa the legendary 
lives of ernest hemingway to chicagos royal george theater 10 
miles from hemingways suburban oak park birthplace 
the play is set in cuba and depicts a day in the life of 
hemingway when he was 58 three years before his 1961 suicide 
the play produced by peppards lime tree productions ends its 
run here aug 28 before heading to san francisco and then possibly 
broadway 
papa written by john de groot struck peppard when he first 
read it the actor said in a recent interview 
something like this happens once in a career something this 
good this literate the actor said 
reviews have been mixed but peppard said people who knew 
hemingway author of for whom the bell tolls and the old man 
and the sea have told him his portrayal brings hemingway to life 
hemingway was married four times drank too much and played out 
dangerous and exciting reallife roles an ambulance driver in 
world war i a biggame hunter a deepsea fisherman 
peppard also has married four times and has had his own problems 
with the bottle though he said he has been off alcohol nearly a 
decade 
it makes a big difference in the character portrayal that i 
drank too much for 25 years he said 
he noted that many of his mothers siblings died young and his 
own father died when he was 22 
death has always been a presence in my life he said 
both hemingway and i have been exposed to the vicissitudes of 
fame so those things lent some real kinds of perceptions into a 
character that is very complex 
the demise of the ateam two years ago came six months 
after peppards separation from his fourth wife alexis adams 
personally emotionally there wasnt anything that i wanted 
to do or anywhere that i wanted to go peppard recalled 
but the television show gave him the money to do hemingway and 
now he has found satisfaction 
i spent a lot of years doing a lot of things that i didnt 
enjoy he said now im doing something that i feel has great 
quality and is extremely entertaining i can stand a few years of 
this

activists have described the 
largest protest against the 1968 sovietled warsaw pact invasion in 
nearly two decades as an important political moment evidencing 
a new attitude in czechoslovakia 
thousands of people marched through the capital sunday night in 
the biggest protest since 1969 against the aug 2021 1968 
invasion that crushed the experiment in democracy known as the 
prague spring 
the official news agency ctk said 28 people were still in 
detention monday after police arrested 77 people in prague in what 
it termed disturbing actions that grew into hooliganism 
six of the seven unidentified foreigners detained were expelled 
ctk said without further details 
batonwielding police with dogs on leashes charged a crowd of 
about 1000 demonstrators sunday after the protest had dwindled 
from an estimated 10000 people who marched through central prague 
chanting long live freedom russians go home and dubcek 
dubcek dubcek 
alexander dubcek pioneered the prague spring reforms and was 
ousted as communist party leader in 1969 and expelled from the 
party the next year 
activists with the charter 77 human rights group and the 
independent cultural association jazz section noted the youth of 
the demonstrators between ages 18 and 35 and said chanting 
dubceks name appeared to be more a symbol than sympathy for his 
person 
hes a symbol of a time of an atmosphere said vaclav maly 
a charter 77 signatory and roman catholic priest who authorities 
have barred from preaching 
it is important for people that they see we demonstrated and 
practically nothing happened maly said it is an important 
political moment 
fantastic that 90 percent of it was young people who grew up 
in this system jazz section leader karel srp commented it is 
the first small flower that will grow up 
charter 77 activist zdenek urbanek said he felt the same good 
experience as in 68 when suddenly i saw young people who didnt 
know anything about democracy freedom and free elections speak 
openly about what is needed for the country 
activists interviewed monday stressed that the protest developed 
spontaneously and involved ordinary people rather than known 
dissidents 
residents of prague and frequent visitors have noticed an 
increasing interest in politics and a trend toward popular activism 
that departs marketly from the cynicism and fear prevalent since 
the 1968 invasion 
a roman catholic petition to communist authorities demanding 
more religious freedom was signed by half a million believers 
earlier this year and in march some 2000 people demonstrated in 
bratislava to air similar demands 
that was the last sizeable street protest in czechoslovakia and 
police dispersed the crowd using water cannon trucks and vans the 
harsh police tactics not unusual for czechoslovakia drew strong 
criticism from the west 
activists speculated that concern for czechoslovakias image in 
the west and possible influence from moscow played a part in the 
initial decision not to break up sundays protest at the start 
maly and urbanek said they detected a more clever approach 
on the part of authorities 
srp however who followed the protest throughout attributed 
the lack of police action to initial confusion saying nobody 
expected it and they had no direction 
reform in the soviet union has had an effect both on 
czechoslovakias communist leadership and on its citizens who 
follow soviet press and television and see that much freer 
expression of opinion is allowed 
czechoslovakias leaders see mikhail s gorbachev adopting many 
of the same reforms pioneered by leaders of the prague spring 
most recently gorbachev has spoken of striving for socialism 
with a human face a slogan used in 1968 by dubcek 
milos jakes who replaced party leader gustav husak last 
december has embraced cautious economic reform but has so far 
skirted any farreaching political or cultural change 
however there has been a slightly more relaxed approach to 
independent groups and dissidents marking an important shift over 
the past two years 
maly and srp cautioned strongly however against expecting any 
rapid political change in czechoslovakia where authorities have 
ensured that living standards remain far higher than in other east 
bloc countries 
i wouldnt exaggerate it maly said it is a start the 
society starts to be more active 
czechoslovakia is an unpredictable country said srp 
nobody knows what will happen here

the dangers in returning americans 
to space flight are overshadowed by the rewards says one of five 
astronauts scheduled to fly on the first shuttle mission since the 
challenger disaster 
there are certain things in life that the importance really 
transcends any danger thats involved or risk thats involved 
marine lt col dave hilmers said monday at the last news 
conference he and fellow discovery crew members will hold before 
their flight 
the sense of privilege that i have in being a part of this and 
the purpose very much overshadows any fear that i have 
discoverys launch expected during late september will mark 
the nations return to manned space flight on jan 28 1986 
challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff killing its crew of 
seven 
navy capt rick hauck who will command the veteran crew on 
discoverys fourday mission said the flight is important to 
establish confidence in the space program 
although safety is important hauck said he was concerned about 
people who believe all risks should be avoided 
if the united states becomes afraid to take any risks then we 
need to find out whos going to lead the world and follow them 
he said 
the mission will be a test flight hauck said noting that the 
shuttle has undergone 210 modifications since the challenger 
tragedy although mechanical failures could occur he doesnt 
believe any will be lifethreatening 
we clearly could not afford to lose another vehicle much less 
another crew hauck said i dont think the manned space flight 
program could withstand another challenger on sts26 his flight 
thats high stakes but im not concerned that thats going to 
happen in the last year and a half ive seen how weve modified 
that machine and how weve done business so i feel very 
comfortable with the flight 
officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
have been hesitant to set a date for the often postponed launch 
because engineers still are grappling with two problems that 
developed during a test firing of discoverys engines on the launch 
pad at cape canaveral on aug 10 hauck said 
but he added im not aware of anything that might get in the 
way of a late september launch 
one problem a small leak of hydrogen gas detected in an area 
where the orbiter is joined to the external fuel tank the other is 
the apparent sluggishness of three gaseous oxygen valves in the 
fueling system 
although nasa officials have said they dont think either 
problem is serious they still wanted to test both systems they 
hope they can announce resolutions and a launch date this week 
the astronauts main goal will be to deploy a communications 
satellite they also will conduct 11 science and technology 
experiments 
the other crew members are air force col richard covey the 
pilot and mission specialists george nelson and mike lounge 
in addition to the changes in the orbiter there were 50 
modifications to the shuttle booster rockets the challenger 
disaster was blamed on a faulty joint in one of two solidfuel 
booster rockets 
on monday a tentative undisclosed settlement was reached in 
richmond va in a lawsuit filed by jane smith widow of 
challenger pilot michael j smith against morton thiokol inc 
manufacturer of the faulty booster rocket the case was the last of 
the morton thiokol lawsuits to be settled 
also monday thiokol spokesman rocky raab said an analysis 
indicates that safety features in the redesigned booster performed 
as designed during a crucial testfiring last week despite 
deliberately incorporated flaws the test was the fifth and final 
fullscale firing needed to qualify the solidfuel booster for 
flight 
detailed inspection and analysis of the tested rocket will 
continue through the rest of the month raab said 
as the engineers continued their study crew members expressed 
eagerness to return to space 
its been a long time and i think at times each of us has 
been a little impatient when things have gone slowly said 
nelson but at the same time we understand that we had to go at 
that pace to do the thorough job that weve done in getting the 
shuttle back ready to fly again we are ready to fly we would like 
to fly yesterday 
its going to happen said hauck

national guard if confronted with a situation like that republican 
vice presidential nominee dan quayle faced in 1969

questioning the military record of quayle since gop presidential

veterans have been ordered not to give media interviews on 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayles national guard 
service 
one angry counselor called the order a violation of his right to 
speak out but the official who issued the directive in seven 
western states said he was merely reinforcing a law that bars 
government employees from getting involved in politics 
the order was issued friday by farrell udell associate regional 
manager for the western region of the veterans administration 
readjustment counseling service 
because were a government organization we do not care to 
comment on political issues udell said in a telephone interview 
from his san francisco office 
david culmer a counselor in the agencys office in the westwood 
neighborhood of los angeles said i dont feel that federal 
employees should be censored or muzzled or not allowed to speak 
their opinion i dont think its appropriate 
quayle the indiana senator tabbed by vice president george bush 
as his running mate has faced questions about whether he used his 
familys influence to get into the national guard in 1969 and so 
avoid being drafted into combat in the vietnam war

uncle sam will get about 100000 of the 
money left by a widow who wanted her estate used to reduce the 
national debt but the bequest is only enough to offset the 
gargantuan debt for 21 seconds 
the federal government and kentucky recently reached an 
agreement on the distribution of the money after a legal battle of 
more than four years over whether the state was entitled to 
inheritance taxes 
under the agreement the state will get 30000 and the us 
bureau of public debt will get the 100000 or so remaining after 
bequests to relatives 
minnie vogel who had no children died in may 1984 at age 85 
she left 35000 of her 188000 estate to seven nieces and nephews 
all the rest i bequeath and devise to my beloved country 
the united states of america to be used to reduce the national 
debt ms vogel said in her will the reason for this 
distribution is because of the deep love i have for america and 
i wish to show my appreciation and love in helping my country in 
this small way 
the national debt is 25 trillion and grows an estimated 
100000 every 21 seconds 
the agreement was recently approved by jefferson circuit judge 
edmund p karem the parties are awaiting final approval from 
jefferson district probate court said assistant us attorney 
michael f spalding 
spalding said he is pleased the case seems about to be resolved 
but is not sure why it took four years 
in an effort to resolve the issue the federal government agreed 
to abide by kentucky law and pay the inheritance tax but ms 
vogels lawyer sued saying he did not think it was ms vogels 
intent that part of her money should go to the state 
we felt her intent was to give it all to the federal 
government said sheldon isaacs the lawyer who prepared the will 
and is administering the estate 
all parties acknowledged they lacked a clear precedent 
david liebschutz a spokesman for the bureau of public debt 
said he could recall just one donation of similar size the 
100000 given annually by a retired ohio industrialist who also 
sends the bureau his monthly social security checks 
liebschutz said few people will their money to the government 
the fund to reduce the public debt receives about 500000 a 
year in donations he said most contributions from individuals 
come as checks for 10 or 20

stress is believed to have killed a zoohatched 
andean condor that was on its way to freedom in an experiment to 
see how its endangered north american cousin will adapt to the wild 
three other transplanted andean condors in the program were 
doing well monday officials said 
the andean birds were chosen for the experiment because it is 
the closest living relative to the california condor though the 
andean species is also endangered they number in the thousands 
only 28 of its north american cousins exist and all in captivity 
the andean condors which are also endangered were transported 
to los padres national forest in airlinestyle animal shipping 
crates and placed in secret holding pens saturday 
one died while being transported 
preliminary results of an autopsy show the death was 
stressrelated although infection has not been ruled out said joe 
dowhan condor recovery coordinator for the us fish and wildlife 
service 
final test results are expected by wednesday 
he said it was premature to say how officials might have handled 
the move differently or what changes might be implemented to 
prevent other deaths 
this is a learning process right now there are all kinds of 
scenarios we could consider changing he said 
scientists are conducting the experiment to see how birds 
hatched in captivity adapt to freedom fending for themselves in a 
region without native birds of their species to serve as examples 
the first group of the 3 and 4monthold birds are scheduled to 
spend several weeks in mesh enclosures in the forest 75 miles 
northeast of los angeles 
two came from the san diego wild animal park one was from the 
fish and wildlife service center in patuxent md and the one that 
died came from the los angeles zoo 
scientists will prepare the birds for their first flights over 
the dry mountains and foothills that once supported a large 
population of california condors 
the condors are being exposed to other young condors for the 
first time because they were raised singly as in the wild dowhan 
said 
more andean condors will be brought to the area in october 
in december when the birds should be able to fly scientists 
will fit them with radio monitors release them and follow their 
progress 
the andean birds will remain in the wild until its time to 
release california condors perhaps as early as 1992 if officials 
have continued success in captive breeding programs at the wild 
animal park and the los angeles zoo dowhan said 
blood tests on the first california condor conceived in 
captivity determined the bird is a female officials said monday 
the 4monthold bird named molloko also was determined to be 
in perfect health said tom hanscom spokesman at the wild 
animal park the bird which weighed in at 6 ounces when born 
april 29 now weighs 16 pounds 
fourteen of the 27 other california condors are females park 
officials say further tests will determine which of the birds are 
related and how they will be separated for breeding

lawyers for two newspapers have asked a judge 
to throw out a 700000 jury award to a public relations man who 
sued the papers for breaking a promise not to print his name as the 
source of a news story 
the lawyers for the st paul pioneer press dispatch and 
minneapolisbased star tribune argued monday that hennepin county 
district court judge franklin knoll should have instructed the jury 
to consider whether the first amendment gives newspapers a right to 
breach a contract 
knoll said he will issue a ruling later on the newspapers 
request that he reverse the jury verdict or grant a new trial 
the jury decided that the newspapers engaged in 
misrepresentation when reporters for both papers promised dan cohen 
that they would not identify him as a source editors later 
overruled the reporters and published cohens name 
the jury last month found misrepresentation and awarded cohen 
500000 in punitive damages and 200000 in compensatory damages 
star tribune lawyer james fitzmaurice argued monday that the 
jury had no grounds for its ruling he said cohen should have been 
required to show the newspapers acted with malice in breaking 
their oral agreements a standard used in libel cases 
but the judge questioned whether the first amendment allows 
newspapers to break contracts 
then i guess the point is that no one should make a contract 
with you because they cant be assured your client wont break 
it the judge told fitzmaurice 
cohen leaked court documents to reporters during the 1982 
gubernatorial campaign that revealed that marlene johnson who was 
the successful candidate for lieutenant governor had a shoplifting 
record 
cohen who worked for rival candidate wheelock whitney provided 
the information on the condition that he not be identified editors 
at the newspapers testified that they broke the promise because the 
public had a right to know the information came from the whitney 
campaign

the soviet union has not stopped its military 
buildup in the far east and the us economy is in comparative 
decline so japan will continue its fiveyear defense expansion 
program the defense agency said today 
the decision is likely to keep japans military spending above 1 
percent of its gross national product a selfimposed ceiling 
abandoned last year by the government that had been observed since 
1976 
the budget for defenserelated expenses for the current fiscal 
year is 28 billion an estimated 1013 percent of japans gnp 
in its annual report on defense the government said the 
soviet union has adopted a military buildup as one of its top 
priorities and as a result has increased its strength enough to 
confront the us in the spheres of both nuclear and conventional 
warfare 
the report said that although the united states continues to 
play a major role in international politics no one can deny that 
its position has recently been declining comparatively in the 
economic field 
under these circumstances japan will be increasingly expected 
to play a role commensurate with its position as the secondlargest 
economic power among free world nations next to the united 
states it said 
the report said soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has 
emphasized peaceful intentions but there is no change in the 
trend of continuous military buildup of the soviet union as seen in 
the realities of deployment of ss24 icbm intercontinental 
ballistic missiles commissioning of a fourth kievclass aircraft 
carrier and deployment of a fourth generation of fighter aircraft 
it said that in the far east the soviet union has begun to 
build up its forces rapidly deploying enormous forces along 
the sovietchina border 
japan has already begun development of a surfacetoship missile 
which will be used by its ground selfdefense forces beginning this 
year it also is developing a new antisubmarine deck helicopter to 
engage in antisubmarine and antiship warfare 
japan has about 180000 authorized defense personnel the 
figures are not broken down by services 
according to the report the united states had 50400 men 
stationed in japan as of dec 31 1987 of whom about 2100 were in 
the army 7400 in the navy 23600 in the marine corps and 17300 
in the air force 
the report said japan should steadily improve its defense 
capabilities as planned in the national defense program outline a 
fiveyear program to beef up japans defenses 
the japanese government passed the controversial fiveyear 
defense buildup plan in september 1985 to meet us requests that 
japan shoulder more of the burden for its own defense 
the plan calls for an annual increase of 79 percent in defense 
spending compared to about 6 percent in previous years 
defense spending is a sensitive issue in japan where 
antimilitary sentiment has been strong since the militarism of 
world war ii the constitution renounces war as a sovereign right

on black market dealers who have inflated prices after the worst 
floods in the countrys history the official sudanese radio 
reported 
omdurman radio quoted maj gen mohammed elfateh abdoun mayor 
of the sudanese capital of khartoum as saying monday night that 
food wholesalers and retailers were required to report the extent 
of their stock to authorities within 48 hours 
he said merchants dealing in cement wood zinc and iron should 
provide a similar inventory within a week he said offenders would 
be tried 
worse than the natural disasters are the moral disasters which 
have prompted some citizens to exploit the bad situation as a means 
for unlawful riches abdoun was quoted as saying the radio 
broadcast was monitored in london 
torrential rains aug 45 caused floods that left 91 people dead 
and 15 million sudanese homeless damage has been estimated at

already has started overflowing in central sudan and areas south of 
khartoum 
all of a sudden some essential commodities have disappeared 
from the markets despite the fact that available data indicate 
their abundance abdoun was quoted as saying 
therefore we have decided to reinforce the law until we 
restore to the state its respect and deter those who tamper with 
essential food he said 
abdoun noted that the absence of supervision and the 
disintegration of local authority after the floods had contributed 
to the situation 
he urged sudanese citizens to report on merchants who hoard 
supplies saying that informers will be awarded 10 percent of the 
quantity of the goods reported

amnesty international said today it has new 
evidence of political prisoners in singapore being tortured during 
interrogations by officials of the internal security department 
a 15page report from the international human rights 
organization says some of the seven prisoners three women and 
four men have been subjected to roundtheclock questioning in 
cold rooms doused with cold water and repeatedly slapped in the 
face if they were uncooperative in making selfincriminating 
confessions 
relatives who saw the prisoners said most of them looked 
extremely tired and haggard with dark rings under their eyes sore 
lips coughs and most appeared thinner the report said 
in singapore officials declined comment on the report local 
newspapers did not publish stories on the report 
the amnesty report says relatives fear the prisoners might have 
been drugged or otherwise illtreated because most had unnaturally 
darker and patchy skin complexions 
the londonbased human rights group said it was asking the 
singapore government for an independent inquiry to investigate the 
allegations it called for the prosecution of any offending 
officers and for the prisoners release 
the seven were among a group arrested in mid1987 accused of a 
marxist conspiracy to overthrow the state but later set free 
amnesty said the seven were again arrested in april after denying 
the allegations and claiming they were illtreated in detention 
after sending a mission to singapore in june 1987 amnesty 
published a report in october charging that the 22 people 
originally detained underwent severely cruel inhuman and 
degrading treatment during interrogation 
all 22 were adopted as prisoners of conscience the amnesty 
term for detainees arrested for holding nonviolent beliefs 
we are concerned about the continued detention of these seven 
persons and we received via relatives and lawyers information from 
the detainees themselves for this new report said amnesty 
spokeswoman carline windall 
the women were identified as teo soh lung 39 lawyer chng suan 
tze 39 lecturer in english and wong souk yee 30 market

the death toll in a fire that gutted a basement 
social club was revised downward from seven to six and officials 
said the blaze did not appear to be arson as was originally 
suspected 
we believe at this point that the fire was accidental but 
many important witnesses who were badly injured have yet to be 
interviewed by fire marshals fire department spokesman john 
mulligan said monday 
dozens of patrons who were injured in sundays fire at the bronx 
club known as the hole remain hospitalized many severely burned 
eighteen firefighters also were hurt none seriously 
arson was initially suspected because of the rapid spread of the 
blaze at the club which officials said operated illegally because 
it served liquor without a license and didnt have enough exits to 
comply with building codes 
many social clubs here operate like bottle clubs in other 
states where customers bring their own liquor and get mixers from 
the management 
fire and police officials were unable monday to explain why 
seven dead were counted sunday instead of the correct six said 
police spokesman peter odonnell 
mayor edward i koch said monday that he wanted the city to do 
more to close illegal social clubs 
what can we do to locate all of these illegal premises and 
close them down koch said in a memo to the police commissioner 
fire commissioner and buildings commissioner 
the hole has been raided five times since march by the police 
department and there have been nine arrests said koch spokesman 
tom kelly 
the club did not have a liquor license kelly said 
koch described the club a 50by75foot tshaped space as a 
rabbit warren 
the steep narrow staircase leading down to the club was no 
better than a ladder said mulligan

underground leaders of the 8monthold 
palestinian uprising today urged more attacks on israelis and 
called on arabs to set up independent institutions in the occupied 
territories 
the calls came in a leaflet that also designated today a day of 
firebomb attacks to protest israels deportation of 33 arabs since 
the revolt against 21 years of israeli occupation began in the west 
bank and gaza strip 
the leaflet was distributed a day after israeli troops shot and 
wounded 17 palestinians in bloody clashes throughout gaza ninety 
other arabs were injured by beatings or overcome by tear gas 
western relief officials said 
there is no going back on the achievements realized on the 
path to the establishment of an independent palestinian state on 
our national soil the zionists will be driven out of our land 
so we may built on it our independent state with its capital in 
jerusalem the fourpage statement said 
there is no sign of weariness on the part of the masses the 
leaflet added we invite you to extend the struggle against the 
occupation 
the leaflet the 24th issued since the uprising began dec 8 
called for setting up underground classrooms planting crops for 
storage and boycotting israeli farm products 
it also called on palestinians to stage four days of general 
strikes over the next seven days in solidarity with deportees and 
with five palestinians killed in a fire in tel aviv and by israeli 
troops in a prison riot last week 
palestinians also were urged to defy israels ban on autonomous 
grassroots committees calling for redoubled efforts to build 
more of them 
it also applauded neighboring jordans severing earlier this 
month of legal and adminstrative ties with the west bank as one 
of the main achievements of the uprising 
an army spokesman said meanwhile that soldiers maintained 
curfews today on four refugee camps and neighborhoods where the 
violence occurred in the gaza strip confining about 118000 
palestinians to their homes 
the west banks largest city of nablus and three neighboring 
refugee camps whose combined populations are about 140000 also 
were under curfew for a second straight day 
the clashes followed a general strike which was called to 
protest the israeli policy of confiscating propety of arabs 
refusing to pay taxes 
the fighting became intense when the israeli army imposed 
curfews in the jabaliya shati and bureij refugee camps and parts 
of gaza city 
palestinians using loudspeakers at moslem mosques called on 
residents of the camps to defy the orders and hundreds responded 
blocking roads burning tires and stoning israeli patrols 
no deaths were reported in mondays violence at least 252 arabs 
and four israelis have been killed in the clashes since the 
uprising began in the lands israel seized in the 1967 middle east 
war 
in another development michel sabah the first arab to be 
appointed roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem rejected an 
invitation to meet defense minister yitzhak rabin at the parliament 
in jerusalem a church official said monday 
he told the associated press the refusal was in line with the 
churchs policy not to meet with israeli authorities in jerusalem

valerie harper denied she tried to gain 
control over the tv series valerie before its producers fired 
her for allegedly violating her contract testifying i wasnt 
trying to be genghis khan 
i wanted to have participation early knowledge of stories so 
i would be in a partnership on the show she testified monday 
her 48th birthday 
ms harper who was to continue testifying in los angeles county 
superior court this afternoon was called to the stand by lorimar 
which is suing her for alleged breach of contract she is 
countersuing contending that lorimar wrongfully fired her a year 
ago 
lorimar replaced ms harper with sandy duncan and renamed the 
nbctv show the hogan family 
lorimar attorney donald engel on monday sought to show that ms 
harper was aware of all aspects of her 1985 contract and tried to 
renegotiate it because she craved more money and total control over 
valerie 
ms harper denied this saying she left business matters in the 
hands of her husband tony cacciotti and left the contract to her 
agent and lawyer whose advice she later came to doubt 
im not good with contracts she said holding the lorimar 
document i read these and start to get crosseyed 
ms harper acknowledged that even before the pilot for 
valerie was sold her relations with other members of the 
production staff began to erode 
the first problem she said arose when cacciottis name was 
left off the credits for the pilot even though he was supervising 
producer 
i was disappointed and hurt she said it felt like a 
betrayal 
as valerie began production ms harper said she came to 
feel that her agent jim berkus was working more in the interest 
of his firm leading artists than hers 
i had my doubts about how well we were being represented 
she said 
do you think mr berkus did a good job in negotiating this 
agreement asked engel 
no replied ms harper 
engel then listed the financial terms of the contract which 
brought ms harper 15 million for the first oneandahalf 
seasons and provided profit shares and escalating salaries for her 
and her husband in subsequent years in the sixth season she would 
have received 90000 per episode 
didnt you realize that you had a very favorable deal asked 
engel 
i felt financially it was a start ms harper replied 
ms harper said she sought to renegotiate her contract later to 
increase her salary and put in writing her participation in 
creating story ideas for each episode 
by then she conceded she felt she was losing the right to 
influence story lines 
the consultation i had enjoyed had eroded and the relationship 
with the producers had started to turn she said 
what you thought you had was total control said engel 
i would disagree said ms harper i wanted participation 
not control i wasnt trying to be genghis khan i wanted 
participation with people i loved and respected

some of the six cubanamericans indicted on charges 
they trained and supplied mercenaries to the contras through a 
florida guerrilla camp say their fight in nicaragua supported us 
interests 
the miamiarea men were the second group charged by a fort 
lauderdale federal grand jury with violating the neutrality act 
which bars people on us soil from launching operations against a 
government at peace with the united states the latest indictment 
was unsealed monday 
one of the six rene corvo also is accused of shipping a 20mm 
cannon a mortar and other weapons from fort lauderdale to contra 
bases in costa rica under the guise of humanitarian aid 
after a brief appearance before us magistrate lurana snow in 
fort lauderdale some of the defendants echoed sentiments of the 
group whose indictment was unsealed a month ago 
we support the contras sergio becerra accused of training 
the mercenaries in the camp near naples fla yelled as he emerged 
from the federal courthouse 
these men were simply following the orders of their commander 
in chief said corvos lawyer ap walter they feel it is the 
duty of every american citizen to oppose communism 
kirk munroe attorney for one of the men who allegedly financed 
the operation eulalio francisco frank castro said his client 
was disappointed in the indictment 
castro would again aid the contras if asked munroe said 
i think it will become clear that these men were acting in the 
interests of the united states and the interests of freedomloving 
people everywhere munroe said 
also financing the mercenary camp along with castro was joseph 
marcos according to the indictment 
right now we really dont understand the charges marcos 
said calling them very unfair 
corvo agreed calling the neutrality act case very 
ridiculous 
all four were released without bond the two remaining 
defendants rafael torres jimenez and francisco hernandez were out 
of the country and federal authorities were attempting to contact 
them assistant us attorney mark schnapp said 
corvo faces up to 38 years in prison if convicted on the weapons 
charges and counts of violating the neutrality act and conspiring 
to violate it the remaining five men face up to eight years in 
prison on the latter two charges 
according to the indictment the six men financed and trained 
cubanamerican and nicaraguan mercenaries most from the miami 
area at a camp that could handle up to 60 soldiers at a time some 
of the men saw combat inside nicaragua after crossing the border 
from costa rica schnapp said 
the men allegedly worked with eden pastora the maverick contra 
commander who has since quit the movement and ran the camp from 
june 1983 to september 1986 the camp was a poorly kept secret and 
was filmed in 1985 by a naplesarea television station schnapp 
said 
members of an earlier group of contra supporters indicted by the 
same grand jury on neutrality act charges included mario calero 
the brother of contra leader adolfo calero and tom posey head of 
the alabamabased civilian materiel assistance 
one defendant joe adams a former adolfo calero associate 
pleaded guilty to the charges but was given a oneday probation 
sentence by us district judge norman roettger 
the other defendants said they were supported by the reagan 
administration and that the united states was in a de facto state 
of war with nicaragua at the time they aided the rebels 
schnapp said the new indictment did not include any evidence 
that the men were acting on behalf of the reagan administration 
the indictment would indicate that they were not sanctioned 
said schnapp

two former attorneys for onetime lobbyist 
paula parkinson say she told the fbi in 1981 that gop vice 
presidential nominee dan quayle propositioned her during a florida 
trip but she refused according to a published report 
in a copyright story in todays editions of the daily news of 
los angeles the attorneys said ms parkinson told the fbi the 
request was made when she quayle then a congressman and two 
other legislators shared a cottage during the 1980 golfing trip 
the lawyers said 
quayle an indiana senator who has been married since 1972 has 
said he did not have an affair with ms parkinson and a campaign 
spokesman declined comment monday evening about the lawyers 
allegations

newspaper said 
the two lawyers represented ms parkinson when she was 
questioned on march 28 1981 by the fbi during an investigation of 
whether sexual favors were traded for votes against legislation 
the lawyers reviewed their notes of the fbi interview for the daily 
news during separate telephone interviews monday 
ms parkinson has said that at the time of the trip she was 
with rep tom evans rdel who lost his reelection bid in 1982 
paula reported to the fbi during the investigation of the

her and asked her to go to bed with him said washington attorney

parkinson 
she indicated at that time that she couldnt respond to his 
overture because she was with congressman evans lewis told the 
newspaper 
washington attorney roy kinsey who also was present during the

according to kinseys notes ms parkinson told the fbi that she 
rejected quayles suggestion saying no im with tom evans 
mark goodin deputy press secretary for the bushquayle 
campaign was told of the lawyers comments monday evening 
i think youve got a huge rumor mill out there churning this 
stuff out and until i have something laid before me that is 
substantially more than a rumor i cant comment goodin said 
the lobbying investigation centered on ms parkinson a lobbyist 
for an insurance industry group that opposed legislation to set up 
a national farm crop insurance program the bill passed the house 
in september 1980 with quayle evans and the third member of the 
florida trip rep tom railsback rill voting against it

the communist government today announced a 
special parliament session would be held aug 31 to review its 
economic policies and said it would continue measures to stem the 
worst strikes since the 1981 imposition of martial law 
authorities earlier announced a curfew tonight on jastrzebie 
the city at the center of strikes that began a week ago and spread 
to coal mines factories ports and transportation facilities 
employing 100000 people 
interior minister czeslaw kiszczak saying at least 20 illegal 
strikes have threatened anarchy in the country announced monday 
that law enforcement forces would secure major industrial 
facilities and that he had empowered provinces to impose curfews in 
the katowice szczecin and gdansk areas 
government spokesman jerzy urban who announced the date of the 
parliament meeting at a news conference today said the session 
would consider the entire economic situation and perhaps make 
adjustments in national price and income policies 
strikers have demanded higher pay and reinstatement of 
solidarity the outlawed independent trade federation 
urban said there have been 49 detentions by police nationwide in 
connection with the strikes most of them preventative 
solidarity leader lech walesa today again appealed for talks 
between authorities and his union 
solidarity remains steadfast in its search for dialogue 
despite the growing social tensions he said on a tape brought 
out of the strikebound lenin shipyard in gdansk where he spent the 
night the present situation in the country has become extremely 
serious the just protest of the workers must not be ignored 
urban told reporters talks with walesa were impossible while 
strikes were going on 
new strikes began at two coal mines monday night and there was a 
brief work stoppage today at the nowa huta steel mill near krakow 
authorities said 
the staterun news agency pap reported that workers voluntarily 
ended a strike today at a railroad car factory in wroclaw 
solidarity sources in wroclaw said earlier that the strike was 
continuing 
partial streetcar traffic resumed in the port city of szczecin 
today after police dislodged strikers from depots monday night 
according to pap but bus service still was affected by a strike 
army troops were operating buses 
the 11 pm5 am curfew was announced for jastrzebie site of 
the first coal mine strike aug 16 and headquarters of the 
intermine strike committee by katowice provincial spokesman 
ryszard gil the province is polands industrial and mining center 
in the first forcible action against strikers riot police 
evicted scores from two streetcar depots and a bus depot monday 
night in szczecin and strike leaders said more than 150 people 
were arrested 
on monday night kiszczak said authorities were dutybound to 
prevent the return to the situation before 1981 when they 
imposed martial law to crush solidarity 
the speech came after workers at the lenin shipyard launched 
their second strike of the year dockworkers in the baltic port 
also began a sitin strike monday 
solidarity leaders said they were joined by workers at several 
of polands largest factories including the ursus tractor plant 
and the huta warszawa steel mill in warsaw the cegielski turbine 
works in poznan and the stalowa wola heavy machinery plant in 
southeastern poland 
the government has refused to negotiate with solidarity the 
only free trade union movement ever allowed in the soviet bloc it 
was outlawed in 1982 
kiszczak said he authorized officials in the provinces of 
szczecin gdansk and katowice to impose curfews to keep the peace 
he said he had also directed security forces to strengthen 
external protection around factories and prevent outsiders from 
entering the plants 
the army was dispatched to assure the continuity of city 
transport everywhere it has been immobilized and courts were 
advised to send violators of the peace to jail in summary 
proceedings rather than merely fining them 
he said the strikes were being carried out by only a minority of 
workers but had dire consequences for the economy 
strike leaders said they were girding for possible police raids 
we are prepared for these gentlemens visit a grim jozef 
kowalczyk spokesman for striking dockworkers in szczecin said 
early today the crew is so determined that they police had 
better not do it we have two priests here and theyve heard our 
confessions 
kiszczak said 5000 militant miners had prevented 65000 miners 
willing to work from entering coal mines and said baltic docks were 
losing valuable business to east and west germany 
coal exports are crucial to service polands 39 billion foreign 
debt 
the law is being broken again and the specter of anarchy is 
rising again people are asking fearful questions where is all 
this heading said kiszczak a general who commands the 
countrys police forces 
a less serious series of strikes occurred in poland in late 
april and may after the government raised prices an average of 40 
percent with strikers at the gdansk shipyard quitting without a 
settlement and police breaking up the nowa huta stoppage 
three times in postwar communist poland labor unrest stemming 
in part from price increases has toppled governments in 1956 1970 
and 1980

the military in burundi took part in 
massacres that have left at least 5000 people dead and caused 
38000 to flee to neighboring rwanda a un official quoted 
refugees as saying today 
what they told me was that they were fleeing persecution from 
the military and we saw many people who had been injured by bullets 
and bayonets said code cisse a un representative in rwandas 
capital kigali 
burundis military is dominated by the minority tutsi tribe 
which has been fighting the majority hutu tribe the hutu people 
liberation party an exiled opposition group has charged that 
burundis military massacred thousands of hutus 
burundis government has denied the accusations it claims the 
slaughter last week was instigated by exiled hutus who infiltrated 
the tiny central african country to inflame antitutsi sentiments 
what the government did was restore peace said an official 
communique issued monday by burundis foreign minister cyprien 
mbonimpa 
the hutu and the tutsi are longtime enemies following an 
abortive coup attempt in 1972 in burundi a former colony of 
belgium the tutsi massacred more than 100000 hutu including most 
of the tribes intelligentsia according to human rights groups 
western diplomats in burundis capital bujumbura said there 
were ethnic disturbances earlier this month in the northern region 
where the slaughter occurred but the government felt it had 
succeeded in calming the situation 
the killing seems to have caught everybody by surprise said 
one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity it could lend 
credence to the governments claim there had been infiltrators 
trying to stir things up 
most of the killings occurred around the remote farming communes 
of ntega and marangara in northern burundi a hilly marshy area 
that has been sealed off by the military 
news has been very very difficult to come by the diplomat 
said but from all that we have been able to gather the army 
moved in after the initial mass killing had occurred and was 
instructed to fire only upon those carrying arms or threatening 
other people 
although burundi claims it has restored peace to the area the 
un official said peasants still were fleeing across the border 
with rwanda at an average of 5000 per day and the refugees had 
numbered 38000 by monday 
he said the majority of refugees were hutu 
cisse who represents the un high commissioner for refugees 
said urgent international assistance was needed to help rwanda cope 
with the influx he said the immediate requirements were blankets 
medicines and tents to accomodate the refugees many of whom were 
sleeping in the open 
the conditions are very bad he said they are located in 
a region where there is a high risk of malaria and are being housed 
in schools and health clinics we cant meet the need 
rwanda and burundi are among the worlds most densely populated 
countries 
nearly 5 million people live in burundi which covers an area 
about the size of maryland eightyfour percent of its people are 
hutu while 15 percent are tutsi the same percentages apply to the 
approximately 6 million people in rwanda which covers a slightly 
smaller area 
in an official communique monday the government of burundi 
promised to work with refugees who fled to rwanda to try to return

a swiss lung specialist who examined 
nelson mandela said today the imprisoned leader of the african 
national congress was in excellent health despite tuberculosis 
i can say that the state of health of mandela is simply 
excellent professor heinrich herzog told swiss radio 
international 
herzog until recently president of the european society of 
pleurology said mandela told him he was in perfect health and 
felt as well as before the whole thing started 
he said the 70yearold black leader looks rather a bit 
younger than his age adding he no longer looks ill 
mandelas lawyer ismail ayob announced last week that his 
client was suffering from tb he said mandela was short of breath 
had a persistent cough and that his speech was impaired 
herzog saw mandela at tygerberg hospital in cape town he did 
not specify when he examined mandela but indicated it was after an 
aug 13 biopsy that showed no sign of malignancy in mandelas left 
lung 
hospital officials had said that herzog was examining mandela 
but did not specify who invited him to do so 
on aug 12 mandela was transferred to tygerberg hospital from 
pollsmoor prison where he is serving a life term for sabotage and 
conspiracy to overthrow the government he was imprisoned in 1962 
herzog said he had no political talks with mandela but he 
said comments in the south african media and indirect remarks 
which obviously originate at a higher level leave the impression 
that the pretoria government may make use of the situation to set 
him free 
in cape town the medical superintendent at tygerberg dr 
jgl strauss said today that mandela was recovering faster 
than he expected the doctor said mandela was sitting up in bed 
reading newspapers and listening to the radio

longestserving member of south africas parliament said she would 
introduce a motion wednesday urging mandelas release

the iraniraq peace talks starting thursday are 
only one set of negotiations that bolster genevas centuryold 
tradition as a city of peace 
a day earlier greek and turkish factions from cyprus open two 
days of meetings in a new attempt to resolve the political future 
of the island divided by war 
both sets of talks are brokered by the united nations which has 
its european base at the former league of nations building 
the palace of nations hosts about 8000 meetings a year helping 
make geneva the worlds conference capital 
the heavy un focus is likely to overshadow a third major 
meeting on the citys neutral ground a ussoviet review of the 
antiballistic missile treaty whose outcome could affect 
superpower arms reduction talks 
the geneva spirit saw a renaissance this year with the 
completion of a ussoviet treaty scrapping intermediaterange 
missiles and the signing of a unbacked accord setting a soviet 
troop pullout from afghanistan 
those agreements took years to complete a fate that may befall 
the iraniraq talks called to settle points of conflict after both 
sides accepted a ceasefire in the 8yearold persian gulf war 
international negotiations have marked genevas history for 116 
years since the settlement of a controversy arising from the us 
civil war 
at dispute in 1872 were heavy losses inflicted on 22 union ships 
by a britishequipped confederate frigate the alabama the united 
states and britain agreed to international arbitration and a geneva 
tribunal ruled britain should pay the united states 155 million 
in damages 
nine years earlier henry dunant a geneva native launched the 
idea for the red cross the international red cross today is based 
in geneva 
hopes were high in 1919 when geneva was chosen to be the host of 
the league of nations but in the 1930s the league could do little 
to prevent adolf hitlers rise to power in germany or italys war 
in ethiopia 
it collapsed in world war ii 
the united nations made geneva its european center in 1946 most 
unaffiliated agencies have headquarters in the city including 
the world health organization and the international 
telecommunication union 
superpower efforts to ban all chemical weapons and nuclear tests 
have gone on for years in geneva 
washington and moscow often have extolled the geneva spirit 
after the first summit between president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev in 1985 signaled a new phase in superpower 
relations 
in april the superpowers signed the un agreement on 
afghanistan after six years of negotiations 
secretary of state george p shultz and foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze returned to geneva a month later to settle final 
details of the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty which was 
signed in washington in last year ussoviet talks on cutting 
longrange nuclear arsenals are continuing 
earlier this month representatives of south africa angola and 
cuba met in geneva under us mediation and agreed on first 
concrete moves to end the civil war in angola and declare 
independence for southwest africa but a complete peace package 
still seems a way off 
geneva was the launching pad for international arbitration 
between chile and argentina on the centuryold beagle channel 
dispute and between egypt and israel over competing claims to the 
taba strip 
pope john paul iis mediation was needed before a 
chileargentina settlement was signed in 1982 the taba judges 
inaugurated in 1986 are still deliberating 
many meetings ended inconclusively or in failure such as an 
18nation conference aimed at organizing free elections in both 
koreas the 197375 european conference on security and cooperation 
and a national reconciliation conference between lebanons feuding 
factions 
the 1955 geneva summit with the united states britain france 
and the soviet union failed to ease cold war tensions 
through the ups and downs of diplomacy negotiators from all 
over the world keep flocking to this city 
no other world city is characterized by as total a calm as 
total an absence of political passion in matters of international 
politics former us diplomat george wynne wrote during his 
1970s posting in geneva

president daniel ortega says the us 
democratic and republican parties are imperialist because each 
had an assistance plan for nicaraguan rebels fighting to overthrow 
his government 
ortega said monday he doubted the inauguration of a new american 
administration next year would improve usnicaraguan relations 
but held out hope a democratic administration under michael dukakis 
would seek negotiations 
what we have said is that a future us government democrat 
or republican both have shown themselves to be imperialist be 
responsible and wise enough to have learned the lesson president 
reagan would leave them he said 
both parties have their own plan for aid to the contras and 
arent satisfied that there exists a sovereign free and 
independent government in nicaragua ortega said 
the united states has supported the rebels known as contras 
since 1981 
us military aid for the rebels expired in february on aug 
10 the senate voted largely along party lines for a democratic 
proposal to provide the contras with 27 million in nonlethal 
humanitarian aid after oct 1 and a possible second vote on 163 
million in stockpiled military aid later this year 
a ceasefire has been in effect since march 21 but talks on a 
permanent truce to the civil war broke down in june each side has 
accused the other of violating the truce 
ortega said if dukakis is elected president and is capable of 
executing plans to enter negotiated solutions he would be giving 
the united states the opportunity to vindicate itself before the 
people of latin america 
ortega made his remarks during a ceremony marking the 10th 
anniversary of the seizure of the national palace by sandinista 
guerrillas fighting the government of the late president anastasio 
somoza 
in the salvadoran capital of san salvador six nicaraguan exiles 
staged a peaceful protest inside their countrys embassy to demand 
greater democratization in nicaragua 
the six men representing a group called the united front of 
mestizos of the nicaraguan atlantic coast said they were 
protesting what they called the sandinista governments failure to 
fulfill a yearold regional peace accord 
among other measures the treaty commits central american 
governments to make democratic reforms and negotiate peaceful 
solutions to insurgencies

stopped about 150 opposition representatives from entering a room 
at the legislative palace where millions of ballots are kept the

charges that the pri rigged the election 
earlier monday the governing institutional revolutionary party 
or pri assured the nation a new chamber of deputies will be 
certified by sept 1 
the outgoing president customarily introduces his successor to 
the nation on sept 1 during his final stateoftheunion address

an initiation for incoming boulder high 
school sophomore girls allegedly involved girls smearing themselves 
with chicken excrement and torturing chickens to death a newspaper 
reported today 
up to 10 chickens may have been killed or injured according to 
accounts given to the boulder daily camera by students and other 
witnesses who were at the mall sunday evening 
however police did not report any evidence of such activity 
hal nees division chief of patrol said three officers were sent 
and apparently did not find that chickens were being killed because 
they took no enforcement action 
initiating sophomores is a longstanding tradition in boulder 
some initiators threw chickens high into the air to fall on 
sophomores who were grouped in a circle or onto the pavement the 
newspaper said 
one sophomore who asked that her name not be used told the 
newspaper that initiators took her group of six girls to a park and 
forced them to smear fresh chicken excrement on each other in 
addition the initiators made the girls kiss a beef tongue which 
was dripping blood she said 
boulder high school principal marcy mcmillan called on monday 
for an investigation by police and the boulder county humane 
society we are strongly opposed to any kind of initiation she 
said 
sally shelton of atlanta visiting for her sons university of 
colorado freshman orientation said she saw 10 girls doing 
cartwheels while holding chickens by the neck 
those girls looked frightened and they looked like they were 
in a sort of a stupor she said

tens of thousands of people marched 
through rangoon today to denounce oneparty rule in the largest 
protest in burmas capital since rioting toppled president sein 
lwin a diplomat said 
the western diplomat said he saw more than 50000 people march 
peacefully through downtown streets chanting antigovernment 
slogans it was the second major demonstration in the capital in as 
many days 
down with socialism and welcome democracy shouted 
about 2000 demonstrators outside the us embassy said the 
diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
in mandalay burmas second largest city some 200000 people 
took part in antigovernment demonstrations japans kyodo news 
service said 
the diplomat in rangoon said soldiers withdrew from the downtown 
area this morning and the crowd swelled enormously with doctors and 
nurses in their uniforms artists writers and lawyers joining the 
students buddhist monks and other people who have been rallying 
for an end to 26 years of authoritarian rule 
the government seems to have been reduced to its leaders and 
its troops the diplomat said of a similar protest monday 
todays demonstration was the largest in rangoon since bloody 
rioting aug 812 forced sein lwins resignation after 17 days in 
power maung maung the attorney general assumed power friday as 
the countrys first civilian leader in a quarter century 
protesters have continued rallies calling for the end of the 
exclusive rule of the burma socialist program party a 
militarydominated autocracy whose rigid policies have turned one 
of southeast asias richest nations into one of the worlds poorest 
on monday hundreds of thousands of people filled the streets of 
rangoon mandalay the secondlargest city and other towns in 
response to student calls for protests and a nationwide general 
strike 
some demonstrators in rangoon tried to march to the sule pagoda 
a rallying point for protest but were peacefully stopped by 
barbedwire and other barricades and some of the three divisions of 
troops deployed in the capital diplomats said 
diplomats said mondays show of military force in the capital 
reflected the governments position that while accommodating 
demands for significant economic reforms it would not institute 
political changes that would erode its power 
the western diplomat said the demonstrations present authorities 
with a dilemma the demonstrations will mushroom if they do not use 
force to contain them but force also brings the distinct 
possibility of violence like that which led to the resignation sein 
lwin 
by official count 112 people were killed in rangoon and 267 
wounded as security forces repeatedly opened fire to disperse the 
tens of thousands who marched against the hardline former army 
general 
since sein lwins aug 12 resignation there have been no 
reports of violence in the rallies and the government has indicated 
it will be much more tolerant of open dissent 
more than 500 people arrested during the rioting have been freed 
by the new government among those still held are aung gyi the 
countrys leading dissident and sein win the burma correspondent 
of the associated press both arrested in a sweep in rangoon july

ap president and general manager louis d boccardi sent a telex 
to maung maung today urging sein wins release 
it is our strongly felt hope that one of the first acts of 
your new administration will be the release of our correspondent 
boccardi said in the telex he said sein win 66 has worked for 
the ap for two decades and there was no indication he was involved 
in antigovernment activities as authorities have claimed 
on monday a man claiming to represent 16 burmese university 
student unions said the coalitions president maung maung kwaw 
had come to bangkok seeking weapons from rebels fighting the 
burmese government 
also monday the karen national union one of the strongest 
ethnicbased guerrilla groups fighting the burmese government for 
greater autonomy issued a statement in bangkok declaring support 
for the students and calling on foreign nations to halt aid to the 
government until it ends oneparty rule 
burma has been in turmoil since september when university 
students rioted in the countrys most serious unrest since 1974 
they were protesting the governments voiding of 60 percent of the 
currency a move that dashed savings and hopes in a nation whose 
average per capita income is less than 200 
demonstrations increasingly focused on political demands 
occurred in march and june and sein lwin is said to have 
personally ordered them brutally suppressed 
rioting resumed in late july after sein lwin succeeded ne win 
who had ruled since leading a 1962 coup toppled democracy 
the demonstrations became bloody when troops fired on crowds and 
some protesters fought back diplomats believe the death toll was 
much higher than official figures

an estimated 20000 undocumented farm workers in 
the southeast will get another opportunity to obtain legal status 
and remove the threat of deportation 
in a temporary injunction issued monday senior us district 
court judge c clyde atkins concluded the us immigration and 
naturalization service was too restrictive in demanding payroll 
stubs from migrant workers seeking workresidency permits under a 
special government amnesty program 
the evidence before this court strongly suggests that despite 
congressional directives applicants are being required to produce 
exactly what they cannot payroll records atkins wrote in a 
40page ruling 
the mostly haitian and mexican workers in florida alabama and 
georgia were often paid in cash and field crew bosses often keep 
insufficient employee records atkins said 
the ins last september stopped accepting employer affidavits and 
required payroll stubs as proof that laborers worked the minimum 
90day period to qualify for the permits without the permits the 
workers faced explusion from the united states 
ins officials disallowed the affidavits because of concerns over 
fraud 
service administrators were not in the office this morning 
congress intended that the program be liberally applied to 
encourage undocumented farm workers to come forward and seek 
legalization atkins wrote 
the ruling also requires ins to give temporary permits to farm 
workers whose applications were not accepted at local offices due 
to lack of payroll stubs and give all laborers a chance to get an 
official explanation of their rejection 
the ins also was ordered to provide spanish and creole 
translators to assist workers with the applications 
i am really elated by this we were hoping for something 
exactly like this said sheryl little an attorney with the 
haitian refugee center in miami one of the principal plaintiffs in 
the suit that went to trial earlier this summer 
ms little estimated 20000 workers in the three states will be 
affected by the ruling the plaintiffs which also included the 
roman catholic diocese of palm beach county and individual migrant 
workers decided to seek a regional case rather than try for a 
nationwide ruling 
this is a nationwide problem but we wanted to try it here

two estonian scholars today called for greater 
economic independence from moscow for their republic on the 49th 
anniversary of an agreement that led to the soviet takeover of 
estonia and two other republics 
activists said thousands of demonstrators from latvia lithuania 
and estonia were planning to commemorate the signing on aug 23 
1939 of a secret nonaggression pact between the soviet union and 
nazi germany 
the pact divided eastern europe into spheres of soviet and 
german influence and led to the soviet takeover of the three 
independent baltic republics a year later soviet officials say the 
pact bought their country a crucial two years to prepare for war 
with germany 
activists in latvia and lithuania told the associated press that 
authorities have granted them permission for outdoor meetings for 
the purpose of recalling the victims of dictator josef stalins 
purges but they said demonstrators undoubtedly would use the 
gatherings to mark the signing of the nonaggression pact 
mikhail bombin correspondent for the dissident journal 
expresschronicle said 1000025000 people were expected at a 
rally in the latvian port of riga 
valdas analauskas the journals correspondent in lithuania 
said a large crowd gathered monday night in the central square in 
the capital of vilnius and surrounded about 40 people on a hunger 
strike in support of lithuanian political prisoners he said there 
had been no action by authorities to break up the protest 
authorities have granted permission for a gathering in a central 
vilnius park tonight analauskas said 
philosopher edgar savisaar and economist i raig writing in 
todays edition of the newspaper sovietskaya kultura called for 
estonia and other republics to be given full responsibility for 
managing their economies estonia is politically and economically 
controlled by the kremlin 
the government is strong when all of its parts are strong the 
parts are strong when they receive the right to be strong only 
then will both the parts and the whole win they said 
savisaar was one of the founders this year of a group called the 
peoples front a citizens organizations that says it supports 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs reforms but demands more 
autonomy for the baltic republics 
the article followed similar calls at a communist party 
conference in moscow at the end of june 
savisaar and raig said the central government should count on 
each of the 15 soviet republics for production of goods and 
services but leave it to the republic to decide how best to 
fulfill the task they said the republics now have little power 
over factories run by powerful moscow ministries 
many estonians are chafing under what they view as the drag on 
their economies by other less developed parts of the soviet union 
and some radicals are seeking a complete break 
the molotovribbentrop pact of 1939 named for soviet foreign 
minister vyacheslav molotov and german foreign minister joachim von 
ribbentrop was published for the first time in the soviet union 
less than two weeks ago by an estonian newspaper

the killing monday night came three days after eight british 
soldiers were slain by another ira bomb 
lt alan shields 45 a royal navy recruiting officer was 
driving into east belfast when a bomb attached to his car blew up 
police said they said shields was the only casualty 
the british newspaper the guardian said some residents jeered as 
the car burned 
the outlawed irish republican army claimed responsibility in a 
telephoned message to a radio station saying it had killed a 
british soldier 
shields was believed to be the first member of the royal navy 
killed by the ira in northern ireland 
the defense ministry responding to a wave of attacks on british 
military personnel in western europe this summer said today the 
distinctive military plates on the 95000 cars driven by military 
personnel and their families in west germany would be replaced by 
ordinary british plates 
the change will make the plates indistinguishable from those on 
cars of british tourists armed forces minister archie hamilton 
said 
four soldiers have died in ira attacks on british army personnel 
in western europe this summer it is suspected the ira identified 
them through plates on their cars 
crispin rodwell a news photographer who was driving about 50 
yards behind the car said it just exploded and was immediately 
engulfed in flames several people ran forward with fire 
extinguishers but the flames were very intense 
they sprayed it but couldnt get close enough to have any 
effect and the driver was still inside rodwell said 
the attack followed an ira bombing 50 miles west of belfast on 
saturday that killed eight british soldiers in a military bus and 
injured 27 others 
in london staff at prime minister margaret thatchers office 
said she was saddened and angered by yet another senseless 
killing 
mrs thatcher ordered a major security review following the bomb 
attack saturday the deadliest ira attack on the military since 
1982 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
protestantdominated northern ireland and unite it with the 
overwhelmingly catholic irish republic under socialist rule 
mrs thatcher said monday that detention without trial of people 
suspected of guerrilla activity had not been ruled out 
ken maginnis a protestant member of parliament from northern 
ireland who urged mrs thatcher to reinstate the policy said he 
gave her the names of three ira men he claimed were involved in the 
saturday bombing 
he claimed internment of 5070 top flight ira organizers 
would drastically reduce violence in northern ireland 
internment was introduced in northern ireland in 1971 and about 
2000 people were held without trial before it was abandoned in 
december 1975 amid world criticism

michael dukakis today said george bush 
has no business in the white house if he supports mandatory 
recitation of the pledge of allegiance in schools 
dukakis also called his republican opponents plan to erase the 
federal deficit son of voodoo economics 
dukakis beginning the second day of a gubernatorial trip to 
northeastern massachusetts urged students to say the pledge of 
allegiance at the start of the school day but said it would be 
unconstitutional to make it mandatory 
i say the pledge of allegiance thats not the issue 
dukakis said 
bush and other republicans have criticized dukakis for vetoing a 
state measure that would have penalized teachers if they did not 
lead their students in the pledge of allegiance dukakis did so 
after the state supreme court citing us supreme court precedent 
said the legislation was unconstitutional 
you have no alternative but to veto it if youre true to your 
oath dukakis told area newspapers editors youre under a 
constitutional oath to veto it is the vice president 
suggesting something else if he does he has no business running 
for the office 
the democratic nominee also lambasted bushs call for a flexible 
freeze on federal spending as a means of balancing the budget 
there is no republican plan dukakis said after detailing 
his plan to freeze military spending reduce some domestic programs 
and collect unpaid taxes the vice president is talking about a 
flexible freeze thats like a melting ice cube thats the son 
of voodoo economics 
on monday night cia director william webster briefed dukakis 
and running mate lloyd bentsen on national security and foreign 
affairs 
participants refused to comment on the session one of a series 
of briefings dukakis and bentsen already a member of the senate 
intelligence committee are entitled to as the democratic 
presidential and vice presidential nominees 
dukakis during a visit to lowell on monday said his campaign 
has been trying to complete arrangements for three debates with 
bush hosted by a bipartisan commission established under a joint 
agreement between republicans and democrats 
dukakis said the bush campaign has not responded to inquiries 
about debates but that he hoped the first encounter scheduled by 
the commission for sept 14 could be devoted to national security 
and foreign policy 
bush frequently criticizes dukakis as inexperienced on those 
fronts and did so again monday in the context of us involvement 
in the persian gulf 
dukakis was quick to fire back 
how anyone who sat there and did nothing while we sold arms to 
the ayatollah can seriously talk about leadership in the persian 
gulf is beyond me dukakis told a news conference 
he also continued to question bushs judgment in selecting sen 
dan quayle of indiana as his running mate and said voters should 
compare the vice presidential nominees closely as they weigh their 
vote for president 
how we make decisions how we make the presidential 
selections who we select whether or not that person should be 
a heartbeat away from the presidency obviously will be an issue in 
this campaign dukakis said 
quayle has been embroiled in controversy since it was revealed 
last week that an employee of his wealthy familys newspaper chain 
who had ties to the indiana national guard recommended quayle to 
guard officials at the height of the vietnam war by serving in the 
guard quayle a staunch conservative avoided combat duty 
quayles father also has been quoted as saying his son talked his 
way into law school because his grades were not good enough 
dukakis said he considered the military records of candidates 
for the presidency and vice presidency relevant as a campaign issue 
but refused to answer directly when asked if he considered quayle 
qualified to be vice president 
this is a judgment the american people will have to make 
dukakis said theyve had an opportunity now to watch michael 
dukakis make his selection and george bush make his decision and 
they will judge us on this and other issues 
dukakis defended his military record from an attack by new york 
republican rep gerald solomon who criticized dukakis for 
deferring his military service while attending swarthmore college 
during the korean war 
dukakis said he could have applied for further deferments and 
entered law school upon graduating swarthmore in 1955 but instead 
asked to be drafted immediately and entered the army less than two 
months after graduation 
the truce ending the war had been signed by then but dukakis 
served 16 months in korea near the demilitarized zone 
im very proud of that service and very proud of the 
opportunity it gave me to serve my country said dukakis who 
suggested solomon was trying to deflect attention from the quayle 
controversy 
i dont think its a coincidence that a republican congressman 
raised it dukakis said it will be up to the republican party 
to explain all this

the preaching children who frequently were 
suspended from school last year for screaming bible verses rather 
enter class stayed home today while representatives of their 
parents and the school held a meeting 
dan rodden president of the chicagobased caleb campaign a 
nonprofit christian civil rights organization which has agreed to 
intercede on behalf of the strode family said the two sides were 
trying to work out a solution 
duffey matthew and pepper strodes first day of school monday 
at eastfield elementary lasted less than a minute and duffey was 
suspended again 
at the school gate duffey 11 and matthew 6 began to shout 
bible verses and pepper 7 yelled repent 
we were there to welcome them to school said eastfield 
principal jim gorst duffey stuck his bible in my face and he 
said you go to hell 
i have trouble when a child says that to an adult and an 
authority figure 
all three children were suspended repeatedly last spring when 
they stood behind the school screaming bible verses and refused to 
enter the building when asked their favorite verse is hebrews 
134 marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled but 
whoremongers and fornicators god will judge 
parents of other eastfield children are angry 
i think its going to get worse said linda vaughn whose 
two children attend eastfield he aint got no right to call our 
kids whores and whoremongers that little stupid brat i aint seen 
no whores over here 
rodden threatened legal action 
the school system has basically violated these peoples civil 
rights said rodden said although their methods are offensive 
to many people i think the school system has overreacted 
we have an attorney who is working on this case and were 
paying their legal fees he said were not trying to bring a 
lawsuit although we will if we have to 
mcdowell schools superintendent david ricketts responded im 
ready let er rip ive had it with this thing its getting on my 
nerves 
ricketts on friday notified the childrens parents david and 
robin strode that they would be barred from the school grounds 
monday morning 
so the strodes brought duffey matthew and pepper to the school 
gate where friends barry and dianna weaver were to escort the 
children to the front door 
at the gate gorst told the weavers they wouldnt be allowed on 
the school grounds and that he and ricketts would take the children 
to class 
a mcdowell county sheriffs deputy approached duffey held 
matthews hand and pepper began to cry 
duffey says he turned to gorst and said youll go to hell 
thats it ricketts said youre suspended 
gorst said duffey told him you go to hell 
duffey was suspended for 10 days for disruptive and 
disrespectful behavior said shirley ramsey the assistant 
principal at eastfield elementary she warned that a longterm 
suspension that could last the entire school year can be enacted 
at any point 
ricketts said it was time to think about 11 other schools and 
6500 other students 
it is absolutely degrading and demoralizing for a school 
superintendent and his staff to be dealing so much with this when 
we should be doing so many other things that are so much more 
important to the general welfare of our students he said

a retired major general in the indiana 
national guard said today he told subordinates to hold open a space 
for dan quayle after a longtime friend called the general to 
recommand quayle as a good man for the guard 
retired major gen alfred ahner who in 1969 was military 
support plans officer for the state of indiana and later headed the 
state guard said he was contacted that spring by wendell 
phillippi an old friend and the managing editor of a newspaper 
owned by quayles family 
wendell phillippi had called and said he had a good man and 
said the thought hed make a good guardsman ahner said in a 
telephone interview from indiana thats when i went over to 
personnel i asked if they had any spaces for a good man 
they said they had a couple spaces i said hold one of them 
theres a good guy coming over 
asked about a report in todays editions of the cleveland plain 
dealer that said the indiana guard was at virtually full strength 
when quayle was accepted ahner said he did not know what numbers 
the story which quoted from the guards 1969 annual report 
referred to 
ahner said he had been assured by two guard personnel people 
that there were spaces he said some units were filled but others 
had openings 
you could recruit to fill vacancies we couldnt take him 
if there wasnt any opening ahner said he said quayle was 
accepted into the guards headquarters unit which was pretty 
selective the unit looked for recruits with intelligence and 
leadership potential 
he also said it was not unusual for guard officials to take such 
recommendations because former guard officials such as phillippi 
who had been the guards commander would have an eye for who might 
make a good guardsman ahner said quayle received no preferential 
treatment during his service 
quayle in a hastily arranged speech monday to the veterans of 
foreign wars convention in chicago said he had not used his 
familys influence to get into the guard during the vietnam war 
influence was not even necessary if i had chosen to use it 
which i never would have he said the reason is because my 
indiana national guard unit had openings before i applied they had 
openings when i applied and they had openings after i applied so 
there was absolutely no influence used 
the plain dealer however said today that the annual report 
shows the guard had imposed severe restrictions on recruitment 49 
days before quayles enlistment on may 19 1969 
the newspaper said the report said that due to some 
overstrength recruiting has been authorized on a limited basis 
since 1 april 
in addition the newspaper said in a copyrighted story that by 
june the state guard had 52 more members than were authorized by 
law 
the newspaper said the report had been signed by guard brig 
gen john h owens 
asked for comment by the newspaper owens said 
i dont know anything about that i went back to the official 
report in washington which showed 136 authorized spaces in his 
quayles unit in april may and june and they never had over 132 
people 
monday night quayles campaign aides gave out an aug 19 
statement released by the indiana national guard saying quayles 
unit had vacancies the month before the month of and the month 
after the senators enlistment 
quayles speech won praise from many veterans 
quayle showed a lot of backbone by coming here tonight said 
tom gerlach 38 a vietnam combat veteran from dayton ohio he 
made a strong impression i think he probably picked up a lot of 
support 
i think in a way quayles military service is kind of blown 
out of proportion said billy stansberry of joplin mo who also 
served in vietnam if the mans qualified thats all that 
matters to me 
the crowd cheered when the indiana senator opened his brief 
remarks by joking my national guard unit was never called up to 
active duty but let me say that after these last 72 hours no one 
can say ive never faced combat 
quayle a promilitary conservative on capitol hill told the 
veterans he hoped his remarks would end the controversy over 
whether he pulled strings to enter the national guard in 1969 as 
his college draft deferment was about to end 
the question before all of us is not what dan quayle did 20 
years in the past but what either president bush or president 
dukakis will do in the future to secure world peace quayle said 
wade ladue the vfws spokesman said the vfw had never formally 
scheduled quayle to speak at the convention but that the nominee 
was invited when republican illinois gov james thompson intervened 
with organization commander in chief earl stock after bushs warm 
reception monday morning 
the vice presidential nominee was scheduled to return to the 
campaign trail wednesday certain to face more questions about his 
past 
paula parkinson was linked again to quayle in a report published 
today in the daily news of los angeles two former attorneys for 
ms paula parkinson said she told the fbi in 1981 that quayle 
propositioned her during a florida trip but she refused him the 
attorneys said ms parkinson told the fbi the request was made when 
quayle and two other legislators shared a cottage with her during 
the 1980 golfing trip according to the daily news 
quayle an indiana senator who has been married since 1972 has 
said he did not have an affair with ms parkinson and a campaign 
spokesman declined comment monday evening about the lawyers 
allegations 
the two lawyers represented ms parkinson when she was 
questioned on march 28 1981 by the fbi during an investigation of 
whether sexual favors were traded for votes against legislation 
meanwhile the des moines register an influential newspaper in 
the farm belt called today for bush to replace quayle who the 
paper said would remain a distraction from the issues throughout 
the campaign 
its tough to admit a mistake but a willingness to see an 
error and to rectify it is a far better quality in a wouldbe 
president than a refusal to do so the newspaper said in an 
editorial

people living near a pharmaceutical 
laboratory that burned down were allowed to return to their homes 
today as officials continued investigating whether smoke from the 
fire was toxic 
clouds of smoke hovering over rexburg and nearby sugar city from 
mondays fire were dispersing and drifting away from populated 
areas said gordon harrop of the rexburgmadison county fire 
department 
an explosion monday afternoon apparently started the fire in the 
ferguson pharmaceuticals laboratory a research and development 
facility where diet supplements were developed for the companys 
2300 diet center franchises in the united states and canada 
the plants 120 employees were on a break no one was injured in 
the explosion or fire but people were evacuated overnight from a 
fourblock area around the plant a madison county sheriffs office 
said 
four people were treated for respiratory complaints at madison 
memorial hospital and released 
ross mayfield operations director for the state bureau of 
disaster services said residents breathing problems may have been 
caused by chlorine and polyvinyl chloride fumes from burning 
plastic containers 
the bureau asked the idaho national engineering laboratory near 
arco to help monitor the cloud for hazardous chemicals 
harrop said the fire was allowed to burn itself out when it was 
clear that the building and its contents could not be saved crews

the captain of the uss dubuque has been 
charged with two counts of violating lawful orders for failing to 
rescue a boatload of vietnamese refugees who claim they later 
resorted to cannibalism to survive 
capt alexander g balian 48 flew to san diego calif on 
sunday after being notified of the charges and is scheduled to 
appear wednesday at a hearing cmdr david dillon a pacific fleet 
spokesman said today 
balian has been assigned a navy lawyer and is currently 
preparing to appear before vice adm george w davis jr the 
commander of all surface ships in the us pacific fleet at a 
socalled admirals mast the spokesman said 
dillon said the captain had been charged under procedures within 
the uniform code of military justice for nonjudicial 
punishment meaning he is not facing a courtmartial 
davis will serve as the lone judge or authority in considering 
the evidence he could take a variety of disciplinary actions 
including stripping balian of his command permanently ordering a 
fine or issuing a letter of reprimand or censure 
balian was temporarily relieved of his command of the dubuque 
earlier this month while on patrol in the persian gulf pending the 
outcome of a navy investigation 
balian has been charged specifically with two counts of 
violating article 92 of the uniform code of military justice for 
failing to heed a lawful order dillon said 
one charge involves a navy regulation and the other involves 
fleet operations orders the spokesman said but both the 
regulation and orders have to do with rendering assistance to 
people adrift on the sea 
the first charge alleges that balian did fail to obey a lawful 
general regulation by wrongfully failing to render appropriate 
assistance to vietnamese refugees found on the south china sea on 
june 9 1988 in danger of being lost 
the second charge alleges that he was derelict in his duty by 
negligently failing to investigate sufficiently and render 
appropriate assistance to vietnamese refugees found on the south 
china sea on june 9 1988 as it was his duty to do 
the dubuque an amphibious landing ship encountered a boatload 
of vietnamese refugees in the south china sea while en route to the 
persian gulf according to the navy the dubuque provided the 
refugees several hundred pounds of food and water and navigational 
aids but did not take them aboard 
the boat people were eventually rescued off the coast of the 
philippines and taken to a refugee camp there where reports of 
killing and cannibalism began to surface 
both the navy and the united nations high commission on refugees 
have been investigating those reports 
some survivors have been quoted as saying they killed and ate 
some of their fellow passengers to stay alive after they 
encountered the dubuque on june 9 two of the victims reportedly 
died of starvation but three others allegedly were killed through 
drowning and then eaten 
some survivors said the dubuque refused to take them aboard even 
though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure and 
starvation 
according to robert cooper the manila representative of the 
un refugee commission 52 refugees survived 37 days at sea but 58 
people died during the crossing the refugees began their journey 
on may 22 from the mekong delta town of ben tre aboard a 35foot 
wooden boat its engine failed two or three days later 
navy regulations specify that warships may pick up refugees on 
the high seas if the vessel theyre traveling in is judged 
unseaworthy bad weather is approaching or there are other 
special circumstances 
in other words its a judgment call by the captain of the 
vessel pentagon spokesman dan howard has said

dying winds and 1200 soldiers flown in to bolster weary 
firefighters in yellowstone national park have helped slow the 
blaze that was threatening two montana towns at the parks 
northeast end 
the threat to cooke city and silver gate is essentially 
over fire operations chief steve frye said today 
with the break in the winds the last two days firefighters 
have had an opportunity to make some significant headway against 
the yellowstone fires that have blackened at least 350000 acres in 
wyoming and montana frye said in an interview on abctvs good 
morning america 
although winds of up to 70 mph over the weekend have died down 
frye said the burning acreage in the northeast clovermist section 
of the park had increased to 21500 acres a jump over the 157000 
acres reported burning over the weekend 
in idaho national guardsmen were called out to help attack a 
700acre fire 
cooler temperatures and relatively light winds monday helped 
firefighters battle the 37000acre warm springs creek forest fire 
southeast of helena mont 
the 2weekold fire which damaged 13 homes and threatened 
scores of others was the us bureau of land managements no 1 
priority monday said jack wilson the agencys top official at the 
interagency fire center in boise idaho which coordinates 
firefighting resources nationwide 
the blaze in the rugged elkhorn mountains was burning in only a 
few spots inside the fire lines monday evening crews had hoped to 
contain it by tonight but after viewing the fire this morning they 
pushed that deadline back to wednesday night said fire information 
officer bob krepps a fire is contained when it is surrounded by a 
fire line 
some of the 2900 firefighters still might be sent home today 
he said while those remaining would finish establishing the fire 
line and dousing hot spots that could flare if winds kicked up 
the infantrymen at yellowstone who arrived monday from fort

the president of the private arms control 
association accused the reagan administration on tuesday of using a 
disputed soviet radar facility in siberia as an excuse to undercut 
the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
the accord restricts us and soviet antimissile defenses a 
review of compliance with the treaty held every five years opens 
on wedneday in geneva 
president reagan has authorized american negotiators to accuse 
the soviets of causing a material breach of the pact with the 
radar facility at krasnoyarsk if the negotiationrs level the 
charge the united states would have the right to break out of the 
treaty 
spurgeon keeny who heads the arms control association agreed 
with the administration that the facility is in violation of the 
treaty but he said a material breach can only be claimed by a 
country seeking an excuse to suspend or terminate the abm treaty 
keeny a former deputy director of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency said it may set in motion a series of events 
that could have a very serious impact 
the treaty restricts us and soviet defenses on the theory the 
likelihood of sustaining devastating nuclear retaliation would 
inhibit a potential aggressor from launching a nuclear attack 
reagan in two reports to congress has charged that krasnoyarsk 
violates the treaty 
the soviets claim the facility is part of a legal system of 
tracking space vehicles us officials contend krasnoyarsk is 
intended to be part of a battle management strategy 
keeny said the soviets had taken some forthcoming steps 
since us intelligence identified krasnoyarsk in 1983 a 
congressional delegation was permitted to make an inspection and 
construction at krasnoyarsk was discontinued last fall 
the soviets also have said they would dismantle the facility if 
the united states agreed to adhere to the treaty 
critics of the reagan administration suspect the treaty may be 
abandoned in order to clear the way for more extensive testing of 
the us strategic defense initiative known popularly as star 
wars 
the program seeks to develop a spacebased shield against soviet 
nuclear attack it is based on the view that the theory behind the 
abm treaty is outdated and that the soviets are developing their 
own antimissile defenses anyway 
keeny said krasnoyark does not represent a threat to us 
national security but that the white house was taking a very 
confrontational approach to the soviets on the subject 
ralph earle a former director of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency urged the reagan administration to apply the 
rule of reason to the dispute 
he said krasnoyarsk does not undermine the treaty as a whole 
and that the soviets are seeking a facesaving solution 
earle said krasnoyarsk was designed to provide early warning 
of a nuclear attack which is legal but it is not located on 
the periphery of soviet territory as the treaty requires 
keeny and earle spoke at a news conference sponsored by the arms 
control association and the carnegie endowment for international 
peace another private research group

the number of homicides in houston this year is 
up by more than 40 percent with more drugrelated killings 
reported during the first eight months of 1988 than in all of 1987 
police records show 
as of sunday 300 homicides had occurred in houston compared 
with 209 through aug 21 1987 sixtynine slayings this year are 
believed to have been drugrelated 19 more than in 1987 records 
show 
police speculated that drug killings are increasing because of 
the popularity of crack cocaine and an influx of colombian and 
jamaican drug dealers who are believed to be more violent than the 
typical local street dealer 
evidently the competition is getting stiffer said sgt john 
burmester theres big money involved and people will kill each 
other for little money 
the fbis uniform crime report for 1987 said houston had a rate 
of 138 homicides per 100000 inhabitants below new yorks 204 
detroits 202 miamis 201 los angeles 166 and new orleans

king john is one of shakespeares least 
performed historical plays and the situation wont change after 
the revival of the drama in central park by the new york 
shakespeare festival 
the play is a pageantry about greed but not much of its 
celebration of selfinterest or anything else for that matter 
comes across in the public theaters sprawling and haphazard 
production 
thats because director stuart vaughan lets his actors do what 
they want resulting in a clash of acting styles that leaves more 
blood on the stage than any of fight coordinator bh barrys 
awkwardly choreographed battles 
john is not the most forceful of shakespeares monarchs in this 
production kevin conway plays him as a petulant difficult child 
but its still a performance with little personality despite a few 
minor tantrums conway practically disappears into the dour gray 
scenery by lindsay w davis his death at the end of the play seems 
little more than an aside to all the fight scenes that have gone 
before 
jay o sanders is more forceful as philip supposedly the 
illegitimate son of richard the lionhearted philip is the one 
fictional character in the play and dominates the evening hes a 
kind of master of ceremonies a notdisinterested everyman who 
comments on and participates in the action sanders plays him a 
little too comically and an illfitting wig that makes him look 
like a redhaired prince valiant doesnt help his performance 
the productions best acting comes from devon michaels as the 
young arthur johns nephew and the rightful heir to the throne 
hes direct and straightforward in his interpretation of the little 
prince and even manages to get some of the poetry shakespeare put 
in the play 
mariette hartley late of the early morning television wars 
struggles with the role of constance arthurs vengeful mother she 
has about as much success as she did on cbs trying to wrestle 
audiences away from today and good morning america 
king john is the fifth production in the new york 
shakespeare festivals marathon of all the bards plays so far 
the festival has had better luck with its exuberant renditions of 
two comedies a midsummer nights dream and much ado about 
nothing the tragedies and historical dramas like king john 
have defeated the festivals efforts 
in other reviews clive barnes in the new york post said it 
has clarity and purpose a handful of performances worth 
cherishing a few lively swordfights and an interestingly 
uncluttered view of shakespeares england through his slanted 
perspective of english history 
howard kissel wrote in the daily news the production 
visually dull is not likely to win new friends for king john 
but it presents the play with clarity and occasionally force 
frank rich in the new york times wrote though king john 
is far better acted than the deadly allstar julius caesar that 
mr vaughan fielded in the spring it is staged in the same way 
colorless standardissue sets and costumes attenuated and cliched 
battle sequences a stiff frontandcenter procession of scene 
after scene the play is dispensed like medicine 
linda winer wrote in newsday that the production is ultimately 
a provocative staging of one of shakespeares least familiar 
history plays since this john has been directed by stuart 
vaughan who recently bashed julius caesar stupid with martin 
sheen and al pacino and since it costars mariette hartley most 
renowned from polaroid commercials and the last failed cbs morning 
show this accomplishment is even more of a pleasant surprise

the foot may be connected to the ankle 
but the ankle is not the podiatrists domain a court has ruled 
the podiatrists had urged the high court to accept a 1984 ruling 
by the board of examiners in podiatry that the ankle is part of 
the foot and the foot is part of the ankle and therefore 
podiatrists could treat ankle ailments 
but state supreme court upheld a lower court ruling barring 
podiatrists from treating ankle ailments 
the high court ruling in the podiatrists appeal of a ruling 
won by the connecticut state medical society said the superior 
court had correctly relied on common usage and the dictionary 
definition of foot 
had the legislature intended to include the ankle in the 
definition of foot it could easily have done so wrote supreme 
court justice t clark hull in the unanimous opinion

gov buddy roemer said today he will 
probably delay the execution this week of a convicted killer who 
has maintained his innocence for more than a decade 
the state pardon board recommended monday night that ronald 
monroes sentence for the 1977 stabbing death of lenora collins be 
reduced to life imprisonment 
roemer said during a news conference today that monroes case 
has been giving me personal concern for some time 
monroe 33 is scheduled to die in the electric chair early 
thursday 
although roemer said he was leaning against a commutation he 
said he probably would stay the execution for up to 100 days to 
allow courts to review the case roemer said he would issue a 
decision later in the day 
louisianas three governors since the us supreme court 
reinstated the death penalty in 1976 have refused to intervene in 
pending executions 
in a brief statement pardon board chairman yvonne campbell said 
the panel found that monroe had been deprived of due process of 
law she would not elaborate or disclose how board members voted 
monroe maintaining that he had not killed lenora collins 
pleaded for clemency during a hearing at the louisiana state 
penitentiary here monday 
i am innocent and will be innocent until the day i die he 
said 
prosecutors contend collins was killed after she told monroe he 
was being evicted from an apartment in the familys duplex 
defense attorney douglas morris said a confession to collins 
slaying by another man raised enough questions to justify a life 
sentence 
i think that anyone who studies the facts of this case will 
realize there is a grave doubt about who committed this crime 
morris said 
he said monroe has an iq of 77 and reads no better than a 
thirdgrader 
courts have rejected the defense contention that george stinson 
convicted in the 1980 stabbing death of his commonlaw wife in 
pontiac mich told a cellmate francis lee mcwilliams that he 
killed collins 
mcwilliams told police that stinson said only that collins had 
been killed in the same way as his wife according to testimony 
family members including monroes wife jo ann and his 
daughter told the board that monroe was quiet and introverted and 
had no previous record of violence 
the chief witnesses against monroe in his 1980 trial were 
collins two children who were 11 and 12 years old when she was 
slain in 1977 the daughter theodise was stabbed in the back when 
she tried to help her mother 
on monday theodise collins again identified monroe as the 
killer 
monroe said he was sleeping in his apartment at the time of the 
killing 
the case has been through the courts several times the us 
supreme court has rejected appeals twice a third request to block 
the execution was filed last week 
eighteen people have died in louisianas electric chair since 
1976 three of them this year

the parents of a rape victim staked out 
the location of the attack for more than a year with the wife as 
decoy and her armed husband waiting in the dark their persistence 
paid off with the arrest of a man police say is responsible for as 
many as 60 rapes 
obviously they had really carefully thought out what they 
were going to do debra seltzer rape prevention coordinator of 
the local chapter of women against rape said tuesday it really 
shows the frustration that a lot of people feel 
police on monday announced the arrest of robert biddings 34 of 
columbus who authorities say is a suspect in a fouryear string of 
attacks attributed to the socalled handcuff rapist the 
nickname resulted from the use of handcuffs in early attacks later 
attributed to the same man 
biddings was being held on one count of rape and two counts of 
kidnapping in lieu of bonds totaling 750000 but police said they 
would seek to have him charged with as many as five dozen rapes 
were talking about 60 rapes and over 100 felony charges 
altogether said capt antone lanata 
in announcing the arrest police said only that they were led to 
biddings by the victim of an attempted rape who was able to give 
police a license number of a car driven by her alleged assailant 
police said they traced the car to biddings and arrested him 
thursday 
however a court document shows the victim cited was a woman 
whose daughter had been raped in the same spot in june 1987 the 
woman was acting as a decoy to apprehend her daughters attacker 
according to a search warrant affidavit police filed with the 
franklin county municipal court 
the affidavit said the older woman was standing at a bus stop on 
the citys near east side about 1030 pm aug 5 when she was 
approached by a man grabbed from behind carried to a nearby yard 
and thrown to the ground 
the suspect then produced a small black revolver pointed the 
firearm at the woman and stated i blow your head off the 
affidavit says 
the womans husband who had been watching from a car then ran 
up behind the man and said freeze police according to the 
affidavit the attacker fled but the husband obtained the license 
number of the mans vehicle according to the court document 
police said the couple identified biddings photo from a group 
of 11 photos later their 23yearold daughter picked biddings 
photo from a similar group 
the columbus dispatch reported in a copyright story tuesday that 
the parents had spent several nights a week for the last year in 
search of their daughters attacker despite warnings from police 
that they were placing their lives in danger and probably wasting 
their time 
the father said he knew police were understaffed and could not 
spend as much time on the case as he and his wife wanted the 
dispatch interviewed the father monday but efforts to reach him 
tuesday were unsuccessful there is no listing for the couple in 
the columbus telephone directory and the affidavit did not 
identify the couples hometown 
lanata refused to confirm the newspapers account 
i didnt give it to them and i dont intend to comment on 
their story he said 
deborah emm author of a doctoral dissertation on survivors of 
sexual assaults said the parents eagerness to see their 
daughters attacker brought to justice was not unusual but their 
persistence was 
i certainly couldnt endorse it said ms emm who is 
director of survivors of crime a local hospitalaffiliated 
organization that helps victims and their families deal with 
assaults but she said its certainly understandable why people 
would do this 
usually people try to do that shortly after the assault 
occurs and theyre usually not successful she said people 
who are close to a victim feel victimized themselves sometimes 
they feel more a victim than the one who was assaulted

educating americas youth is expected to cost 
4810 per student in public elementary and secondary schools this 
year an increase of more than 2000 since 1980 the department of 
education reported tuesday 
the financial investment we are making in our childrens 
education is immense we must produce better results for our 
investment for our young people and for the future of our 
nation said education secretary william j bennett in releasing 
the agencys backtoschool forecast 
the new estimate puts spending on education well ahead of 
inflation in this decade department statistics show 
the 2762 per pupil spending of the 198081 school year would 
have risen to 3462 if simply adjusted to reflect increases in 
the federal consumer price index yet the department expects 
spending to top that by nearly 39 percent 
increased spending by state and local governments in an effort 
to improve schools was cited by statistician vance grant as a major 
reason for spending being ahead of inflation 
during the same period between the 198081 school year and 
198889 salaries for teachers have increased from 17644 to 
29573 the report shows 
since inflation would have raised teacher pay to just 21286 in 
the period their salaries led inflation by the same amount as 
perpupil spending did 39 percent 
overall the agency expects education spending at all levels 
public and private to rise to 328 billion for the coming school 
year a record that is up from 3088 billion last year and 1828 
billion in 198081 
spending by colleges and universities is expected to reach 132 
billion up 66 percent from last year while elementary and 
secondary spending is up 60 percent to 196 billion 
total enrollment in the nations schools and colleges is 
expected to reach 585 million students thats about 100000 more 
than last year fourfifths of which are accounted for by increases 
in elementary and secondary enrollment 
elementary enrollments continue to rise because of the surge in 
births that began in 1977 rising from 3238 million last year to 
3284 million the number of students in high school continues to 
decline somewhat falling from last years 1351 million to 1314 
million expected in classes this fall

the state department has questioned israels 
expulsion of palestinians from the troubled west bank but an 
israeli spokesman on tuesday defended the policy as a measure of 
last resort in dealing with agitation 
the disagreement underscores a split between the us and 
israeli governments over palestinian unrest that has claimed more 
than 200 lives in the last eight months 
the latest us complaint was registered unannounced monday 
when deputy secretary of state john c whitehead summoned oded 
eran the deputy israeli ambassador to his office 
on several occasions the state department has also taken the 
public offensive against israel on the issue by authorizing 
spokesmen to criticize the expulsion of palestinians as unjustified 
the us position is that if individuals are accused of illegal 
acts they should be charged and prosecuted not summarily banned 
from the territory that israel has held since 1967 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley declined tuesday to

a blind man had his guide dog on 
hand while his wife gave birth after hospital officials agreed to a 
compromise between the needs of the dog and the baby 
brad schuler 23 and his seeing eye dog theo were in a 
critical stage of the dogs training aug 14 when schulers wife 
teresa went into labor schuler had told officials at traverse 
city osteopathic hospital that he couldnt be separated from the 
70pound labrador retriever and asked to bring him into the 
delivery room 
schuler said that because he and the dog had been together for 
just a month a separation could have made the dog distraught and 
undone 18 months of training 
but federal law prohibits dogs even seeing eye dogs from 
delivery rooms 
after consulting with state and federal health officials and 
colleagues at more than 20 other hospitals officials decided to 
let theo watch the couple from the bathroom while mrs schuler lay 
in labor for six hours until giving birth to a baby girl stephanie 
the dog handled it real well schuler said he was a 
professional 
i had my reservations said julie dixon who delivered the 
infant but it went very smoothly i dont know if brad could 
have been there otherwise because he needed to be with his dog 
that is a heck of a choice to have to make

the sunken ferry ellis island which carried 12 
million immigrants to manhattan and new jersey was outfitted with 
pontoons tuesday but sprang a leak before workers could refloat it 
a navy crew started pumping water out of the vessel at 10 am 
and attached pontoons to it an hour later said manny strumpf a 
spokesman for the national park service 
at around noon the pressure caused an 8foot by 12foot plywood 
patch to collapse over the engine room and water rushed back into 
the boat said strumpf the pumping was halted until wednesday 
strumpf said it normally would take several hours for the ferry 
aided by the rising tide to float to the surface 
work began in april to refloat the vessel which sank in 1968 in 
a slip between the northern and southern portions of the 275acre 
island 
the doubledecked ferry began service in 1904 for what was then 
the bureau of immigration it made its last run nov 29 1954 and 
was docked at ellis island until it sank 
the 160footlong vessel could carry 1000 immigrants in its 
hold and about 25 officials and visitors on the top it also was 
outfitted with a 12bed sick bay and a padded cell for violent 
mental patients 
now all that remains of the ferry is its 160foot by 45foot 
castiron hull 
five naval reserve units have removed 500 tons of mud and 
patched holes in the deck divers brought up benches linoleum 
tile map fixtures pulley systems a captains chair and other 
items 
the park service decided the sunken ferry had become a 
navigational hazard the channel is being dredged for newer ferries 
its raising is the first step in resolving the problem while 
respecting the ships historical significance the park service 
said in a statement

orders for big ticket durable goods hurt 
by a drop in demand in the volatile transportation sector fell a 
sharp 7 percent in july the biggest setback in four years the 
government reported tuesday 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last at least three years fell 88 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 1166 billion last month as demand dropped off 
for ships and tanks autos and aircraft 
the july decline was the largest since a 72 percent drop in 
april 1984 but it followed on the heels of an 87 percent june 
increase which had been the largest onemonth advance in more than 
six years 
economists said they were not concerned by the turnabout 
contending that it primarily reflected the fact that orders for 
expensive capital goods were notoriously volatile from month to 
month they said the july report did nothing to shake their belief 
that manufacturing will remain strong in the months ahead 
the july drop is not indicating any real weakness in the 
industrial sector of the economy said bruce steinberg senior 
economist at merrill lynch the backlog of unfilled orders is 
sufficiently fat that we should have very solid production gains 
for the rest of the year 
the manufacturing sector has been one of the economys standouts 
in 1988 as american producers have benefited from a weaker dollar 
which has made their products more competitive on overseas markets 
analysts said that even though the dollar has been gaining in 
value since june they saw little danger that american goods would 
be priced out of overseas markets 
july should not be seen as anything but a onemonth pause in 
what has been a very strong area of economic activity said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co 
michael evans head of his own washingtonbased economic 
forecasting firm said the orders report should calm inflation 
fears that have been building in the financial markets because of 
concerns that factory operating rates were at such high levels 
the orders numbers are back to normal everybody knew that the 
june number was a fluke he said this is entirely consistent 
with the fact that were going to have slower growth in the second 
half 
the big surge in june and the hefty drop in july reflected wide 
swings in orders for transportation goods which had soared by 333 
percent in june only to plunge 212 percent in july to a monthly 
total of 297 billion 
about half of the july drop in transportation was attributed to 
a decline in defense orders for ships and tanks with the rest of 
the weakness coming from declines in orders for autos and aircraft 
without the big swings in transportation orders would have 
fallen 09 percent in july after rising 07 percent in june 
military orders fell by 439 percent in july to 78 billion 
following a 688 percent surge in this volatile category in the 
previous month 
orders in the category of nondefense capital goods were 
basically unchanged in july at 354 billion following a big 124 
percent increase in june this sector which reflects industry 
plans to expand and modernize production facilities has been 
strong all year as manufacturers have boosted spending to meet 
rising export demand 
orders for primary metals such as steel dropped 03 percent in 
july to 122 billion the second consecutive small monthly decline 
orders for the machinery category which includes computers fell 
56 percent to 207 billion while a second machinery category rose 
38 percent to 192 billion 
shipments of durable goods dropped 26 percent to 1134 billion 
following a 15 percent increase in june

former black panther huey newton told 
officials today that he wont leave the prison where hes been 
serving time for a parole violation unless a fellow inmate and 
former panther is also released 
the other inmate convicted killer elmer geronimo pratt 
two weeks ago lost his eighth bid for parole after a state panel 
called him a danger to the public 
pratt a former deputy defense minister of the black panther 
party is serving a life term for murdering a santa monica woman 
during a 30 robbery he was convicted in 1972 of killing 
27yearold caroline olsen 
pratts supporters contend that he is a political prisoner and 
the victim of police efforts to jail panther leaders and dismantle 
the oaklandbased radical movement of the late 1960s and early 70s 
san quentin spokeswoman jeanne ballatore said that prison 
officers filed a disciplinary action against newton for refusing to 
obey a direct order by guards to prepare for his release today he 
was serving a 60day sentence 
a state parole board panel at the prison will hold an informal 
hearing today to review the case and decide whether the offense 
merits additional time in custody she said 
newton has the option of accepting their recommendation and 
remaining in prison if that is their finding ballatore said 
whatever the board rules newton may refuse the recommendation 
and remain in custody pending a complete hearing she said 
newton was charged with the 1967 killing of an oakland policeman 
and convicted of manslaughter but that conviction was overturned 
on appeal after he served two years in prison the charge was 
dropped after two retrials ended in hung juries 
he was convicted in 1974 because of an assault conviction in 
1964 of possessing a firearm allegedly used in the pistolwhipping 
of his tailor he then fled the country and lived for three years 
in cuba he was acquitted of a charge of assault in connection with 
the incident 
newton is scheduled to finish parole on feb 8 1989 
he was jailed at san quentin for parole violations that included 
failure to submit to drug testing and failure to advise his parole 
officer that he had been arrested for investigation of driving 
under the influence of alcohol or drugs

a tropical depression in the caribbean fizzled and 
was downgraded today to a tropical wave while two other 
depressions brewed in the atlantic as peak hurricane season 
approaches 
we were expecting this one to have really picked up steam by 
now but that just hasnt materialized forecaster bob case said 
of the tropical wave about 300 miles south of kingston jamaica 
the system which at its strongest had winds of nearly 30 mph 
was still producing widespread showers and thunderstorms over the 
caribbean the system will continue to be watched but regeneration 
is unlikely the national hurricane center reported 
meanwhile the newest tropical depression formed monday in the 
middle atlantic ocean east of the lesser antilles the 
westwardmoving systems highest sustained winds were near 35 mph 
around a loose center roughly 100 miles east of the island of 
dominica forecasters said in a noon edt advisory today the 
depression was moving westward at 20 mph and was not expected to 
change in course or strength though today 
a third depression was located about 350 miles northwest of the 
northernmost cape verde islands off west africa it was moving 
westnorthwest at 15 mph into colder water a course and speed it 
was expected to maintain for the next day or two its highest 
sustained winds were estimated near 35 mph 
depressions are upgraded to named tropical storms when their 
sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74 
mph 
there have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988 atlantic 
ocean hurricane season but neither reached hurricane strength 
case noted earlier that three depressions at the same time is 
normal at this point in the atlantic hurricane season which began 
june 1 and ends nov 30

a proposed treaty to cut us and soviet 
longrange nuclear arsenals would do little to reduce casualties in 
a war because it does not eliminate the most advanced weapons 
according to a new study 
in an article published in the september issue of scientific 
american four scholars estimate that 12 million to 27 million 
americans and 15 million to 32 million soviets would die in the 
initial stages of a nuclear holocaust and that tens of millions 
more would die later of starvation and disease 
the scientific american article by frank von hippel barbara g 
levi theodore a postol and william h daugherty breaks new 
ground by estimating the possible number of victims based on the 
proposed strategic arms reduction treaty start which would slash 
superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent 
their calculations are based on the assumption that the 
superpowers with reduced nuclear aresenals would concentrate on 
military rather than civilian targets 
the estimates include the number of people killed by each 
warhead those killed shortly thereafter by superfires ignited 
by the intense heat of nuclear explosions and those who are likely 
to die from the immediate effects of radiation 
estimates of the number of people who could die in a nuclear war 
vary greatly many more would die if the superpowers concentrated 
on civlian rather than military targets 
both superpowers have enough warheads to enable them even 
after their strategic forces had suffered a worst case nuclear 
attack to explode the equivalent of 200 megatons over enemy 
cities and cause about 100 million immediate deaths in the united 
states and soviet union according to the scientific american 
article 
a us government study released last year reached a similar 
conclusion the federal emergency management agency which directs 
the us civil defense program predicted that most american 
manufacturing and administrative centers would be destroyed in a 
nuclear war resulting in the deaths of an estimated 11191 million 
people 
the authors of the scientific american article in calculating 
the relationship between the proposed start agreement and the 
number of likely casualities concluded that a dangerous 
situation can be prevented if nuclear forces are structured in such 
a way that neither side would gain an advantage by striking first 
a start agreement as outlined in the current negotiations 
would not achieve this since it would allow each side to retain 
its most modern multiplewarhead missiles the article said 
the authors hypothesized that if each side kept multiplewarhead 
missiles rather than switching to singlewarhead missiles they 
would favor socalled counterforce attacks designed to destroy 
an enemys nuclear arsenal in the opening minutes of a war 
such a counterforce strike could vastly reduce the ability of an 
opponent to launch a counterattack 
the authors estimated that there are 1215 military facilities 
in the united states and 1740 in the soviet union 
the disparity between the numbers is due to the fact that the 
soviet union has more missile silos than the united states they 
said 
many projected victims reside in cities near military 
installations such as command posts in washington air fields for 
tankers in chicago milwaukee phoenix and salt lake city nuclear 
submarine bases adjacent to san francisco and long beach near los 
angeles and in the future in new york and navy radio 
transmitters in jacksonville fla san diego and sacramento calif 
in the soviet union such major cities as moscow leningrad and 
vladivostok house military installations 
the soviets could use in a counterforce attack against the 
united states 3000 warheads with a total megaton yield of 3000 
and the united states has available 4000 warheads with a total 
yield of 800 megatons the study said a megaton is defined as the 
energy released by the detonation of one million tons of tnt

president reagan predicted today that he 
will be succeeded by george bush and dan quayle because america 
is not going to trade away our winning team for thirdstringers 
in remarks prepared for delivery at a 500aperson fundraising 
luncheon for sen pete wilson rcalif reagan described the 
republican party as strong unified and ready to work for 
victory 
he made no reference in his prepared remarks to the controversy 
surrounding bushs choice of quayle a secondterm gop senator from 
indiana as his running mate quayle has been the subject of 
controversy for joining the indiana national guard during the 
vietnam war making himself immune from the draft 
america is not going to trade away our winning team for 
thirdstringers with a weak defense a foreign policy of errors 
curveball campaign promises a set of policies to be named later 
and billions of dollars in higher taxes the president said 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis told a news 
conference in beverly mass i think it will be the american 
people who decide who belongs in the major leagues and who belongs 
in the bush leagues i think its dukakis and democratic vice 
presidential candidate lloyd bentsen who belong in the major 
leagues 
earlier in the day reagan was asked by reporters after a 
signing ceremony for trade legislation if bush should drop quayle 
from the republican ticket no hes a fine man and 
wellqualified reagan responded 
urging the reelection of wilson who faces a challenge from 
democratic lt gov leo mccarthy reagan said he sees a real 
chance that pete may be part of a republican majority in the 
senate 
and wouldnt that be a nice gift for president george bush and 
vice president dan quayle he asked 
reagan said that in 1984 our opponents wrongheaded as their 
policies may have been at least ran in the clear light of day 
he said they ran as the liberals they were 
but that has changed he said the first sign of this 
deceptive strategy came in 1986 when many of their liberal senate 
candidates ran stealth campaigns avoiding the tough issues and 
using the language of conservatism to conceal their true beliefs 
in 1988 we are seeing this kind of covert liberalism at the 
national level and to an extraordinary degree the president said 
reagan will meet privately with bush on wednesday before they 
appear together at a rally in los angeles it will be their first 
meeting since controversy erupted over bushs selection of quayle

grocery prices jumped 14 percent in july the 
biggest monthly increase since early 1984 as the droughts effects 
reached supermarket checkout counters the government said tuesday 
but there was little evidence of accelerating retail price 
inflation elsewhere in the us economy excluding food overall 
retail prices rose just 03 percent for the month slower than the 
pace of the first half of 1987 the labor department said 
including the droughtrelated price spikes for food which 
accounts for about onesixth of peoples spending consumer prices 
rose 04 percent in july an annual rate of 52 percent 
despite all the talk about inflationary pressures its very 
difficult to find much in the way of evidence of it even with this 
huge increase for food said sandra shaber an economist for the 
futures group a washington consulting firm 
energy costs were up 03 percent largely because of 07 percent 
rise in gasoline prices but both home heating oil and electric 
rates declined even with the july increase gasoline prices are 
still lower than they were last december and 281 percent below 
their peak in march 1981 
housing expenses which account for 42 percent of what people 
spend rose at the same 03 percent monthly pace they have 
maintained since february with slightly lower repair costs 
offsetting slightly higher rents and mortgage payments 
retail auto prices were unchanged and clothing prices dropped 
06 percent the second consecutive monthly decline despite 
increases in both on the wholesale level in july the labor 
department said 
economists said it is becoming increasingly apparent that retail 
outlets are finding it harder to pass along wholesale price 
increases 
the real question is whether some of it will start seeping 
through there certainly hasnt been the surge that people worried 
about said larry chimerine of the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa economic forecasting firm 
were seeing a lot more consumer resistence than we used to 
and that is going to keep inflation down said michael evans a 
washington economic consultant part of it is the availability of 
imports but consumers also have become so use to rebates and sales 
that they wont buy without them 
meanwhile the commerce department reported that orders for 
big ticket durable goods plunged 7 percent in july the biggest 
drop in four years primarly because of huge declines in orders for 
cars and decreased military purchases 
the decline had been anticipated after durablegoods orders 
skyrocketed 87 percent in june the biggest monthly increase in 
more than six years 
this should not be taken as anything more than a onemonth 
pause in what has been a very strong area of economic activiity 
said allen sinai of the boston co a new york financial consultant 
in a third report the labor department said americans average 
weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation climbed 06 percent 
in july the best showing since a 12 percent increase in april 
workers benefited from a rise in hourly earnings plus an 
increase in the number of hours worked which was only partially 
offset by the boost in consumer prices in july the advance left 
americans inflationadjusted earnings 02 percent higher than they 
were a year ago 
the higher food prices from the four months of dry weather in 
the farm belt had been anticipated and if anything analysts were 
surprised that they were not bigger 
the food prices increases are not that big or that 
unexpected said chimerine well have a second round of 
droughtrelated increases later on but its not going to be a 
phenomenal increase 
the 14 percent gain in grocery store prices was led by a 96 
percent jump in egg costs a 74 percent boost for poultry and a 
47 percent gain for fresh fruits and vegetables 
these increases reflect rising input prices at least 
partially due to the adverse summer weather the labor department 
said 
cereal and bakery product prices gained 11 percent while 
cooking oil posted a 10 percent price increase 
despite widespread increases for most foods meat costs overall 
declined slightly as droughtstricken farmers trimmed their herds 
pork prices dropped 22 percent and beef and veal prices rose just 
01 percent 
the second major food price spike resulting from the drought is 
not expected until the end of this year or early 1989 as meat 
shortages from the early slaughters start showing up 
food costs overall rose 10 percent in july slower advances of 
05 percent and 04 percent respectively were posted for 
restaurant meals and alcoholic beverages 
for the first seven months of 1988 inflation on the retail 
level is running at an annual rate of 45 percent just a tick 
above the 44 percent rate for all of 1987

this years hot dry weather should not 
keep vermonts trees from displaying their famous array of fall 
colors but the dry spell could prompt the trees to turn color 
early experts said tuesday 
here and there on the hillsides youve got an occasional tree 
thats starting to turn although its nothing to get alarmed 
about said arlo sterner of wolcott whos been monitoring 
foliage for the state for 40 years 
i dont want to sound like the perennial hypersalesperson 
but i really think we can look forward to some gorgeous foliage 
this fall said george buzzell a forester from newport who also 
surveys foliage for the vermont travel division if you plan to 
come to vermont be prepared to pick up a lot of film and use it 
vermonts precipitation is 5 inches below normal so far this 
year the national weather service said the state also experienced 
an infestation from an insect called the pear thrips which 
defoliated nearly 500000 acres mostly in southern vermont but 
foresters say those trees grew a second set of leaves 
predicting the start of the season is always difficult but it 
usually begins the second week of september in the northern part of 
the state and lasts through most of october 
the seasons length and brilliance are affected by rainfall 
sun temperature and other weather factors too much sun rain or 
heat retard the foliage 
sterner and joe luisi of the weather service said a dry year 
usually means an earlier season luisi said a spell of chilly 
weather next month also could prompt the leaves to turn 
the uncertainty doesnt seem to have discouraged prospective 
visitors inns and lodges are booking their usual throng of autumn 
customers and the state travel division is swamped with telephone 
calls 
division spokesman john cashman said the peak weekend of oct 
810 should be especially busy because oct 10 is not only columbus 
day but thanksgiving day in canada

the state department on tuesday urged the 
polish government to employ reconciliation not force in dealing 
with spreading labor unrest 
free labor unions can help the polish economic reform effort 
not hinder it said a statement read by spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley 
indeed it is hard to see how economic reform can succeed 
without the participation of free trade unions economic reform is 
a truly national undertaking it must include all the people 
the mildly worded statement contained no direct criticism of the 
polish government uspolish relations have improved since 
martial law was lifted in 1983 but the ban on the solidarity labor 
movement remained and the statement concentrated on that issue 
as tension mounts in poland the united states continues to 
encourage dialogue and national reconciliation it said not 
confrontation and intimidation by force as the means to resolve 
polands difficulties 
the polish government has imposed special security measures and 
scheduled a session of parliament next wednesday to try to cope 
with the worst strikes since 1981 
in warsaw interior minister czeslaw kiszczak said at least 20 
illegal strikes had threatened anarchy in the country polish 
authorities have denounced the organizers as outside agitators and 
even terrorists 
mrs oakley said however the strikes were a clear indication 
of the wishes of the polish people and their support for 
solidarity 
she said poland needed economic reform and that trade unions 
should play an important role 
the united states is watching developments in poland 
closely the statement said 
in a separate statement the state department accused the 
government of czechoslovakia of using force against peaceful 
demonstrators and urged the release of dozens who were detained 
the demonstration in prague on sunday marked the 20th 
anniversary of the use of soviet troops to crush a reform movement 
in the warsaw pact country 
the demonstration points once more to the pressing need for 
the czechoslovak government to reevaluate the tragic events of 
1968 and address the legacy of political repression and economic 
stagnation the department said 
it called the demonstration an apparently spontaneous 
outpouring of frustration and hope by the people of 
czechoslovakia

a christian film critic says protests 
against the last temptation of christ backfired making people 
curious about martin scorseses movie 
its slander its libel its evil its bigotry and its 
wrong theodore baehr said monday during a taping of the john 
ankerberg show a religious television program 
the movie based on a novel by nikos kazantzakis has drawn much 
attention for its portrayal of jesus christ as questioning his 
divinity and dreaming of making love to mary magdalene 
baehr who reviews films for movieguide a christian index 
to movies and entertainment compared the portrayal of jesus by 
willem dafoe to don rickles playing dr martin luther king 
but he conceded there was error when certain members of the 
christian community felt the need to go public and called a press 
conference to condemn the movie 
the initial plan was for don wildmon head of the american 
family association of tupelo miss which spearheaded the boycott 
to reach his support base of 2 million and to reach our audience 
through 300plus christian radio stations and 25 magazines to speak 
out against the film 
when the secular press got wind of the protest it hurt 
baehr said in fact watching the press conference in los 
angeles i wondered if those speaking against the film were working 
for universal pictures which distributed the film it was the 
best advertising they could receive

gov mario cuomo said tuesday that the film 
the last temptation of christ is offensive and he wouldnt see 
it 
but cuomo a roman catholic said producers had a right to make 
the film 
i dont see the point of my seeing it cuomo said in an 
interview with albany public radio station wamc the idea of 
profaning the christ figure by showing him to be as human as the 
rest of us and leering at a woman and desiring her sexually is 
something that i find offensive to good taste 
the film which opened in theaters earlier this month includes 
a scene in which a crucified jesus christ hallucinates that he has 
married mary magdalene 
roman catholic bishops have urged the countrys 53 million 
catholics to boycott the film other religious groups have 
demonstrated against it

democrat michael dukakis today ridiculed george bushs plan for 
a flexible freeze to cut the federal deficit as the son of voodoo 
economics while president reagan dismissed the democratic ticket 
as thirdstringers 
bush campaigning on the west coast today basked in the warmth 
of a postconvention poll giving him a slim lead but he continued 
to feel the heat over running mate dan quayles military record and 
alleged involvement with a woman lobbyist 
quayle snapped at reporters staking out his home in the 
washington suburb of mclean va today saying this is getting a 
little bit outrageous and im getting a little bit indignant about 
just one bum rap after another 
reagan rallied a republican fundraising luncheon with criticism 
of the democrats 
america is not going to trade away our winning team for 
thirdstringers with a weak defense a foreign policy of errors 
curveball campaign promises a set of policies to be named later 
and billions of dollars in higher taxes the president said in 
remarks prepared for the fundraiser in california where he will 
campaign wednesday with bush at his side 
dukakis turned the fiscal criticism back on the gop saying 
there is no republican plan to balance the budget the vice 
president is talking about a flexible freeze thats like a melting 
ice cube thats the son of voodoo economics a phrase that 
bush used in 1980 to lampoon reagans theory of economics 
dukakis and running mate lloyd bentsen met monday night with cia 
director william webster and other lawmakers and officials involved 
in intelligence for a briefing on national security and foreign 
affairs 
in the first survey done entirely after the end of last weeks 
republican national convention bush and quayle led dukakis and 
bentsen by 46 percent to 40 percent 
the cbs news poll of 1221 registered voters across the country 
had a margin of error of 3 percentage points candidates typically 
receive a boost in the polls after their partys convention 
but half the respondents did not believe quayle 41 has the 
experience to be a good president and 28 percent were unsure 
thirtynine percent wished bush had chosen someone else 
quayle facing questions about whether he used his wealthy 
familys connections to enter the national guard and avoid being 
drafted into combat in vietnam found a split jury in the poll 
forty percent said phone calls made to the guard on his behalf 
represented an unfair attempt to ease his admission 40 percent 
said such calls were acceptable and 20 percent were unsure 
reservations about quayle were also expressed monday by bush 
supporters although they rejected suggestions he be dropped from 
the ticket 
i think quayle should assess and if he feels like hes hurting 
the ticket he ought to be man enough to step aside tommy 
thomas chairman of the bush steering committee in florida said 
monday 
i want to get to know a lot more about him said new jersey 
gov thomas kean who delivered the keynote at last weeks 
convention in new orleans 
gov john r mckernan of maine said that when quayles name 
first surfaced at the republican national convention as a possible 
bush choice i said i thought it would be a mistake and 
unfortunately ive been borne out to be right 
but bush went all out to defend quayle at a convention of the 
veterans of foreign wars telling the audience of about 4500 in 
chicago that the indiana senator did not go to canada and he did 
not burn his draft card and he damn sure didnt burn the american 
flag 
bush was scheduled to tour a steel plant in seattle wash here 
today before flying to portland ore and sacramento calif he 
has a joint appearance scheduled with president reagan on wednesday 
before returning to houston his adopted hometown 
quayle in a hastily arranged appearance before the vfw said no 
influence was used to get him into the national guard and none was 
needed because there were vacancies at the time 
my national guard unit was never called up to active duty but 
let me say that after these last 72 hours no one can say ive never 
faced combat he joked 
he continued to face questions about the guard and other issues 
the daily news of los angeles today quoted two former lawyers for 
onetime lobbyist paula parkinson who said the woman told the fbi 
in 1981 that quayle had propositioned her during a 1980 trip to 
florida 
the lawyers said parkinson told agents she refused the advance 
allegedly made during a golfing trip in which parkinson quayle and 
two other congressmen shared a cottage 
quayle adamantly denied a relationship with parkinson that is 
just an absolute flatout falsehood i had nothing to do with her 
down there i had nothing to do with her before and i had nothing 
to do with her afterwards he said today 
in his speech to the vfw bush again hit dukakis as weak on 
defense 
i plan to negotiate strategic arms reductions with the 
soviets bush said but he added i will not do what my 
opponent has suggested get rid of the mx the midgetman the b1 
bomber and two carrier battle groups i will not make such 
unilateral cuts in our defense 
dukakis countered at a news conference how anyone who sat 
there and did nothing while we sold arms to the ayatollah can 
seriously talk about leadership in the persian gulf is beyond me 
the democratic candidate was continuing his twoday annual visit 
of northern massachusetts today meeting with regional newspaper 
executives teenagers involved in an antidrug program and local 
law enforcement officials 
dukakis also answered allegations by a republican congressman 
that he obtained a deferment until he finished swarthmore college 
during the korean war 
dukakis said he asked to be drafted immediately after 
graduation and he spent 16 months in the demilitarized zone in 
korea after the fighting had stopped 
im very proud of that service and very proud of the 
opportunity it gave me to serve my country said dukakis 
quayle who makes his first solo campaign tour on wednesday is 
getting coaching from former reagan aides with experience in 
presidential politics the new campaign staff was assembled by 
aides to bush 
the des moines register an influential newspaper in the farm 
belt called today for bush to replace quayle because the senator 
would the paper said remain a distraction from the issues 
throughout the campaign 
its tough to admit a mistake but a willingness to see an 
error and to rectify it is a far better quality in a wouldbe 
president than a refusal to do so the newspaper said in an 
editorial

police bulldozed teetering houses tuesday 
to keep people from returning to homes left unsafe by an earthquake 
that killed at least 731 people in india and nepal 
officials in both countries expected the death toll to rise as 
relief workers reached remote towns that have been inaccessible 
since sundays devastating quake 
some roads were flooded by heavy rains that continued tuesday 
while others had 3footdeep cracks or were blocked by boulders the 
size of houses in the himalayan mountains and valleys 
at least 531 people were killed in nepal said tek bahadur 
thapa additional secretary in the home affairs ministry 
prime minister marich man singh shrestha visited dharan one of 
the hardesthit towns and surveyed heaps of bricks that were once 
threestory and fivestory houses 
this is the biggest calamity to strike nepal shrestha said 
as he toured the town 
india reported an official death toll of 200 but the figure was 
disputed by news media and opposition politicians who put the 
indian death count at anywhere from 400 to 1500 
in darbhanga india on tuesday worshipers offered sweets milk 
and coconuts to appease the hindu god of destruction women dressed 
in colorful saris gathered at countryside temples in the 
quakeravaged areas of eastern bihar state to pray and present 
their offerings to lord shiva the god of destruction in the hindu 
trinity

refused to give her name 
the earthquake which struck shortly before daybreak sunday when 
most people were still asleep registered 65 on the richter scale 
it was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950 when a temblor 
in the east indian state of assam killed 1500 by official count 
and 30000 by seismologists accounts 
dharan 105 miles southeast of katmandu sits on a rolling plain 
at the base of a steep hill at least 131 bodies have been found in 
the town of 100000

bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal 
monsoon rains

more than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation we will 
continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied the ones 
remaining are safe to live in he said

in with cranes to aid the demolition dharan is in the heart of 
regional famed for fierce gurkha fighters who have served in the

were demolished most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors

international agencies operating in nepal were gearing up to 
contribute supplies or assistance but have not yet heard from the

neither public protest nor us 
pressure has budged gen manuel antonio noriega and the panamanian 
movement to oust the nations de facto ruler appears mired in 
uncertainty and despair 
noriegas political foes did not even draw much enthusiasm from 
a huge antigovernment demonstration that accompanied the funeral 
aug 15 of a revered former president whom the military threw out 
of office three times 
tens of thousands of people marched 40 and 50 abreast in the 
funeral procession for arnulfo arias madrid but roberto aleman a 
leader of the opposition alliance discounted its significance 
in the short and medium term i doubt that it will mean 
much he said in the longer term we may see some life put 
back into the movement or we may see it fractionalized the thing 
is arnulfo is gone but noriegas still here 
behind alemans assessment was his concern shared by other 
opposition leaders that the death could split the authentic 
panamanian party which arias founded and built into the countrys 
largest opposition force 
theres no one of arias madrids stature in the wings but if 
his followers can unite around someone it would certainly 
strengthen the entire opposition movement a western diplomat 
said privately if they dont the party is likely to be split 
into a number of competing factions and that would just muddy 
things up 
noriega has weathered a 14monthold opposition campaign to 
force him out as commander of the 15000member panama defense 
forces which include the armed forces and police 
us economic sanctions against panama and federal indictments 
on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering have had little 
visible impact on noriegas standing 
eric arturo delvalle the president noriega put into office 
rebelled and tried to fire the general a few days after the us 
indictments were handed up in february noriega arranged for the 
national assembly which he controls to dismiss delvalle instead 
in speeches interviews and billboard advertisements noriega 
says the government will hold a presidential election as planned in 
may 1989 
the main questions are whether noriega will seek the presidency 
and whether the opposition can unite long enough to defeat either 
the general or the candidate he chooses some opposition leaders 
speak of boycotting the election but most do not see that as an 
option 
another diplomat said the us sanctions havent driven 
noriega out it is doubtful they washington will try a military 
solution and theres no one in panama who can singlehandedly carry 
the opposition banner the people are being driven to despair 
there are a lot of people out there who are against noriega 
very easily the majority id say but they feel abandoned by the 
united states and theres not one single opposition leader with 
whom they feel comfortable 
morton abramowitz us assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs visited panama two weeks ago opposition 
leaders who met him said he offered nothing new 
one said on condition his name not be used i got the 
impression that nothing will happen until after the us 
election and then who knows what some observers had expected 
noriega to announce his presidential candidacy aug 12 his fifth 
anniversary as commander of the defense forces 
noriega dropped no hints at the celebration however instead 
he delivered another diatribe against the united states accusing 
it of creating a crisis in panama to negate the 1977 treaties that 
turn the panama canal over to panama on dec 31 1999 
many panamanians wrongly thought that with the new treaties of 
1977 panama and the united states were beginning a permanent 
honeymoon forgetting that for the united states a treaty is no 
more than a useful but ephemeral act noriega declared 
on sunday the panama defense forces rejected charges that its 
troops are harassing us military personnel and called the 
accusations part of an effort to undermine the government 
its statement injected a note of sarcasm by saying us 
officials who make such accusations must have the iq of a 
3yearold cromagnon

pratt amp whitney quickly dismissed a 
consultant who the army said stole a sensitive report by a rival in 
a helicopterengine competition but the army said it lacked the 
evidence to press charges 
an internal report obtained by the hartford courant said 
consultant william henry maloney 50 stole a 358page progress 
report on the lhtec t800 turbine helicopterengine program from an 
office of the army materiel commands aviation branch on dec 8 
1986 
maloney who was chief of the aviation branch until his 
retirement as a colonel in 1984 returned the report two hours 
later after an army engineer noticed it missing and asked about it 
maloney also lied about the incident the army said 
maloney said monday that he is innocent of any criminal conduct 
i did something stupid but i didnt do anything wrong he said 
maloney told the courant he didnt take the report 
the army said the case is unrelated to the justice department 
investigation into allegations of bribery and bidrigging in 
pentagon procurement under scrutiny in that probe are consultants 
for pratt and norden systems both divisions of hartfordbased 
united technologies corp 
lhtec is a partnership of two major engine builders the allison 
gas turbine division of general motors and the garrett engine 
division of allied signal aerospace co 
lhtec is competing against the team of pratt and textron 
lycoming of stratford conn to develop the t800 
at stake are 35 billion in t800 production contracts and 
domination of a class of turbine engines that can power smaller 
airplanes including business jets as well as helicopters 
william c campbell director of communications for allison 
said the report was a detailed account of lhtecs progress in 
developing the t800 including technical information of keen 
interest to competitors but he said he wasnt sure the data would 
give a rival an edge in competition for the t800 contract 
the courant obtained the internal report of the armys 
investigation into the incident under the freedom of information 
act and reported on it in tuesdays editions 
eugene j tallia chief of pratts washington office said the 
company suspended maloney who was under a oneyear contract eight 
days after the incident maloney never offered to give pratt the 
lhtec data tallia said 
army lawyers concluded there was probable cause to believe 
maloney committed criminal conversion a theft in which a 
perpetrator doesnt intend to permanently keep a stolen item and 
gave a false sworn statement to investigators 
but col anthony wagner deputy command counsel for the army 
materiel command said no charges have been filed against maloney 
because pratt denied ever having received or used information from 
the report leaving no way to prove criminal intent 
he said the army materiel command has barred maloney from its 
offices and army investigators are holding maloneys pentagon pass 
maloney now works as senior washington dc representative for 
the northrop corp of los angeles a major aircraft manufacturer 
john thorne a spokesman for northrop said he couldnt comment 
on the army report because he hadnt read it

attorney general richard l thornburgh said 
tuesday he is taking a second look at the lastminute order of 
edwin meese iii calling for special investigations of members of 
congress suspected of criminal wrongdoing 
i want to find out what the underlying premise was in the 
issuance of the order the former pennsylvania governor said in 
one of his first interviews since being sworn in on aug 12 
thornburghs comments came as sen carl levin dmich chairman 
of a governmental affairs subcommittee asked the attorney general 
to rescind the order because the public didnt have a chance to 
comment on it and it contains a drafting error and other problems 
hours before meese left the attorney generals post on aug 12 
he signed the regulation that requires his successors to appoint an 
independent counsel to investigate allegations of wrongdoing made 
against a senator or congressman 
meese who was twice investigated by independent counsels during 
his 7 years as a reagan administration official said his order 
was designed to ensure that legislators and top executive officials 
are treated equitably the 1978 ethics in government act allows 
executivebranch employees to be investigated by special 
prosecutors but not members of congress 
thornburgh 56 a former head of the justice departments 
criminal division in the ford administration said it was pretty 
well known that i see a very limited role for special 
prosecutorsindependent counsels in the process of investigating 
and prosecuting criminal cases 
in general he said that us attorneys and the departments 
office of public integrity which investigates corruption of public 
officials do a fine job pursuing allegations of criminal conduct 
thornburgh once a prosecutor in pittsburgh established the public 
integrity office in the mid1970s 
i guess what i am curious about is what is being proposed 
a cure where there is no disease he said i am taking what 
could be called fairly a second look at that order 
he said he had no idea when his review might be completed but 
it will include talking to an advisory committee of us attorneys 
thornburgh a friend and supporter of vice president george 
bush refused to talk about bushs selection of indiana sen dan 
quayle as his running mate 
i am really not comfortable talking about issues in the 
political realm from this position said thornburgh whose name 
was bandied about as possible vice presidential candidate before 
bush tapped quayle 
thornburgh said he will not campaign for bush and has no 
commitment that he will remain as attorney general if bush wins in 
november 
during the next five months thornburgh said he will guide the 
department by setting high standards for professional conduct and 
aggressively pursuing the war on drugs and other criminal activity 
he has initiated an overall assessment of the department 
evaluating its staff and budgetary needs and looking at which 
vacancies need to be filled the responsibility i have to the 
president is to take stock and make sure everything is shipshape 
asked how he planned to boost morale at the department after the 
meese era thornburgh said you lead by example my view of 
the department is one that requires an absolute fidelity to high 
standards of professional conduct and integrity in our operations 
while meese was attorney general there were widespread 
defections among the top ranks at the department some officials 
expressed unhappiness with the attention meese was forced to give 
to his personal troubles 
james c mckay the special prosecutor who investigated meese 
concluded the thenattorney general probably broke 
conflictofinterest and tax laws but mckay said he found no basis 
to seek criminal charges against meese meese said the report 
vindicated him 
as a result of mckays report the departments office of 
professional responsiblity which looks into the conduct of justice 
employees started a review of meeses conduct to see if it met 
ethical standards thornburgh said he had no idea when that report 
would be completed

executive clemency tuesday 7 years after she went to prison for 
the murder of the developer of the scarsdale diet dr herman 
tarnower 
mrs harris 65 who recently wrote a book on her experiences at 
the bedford hills correctional facility will ask gov mario cuomo 
to grant clemency because of her age poor health including two 
heart attacks in prison and good prison record according to her 
attorney michael kennedy 
state law requires an inmate to serve half the minimum prison 
term before becoming eligible for executive clemency an act that 
commutes a sentence and allows an inmate to become eligible for 
parole 
final release must be granted by the state parole board 
mrs harris a former girls school headmistress was sentenced 
to 15 years to life 
she was convicted of seconddegree murder for the shooting of 
tarnower in the cardiologists home in purchase on march 10 1980

her own suicide attempt prosecutors contended mrs harris shot her 
lover of 14 years during a jealous rage over a romance with a 
younger woman 
anne lennox who heads a group fighting for mrs harris 
freedom has said the group is seeking to give the governor 
petitions bearing 10000 signatures to show support for clemency 
two years ago mrs harris sought a waiver of the minimum time 
requirement to seek clemency the governors executive clemency 
board denied the request 
anne crowley a spokeswoman for cuomo said mrs harris 
application would be reviewed as are all requests 
authorities will seek comment from the sentencing judge and the 
westchester county district attorneys office as well as the head 
of bedford hills 
russell leggett who presided over the trial and has since 
retired to private practice has gone on record favoring clemency 
the district attorneys office has not commented 
ms crowley said it was possible the review of mrs harris 
petition may not be completed by the christmas season when cuomo

after a brief exposure a nearly nude 
billboard character is back with a change of clothes 
now there can be little doubt that the character criticized by 
some for appearing to be nude is covered up in a new sign 
unveiled monday the man wears a bright red bikini bathing suit 
the guy had a bathing suit before but it was hard to see 
said don pierce manager of naegle outdoor advertising co in 
raleigh 
pierce said the company which owns the three billboards in 
greenville on which the ad appeared decided to change the sign 
after talking with the advertiser and the advertising agency that 
developed it 
the original ads for the carpet bargain center had the face of 
an area television announcer imposed on a reclining body that was 
clad in fleshcolored briefs 
greenville officials said they received about a dozen complaints 
from people who thought the man was in the buff but city officials 
said the sign did not violate zoning ordinances or obscenity laws 
jeff french a spokesman for the french advertising agency that 
prepared the billboard said monday the billboards were done with 
humor in mind and the advertisers didnt intend for it to be 
controversial

land must have a conservation plan approved by dec 31 1989 and 
implement it fully by dec 31 1994 to remain eligible for usda 
program benefits

some of indianas produce that survived 
the drought may rot in the fields because of a shortage of migrant 
workers a state official said tuesday 
eldon smith and his son scott said the drought has delayed the 
crops at their sharpview farms inc by a few weeks but their 300 
acres of tomatoes and 80 acres of cucumbers have had a strong 
finish 
its as good as any year weve ever had we just dont have 
the labor said scott smith 
in a normal year the two crops are staggered so the harvest is 
spread over several weeks this years dry conditions however 
forced the smiths to plant the tomatoes later than usual so the 
crops have come in at the same time 
michelle moscato who heads the migrant services division of the 
state department of human services said the same problem is 
generating demand for more labor throughout the state at a time 
when migrant workers are relatively scarce 
ms moscato said the number of migrant workers who came to 
indiana this summer is up 10 percent to 15 percent to 3800 to 
4000 
but people are not staying because the work is not good she 
said 
this week the smiths employed 40 migrant workers compared with 
the 80 usually hired at this time the farm could use 120 workers 
this year so the 40 who are there must work sunrise to sunset 
seven days a week the elder smith said 
people are working long hours and are making 30 to 40 a 
week the tomatoes are very small and its taking two or three 
times as long to fill a basket ms moscato said 
while cucumber harvesters usually are paid an hourly rate 
tomato pickers are paid 28 cents to 35 cents a bushel basket 
compared with at least 35 cents last year

seven senior members of the house armed 
services committee said tuesday the pentagon should add a clause to 
future defense contracts to ensure that any illegally gained 
profits can be recovered by the government 
there is an urgent need to protect both the national security 
and the interests of the us taxpayer in defense procurement 
they said in a statement 
a clause in all future contracts allowing the defense 
department to recover the profit from illegally obtained contracts 
would go a long way toward doing that it said 
the statement arises from the current pentagon bribery 
investigation which involves allegations that private consultants 
illegally bought information about future contracts from defense 
department employees no charges have been filed in the case which 
became public june 14 
defense secretary frank c carlucci and other top pentagon 
officials have said that if any of the contracts involved in the 
investigation turned out to have been won on the basis of illegal 
information the pentagon can use existing laws to recover the 
profits 
carlucci last month ordered that a new clause be inserted into 
some contracts with firms involved in the investigation 
the clause should be put into all contracts the statement said 
without such protection the government is not in a position 
to feel comfortable entering into future contracts with any of 
the defense firms mentioned in the investigation the statement 
said 
the clause could replace some of the legions of auditors who now 
check contracts said rep william dickinson rala ranking 
republican on the panel 
weve got so many regulations now it takes two men to buy an 
aspirin tablet one to fill out the papers and one to audit them 
he said by the time theyre finished theyve both got a new 
headache 
the letter was signed by dickinson and reps larry hopkins

president reagan wooed bluecollar and 
conservative votes for vice president george bush on tuesday 
signing a landmark trade bill and deriding the democratic 
presidential ticket as thirdstringers playing a curveball 
campaign 
in two southern california appearances a bill signing ceremony 
on a pier in long beach and a gop fundraiser in conservative orange 
county the president touted the economic advances of his term and 
proclaimed bush the man to carry his legacy forward 
he did not mention the record 170 billion trade deficit in 1987 
that helped propel this version of the measure through congress 
nor its primary sponsor sen lloyd bentsen of texas who is paired 
with democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis against bush 
and quayle 
were here to sign a piece of legislation that will help our 
economy continue to grow and compete reagan told hundreds of 
dock workers and politicians as he spoke before a huge container 
ship in long beach one of the worlds 10 busiest computerized 
cargo ports 
the bill he signed so thick he joked he couldnt pick it up 
is seen as a landmark bipartisan attempt to deal with the nations 
trade woes 
the signing climaxed months of negotiations between the 
administration and congress over the bill which reagan vetoed when 
it was first sent to him because it contained a provision requiring 
60day notice to employees of plant closings and layoffs 
congress however then passed the advance notice provision as a 
separate bill and the president at bushs urging and trying to 
minimize its importance as a democratic electionyear issue then 
let it become law without his signature 
bentsen touring a st louis clothing factory said reagan had 
to be dragged kicking and screaming into signing the trade 
bill the president could have signed that bill many months 
ago when it contained the plantclosing provision said bentsen 
who is chairman of the senate finance committee 
while reagan has said the revised bill more closely reflects 
his and bushs open trade views he noted there are things he 
doesnt like about the bill such as its call for import fees and a 
requirement that the executive branch negotiate with foreign 
countries on specific trade topics 
our administration and congress have come together in an 
effort to ensure open markets around the world reagan said 
this bill is just the latest step in that effort which began the 
first day george bush and i entered office and has already opened 
vast markets to american products all around the globe 
reagan pointed out the bill will provide up to a billion 
dollars a year for retraining workers to adjust to our 
turbocharged economy an economy that with the right leader 
will remain vibrant 
the bill is designed to battle the trade deficit by streamlining 
machinery for imposing import curbs which would retaliate against 
international trade violations 
it expands job training for workers left unemployed by import 
competition and strengthens the administrations hand in the 
current round of world trade talks it also repeals the windfall 
profits tax on oil and imposes sanctions against two foreign 
companies linked to sale of submarinesilencing equipment to the 
soviet union 
in remarks at a 500a plate luncheon in irvine to boost the 
reelection campaign of sen pete wilson rcalif reagan held to 
his theme of crediting bush with helping paint the economys rosy 
glow 
vice president bush and i have given america the longest 
peacetime expansion on record the country has created over 175 
million new jobs inflation is low and employment is at an all time 
high he told the 800 to 900 republican loyalists 
if our opponents are elected this era of record prosperity 
will be over but ive got news for the liberals its not going 
to happen he said 
america is not going to trade away our winning team for 
thirdstringers with a weak defense a foreign policy of errors 
curveball campaign promises a set of policies to be named later 
and billions of dollars in higher taxes the president said 
dukakis struck back at a news conference in beverly mass i 
think it will be the american people who decide who belongs in the 
major leagues and who belongs in the bush leagues he said i 
think its dukakis and bentsen who belong in the major leagues 
urging the reelection of wilson who faces a challenge from 
democratic lt gov leo mccarthy reagan said he sees a real 
chance that pete may be part of a republican majority in the 
senate 
and wouldnt that be a nice gift for president george bush and 
vice president dan quayle he asked 
in long beach reagan offered a strong rebuttal to suggestions 
that bush should jettison quayle a senator from indiana who is 
enmeshed in controversy over his military and scholastic records 
no hes a fine man and wellqualified he retorted when 
queried about quayles situation

the indiana national guard was below its 
authorized strength when dan quayle signed up in may 1969 
officials said tuesday even so a retired guard officer said he 
directed subordinates to hold an opening for quayle 
maj gen alfred ahner said tuesday he handled a call from a 
family employee who recommended quayle and then he contacted the 
guard personnel office they said they had a couple of spaces 
ahner told the associated press on tuesday i said hold one of 
them theres a good guy coming over 
ahner also said in an interview with wthrtv i couldnt have 
done a thing if there hadnt been a vacancy 
the issue of whether quayle used family influence to gain 
admittance to the guard thus avoiding a likely draft summons at 
the height of the vietnam war has dogged quayle since he was named 
last week to the republican presidential ticket 
a 1969 guard report circulating here indicated that the indiana 
guard was overextended in mid1969 but a monthbymonth breakdown 
made available on tuesday showed that quayles specific unit had 
legitimate openings when he joined up in may and in the months 
before and after 
capt cathi kiger said quayles guard unit had an authorized 
strength of 138 people in may 1969 according to guard records 134 
men were in the unit at the end of april 132 were serving in may 
when quayle joined and 133 men were enlisted in june 
the pentagon in washington further said that quayles public 
information unit of the guard authorized for a staff of five 
had three individuals assigned to it before quayle and another man 
brought it to full strength in january 1970 
the figures were made available after publication of the 1969 
report from brig gen john n owens then adjutant general of the 
guard which put the guards assigned strength on june 30 1969 at 
10255 52 more than its authorized strength of 10203 
due to some overstrength recruiting has been authorized on a 
limited basis since 1 april 1969 however it is anticipated that 
large scale recruiting will be conducted to replace approximately 
2500 individuals by the end of current year 1969 the owens 
report said 
i can find no evidence that he was given special consideration 
and there was no need kiger said of quayles guard service 
units that were not up to 100 percent strength could continue to 
recruit 
retired col jerome rafferty director of personnel for owens in 
1969 said that would mean that if you have a well qualified man 
like dan quayle that would be exceptional you can always get 
cooks and drivers theyre a lot easier to get than doctors and 
lawyers 
quayle was not an attorney when he applied for the guard in 
fact had he not gained admission to the guard he likely would 
have been drafted into vietnam war service 
the unit senator quayle served in was a specialized unit 
rafferty said he could have been recruited very simply for the 
fact that he got a college degree was in law school and had a 
newspaper background 
the public information unit produced press releases and a 
quarterly magazine the indiana national guardsman 
rafferty said the then22yearold quayles background he is 
an heir of the pulliam newspaper family made him a good candidate 
for the guard but said his personnel staff also welcomed 
recommendations from highranking officers 
retired maj gen wendell c phillippi who was managing editor 
of the familys indianapolis news has said he made one call on 
quayles behalf 
if general phillippi or any of the generals called me and said 
they knew a man who would make a good guardsman id prick my 
ears said rafferty because they only sent the highest quality 
young man thats the way the system worked 
phillippi contacted retired maj gen ahner who said tuesday 
wendell phillipp had called and said he had a good man and 
said he thought hed make a good guardsman thats when i went over 
to personnel i asked if they had any spaces for a good man 
they said they had a couple of spaces i said hold one of 
them theres a good guy coming over 
rafferty said it was degrading to allege that quayle used family 
connections to secure a spot with the guard as a means to avoid the 
draft 
why degrade a man who because he went to college was smart 
enough to do the best thing rafferty asked he wanted to 
finish his law career id have done the same thing

terrorist attacks within us borders remain few 
and far between but americans are targeted in onequarter of all 
such attacks worldwide law enforcement experts said tuesday 
on a global scale terrorism continues to grow and it 
continues to plague several nations said donald lavey an fbi 
agent who heads the antiterrorist squad for interpol the 
international police agency 
though this is not the case within the territorial confines of 
the united states americans remain prominent targets he said 
and authorities have their work cut out for them 
lavey was among the speakers at a threeday international 
conference of law enforcement officials titled terrorism in the 
decade ahead the meeting which began monday was sponsored by 
the university of illinoischicagos office of international 
criminal justice 
antiterrorism experts and law enforcement officials from a 
dozen nations attended to compare notes techniques and tactics for 
combating terrorism 
lavey said terrorist groups are increasingly better financed 
better equipped and more sophisticated than in the past but 
attacking targets on us soil provides more of a logistical 
challenge than almost anywhere else in the world 
even though this is 1988 the oceans still provide a 
formidable obstacle he said 
terrorists view europe as much more vulnerable because it 
provides great freedom to travel between one country and 
another he noted its much easier to get lost 
by the same token us citizens seem to stand out wherever 
they travel lavey said and the terrorists know the easiest 
way to get publicity for their causes are to attack americans 
thats why 25 percent of all attacks are directed against us 
william dyson the supervising special agent in charge of the 
fbis antiterrorist squad in chicago argued that the us law 
enforcement communitys reputation is welldeserved and backed up 
by its record 
throughout the late 60s and early 70s plenty of us 
agencies didnt know what they were doing in relation to 
terrorism dyson said the weather underground a radical 
student group alone was responsible for 385 terrorist incidents 
and do you know how many were solved not one 
and plenty of people got a chance at them they were equal 
opportunity bombers they went all over the country 
but dyson said the agency made domestic terrorism a national 
priority in 1981 after the capture of former underground radical 
kathy boudin following a deadly armoredcar heist in upstate new 
york 
there were elements of the black liberation army involved the 
puerto rican independence group faln and some other weather 
underground people he said it was an indication of how much 
of a network existed between groups that we once considered 
essentially separate 
what we learned is that we needed a network of law enforcement 
agencies to deal with the problem he said the new york 
terrorism task force which brought federal state and local 
authorities in a cooperative effort came out of that and its been 
a successful model 
dyson said the success of such programs can be measured by the 
range of terrorist organizations that have been rendered 
ineffectual in recent years from the white supremacist aryan 
nations which once staged armed robberies to finance its attacks 
against black and jewish targets to the conviction of members of 
the el rukns a powerful black chicago street gang on charges of 
conspiring to carry out bombings on behalf of libya 
i dont know how long it may be before a terrorist attack 
inside the united states happens he said it may never 
happen but as long as terrorists know they can get the worlds 
attention it would be dangerous to let our guard down

a federal judge has dismissed a 25 million 
antitrust lawsuit against mca records and the warner communications 
labels brought by a record promoter under scrutiny in a nationwide 
payola investigation 
during a fiveminute hearing monday us district judge 
consuelo b marshall decided to dismiss the suit reversing a 
decision she made in june 
marshall said that after reviewing mcas and warners motion for 
dismissal she decided her previous ruling was incorrect 
the 2yearold action was filed by independent record promoter 
joseph isgro who accused mca warner and 10 other record companies 
of conspiring to boycott his services 
all the other record companies settled out of court 
attorneys steven cannata and lawrence papale representing 
isgro were very surprised by the judges decision 
it was the same motion word for word that she already 
denied cannata said papale said the ruling would probably be 
appealed 
mca continues to deny there was conspiracy in the first 
place said brad phillips a lawyer with the firm representing 
mca he contended that isgro could not have proven that there was 
an antitrust violation 
mca is still suing isgro claiming civil racketeering against 
the promoter the judge on monday dismissed a similar complaint 
filed by warner saying warners complaint against isgro was not 
specific enough warner however has 30 days to amend its 
complaint 
isgro drew attention in the payola scandal in 1986 when nbc news 
portrayed him as being associated with organized crime after the 
telecast all major record companies announced they would suspend 
use of independent promoters 
isgro has denied any connection with payola practices but he is 
the focus of a federal grand jury probe his former business 
associates ralph tashjian and bill craig were indicted in january 
of several payola and tax evasion charges

some workers ended their strikes tuesday 
but 125 miners barricaded themselves in an underground shaft and 
vowed to stay until they won higher pay and recognition of the 
banned solidarity trade union 
the government said it wouldnt negotiate under the pistol 
of a strike and took measures to end polands worst wave of 
labor unrest since the 1981 imposition of martial law 
government spokesman jerzy urban said at least 49 people have 
been detained by police nationwide in connection with the strikes 
which began aug 16 and at their height affected about 100000 
workers at 20 sites 
on monday night interior minister czeslaw kiszczak said troops 
would be sent to secure major industrial plants to prevent anarchy 
although none were in evidence at the plants tuesday an 11 pm to 
5 am curfew was imposed in jastrzebie in katowice province the 
site of many of the mine strikes 
four columns of army and police vehicles left krakow for 
katowice witnesses said two of the convoys consisted of more than 
70 vehicles including four trucks with water cannons and 10 
truckloads of armed soldiers the witnesses said 
on the road in oswiecim near the entrance to the coalrich 
silesia region army roadblocks stopped cars and searched them 
miners from the 30 years of peoples poland mine near jastrzebie 
pledged they will stay there until the end of their lives until 
all the demands are met said wojciech maziarski a solidarity 
spokesman in warsaw 
striking dockworkers in szczecin said they feared police were 
getting ready to move in on them tuesday night police broke up 
strikes at two szczecin streetcar depots and one bus depot on 
monday night 
the situation here is very simple now we are expecting an 
assault at any moment because movements of police vehicles have 
been spotted outside our perimeter said edward rodziewicz 
chairman of the interfactory strike committee at the baltic port 
at the 30 years of peoples poland mine workers went down into 
the shaft 580 yards underground about noon tuesday according to 
the intermine strike committee in jastrzebie 
they have decided to stay underground until the start of 
negotiations said a communique issued by the committee their 
health is in danger 
mine strike leaders said they were not discouraged by the 
government actions and would continue their strike 
we have to continue to fight the red bourgeoisie in the 
party said romuald bozko a worker at the moszczenice mine who 
was interviewed at a church in jastrzebie 
solidarity leader lech walesa appealed again for dialogue with 
authorities to end the strikes but urban dismissed the possibility 
of negotiations while strikes continued 
there will be no political talks under the pistol of a 
strike urban told a warsaw news conference the strikers have 
been demanding increased wages and recognition of solidarity which 
was outlawed in 1981 
urban announced that a special parliament commission will meet 
aug 31 to review the governments economic policies and that it 
might make adjustments in its economic program after consultation 
with official trade unions 
he declined to explain what steps the security forces mentioned 
by kiszczak would take at the strikebound plants kiszczak also 
said curfews were authorized in the provinces of szczecin katowice 
and gdansk although the only place where one was imposed was in 
the katowice town of jastrzebie 
urban did not rule out declaring a state of emergency in the 
affected provinces 
the measures that will be applied will be adequate to 
developments urban said 
the government said only a few thousand workers remained on 
strike the number could not be independently verified 
the politburo of the countrys ruling polish united workers 
communist party met on the situation tuesday night state 
television reported but there were no details on its deliberation 
on monday workers at the lenin shipyard in gdansk waved polish 
flags and changed solidarity in scenes reminiscent of a 
nineday strike there in may 
strikes were reported at two more silesian coal mines tuesday 
bringing to 11 the number hit by labor unrest solidarity activists 
said strike actions spread to a repair shipyard and a shipyard 
making boats for river traffic in gdansk 
these are events of great importance said solidarity 
adviser adam michnik because they followed kiszczaks speech 
monday 
if the intention of the speech was to stop the just protest of 
the workers by intimidating them then this scenario has failed 
michnik said 
but there were signs that enthusiasm for strikes was ebbing 
elsewhere 
strikers in two departments of the cegielski engine works in 
poznan ended a walkout tuesday as well as those at a train car 
factory in wroclaw the huta warszawa steel mill in warsaw and the 
andaluzja coal mine according to the staterun news agency pap

miners in jastrzebie the heart of the miners unrest reported 
a harrowing few hours before dawn tuesday saying police cars with 
sirens blaring drove up to the july manifest mine in a mock raid 
strikers could be seen erecting barricades by using wood to 
reinforce the mines entrance gates in preparation for possible 
police assault 
provincial governors in wroclaw warsaw katowice and szczecin 
issued regulations for speededup court proceedings against strike 
leaders according to reports in the official press 
kiszczak in his tv address had urged that glaring offenders 
against the peace be jailed in summary proceedings not just fined

cattle fattened for the slaughter market are 
bringing higher prices this month reflecting fewer animals and a 
strong consumer demand for beef the agriculture department said 
tuesday 
in all cattle slaughter in august may rise only 8 percent from 
july the departments economic research service said in an updated 
review of the livestock and poultry situation 
officials gave the 8 percent forecast even though august has two 
more working days at plants than july which raised speculation 
that cattle slaughter might rise by as much as 10 percent this 
month 
cow slaughter has begun picking up the report said 
however this appears to be a seasonal movement of beef cows off 
grass pasture rather than a forced drought movement 
there had been an increase in cow slaughter earlier this summer 
as some producers in the droughtstricken northern plains and in 
the lakes states were forced to send beef and dairy cows to market 
because of feed shortages 
in many cases however breeding animals have been purchased by 
producers in other areas where feed is available thus forestalling 
massive selloffs of herds 
according to federal inspection reports the slaughter of beef 
cows this year through the first week in august totaled about 189 
million head down 9 percent from the same period in 1987 dairy 
cow slaughter at 166 million head dropped 3 percent 
prices of fed cattle in the southern great plains are selling 
for more than 70 per 100 pounds of live weight in late august up 
from 66 in july the report said 
beef from cows goes mainly into hamburger and processing while 
grainfed steers and heifers provide the highergrade cuts found in 
supermarkets 
looking at pork the report said weekly slaughter is expected to 
increase sharply in september pushing prices down 
meanwhile hot weather has disrupted marketings and slowed 
weight gains of hogs that has lent some support to an otherwise 
weak market this summer the report said 
wholesale prices of dressed broiler chickens in early august 
remained around 70 cents a pound well above the 53 cents of a year 
earlier prices should average around 61 to 65 cents a pound during 
the third quarter the report said

ira guerrillas killed another 
british military officer and london announced tuesday it is 
changing license plates for the cars of britiah servicemen in west 
germany 
lt alan shields 45 a navy recruiting officer was driving 
into east belfast monday night when a bomb attached to his car blew 
up police reported 
his death came three days after an ira bomb killed eight 
soldiers in a bus in northern ireland shields was the 26th british 
serviceman killed this year in ira attacks compared with three in 
1987 
the defense department announced in london that the distinctive 
military plates used on the 95000 vehicles of british military 
personnel and their families in west germany would be replaced by 
standard british license plates 
four british military personnel were killed in western europe 
this summer by bombs and automatic rifle fire the ira claimed 
responsibility for the attacks that involved cars carrying military 
license plates 
armed forces minister archie hamilton said the licenselate 
change will make the cars of military personnel indistinguishable 
from those of british tourists 
shields whose wife and son live in scotland was believed to be 
the first royal navy man killed by the ira in northern ireland 
crispin rodwell a news photographer who was driving behind 
shields car said it just exploded and was immediately engulfed 
in flames several people ran forward with fire extinguishers 
but couldnt get close enough to have any effect and the driver was 
still inside 
the blast occurred near the roman catholic short strand area a 
stronghold of irish republican army the guardian newspaper in 
london said some short strand residents jeered as the car burned 
the outlawed ira claimed responsibility for the bombing in a 
telephoned message to a local radio station saying it had killed a 
british soldier 
but a press officer at police headquarters in belfast said 
shields was a royal navy recruiting officer who worked at the 
recruiting office in belfast 
the ira circulated a statement tuesday saying shields was 
engaged in recruiting personnel to carry on britains war in 
ireland 
it added our volunteers had been observing their target and a 
number of others based at the same location for some time 
yesterday when the opportunity presented itself a 3pound charge of 
high explosives was placed on the vehicle 
prime minister margaret thatchers office in london said she was 
saddened and angered by yet another senseless killing 
mrs thatcher ordered a security review following the ira bomb 
attack saturday that killed eight soldiers and injured 27 
the soldiers were in an unmarked military bus returning to their 
barracks at omagh 50 miles west of belfast following leave on the 
british mainland when a bomb in a car parked on the roadside 
exploded as the bus passed 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to unite northern 
ireland a british province where protestants outnumber catholics 
32 with the predominantly catholic irish republic

public approval of labor unions has climbed by 
six percentage points since 1981 while disapproval of them has 
declined by 10 percent according to a gallup organization poll 
released tuesday 
the poll conducted in june through indepth personal interviews 
with 1029 people in their homes showed that 61 percent of the 
public at large approved of unions while 25 percent disapproved and 
14 percent had no opinion 
in 1986 the last time gallup asked the same question do you 
approve or disapprove of labor unions 59 percent answered they 
approved 30 percent said they do not approve and 11 percent had no 
opinion 
public opinion of labor unions as measured by the poll conducted 
periodically since 1936 had fallen from 1965 through the 1970s but 
began rebounding after 1981 when the approval rate was 55 percent 
and the dispproval rate was an alltime high 35 percent 
the trend in the last couple of years has been that it is kind 
of inching upwards said john mcnee a gallup vice president 
mcnee said the poll had a margin of error of 4 percent meaning 
that if every adult in the country had been questioned the results 
could have been 4 percentage points different in either direction 
approval of unions is still well below the 6367 percent range 
it was in the middle 1960s and the peak 7576 percent of the middle 
50s 
in the latest poll unions were held in highest esteem 67 
percent and 68 percent respectively by people aged 1824 and 
4554 disapproval was greatest 32 percent among 35yearolds to 
44 yearolds 
among income groups those earning 40000 to 50000 a year had 
the highest approval rate of unions 66 percent the highest 
disapproval rate 37 percent was among those with incomes 
exceeding 50000 
unions were most popular among blacks with an approval rate of 
74 percent and a disapproval rate of 11 percent followed by 
hispanics at 71 percent approval and 15 percent disapproval and 
whites at 60 percent approval and 26 percent disapproval 
aflcio president lane kirkland said the most encouraging aspect 
of the poll for a union movement that has lost members every year 
this decade is the aboveaverage approval rate among those aged 18 
to 24 
kirkland said several factors could be behind the turnaround 
including a decrease in strikes in recent years and more extensive 
public relations efforts by the labor federation and individual 
unions such as a 13 million television and radio advertising 
campaign launched in may 
strikes are clearly unpopular he said there are elements 
of our duties that are not joyously received by the public at 
large that sometimes cause inconvenience he said 
but also i think there is a public recognition that the 
pendulum has swung too far he said weve had several years 
where employers have had the upper hand in many cases and theyve 
used it brutally in unfair treatment of employees who have 
given their lives to enterprises

syrianbacked leftist and moslem factions 
on tuesday vowed to block presidential elections until christians 
agree to constitutional reforms that would give lebanons feuding 
communities an equal share of power 
nationalist and progressive forces will undertake all poitical 
and active measures to prevent elections until achieving national 
entente said a joint statement issued by 12 factions 
the factions included the prominent shiite moslem amal militia 
of justice minister nabih berri and the progressive socialist party 
of druse warlord walid jumblatt 
the sixyear term of president amin gemayel a maronite 
catholic expires sept 23 and under the constitution parliament 
must elect a new president by midseptember 
planned elections in the 99seat parliament were blocked last 
thursday when most christian deputies boycotted the session to 
protest the candidiacy of former president suleiman franjieh 
franjieh 78 a staunch ally of syria was president when the 
civil war broke out in april 1975 before his term ended in 1976 
he requested syrian military intervention to end the fighting 
there are only 76 active members of parliament the house was 
elected in 1972 for a fouryear term but but its mandate was 
renewed several times because civil strife prevented elections 
the lebanese forces militia the christians main military arm 
is proisraeli and violently opposed to syria which maintians 
40000 troops in east and north lebanon and moslem west beirut 
israel maintians a selfproclaimed security zone six to 10 
miles into southern lebanon 
under an unwritten national covenant made after lebanons 
independence from france in 1943 christians have maintained the 
top executive legislative judicial and military posts 
the president is traditionally elected from the maronite 
catholic community 
in the absence of elections the outgoing president could form a 
caretaker cabinet under a maronite prime minister 
but the statement on tuesday vowed to fight with political and 
material means any such attempt by gemayel it did not elaborate 
or say outrightly if that meant the 12 groups plan to rekindle 
civil war fighting 
the statement also called for a nationwide warning strike on 
friday to protest the americanisraeli intervention that 
prevented the parliament from practicing its role of electing a new 
president 
the prosyrian militias urged their followers to be on maximum 
alert to confront the critical situation and to continue the 
struggle in order to liberate the country and regain its 
sovereignty

a lung specialist who visited nelson mandela last 
weekend in a cape town hospital said tuesday the black african 
nationalist leader is in excellent health after a bout with 
noninfectious tuberculosis 
he is in excellent shape and he is in the best possible 
hands said professor heinrich herzog he told me i was sick 
and now i am perfectly well he also said all symptoms of the 
disease had gone 
herzog a former president of the european society of 
pneumology returned monday night after a threeday stay he said 
he was invited by mandelas attending physician attie de kock of 
stellenbosch university 
de kock who is treating mandela in cape towns tygerberg 
hospital wanted to have a second neutral specialist confirm 
his diagnosis after unspecified quarters voiced doubt about it he 
said 
herzog said an examination of medical records and xrays left 
him absolutely without doubt that the diagnosis was correct and 
that the 70yearold mandela had suffered from closed or 
nonbacillar tuberculosis he said antibiotic therapy worked 
very fast and with perfect results 
he is really in the best possible hands herzog said he 
said he knew de kock as a colleague and a fellow member of the 
american college of chest physicians and that they both repeatedly 
met at international medical congresses 
he laughed when told some people may suspect his trip was 
arranged by the white government for propaganda purposes they 
should know that i am an outspoken opponent of apartheid but i 
went there to see mandela because he is a patient i did not go 
there for political reasons herzog said 
his observations contrasted with a report by mandelas lawyer 
ismail ayob who said last week that mandela had lost much weight 
was short of breath had a persistent cough and impaired speech 
mr mandela is normally slender herzog said he did not 
cough once when i visited him because of the rumors about his 
health he was extremely grateful for my visit because it provided 
him with the final evidence he could say stop now with the 
rumors you cannot doubt two authorities 
herzog said mandela was still in tygerberg hospital when he left 
south africa he could leave there soon he said the 
question is where to mandela has been imprisoned since 1962

watching her since sunday four days after zias c130 plane 
exploded and crashed in eastern pakistan on aug 17

parked an unmarked blue truck white jeep and motorcycle all 
bearing special government plates they were manned by members of 
an elite unit from the sind provincial police called the eagle 
squad the intelligence source said 
ms bhutto in the interview said political leaders must 
conduct themselves in the finest democratic tradition and act 
so as to give the military no pretext for intervention 
she said she was seeking to form alliances with other opposition 
groups and reach agreements to prevent them competing for the same 
national assembly seats 
ms bhutto strongly criticized the current cabinet calling the 
ministers dangerous holdovers from zias regime thirteen of 
the 16 ministers were appointed by zia 
these are people who know they will lose their power their 
privilege their patronage nov 16 and it is they who will do 
whatever they can to prevent the holding of fair free and 
impartial elections she said 
she called on new president ishaq khan to dismiss the cabinet 
and appoint a caretaker government until elections of people who 
dont have a vested interest in the elections and will conduct 
themselves in a neutral way she said 
she expressed confidence that if elections were conducted fairly 
she would win she said her government would seek to attract 
outside investment maintain close relations with the united states 
and honor commitments to the afghan mujahedeen guerrillas 
pakistan under zia was the united states chief ally in the 
region chanelling us arms and other support to the guerrillas 
fighting soviet and afghan forces in neighboring afghanistan

religious leader in northwestern pakistan tension between shiite 
and sunni moslems has increased and authorities feared the

romanian refugees and hungarian 
activist groups have begun a twoweek protest against the razing of 
thousands of villages in romania it was reported tuesday 
the protesters are demanding that the romanian government stop 
its plan to demolish about 7000 of romanias 13000 villages and 
to resettle the population in big agroindustrial centers by 
the year 2000 
hungarian radio said the peaceful protest began monday night 
outside the romanian embassy in budapest and was led by the free 
romania group which is made up of ethnic romanians who fled to 
hungary 
members of the group went on a 24hour hunger strike on tuesday 
the romanian national day the report said

of the embassy in shifts of three to six hours and their numbers 
are expected to vary from a few dozen to several hundred people 
outlawed hungarian activist groups also represented in the 
protest included the hungarian democratic forum the fidesz 
independent youth group and the forras koer fountain circle the 
radio reported 
the resettlement scheme would affect hundreds of ethnic 
hungarian villages

a crime against mankind

largest ethnic hungarian group outside hungary lives in romania and 
that it could play the role of bridge between the two countries 
citizens

a policy of discrimination against the 17 million hungarians in 
romania by destroying village culture as well as the tradition of 
romanias minorities

project will raise living standards and win arable land for 
agriculture

kathpress said 
the bishop described the situation for refugees on the border as 
dramatic saying people were beaten

democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd 
bentsen told union audiences tuesday that president reagan fought 
the trade bill until he signed it and tried to take credit for it 
we had no help on that from the administration bentsen told 
a cheering flagwaving crowd of about 500 united auto workers 
members overflowing a meeting hall in this detroit suburb he 
could have signed that bill months ago but he vetoed it over the 
plantclosing provision 
the president vetoed the trade bill earlier this year largely 
because of the provision calling for 60 days notice to workers 
before a plant can be closed he has since let that provision 
become law in separate legislation and he signed the companion 
trade bill tuesday in california 
the campaign schedule for bentsen chairman of the senate 
finance committee and a prime sponsor of the trade bill was 
tailored to help him dramatize his point that reagan had done a 
180degree turn on the legislation because the issue was hurting 
republican presidential nominee george bush 
i want you to know who the point man was in fighting that 
plantclosing provision bentsen told clothing workers earlier at 
the biltwell co in st louis 
it was a senator dan quayle who fought against it but he 
lost and the administration lost and we were able to put it into 
law he said referring to the republican vice presidential 
nominee 
i fought for two or three years to put that trade bill in 
effect while the president put many a roadblock in front 
bentsen said 
the president now has waited until the very last day to sign 
it and hes gone to the latest time zone bentsen said 
hes been carried kicking and screaming to the altar but it 
looks like we finally have a marriage and were finally going to 
get a real trade bill for america bentsen said receiving hearty 
applause from the 100 workers crowded in the plant snack bar to 
listen 
bush when reagan tapped him earlier in the administration to 
talk with the japanese about unfair trade was heaping effusive 
praise instead of bargaining tough bentsen said 
bentsen said a dukakisbentsen administration would fight to 
open foreign markets he promised that one of the first pieces of 
business before the senate next month would be a textile trade bill 
aimed specifically at the clothing industry which he said had been 
particularly hard hit 
when bentsen toured the plant the workers mostly women showed 
him how to use various pieces of equipment he worked a machine 
pressing mens suit coats and his wife ba joked that he didnt 
do that at home 
the company gave bentsen a blue hopsack blazer size 42 long 
and he was presented with a buy american tee shirt and a union 
hat 
earlier talking to reporters on the campaign jet bentsen 
remarked on reagans delay in signing the bill and said the 
president really is a hard loser 
bentsen denied that reagans signature on the measure would take 
the issue away from the democrats not so long as we remember 
its the bentsendanforth bill he said sen john danforth 
rmo cosponsored the legislation 
bentsen avoided criticizing quayle over the republicans entry 
in to the national guard during the vietnam war one of bentsens 
sons also joined the guard during that time frame 
i think youll see less intensity on the issue as time goes 
on he said im not going to trash him on the issue 
bentsen did chide quayle for his late conversion which came 
monday night before the veterans of foreign wars convention in 
chicago to supporting a bill making the veterans administration a 
cabinetlevel agency that was only a month ago that quayle was 
one of few in the senate to oppose the measure bentsen said

refugees fleeing tribal violence in 
burundi claim that the army took part in the slaughter of thousands 
of people in that small central african nation a un official 
said tuesday 
at least 5000 people have been reported killed in massacres 
during fightng between two rival tribes 
code cisse the un high commissioner for refugees 
representative in rwanda said about 38000 refugees have fled 
burundi into neighboring rwanda since the killing broke out aug 
14 he said about 5000 peasants continue to cross the border each 
day 
most of those fleeing are members of the hutu tribe said cisse 
who spoke in a telephone interview after visiting border areas over 
the weekend 
although the hutu make up nearly 85 percent of burundis 5 
million people they are subservient to the tutsi who comprise the 
remaining 15 percent and dominate the government and army 
we saw many people who had been injured by bullets and 
bayonets cisse said they said they were fleeing because they 
didnt want to get shot by the military 
the hutu people liberation party an exiled opposition group 
also has charged that burundis military massacred thousands of the 
majority hutus 
burundis government denied the accusations and said 5000 
people were killed in a slaughter instigated by exiled hutus who 
infiltrated burundi to inflame antitutsi sentiments 
what the government did was restore peace said a communique 
issued monday by burundis foreign minister cyprien mbonimpa 
the hutu and the tutsi are longtime enemies after an abortive 
1972 coup attempt in the former belgium colony the tutsi massacred 
more than 100000 hutu including most of the tribes educated 
class according to human rights groups 
western diplomats in burundis capital bujumbura say tribal 
disturbances took place earlier this month in the northern region 
where last weeks slaughter occurred but that the government 
believes it has restored order 
the killing seems to have caught everybody by surprise said 
one western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity he said 
the suddenness of the violence could lend credence to the 
governments claim there had been infiltrators trying to stir 
things up 
most killings occurred around the remote farming communes of 
ntega and marangara in northern burundi a hilly marshy area that 
has since been sealed off by the military 
news has been very very difficult to come by the diplomat 
said but from all that we have been able to gather the army 
moved in after the initial mass killing had occurred and was 
instructed to fire only upon those carrying arms or threatening 
other people 
cisse said rwanda urgently needed help to cope with the refugee 
influx immediate requirements were blankets medicines and tents 
he said adding that many refugees were sleeping in the open 
the conditions are very bad he said they are located in 
a region where there is a high risk of malaria and are being housed 
in schools and health clinics we cant meet the need 
rwanda and burundi are among the worlds most densely populated 
countries 
nearly 5 million people are crammed into burundi which covers 
an area about the size of maryland about 6 million people live in 
slightly smaller rwanda there the hutututsi percentages are 
roughly the same although the hutu dominate the government 
burundi promised in its communique monday to work with those who 
fled to rwanda and to make possible a speedy return home 
the massacre was the first outbreak of violence since maj 
pierre buyoya seized power in a bloodless coup on sept 3 1987 
while former president jeanbaptiste bagaza was attending a 
francophone summit in canada 
the government has restricted travel between towns enforced a 7 
pm to 5 am curfew throughout the country and banned meetings of 
more than five people

the federal centers for disease control is 
sponsoring a program to randomly test the blood of up to onethird 
of the babies born in the united states next year for antibodies to 
the aids virus 
the tests will determine only whether the mother is infected a 
positive result does not necessarily mean the child has or will get 
aids said dr timothy dondero head of the seroepidemiology 
branch of the cdcs aids program 
although the conclusions of several studies differ they 
indicate that from 30 percent to 50 percent of the newborns testing 
positive could eventually get acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
he said in an interview tuesday 
dondero said plans for the infant tests are in place so far in 
about 23 states plus puerto rico and the district of columbia and 
actual testing is under way in about half of those 
he said he expects participation of about 30 states by the end 
of the year and more in 1989 the study is part of a 40 million 
package of programs to track the spread of the aids virus 
the virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to infections and cancer the disease has claimed the 
lives of nearly 40000 americans 
aids is most commonly transmitted by sexual contact or by 
sharing contaminated drug needles it is also spread less often 
from an infected mother to her child before or at birth 
it is likely that about 13 million infants will be tested next 
year using a method first tried by massachusetts health officials 
dondero said no names will be attatched to the blood samples he 
said 
there is no way of testing specimens linked to individuals 
unless you have the consent of the individual he said adding 
that getting consent would hobble the random aspect of the sample 
most groups involved in testing military recruits sexually 
transmitted disease clinics blood donors are to some extent 
selfselected he said people do not agree to take part who 
have some reason for not wanting to take part 
the new program is intended to test a true representative sample 
of the population dondero said he said the aim is to determine 
where aids infection among women is concentrated and to determine 
where to target prevention programs 
so far it is concentrated in big cities it is important to 
assess if it is prevalent in some rural areas as well he said 
over time we will be able to monitor trends of infection in 
the female half of the general population he said

president augusto pinochet celebrating 
15 years as chief of chiles army declared tuesday that the armed 
forces will not withdraw from politics or abandon control of 
internal security 
in addition the armys vicecommander gen santiago sinclair 
said troops were in a state of readiness for an october 
referendum in which the rightwing president is expected to seek 
eight more years of rule 
the 72yearold pinochets impassioned defense of military 
involvement in politics appeared intended to counter suggestions 
that he should give up his army command in return for the 
presidential nomination 
pinochet told army officers at a luncheon at the army academy in 
east suburban santiago that chile faced a constant threat of 
marxist subversion 
it is thus impossible to conceive that the military would be 
called upon to intervene only when the cannon roars in an external 
conflict he said each day we are more certain that the 
permanent enemies of western humanity are active within a countrys 
own borders 
pinochet complained that past governments kept the armed 
forces apart from national development and public affairs 
relegating them to darkest passivity 
he said chiles new institutional structure requires an armed 
forces conscious of their political responsibilities 
the luncheon was private but copies of pinochets address were 
given to reporters by his press secretary 
pinochet was named commander of the army by far the most 
powerful military branch on aug 23 1973 by elected president 
salvador allende a selfdeclared marxist nineteen days later 
pinochet led the coup that toppled allendes government he has 
been the countrys authoritarian ruler ever since 
sinclair told pinochet in a speech that the military branch was 
in a state of readiness over future events on which the destiny 
of the country depends 
military leaders meet aug 30 to select a single presidential 
candidate expected to be pinochet voters then will be asked to 
vote yes or no on the candidate during a referendum 
sinclair pledged army support for the nominee saying it is 
essential that we move forward and continue the work of 
pinochets administration 
no exact date for the referendum has been announced but 
pinochet has said it will be in early october if he wins a 
majority in the referendum the candidate will begin an eightyear 
presidential term in march if he is rejected by most voters open 
elections are supposed to be held in 1990 
opposition supporters have begun an intensive campaign for a 
no vote 
other commanders participating in the selection of a nominee 
navy adm jose merino air force gen fernando matthei and national 
police gen rodolfo stange have said the candidate should give up 
any military position however pinochets central source of power 
has been his leadership of the army and he is seen as reluctant to 
relinquish it

a gallup poll released tuesday found 48 percent 
support for george bush and 44 percent for michael dukakis in the 
presidential race with about half the respondents approving of 
sen dan quayle as bushs running mate 
fiftytwo percent of the 1001 registered voters surveyed in the 
national poll said they approved of bushs choice of quayle an 
indiana senator while 27 percent said they disapproved and 21 
percent were not sure 
the survey was conducted from friday through sunday 
an earlier gallup poll found similar reaction to dukakis choice 
of sen lloyd bentsen of texas as the democratic running mate 57 
percent approved 22 percent disapproved and 21 percent were unsure 
quayle has been embroiled in a controversy over whether he used 
family influence to join the national guard during the vietnam war 
and avoid the military draft when asked in the new gallup poll 
whom they would choose if they could vote separately for the vice 
president 41 percent picked bentsen and 36 percent quayle 
the fourpoint spread between bush and dukakis was within the 
polls margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage 
points meaning it found the race to be statistically a dead heat 
radio station weei in boston reported 
a cbs news poll conducted over the same period last week found a 
sixpoint spread 4640 between the candidates with bush 
numerically ahead another gallup poll done for newsweek on 
thursday and friday found bush ahead 5142 while other polls done 
just before or during the gop convention last week found a dead 
heat in the race 
dukakis had led by as many as 18 points in polls after the 
democratic convention in midjuly a margin that pollsters 
attributed to the rush of positive television publicity generated 
by the convention 
dukakis convention bounce was expected to fade as it did and 
bush was expected to gain his own boost after the republican 
convention as the most recent polls indicate he has the last 
gallup poll before the gop convention had the race at 4942 for 
dukakis

a jury tuesday convicted two men of arson for 
firebombing the home of a man who had complained about drug dealers 
in his neighborhood where a policeman assigned to guard the mans 
home was later shot to death

of criminal mischief and intimidating a witness in the triallevel 
state supreme court 
firstdegree arson carries a maximum penalty of 25 years to life 
in prison sentencing was scheduled for sept 20 
the molotov cocktail attacks occurred in the early morning hours 
of nov 10 two weeks after the victim arjune a guyanese 
immigrant who goes by one name had moved to the queens 
neighborhood of south jamaica he had repeatedly called police 
about alleged drugdealing outside his home in those two weeks 
most recently the night before the attacks 
i saw these guys collecting money from people cars and so 
forth testified arjune who is now in the federal witness 
protection program with his wife son and daughter 
about 425 am on nov 10 he said on the stand last week he 
heard his familys dogs barking looked through a window and saw 
the defendants approaching his home each carrying a burning glass 
jar 
i shouted at everybody to wake up he said i ran to 
the window where this gentleman webster was trying to open my 
window i looked at his face he looked at me he was 
determined to burn my house 
arjune said the second firebombing occurred about two hours 
after the first in the first attack four bottles were thrown all 
of which bounced off the house and landed outside in the second 
three bottles were thrown one of which went through a window and 
set fire to the carpet and draperies while scorching the wall he 
said 
webster was involved in both johnson was arrested after the 
first he testifid 
arjune said he was burned on the arms and chest while hurling 
the incendiary device back outside the house 
i had no choice i couldnt he said before breaking 
down in tears i couldnt leave the fire to burn my house 
the firebombings caused police to post a roundtheclock guard 
at the house last february one of the guards officer edward 
byrne was shot to death in what police called an execution ordered 
by highlevel drug traffickers to retaliate for their own 
prosecutions and imprisonment 
the byrne killing was not mentioned in the trial because it was 
ruled legally irrelevant to the firebombings 
in their summations defense attorneys pointed out 
inconsistencies in arjunes account of the firebombing and 
questioned his identification of the defendants 
arjune is scheduled to testify at two other trials of people 
accused of having threatened him 
one defendant is websters father also named robert who is 
charged with witness intimidation the other is thomas godbolt 
charged with coercion and menacing both have pleaded innocent 
godbolt is said by authorities to be associated with lorenzo 
fat cat nichols who is serving a 25yeartolife prison term 
for major drug trafficking in queens 
police commissioner benjamin ward and other officials have said 
they believe nichols whose alleged drug organization was the 
target of 30 arrests on aug 11 may have ordered the murder of 
byrne however nichols is not one of the four men charged with 
byrnes killing and his lawyers have denied he was involved

nicaraguan rebels who have entered 
honduras will be restricted to honduran border areas to limit their 
impact on the country the foreign minister said tuesday 
rebel leaders have said more than 9000 rebel combatants known 
as contras are at base camps inside honduras 
foreign minister carlos lopez contreras said many contras 
recently crossed into honduras seeking refuge and humanitarian aid 
distributed by the united states 
lopez contreras said honduras was allowing the us aid to reach 
the contras as part of the peace plan signed last year by the 
presidents of five central american countries including daniel 
ortega of nicaragua 
he said the contras cross the frontier frequently because under 
the plan they were to be assigned to a zone in nicaragua that 
borders honduras 
lopez contreras said some contras were entering honduras as 
refugees then later returning to their country to fight 
the foreign minister said that anticommunist rebels from 
nicaragua and leftist guerrillas from el salvador have caused 
honduras serious problems 
both groups have been using frontier territory for their war 
bases and honduras social stability has been damaged lopez 
contreras said 
he said to try to alleviate the problem honduras will restrict 
the contras to border areas while they await supplies from the 
united states 
honduras faces peculiar problems because of the superpowers 
lopez contreras said with the united states supporting the contras 
and the soviet bloc helping nicaraguas sandinista government and 
the salvadoran rebels 
honduran critics have denounced the government saying it is 
helping the united states support the contras they also have 
criticized the frequent joint military exercises by us and 
honduran forces 
there have been several antiamerican demonstrations this year 
in honduras which is considered one of washingtons strongest 
allies in the region

the united states said it hoped for a 
constructive and successful session wednesday to begin the third 
ussoviet review of compliance with the 1972 abm treaty limiting 
missile defenses 
the review is expekcted to last up to two weeks the 
antiballistic missile treaty requires such a meeting every five 
years 
a statement tuesday from the us diplomatic mission in geneva 
reiterated the us position that a soviet radar under construction 
in krasnoyarsk siberia violates the treaty and that it should be 
dismantled 
officials in washington have said the main us objective at the 
review conference will be to have moscow agree to dismantle the 
station 
otherwise the white house has threatened to declare the 
facility a material breach of the treaty this could clear the 
way for the united states to overstep treaty limits in its 
spacebased missile defense program formally known as the 
strategic defense initiative and commonly called star wars 
us officials in washington said after the moscow summit in 
june that until the radar is dismantled conclusion of a separate 
treaty limiting longrange nuclear forces would be impossible that 
appeaered to be the first such linkage by the us side 
the soviets have consistently linked a longrange or strategic 
arms agreement to limits on star wars which washington has said 
it will not accept the two sides are negotiating in geneva with 
the stated common goal of reducing their strategic arsenals by 50 
percent 
both sides appeared to take a conciliatory attitude as the 
meeting approached the us statement said the united states 
delegation looks forward to a constructive and successful review 
viktor karpov chief of the soviet delegation said in an 
arrival statement saturday the upcoming discussions should not 
be confrontational 
the us team is led by the director of the arms control and

quayle on tuesday denounced as outrageous new allegations about 
his entry into the national guard and his involvement with a woman 
lobbyist 
quayle preparing for his first solo campaign trip said voters 
want to know about the issues they are not interested in a bunch 
of rumor and gossip and half truths and outright lies 
this is just getting a little bit outrageous and im getting a 
little bit indignant about just one bum rap after another quayle 
told reporters outside his home in mclean va 
quayle denied using his familys influence to get into the 
indiana national guard during the vietnam war 
there was no influence used quayle said i didnt have to 
use any influence because before i applied there were openings 
when i applied there were openings and after i applied there were 
openings

he asked the guard personnel office to hold open a space for quayle

retired major gen alfred ahner former military support officer 
for indiana and later head of the states national guard said he 
was contacted by an old friend wendell phillippi a retired guard

telephone interview from indiana thats when i went over to 
personnel i asked if they had any spaces for a good man 
they said they had a couple spaces i said hold one of them 
theres a good guy coming over 
he said it was not unusual for guard officials to take such 
recommendations and said he paid attention to phillippi 
because he was a former commanding general who would have an 
eye for good guardsman prospects ahner said quayle received no 
preferential treatment during his service 
there have been conflicting reports about whether there were 
vacancies in the guard when quayle sought entry 
a 1969 guard report indicated that the indiana guard was 
overextended in mid1969 but a monthbymonth breakdown made 
available tuesday indicated that quayles specific unit had 
openings when he joined up in may and in the months before and 
after 
capt cathi kiger said quayles guard unit had an authorized 
strength of 138 people in may 1969 according to guard records 134 
men were in the unit at the end of april 132 were serving in may 
when quayle joined and 133 men were enlisted in june 
the pentagon in washington further said that quayles public 
information unit of the guard authorized for a staff of five 
had three individuals assigned to it before quayle and another man 
brought it to full strength in january 1970 
meanwhile playboy magazine released an excerpt from an article 
in its forthcoming november issue in which onetime lobbyist paula 
parkinson said she told the fbi that quayle once propositioned her 
but she rebuffed him 
she said in the article that she and quayle hadnt actually 
slept together during a 1980 golfing vacation in florida but we 
flirted a lot and danced extremely close and suggestively he said 
he wanted to make love 
the release by playboy followed a published report in which two 
former attorneys for ms parkinson say she told the fbi in 1981 
about the alleged proposition 
the daily news of los angeles quoted the lawyers as saying that 
ms parkinson told the fbi quayle propositioned her when quayle 
then a congressman and two other legislators shared a cottage 
during the trip 
quayle who has been married since 1972 denounced the newspaper 
report 
that is just an absolute flatout falsehood he told 
reporters i had nothing to do with her down there i had nothing 
to do with her before and i had nothing to do with her afterwards 
i think yall are going to have to be a little bit careful about 
this because its totally untrue ive got a wife and three small 
children and i hope theres some respect and dignity for things i 
did not do before we go rushing off with all these socalled 
rumors 
the two lawyers represented ms parkinson when she was 
questioned on march 28 1981 by the fbi during an investigation of 
whether sexual favors were traded for votes against legislation 
ms parkinson was on the trip with rep tom evans rdel who lost 
his reelection bid in 1982 
one of the attorneys washington lawyer glenn lewis later told 
the associated press that playboys account was consistent with 
what ms parkinson had told the fbi 
quayle made a pass at her said he would like to sleep with 
her she said no im with tom lewis said referring to notes 
from the fbi interview 
they didnt do drugs together they didnt have sex lewis 
said 
washington attorney roy kinsey who also was present during the 
interview said his paraphrased notes show that she told the fbi 
quayle made a pass and said he would like to sleep with her 
quayle spent tuesday working on his stump speech in preparation 
for his first solo campaign trip on wednesday 
he is to attend legislative conferences in cincinnati and 
lexington ky before traveling to st louis where he will speak 
to the enlisted association of the national guard composed of 
current and former enlisted personnel 
questions about whether strings were pulled to get quayle into 
the guard and into indiana university law school have threatened to 
overwhelm his campaign 
an average college student quayle did not meet the law schools 
admission standards but gained entrance afer meeting with the 
admissions dean a republican judge in a city where quayles family 
owns the local newspaper according to published reports 
a former dean at the school said monday he was confident quayle 
received no special consideration

one person was killed and dozens were 
hurt in a battle between members of a mob and police who kept them 
from lynching two men suspected of raping and murdering a teenage 
girl authorities said tuesday 
the violence took place monday in the city of araraquara in 
southeastern brazil 170 miles northwest of sao paulo 
capt nicolau lambort of araraquara state police said the 
grandfather of the 14yearold girl was shot to death in the 
fourhour melee lambort said by telephone police did not know who 
fired the shot 
he said 14 policemen and 3040 townspeople were injured two 
with gunshot wounds in their legs no one was arrested 
lambort said a mob of 800 to 1000 men and women tried to lynch 
two men accused of the kidnap rape and stabbing death of a 
14yearold girl abducted last friday as she was walking home from 
school 
he said the mob was doubly enraged because on sunday one 
day after the girl was buried unidentified individuals unearthed 
her body and sexually molested it 
the captain said police quickly removed the two suspects and 
took them to another city when the infuriated mob gathered in front 
of the police station 
frustrated in their lynching attempt the mob started hurling 
rocks at the police station then they went on a rampage smashing 
windows of three banks and damaging other buildings in the city 
he reported 
he said araraquaras 230member police force was unable to quell 
the riot and 200 more police officers were called in from four 
neighboring cities

the fbi has no quota system to ensure 
hispanics are included in a program to train agents for top 
positions one of the fbis highestranking officials testified 
tuesday 
were trying to recruit the best people we can for the 
program said john otto executive assistant fbi director 
there are no quotas at this time but we want our very best 
people to include minorities and women 
otto one of three men who share the bureaus no 2 rank under 
director william sessions testified in a discrimination lawsuit 
against the fbi 
attorneys for the 311 hispanic agents joined in the classaction 
suit contend the fbi routinely keeps hispanics out of a fasttrack 
promotion path that includes the fourday management assessment 
program 
the plaintiffs contend the fbi discriminates against hispanics 
in hiring promotion assignments and discipline they seek 
unspecified damages and changes in fbi policies about 400 of the 
bureaus 9400 agents or 43 percent are hispanic compared 
with 8 percent of the general us population 
during the first week of testimony about 40 agents hispanic 
and nonhispanic testified that hispanic agents are transferred 
more often to undesirable locations are given less glamorous or 
more dangerous assignments and receive less recognition for their 
successes 
otto said the fbis career board which supervises the 
fasttrack promotion program holds an annual retreat in quantico 
va to discuss the problems of minorities 
no hispanics sit on the career board he testified 
in other testimony melvin jeter head of the fbis equal 
employment opportunity office said all 25 discrimination 
complaints brought in the past by agents in the classaction suit 
were determined to be unfounded 
asked by defense attorney felix baxter whether he considered 
himself antihispanic jeter said i certainly do not i 
personally look forward to going to conventions and recruiting 
hispanic agents 
margaret gulotta head of the fbis linguist program said any 
agent who speaks a foreign language can be required to use that 
skill throughout the agents career 
agents can serve as language specialists for three years then 
ask not to be requested to use the language again but a loophole 
in the rule allows supervisors to ask those agents to do undercover 
work listen to wiretaps and do other assignments in the language 
based upon the needs of the fbi 
the plaintiffs contend the fbi abuses that loophole keeping 
hispanic agents doing routine tasks such as listening to wiretaps 
that do not lead to management jobs 
the nonjury trial is scheduled to end friday and us district 
judge lucius bunton is expected to render a decision within six 
months federal employees are not entitled to jury trials when 
suing the government in discrimination cases

afghan guerrillas and western 
diplomats believe soviet forces suffered their worst losses in 8 
years of fighting in afghanistan when an ammunition depot blew up 
earlier this month 
but in mosow a soviet spokesman said tuesday there were no 
casualties in the explosions at the depot at the military base at 
kalagay 100 morth of the afghan capital of kabul 
the dump reportedly blew up aug 10 or aug 11 when it was hit 
by rebelfired rockets 
western diplomatic sources in islamabad on tuesday repeated 
their earlier report that the rebels claimed at least 109 soviets 
were killed and eight helicopters were destroyed 
last week guerrilla organizations said 500 soviet soldiers 
perished in the attack 
londons daily telegraph in its tuesday editions said up to 
710 soviet soldiers and civilians were killed it said a report 
received in peshawar pakistan from a guerrilla commander in the 
kalagay district claimed that 598 soviet soldiers and 112 soviet 
civilians were killed and 284 soviets were wounded 
the kalagay depot stored soviet ammunition and weapons for 
garrisons throughout the country 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov addressing 
a regular news briefing in moscow confirmed there had been an 
explosion at the kalagay base but he added 
the explosion took place at the place where they give arms to 
people from other detachments and there were no casualties he 
did not say when the blasts occured what might have caused them or 
give further details 
it is believed that the greatest loss suffered previously by the 
soviets in a single action occurred two years ago when fighting 
near a mountain tunnel triggered an avalance and more than 70 
soviet troopers were killed 
western reporters normally are barred from afghanistan by the 
marxist government and there was no independent confirmation of the 
conflicting accounts of casualties at kalagay 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help 
battle the guerrillas but they are now being withdrawn under an 
agreement signed in april by afghanistan and pakistan 
western diplomatic and rebels sources said tuesday the 
guerrillas are trying to capture their first major city and are 
attacking government forces aound three provincial capitals 
they gave these reports 
rebels battled their way into kunduz on aug 9 two days after 
soviet forces withdrew but last week government troops regained 
control and fighting continued 
the western sources said rebels shot down a soviet plane flying 
soldiers into kunduz and up to 45 people aboard the craft perished 
kabuls official media said as many as 265 guerrillas have been 
killed in the kunduz fighting it did not mention government 
casualties 
guerrillas claimed they seized the provincial capital of taloqan 
on aug 12 but the claim was not verified and one western source 
said there was fighting around the city 
on monday a rebel group said guerrillas had captured the 
arghandab district near kandahar city 
the soviet union had an estimated 115000 military personnel in 
afghanistan and recently announced half of the force had been 
removed as of aug 15 
under the april agreement all of the soviet troops are to be 
out of afghanistan by feb 15 and the soviets have said they will 
comply with the schedule 
but there were reports that the withdrawal has slowed 
we suspect this is a planned pause and that no further major 
movements will occur until the onset of winter one western 
diplomatic source said 
he said the soviets probably would make propaganda capital out 
of the delay 
the kremlin has accused pakistan of violating the april 
agreement by continuing to provide arms and bases for the 
guerrillas and declared it would take unspecified measure if the 
actions continued 
the guerrillas did not participate in the peace negotiations and 
have vowed to continue their fight

the international monetary fund on tuesday 
approved a 14 billion loan to brazil to supplement 52 billion 
in bank loans said a fund spokesman 
the imf loan to be disbursed by installment until feb 28 
1990 gives officials the opportunity to cut off funds if brazils 
economy has not performed as promised 
in the past the imf has required borrowers to lower their 
spending especially on subsidies in return for its help brazil 
reportedly has promised to cut government spending by 22 percent 
the funds spokesman who insisted on anonymity did not say how 
soon its loan would have to be repaid but brazil will have 20 
years including an eightyear grace period during which only 
interest will be due to pay back the 52 billion it borrowed from 
the banks 
the new loans amount to less than the interest payments on 
brazils current debt of 121 billion the largest in the third 
world last year the government suspended interest payments on its 
bank loans but began repayment again this year 
finance minister mailson da nobrega said in july that the 
suspension has not formally been revoked but he said that might be 
done when the countrys 700 creditor banks joined the new 
agreement last week he announced in new york that 95 percent of 
the total had been committed 
in addition to its mounting debts the government of president 
jose sarney has been struggling with inflation which reached a 
record 2404 percent in july one report has suggested brazils 
inflation rate will reach 927 percent for the year well above the 
600 percent level reportedly set in the governments agreements 
with both the fund and banks 
on july 30 brazil agreed in paris with 13 creditor governments 
including the united states to delay repayment of 5 billion of 
its l5 billion debt to them the united states has the largest 
block of votes in the imf 
the rescheduled debts which fall due between jan 1 1987 and 
march 31 1990 were delayed for 10 years with a fiveyear grace 
period 
brazil will pay neither a cent of interest nor principal until 
march 31 1990 on this money said sergio amaral brazils 
secretary for international affairs at the ministry of finance the 
country also has not reduced its principal on bank debt

the scheduled execution of a convicted 
killer who has maintained his innocence for more than a decade was 
stayed tuesday by the louisiana supreme court pending a review of 
the sentence 
after the ruling gov buddy roemer said he would wait for the 
courts review before deciding whether to commute the death 
sentence of ronald monroe to life imprisonment without parole as 
the states pardon board has recommended 
it was not known immediately how long the courts review would 
take 
monroe 33 had been scheduled to die early thursday for the 
sept 9 1977 stabbing death of lenora collins of new orleans the 
victims daughter then 11 also was stabbed and testified that 
monroe was the assailant 
i agree with the louisiana supreme courts decision to stay 
the execution of ronald monroe roemer said in a statement in 
capital punishment cases it is the responsibility of all those 
involved in the review process to be certain about administering 
justice 
earlier tuesday the governor said he was leaning against 
commutation but probably would stay the execution for up to 100 
days to allow courts to review the case again 
the pardon board issued its recommendation monday after a 
hearing lasting more than five hours board chairman yvonne 
campbell said the panel found that monroe had been deprived of due 
process of law she would not elaborate or disclose how board 
members voted 
during the hearing monroe pleaded for clemency maintaining 
that he had not committed the slaying 
i am innocent and will be innocent until the day i die he 
said 
prosecutors contend that collins 33 was killed after she told 
monroe he was being evicted from an apartment in her familys 
duplex 
defense attorney douglas morris of new york said a reputed 
confession to collins slaying by another man raised enough 
questions to justify commutation 
courts have rejected the claim that george stinson convicted in 
the 1980 stabbing death of his commonlaw wife in pontiac mich 
told a cellmate he killed collins according to court testimony 
the cellmate told police that stinson merely said collins had been 
killed in the same way as the michigan woman

palestinian underground leaders who oversee the 
uprising in the occupied lands expressed frustration over the sharp 
divisions in the plo and urged tuesday that the organization adopt 
a clear political strategy 
also tuesday israeli troops shot and wounded three palestinians 
during a clash in the jabaliya refugee camp in the the gaza strip 
arab reporters said quoting officials at the ahli arab hospital in 
gaza city 
an israeli army spokesman said he had no reports of violence in 
the gaza strip the camp has been under a curfew since monday 
the call from palestinian underground leaders to the plo on 
tuesday came in a leaflet the 24th issued since the rebellion 
began dec 8 among the 15 million palestinians in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
at least 252 palestinian have been killed since the uprising 
began and four israelis have been slain 
factions in the palestine liberation organization have been 
feuding over proposals to create a governmentinexile and declare 
an independent palestinian state in the west bank and gaza which 
israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
most of the frustration occurs among mainstream elements who 
support efforts to start peace negotiations with israel those on 
the other side feel such a move would aggravate divisions among 
palestinians 
daoud kutta a leading palestinian journalist said the main 
division is over how to deal with the question of recognizing 
israels right to exist 
people are saying the ambiguuity has to be cleared up he 
said 
supporters of plo chief yasser arafat have called for a clear 
statement recognizing the jewish state as a means of spurring 
negotiations opposing that view are the radicals including the 
popular front for the liberation of palestine led by george habash 
who oppose any concessions before peace talks 
tuesdays appeal was directed to the palestinian national 
council the 447member body the plo calls its parliament in exile 
it is expected to meet next month 
it said the underground is certain the council will adopt a 
comprehensive and clear political program which will gain 
widespread international support for the national rights of our 
people 
although the leaflet stressed that the clandestine leaders were 
not trying to take over they clearly were prodding the plo for a 
decision 
salah khalaf deputy commander of arafats fatah guerrillas 
said monday on austrian radio he expects a palestinian government 
and state to be formed by years end 
we are realists israel is there it exists as far as the 
political reality is concerned he said 
khalaf also known as abu iyad has called for a provisional 
government with a new charter to replace the plo covenant calling 
for the destruction of israel and establishment of a democratic 
secular state 
the khalaf proposal is opposed by prosyrian palestinian 
factions on the left and moslem fundamentalist groups on the right 
hamas a fundamentalist umbrella group whose name is arabic for 
zeal says an international peace conference is an american plot to 
create circumstances so some palestinians can sign over palestine 
to the jews 
saleh hussein a moslem preacher in bethlehem said in an 
interview the fundamentalists want to create a panislamic state 
the plo wants to live with jews as partners either with two 
different states or in one state and we completely reject this 
idea and refuse to be partners with the jews in any plan he 
declared 
a document circulated in the west bank this month by the 
prosyrian followers of abu musa attacked moderate calls for a 
palestinianisraeli dialogue and rejected a palestinian state 
limited to the west bank and gaza 
such a state means part of palestine is not a home for its 
citizens but a home of the canadian american and russian jews and 
whoever is thinking of immigrating the statement said 
jerome m segal a university of maryland professor whose 
writings influenced palestinians who drafted a proposed declaration 
of independence said a turning point had been reached in 
palestinianisraeli relations 
segal speaking to a hebrew university audience said 
palestinians should act on their own to declare a state and seek 
international recognition 
about five minutes into his speech 12 supporters of the 
rightwing tehiya party stood up and began chanting plo no 
the hecklers sat down after a few minutes and left the hall shortly 
afterward 
in another development michel sabah the first arab appointed 
roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem rejected an invitation to 
meet with yitzhak rabin the defense minister rabin has held 
private meetings with several other palestinian notables 
a church official said sabahs refusal was in line with vatican 
policy of not meeting with israeli authorities in jerusalem 
the vatican does not recognize israeli control over jerusalem 
which was given international status by the united nations under a 
1947 partition plan israel captured the arab section of jerusalem 
in the 1967 war annexed it and declared the entire city the 
israeli capital

sacramento calif george bush declared tuesday night he will 
not abandon running mate dan quayle in the face of a host of 
questions about quayles personal and social past 
standing before a crowd of supporters gathered in front of the 
california state capitol bush said im not going to let some 
insidious rumormongers drive me to change my mind im standing 
behind dan quayle 
sheila tate bushs press secretary said the campaign considers 
questions about quayle to be resolved 
i think now its just getting more petty she said its 
more partisan and less credible and we consider it behind us 
earlier in seattle bush said he was appalled at one query 
about dan quayles behavior with a female lobbyist and declared 
that his campaign would get back on track whenever you stop 
asking me these questions 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller earlier insisted that no 
thought was being given to dropping quayle from the ticket calling 
the 41yearold indiana senator a tremendous asset and the 
vice presidents aides said they would refer future questions about 
quayle to the senators own staff 
bush while greeting workers at the seattle steel plant was 
asked by reporters about new reports concerning quayles purported 
use of special influence to get into law school and the national 
guard when his undergraduate draft deferment expired during the 
vietnam war 
the vice president responded simply that such stories were 
exaggerated and when asked if his campaign was hurt by them said 
his message would get through to the people whenever you stop 
asking me these questions 
and bush told one reporter that im appalled that you could 
ask about a report concerning quayles behavior with ms 
parkinson the buxom lobbyist and later playboy nude model who 
shared a vacation cottage with quayle and two other congressmen on 
a trip to florida in 1980 
the daily news in los angeles quoted two former attorneys for 
ms parkinson as saying that she told the fbi in 1981 that quayle 
propositioned her during the trip but that she refused saying 
im with tom thenrep tom evans rdel ms parkinson was 
lobbying against a crop insurance bill which quayle subsequently 
voted against quayle has denied any impropriety concerning the 
woman 
and playboy on tuesday said an article in its november issue 
will include a statement directly from ms parkinson that quayle 
propositioned her during the trip 
bush a day earlier had made an impassioned defense of his 
embattled running mate before the veterans of foreign wars 
convention in chicago and the bush campaign had quayle travel to 
chicago monday night to make points in his own behalf 
while the vice president mixed with hardhats on the grounds 
outside the steel mill fuller told reporters that the storm over 
quayle is something the press is going to have to contend with 
rather than the campaign 
fuller called the parkinson report ridiculous theres nothing 
to it asked how he knew he replied simply we are certain 
theres nothing to it 
asked about the latest stories detailing quayles purported 
jockeying to get into the indiana national guard bush said i 
didnt see it i never deal in rumors especially if theyre ugly 
and hurtful 
standing before an elbowtoelbow jampacked rally later in 
portlands pioneer courthouse square later bush said that i have 
my confidence in the new generation i have my confidence in dan 
quayle and wait till you see this guy on job training and national 
defense youll be as proud of him as i am 
at the steel mill earlier bush got a generally polite but cool 
reception from an audience composed largely of members of a united 
steel workers local 
he toured the plant getting a briefing from managers as he 
stood on a high railing overlooking a smelter where molten steel 
was being poured into huge vats 
on the way into the plant site bushs limousine encountered 
probush hardhats on one side of the narrow road and hardhats 
carrying dukakis signs across the way 
im interested in how the members of the union feel and i 
think were going to do pretty well with members and thats where 
you got to so bush said as he answered questions while greeting 
people along a ropeline 
some of the union officials will be the other way 
historically they have but nobody can dictate to the working man 
or a working woman how they vote

idaho farmers and equipment dealers tuesday 
responded to a state officials plea and donated balers tractors 
trucks and other equipment to droughtcursed iowa farmers lured by 
an offer of free hay 
organizers of the hay harvest had been worried that there 
wouldnt be enough machinery to keep the iowans busy on wednesday 
when they are scheduled to begin working 
but offers of equipment began pouring into the farm bureau 
office in moscow tuesday after norman plank a farm bureau official 
from orofino appealed on television for donations the night before 
its very very encouraging plank said i just cant 
believe the response from people up here 
the 60 iowans who were scheduled to arrive in moscow tuesday 
night after a 1600mile bus trip planned to harvest hay on 
pasture land that has been placed in the governments conservation 
reserve program the hay is to be shipped back to iowa where the 
drought has stunted or destroyed thousands of pasture acres 
don murdock an iowa farm bureau official in chariton said 
organizers originally thought an equipment dealer association was 
going to lend the balers and other implements the iowa farmers 
need but the organizers later found out the association actually 
wanted to lease the equipment 
im sure it wasnt anything deliberate just wishful 
thinking he said of the misunderstanding 
plank said all of the equipment made available tuesday had been 
donated either by moscowarea farmers or implement dealers 
hopefully well have enough to keep everybody busy he 
said weve got our fingers crossed were a little shy on 
tractors yet and its possible we need a few more trucks but the 
swathers and balers are coming in pretty good 
plank said individuals and businesses in the area also called to 
donate items such as food cash fuel and baling twine 
in addition 30 motel rooms were donated for a 10day period he 
said before that offer the farmers had planned to stay in 
dormitories at the university of idaho in moscow 
that puts them in a central location plank said it will 
be much easier to dispatch them out and work with them its a real 
blessing 
right now were a little concerned with transportation to and 
from the field but were working on that right now 
murdock said the need for hay was urgent some of the farmers on 
the trip say they need at least 50 tons of hay to get through the 
winter 
with adequate machinery and land one operator could harvest 
that much hay in a day murdock said a large bale of hay weighs 
between 1000 and 1500 pounds and consumes about an acre of hay 
he added 
but our need is so much more i cant begin to put a number on 
it he said 
murdock said he could easily fill two more buses with farmers 
wanting to help harvest the hay but he has told callers there will 
not be any more trips unless machinery becomes available 
the venture is a cooperative effort of the farm bureau of idaho 
and iowa with greyhound donating the buses burlington northern 
railroad donating freight space for the hay and three banks in 
chariton a town of about 5000 that is 45 miles south of des 
moines putting up cash for meals along the way

you cant get there from here used to be 
the punch line of jokes about rural america but its become a fact 
of life for too many people a congresswoman told a conference on 
rural transportation tuesday 
the farm crisis deregulation of the transportation industry and 
too high a priority on urban transit has caused a major upheaval in 
rural areas rep virginia smith rneb said 
the revitalization of rural america cannot and will not occur 
unless we guarantee mobility she said 
intercity bus service has declined over the past 20 years she 
noted 
since 1982 more than 3000 towns have lost their bus service 
and 92 percent of those towns have populations less than 10000 
people mrs smith told the twoday conference sponsored by the 
us department of agriculture 
she urged people in rural america to fight for their share of 
transportation dollars 
we make up 39 percent of the nations population but we get 
less than 3 percent of the funds she said its time we got 
our fair share 
the nations rural people need education and transportation 
but their population is decreasing their affluence is dwindling 
and they can least afford the services they need the most said 
new york state sen charles cook of delaware county in central new 
york about 65 miles southwest of albany 
more than half of the nations farm families rely on nonfarm 
income as well they are reliant on transportation they dont 
just go to town once a week to get staples anymore he said 
mrs smith recounted results of a study made of the black hills 
stage line which makes a 564mile daily trip from omaha to rapid 
city sd west across nebraska on us highway 20 
when the owners threatened to discontinue the line mrs smith 
went to thentransportation secretary elizabeth dole to plead the 
case she came up with 225000 for a demonstration project to keep 
the bus route alive for one year 
she got more money in washington and the nebraska legislature 
came up with 50000 during the recent session to match it for 
another year 
results of the demonstration study revealed that half of the 
people riding the bus had no other means of transportation 
twothirds said they couldnt have made the trip without the bus 
mrs smith said 
half said they had a yearly income of less than 10000 and 
one in every five said they were using the bus to go to work 
school or a job pool she said 
the towns are small the distances are great but the people 
need the bus she said 
mrs smith said she had been told that doctors rely on the bus 
for medicine hospitals for blood supplies farmers for machinery 
parts and the florist for flowers 
its the only option for overnight deliveries many of the 
states elderly use it to get to the doctor and to visit friends 
and family 
a ray of hope was offered by michael redisch chief of research 
and analysis for the interstate commerce commissions office of 
transportation analysis 
theres a lot of capital out there a lot of old buses and old 
terminals that need to be disposed of he said secondly 
theres a whole new breed of managers coming to the deregulated 
companies and theyre trying to break with past habits and 
practices 
that transition spells promise for the future he said adding 
new ideas and innovations will help change the face of rural 
america

about 2000 students marched 
around the university of cape town campus tuesday to protest the 
governments banning of a group opposed to the military draft 
about 20 young men who addressed the demonstrators said they 
would refuse to serve in the military echoing the stand announced 
by 143 other men this month 
military service is mandatory for white men and voluntary for 
other races 
numerous antiapartheid groups and individual activists have 
condemned the ban imposed by police monday on the end conscription 
campaign an organization founded five years ago which advocated 
alternative nonmilitary service for young men with moral or 
political objections to joining the armed forces 
the rev allan hendrickse leader of the mixedrace chamber of 
parliament was among those denouncing the ban the black majority 
is excluded from parliament which also has chambers for whites and 
asians 
hendrickse said there should be no conscription until all south 
africans have equal political rights 
defense minister magnus malan called hendrickses remarks a 
slap in the face to soldiers and accused him of playing into 
the hands of terrorists 
the congress of south african trade unions the countrys 
largest black labor federation said the ban was a sign of weakness 
by the government 
a government is in a serious crisis when it feels gravely 
threatened by a smallish campaign questioning an aspect of its 
policy the federation said 
despite the powerful propaganda instruments at its disposal 
it is not able to stem the growing disquiet among whites about the 
role of the defense force

troops in burma killed up to 3000 demonstrators 
during a wave of protests two weeks ago and authorities have failed 
to take measures to prevent further unlawful killings amnesty 
international charged tuesday 
citing reliable reports the human rights organizaton said 
burmese soldiers acting under a state of emergency killed 1000 to 
3000 demonstrators mostly unarmed and peaceful in violence this 
month 
amnesty representative ingrid kircher told a un human rights 
panel that the soldiers appeared to use unreasonable and 
unnecessary force against protesters and violated un guidelines 
for the conduct of law enforcement personnel 
the emergency remains in effect and there are no clear 
indications of government action to prevent further unlawful 
killings should demonstrations resume she said in a statement to 
the un subcommission on prevention of discrimination and 
protection of minorities 
soldiers repeatedly fired into unarmed peaceful crowds and at 
protesters who turned violent when the studentled unrest peaked in 
the second week of august amnesty said 
the organization said the burmese government admits 112 
demonstrators were killed but publicly denies wrongdoing by 
security forces 
burma has been in turmoil since september when students rioted 
over the voiding of 60 percent of the currency 
bloody rioting increasingly focused on political demands 
occurred in march and june and after a lull resumed in late july 
after hardliner sein lwin took over the countrys ruling party on 
july 26 sein lwin resigned aug 12 and was replaced by maung maung 
took power friday

president corazon aquino said tuesday 
she was confident her government will stay in power and said she 
will personally guarantee the safety of ferdinand marcos if the 
courts let him come home 
at a news conference with filipino reporters the 55yearold 
president brushed aside charges of incompetence leveled by vice 
president salvador laurel and said she had more important tasks 
to attend to than respond to his charges publicly 
mrs aquino was asked to comment on a statement made monday by 
her chief aide executive secretary catalino macaraig that the 
government could not afford to have marcos return from hawaii 
because foes of the ousted president might try to kill him and 
blame the slaying on the administration 
in the event that mr marcos is allowed by our courts to 
return we will expect adequate security she said it an 
assassination attempt will not happen because if it is necessary 
for the chief of staff himself to go there and escort him then i 
will do that mrs aquino said 
mrs aquinos husband sen benigno aquino jr was killed in 
1983 while under military escort at manila airport moments after 
returning from three years in the united states 
the shooting helped inflame popular unrest which toppled marcos 
and propelled mrs aquino to the presidency in february 1986 
mrs aquino refused to allow marcos to return from hawaiian 
exile 
last week however an anticorruption court said marcos had the 
right to crossexamine a former cabinet minister who is due to 
give a deposition next november if the statement was to be used as 
evidence in any future criminal trial 
marcos who is a lawyer said he would demand the right to 
conduct his own defense at the deposition hearing mrs aquino has 
said she would abide by the decision of the court if it rules that 
marcos can return 
mrs aquino said tuesday she was confident no new coup attempt 
would be made during her threeday visit to brunei which begins 
monday 
rumors of a new attempt surfaced after laurel this month called 
on mrs aquino to resign and order new presidential elections 
she said tuesday i think there are enough people in 
the nation who support us and who are concerned about the 
preservation of democracy in our country so i feel confident 
rumors notwithstanding this government will continue 
mrs aquino said of laurels charges i would just like to 
remind the vice president i know what my duties are as president of 
the philippines i think that he knows what his duties are as 
vice president i dont want to engage in namecalling i have more 
important tasks to attend do

former black panther leader huey 
newton refused to leave prison on his scheduled release date 
tuesday demanding that officials also free fellow inmate and 
expanther elmer geronimo pratt 
newton has been in prison for 60 days for parole violations 
pratt a convicted murderer has been serving a life term since his 
conviction in 1972 two weeks ago he lost his eighth bid for parole 
after a state panel called him a danger to the public 
sue gegner an acquaintance of newtons said that newton did 
not expect pratt to be freed its more of a statement that hes 
trying to make she said 
geronimo pratt has been unjustly imprisoned for over 18 years 
and he newton feels very strongly about this gegner said 
san quentin spokeswoman jeanne ballatore said that when officers 
went to newtons cell tuesday morning to begin release proceedings 
he refused to leave 
prison officers filed a disciplinary action against newton for 
refusing to obey a direct order a state parole board panel met at 
the prison later in the day and recommended that newtons sentence 
be lengthened by 30 days for violating the order but newton 
instead requested a formal hearing by the full state parole board 
ballatore said 
he will remain in custody at least until the full hearing set 
for aug 30 and the boards decision about what action is in 
order she said 
if newton continues to refuse to leave he can receive 
additional discliplinary citations that require him to remain 
behind bars up to the time his parole expires on feb 8 1989 
if at that point in time if he continues to refuse a 
decision would have to be made hed be trespassing at that 
point she said 
authorities recall just one other inmate who declined to be 
released from prison at the scheduled time said corrections 
department spokeswoman christine may 
theodore streleski killed popular stanford university math 
professor karel deleeuw in 1978 smashing his head with a twopound 
hammer he later called the killing a protest over treatment of 
graduate students at the school 
he refused to express remorse for the crime and turned down 
parole three times from march 1984 to september 1985 because the 
terms of his parole said he couldnt live in the san francisco bay 
area when he was finally released his term for parole had expired 
and he had no restrictions on where he could live 
newton served nine months of a 16month state prison term for 
possessing firearms as an exfelon he was released on parole dec 
8 
he was returned to custody in june for parole violations that 
included failure to submit to drug testing and failure to advise 
his parole officer that he had been arrested for investigation of 
driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs 
supporters of pratt a former panther deputy defense minister 
contend hes a political prisoner and the victim of police efforts 
to jail panther leaders and dismantle the oaklandbased radical 
movement of the late 1960s and early 70s 
pratt was found guilty of slaying a santa monica woman during a 
30 robbery in 1968 her husband also was shot but survived pratt 
maintained he was at party headquarters in oakland at the time

a 20yearold brazilian woman died tuesday 
night after trying to swim the english channel the coast guard 
said 
renata camara agondi was pulled from the sea and into her escort 
boat when she encountered difficulty eight miles from cap gris nez 
on the french coast at about 7 pm 2 pm edt 
a british air force rescue helicopter summoned from manston in 
southeast england took her from the boat and to calais france but 
she died in an ambulance en route to a hospital there a coast 
guard spokesman said 
the spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping with british 
custom said there was nothing untoward in weather conditions 
dr christopher stockdale medical officer for the doverbased 
channel swimming association said miss agondi was a marathon 
swimmer of worldwide status who three weeks ago successfully 
completed a world championship swimming race of similar distance 
the cause of death was not determined immediately stockdale 
said fatigue and hypothermia were possible factors in her death 
he said a doctor examined her on aug 12 and found her 
completely fit stockdale added that miss agondi appeared in 
perfect physical condition and was in good spirits before setting 
off from dover for france tuesday morning 
in a straight line the distance from the southeast english port 
of dover to the nearest point in france is 21 miles but winds 
tides and currents make the distance longer for swimmers 
earlier tuesday high winds forced retired teacher ashby harper 
of albuquerue nm to abandon his attempt to become the oldest 
person to swim the channel harper 71 was more than halfway 
across when he decided to get out of the water 
at least three people are known to have died previously trying 
to swim the channel since the first proved swim in 1875 by matthew 
webb an english marchant navy captain the last previous death was 
in 1984 
fewer than one in 10 attempts to swim the channel are successful 
about 300 people the youngest age 12 and the oldest 68 have 
conquered the waterway and a few of them have done it several times 
the swim is difficult because of the cold and throatparching 
salt water stinging jellyfish floating logs diesel fumes from 
the escort boat winds and opposing tides that drag swimmers into 
an s course and nearly always add 10 miles or so to the 
distance

member lubomir strougal did not discussed sundays demonstrations

police said tuesday that guerillas 
using explosives heavily damaged a jungle bridge on a main highway 
near tingo maria 
they said the monday night attack 220 miles northeast of lima 
came during a threeday armed strike against a us proposal to 
kill coca plants with a herbicide 
cesar acosta chief of antidrug police in the region said 
guerrillas of the maoist shining path movement called the attacks 
and used fallen trees rocks and boulders to block roads leading to 
tingo maria 
the rebels are urging peasants to protest a us proposal to 
spray coca the raw material of cocaine with the herbicide spike 
the government says rebels protect drug traffickers in exchange for 
funds to buy arms 
the huallaga valley north of tingo maria is known as the cocaine 
cradle because about 60 percent of the worlds coca is harvested 
illegally there 
coca leaves are refined into semiprocessed cocaine and then 
smuggled into colombia where it is refined into cocaine for sale 
abroad 
environmentalists have criticized the hebicide plan saying that 
spike will denude all plants and ruin the zone for food crops for 
years to come 
peru demanded more testing before spike is used and the us 
government agreed 
acosta said police recovered pamphlets signed by the shining 
path protesting the spike plan and the presence of agents of the 
us drug enforcement administration in the area 
about a dozen us agents have been in the area for more than a 
year advising peruvian antidrug units the government has said

boy will hbo be in trouble if michael dukakis 
is elected president the cable channel has dropped tanner 88 
the series about a fictional underdog presidential candidate and 
kitty dukakis is such a fan she was in it 
mrs dukakis did a cameo in the final episode filmed last month 
at the democratic national convention in atlanta 
hbo had agreed to carry the robert altmangarry trudeau series 
only through the convention but the tanner crew hoped to get an 
extension based on their good critical notices and take candidate 
jack tanner through the november election as an independent 
except for a possible preelection special the series final 
episode the reality check airs thursday as well as aug 28 
and 30 
otherwise this is it ill ride off into the sunset said 
michael murphy who plays tanner next week this time ill be 
out of work and depressed 
murphy may only be out of work temporarily the public 
broadcasting service is hoping to find an underwriter to pick up 
the series and move it to public television for the rest of the 
campaign that will take some doing since time is short and the 
show is expensive 
ive never had response to a character that ive had with 
this said murphy in an interview on the set in atlanta the 
response is not only positive its intelligent we get people who 
get it who get what were trying to do here everybody except hbo 
i guess 
if i had a show that was talked about the way this show is 
and had garry trudeau and robert altman under my wing id be 
jumpin up and down wed love to take it to the election which 
would be a nice way to finish this thing 
a move to pbs said murphy would be great because we could 
reach the audience were really looking for and you wouldnt have 
to be wired up and there still wouldnt be any commercials id 
love to be over there and theyre trying as we speak theyre 
trying to get the dough 
trudeau who writes the scripts and is coproducer is the 
cartoonist of doonesbury fame director altman mash 
nashville is known for his facility with improvisation and 
gritty realism 
the two combined to create a fictional series that feels like 
the real thing and in fact tanners campaign slogan is for 
real in atlanta confused passersby spotted the tanner office in 
the cnn center and stopped stockstill which one is that one 
woman wondered when confronted with the tanner billboards 
but most of the politically savvy crowd in town for the 
convention were up on tanner 
whatll you do if you really win joked a woman who spotted 
murphy relaxing near the set murphy just laughed 
tanner has run into all his opponents along the campaign 
trail and many have done cameos in atlanta the tanner crew 
learned mrs dukakis was a fan when one of her staffers told them 
shed like to do a scene 
we said what do you want to do murphy recounted and she 
said well i want to do a scene with that girlfriend 
tanners girlfriend joanna was skulking around in the early 
episodes because she was working for the dukakis campaign 
we went up and sort of started kicking things around murphy 
said garry trudeau said well she joanna should be a little 
nervous because shes shown some lapses in judgment here and 
kitty said quite spontaneously what for falling in love so we 
thought that was great and we thought wed shoot something like 
that 
in the reality check joanna wendy crewson has lunch with 
mrs dukakis who forgives joanna her indiscretions then asks her 
to seek tanners support for dukakis 
by the end of the episode tanners staff is pondering whether 
to run their man as an independent 
emile the campaigns pollster played by jim fyfe argues in 
favor of an independent run leadership isnt about management 
especially given the very real limitations on presidential power 
its about values its about choosing roads not paving them 
the episode concludes with joanna back from her lunch its 
over jack she says isnt it jack tanner stares 
enigmatically into the camera as the credits roll

as in some nationwide game of musical chairs 
united methodists have ordered their big reshuffling of bishops by 
sept 1 theyre to be in their new places 
its a quadrennial changeabout of area leadership in which some 
bishops new and old are deployed to different posts this time 
21 bishops were involved 40 percent of the churchs total of 50 
active us bishops 
in the process five regional conferences july 1216 elected a 
total of 15 new bishops they were consecrated and assigned to 
areas other than where they came from six incumbent bishops were 
transferred to new areas 
the movingabout of clergy bishops and pastors reflects the 
denominations itinerant ministry which stems historically 
from early american circuit riding ministers always on the go 
the purpose is to infuse new blood and fresh ideas so people 
dont get into a rut says thomas mcanally of nashville tenn 
director of the denominations news service 
however pastors used to be moved much more often that they 
are now he added noting that some churchgrowth studies 
indicate that longer pastorates are more effective 
pastors now generally serve congregations several years some 
indefinitely but are subject to annual appointment by their 
bishops bishops in office for life are limited to serving two 
fouryear terms in each place except in special circumstances 
the current reposting of bishops and choosing of new ones in 
the 96millionmember denomination occurred at five jurisdictional 
conferences involving a total of about 2000 delegates half 
clergy and half laity 
two women were elected as bishops each in their early 40s 
among the youngest bishops ever named in us methodisms history 
under church law they wont have to retire until 2012 
they are 
bishop sharon brown christopher 43 of waukesha wis elected 
at the north central meeting in buckhannon west va assigned as 
bishop in minneapolis replacing retired bishop emerson s colaw 
bishop susan burch morrison 45 of baltimore elected at the 
northeastern meeting in de kalab ill assigned as bishop in 
philadelphia replacing bishop f herbert skeete who was 
transferred to boston 
the denomination has one other active woman bishop judith craig 
of detroit and two previous women bishops leontine kelly of san 
francisco retired and the late marjorie mathews of detroit who 
died in 1986 
other transfers besides skeete included bishops george w 
bashore from boston to pittsburgh edwin c boulton from fargo 
nd to west canton ohio replacing retired james s thomas 
calvin d mcconnell from portland ore to seattle wash and 
melvin g talbert from seattle to san francisco replacing the 
retired kelly 
also bishop john w russell of dallas was transferred to to the 
newly created fort worth area formerly combined with dallas while 
newly elected bishop bruce p blake formerly a winfield kan 
college president was assigned to dallas 
blake was elected at the south central meeting in new orleans 
which also elected bishops william b oden an enid okla pastor 
assigned to baton rouge la replacing the late walter l 
underwood and dan e solomon of corpus christi texas assigned to 
oklahoma city replacing retired john w hart 
blake oden and solomon were all consecrated in ceremonies at 
new orleans roman catholic cathedral 
it was a great ecumenical gesture said the citys catholic 
archbishop philip hannan 
the western jurisdiction meeting in san diego elected only one 
bishop but it took 38 ballots over about three days to do it he 
is william w dew jr an alamo calif pastor and former theology 
professor assigned to portland ore replacing transferred 
mcconnell 
the north central meeting in de kalb besides electing 
christopher also elected two male bishops 
they are r sheldon duecker of muncie ill assigned to 
chicago replacing retired jesse dewitt and william b lewis of 
belleville ill assigned to fargo nd replacing transferred 
boulton 
not for about 50 years had one jurisdiction elected so many 
bishops in one year as the seven elected in the southeastern 
meeting at lake junaluska nc 
one was black bishop joseph b bethea district superintendent 
in raleigh nc assigned as bishop at columbia sc replacing 
retired roy c clark he becomes the denominations 13th black 
bishop 
other southeastern elections were 
bishops thomas b stockton of high point nc assigned to 
richmond va replacing retired robert m blackburn h hasbrouck 
hughes jr of richmond assigned to lakeland fla replacing 
retired earl g hunt 
also moved were bishops richard c looney of knoxville tenn 
assigned a new area of macon ga robert h spain of nashville 
tenn assigned to louisville ky replacing retired paul a 
duffey 
bishop c w hancock of macon city ga was assigned to a new 
area of montgomery ala and bishop clay f lee of jackson miss

south korea has expressed deep 
disappointment at a us trade bill signed into law by president 
ronald reagan saying it will create a confrontational world 
trading environment 
in a statement the foreign ministry accused the us trade bill 
signed tuesday of having all the protectionist elements which 
aroused so much concern and protest from korea and many other 
trading nations 
we are particularly concerned with the likely 
counterreactions from us trading partners the statement said 
adding the bills legislation would entail enactment of similiar 
laws or retaliations 
the statement also urged the us adminstration to ensure the 
law be implemented in such a way as not to adversely affect either 
the smooth growth of the koreaus trade relationship 
the new law is designed to battle the us trade deficit by 
streamlining machinery for imposing import curbs which would 
retaliate against international trade violations 
it also expands job training for workers left unemployed by 
import competition and strengthens the administrations hand in the 
current round of world trade talks

a 400 picture telephone and 
other expensive gadgets are taking their places alongside the santa 
claus toilet paper windshield ice protectors and other household 
items that for years have characterized the spencer gifts catalog 
changing demands in the mailorder business mean a newer 
increasingly upscale product lineup for spencer greater 
concentration on retail outlets and a new computerized telephone 
ordering system company president john hacala said in a recent 
interview 
for years spencer gifts inc could get by with its offerings of 
elastic bra extenders personalized calendar towels and other 
inexpensive unusual household items and gadgets 
its nothing you need and everything youd like to have 
says laurin letort the companys vice president of human resources 
but competition and a changing consumer profile have forced some 
changes 
the mailorder industry has become a booming business 
especially with more expensive merchandise such as what ll bean 
and j crew offers letort said of the clothing retailers for 
years spencer gifts and several other companies stuck with 
lowerprice products 
but with postage increases and higher wages its become 
difficult to operate at that level 
in recent years spencer has concentrated most of its energy on 
retail stores usually located in shopping malls the company has 
more than 600 stores in 46 states letort said 
spencer also plans to change the focus of its catalog 
merchandise in an effort to keep up with its changing customers 
a first step has been the introduction of several a2z stores 
and catalogs featuring more expensive products and gadgets such 
the 400 picture phone a 30 baseball cap with a solarpowered 
fan a 70 inflatable raft complete with builtin toy machine guns 
and a 200 neon telephone 
spencer gifts stores are geared to attract younger consumers 
while catalogs from spencer gifts inc traditionally have attracted 
women over 45 years old in rural america hacala said 
but now 50 percent of american women are in the workforce and 
time is not available to hit the stores as much so they like to 
shop out of a catalog for the things they really need he said 
spencer gifts eventually will change its catalog offerings to 
reflect the shopping trend hacala says he says the company also 
must select more expensive products for financial reasons 
we cant continue concentrating on 88cent products hacala 
says you cant pack and ship that merchandise costeffectively 
the final figures are not in but spencer gifts a whollyowned 
subsidiary of mca inc in los angeles projects sales of 300 
million for 1987 
in the catalog business letort says the company is about the 
last of the few survivors at the lower end of the market we need 
to reposition ourselves to go after a higher profit margin 
by switching its focus spencer gifts will transfer its 
mailorder facility in atlantic city to williamsburg va where 
labor is more readily available at lower wages than in the 
northeast more than 200 fulltime jobs will be affected although 
another 800 or so people traditionally have been hired as temporary 
packers during the busy holiday season hacala says 
he says the companys national headquarters will remain in egg 
harbor township 
spencer also must modernize its mailorder system one of the 
originals in the business 
since 1947 a paper order form in each catalog has been the only 
way to order hacala said now the company is investing in an 
elaborate computer system that will allow customers to order via a 
tollfree telephone number he said 
people want instant gratification he said

market strategists say the new york stock 
exchanges first monthly statistical breakdown on computerdriven 
trading reinforces their view that the broad range of investors 
remained sidelined nearly 10 months after the 1987 crash 
the report released monday also indicated that computerized 
program trading accounted for only a tenth of the nyses light 
volume in july with most of it done by a few big brokerage firms 
included some that briefly had halted the practice for their own 
accounts 
the report provided some of the most detailed figures yet 
available on the shortterm and highly profitable trading 
technique blamed by some studies for playing a role in the crash 
and creating volatility that has frightened investors away 
it showed program trading in july accounted for only 101 
percent of the average daily trading volume of 1669 million 
shares by contrast program trading accounted for about 20 percent 
of the record volume during the crash 
some professionals called the nyse report significant because it 
suggested program trading had declined substantially but others 
said the report showed that apathetic postcrash investor 
participation in the market an increasing concern on wall street 
was even worse than previously thought 
when program trading is added to dividendcaptures and other 
shortterm techniques that inflated volume last month the amount 
of genuine investing in stocks constituted 80 million shares a 
day or less some said 
youre really looking at about 50 percent of the volume that 
has been relatively meaningless said jack barbanel a strategist 
at gruntal amp co in new york if youre trying to gauge whether 
people are coming back to the market this tells you theyre not 
another trading strategist who spoke on condition he not be 
identified because of the sensitivity of the issue said of the 
nyse report heres what i think is happening nothings 
happening there are so few real buyers theres nothing 
program trading is a generic term referring to the purchase or 
sale of large amounts of stocks or groups of stocks through the use 
of highspeed computer connections between brokerages and trading 
exchanges 
the most controversial form of program trading is called index 
arbitrage which involves the sale of stocks in one market and 
purchase of stockindex futures in another or vice versa to 
profit from brief price disparities 
index arbitrage has been blamed for injecting sudden and 
unpredictable price swings into stocks without regard to underlying 
values a clamor about index arbitrage compelled several major 
brokerages to announce earlier this year they had suspended its use 
for themselves but would do it for customers 
the nyse report suggested bear stearns cos had resumed index 
arbitrage for its own account trading 302 million shares in july 
bear stearns chairman and chief executive alan greenberg 
confirmed in a telephone interview that the firm was back in the 
indexarbitrage business 
the report also showed merrill lynch amp co traded 72 million 
shares for its own account morgan stanley amp co traded 52 
million painewebber group inc 46 million goldman sachs amp co 
14 million shearson lehman hutton inc 800000 kidder peabody 
group inc 600000 and salomon brothers inc 100000 officials at 
morgan painewebber goldman kidder and shearson said their house 
ban on index arbitrage remained unchanged morgan painewebber 
goldman and kidder aides said the nyse figures were distorted 
because trading reported on their own accounts was actually done on 
behalf of customers 
shearson spokesman james podany said the figure reported by the 
nyse represented another form of program trading not index 
arbitrage salomon officials did not return telephone calls 
the nyse report also indicated 654 percent of all program 
trades executed through the exchange were related to index 
arbitrage it also showed that morgan merrill bear stearns and 
two smaller investment concerns susquehanna investment group and 
lit america inc accounted for almost 75 percent of all index 
arbitrage in july 
nyse spokeswoman sharon gamsin said the report was part of an 
nyse decision in may to require all member firms to disclose 
statistics on program trading she said the monthly reports were 
created to make as much information available to investors as 
possible

audi of america inc is showing signs of 
rebounding from a dramatic sales decline that followed complaints 
and lawsuits over accidents caused by unintended acceleration of 
some audis according to one company executive 
richard mugg vice president in charge of audi of america said 
monday that if the company maintained its early august sales pace 
it would top the months sales goal of 2600 cars 
in the past for audi that would have been no big deal but 
when you are in a recovery process its very encouraging he said 
mugg credited audis revision and renaming of one line of us 
cars plus a new warranty aimed at highcost maintenance for 
aiding the early sales rebound 
sales in the first two weeks after the aug 1 introduction of 
audis new warranty and new 100 and 200 series cars were up 59 
percent from the first half of july mugg said 
he acknowledged that july was a slow month to compare with that 
late summer sales usually are not brisk and that july also marked 
the closeout of the discontinued audi 5000 line 
audi of americas sales reached about 74000 in 1985 but dropped 
to 41000 last year and mugg has projected 27000 in sales for 
this year after a wave of complaints of sudden unintended 
acceleration incidents leading to accidents and lawsuits 
the complaints also have involved other brands of automobiles 
but not as often as audis audi engineers and other investigators 
have failed to find a mechanical fault 
audi began installing interlock devices designed to prevent the 
car from being put accidentially into gear with a foot on the 
accelerator and 275000 automatic transmission cars were recalled 
in october 1987 for installation of the devices 
mugg said audi since then had counted only 14 sudden 
acceleration complaints and he said those were on cars with 
improperly installed interlocks 
the national highway traffic safety board is investigating 433 
complaints involving the interlockequipped audis but nhtsb 
spokesman ron defore said the complaints which still must be 
confirmed involve engine surge rather than the full acceleration 
described in earlier complaints 
we have felt that an interlock was sufficient defore said 
audis former threeyear 50000mile warranty was expanded to 
cover scheduled maintenance all dealer visits and even routine oil 
changes and parts such as wiper blades brake pads and light bulbs 
were the only one covering maintenance and wear and tear for 
50000 miles mugg said 
audis marketing also is emphasizing technological advances such 
as antilock braking systems and allwheel drive available on 100 
and 200 series audis mugg said 
while the new models show only minor exterior changes from the 
audi 5000 body shell the cars are more extensively changed beneath 
the skin with more than 1400 new parts mugg said

next year could bring a leveling off of the 
massive drain on the us wheat stockpile if the drought eases and 
farmers expand plantings as expected says the agriculture 
department 
the departments economic research service says the total wheat 
supply for the 198889 marketing year that began june 1 is about 
31 billion bushels down more than 20 percent from last season and 
the lowest in almost a decade 
more than 22 million acres of wheat land were idled under the 
usdas acreage program this year when farmers were required to set 
aside 275 percent of their base acres for 1989 they have to idle 
only 10 percent 
with increased area and average yields in 198990 the united 
states would be able to produce 25 billion bushels of wheat 
enough to cover likely use without a further stock decline the 
report said monday 
although the supply this years harvest plus excess left over 
from previous crops will be more than enough to meet expected 
use the wheat inventory by next june 1 is expected to be around 
597 million bushels down from 1266 billion bushels this june 1 
based on the current rate of wheat use for domestic consumption 
and exports the us wheat supply next june 1 would represent an 
87day supply compared with reserves for 185 days this june 1 it 
also would be the smallest since 197374 
this years wheat harvest of 182 billion bushels is far short 
of the more than 25 billion bushels needed to cover expected 
domestic and export demands in 198889 the shortfall of 684 
million bushels has to come out of reserves 
thus according to the report the beginning inventory of 1266 
billion bushels is drawn down by the shortfall to 582 million 
bushels when imports of 15 million bushels are added the 
projected us wheat stockpile next june 1 becomes 597 million 
bushels 
largely due to drought hard red spring hrs wheat production 
is forecast to decline 56 percent in 1988 to 188 million bushels 
the report said however indications are that hrs and durum crop 
quality is higher than expected and protein content is rated 
high 
drought struck hrs and durum wheat areas in the northern plains 
including the dakotas severely this year 
hard red winter hrw production in 1988 is an estimated 894 
million bushels down 12 percent from a year earlier as area and 
yields are forecast lower the report said in contrast soft 
red winter srw production is up 33 percent in 1988 as area and 
yield increased 
the report said some farmers in the srw areas do not participate 
in the governments wheat program and had stopped planting when 
prices dropped in the mid1980s however last fall prices began to 
rise and growers expanded plantings

agriculture department officials are advising 
farmers who suffered drought damage to consider enrolling highly 
erodible cropland in the longterm conservation reserve program 
the current signup period for the crp will end aug 31 more 
than 255 million acres have been enrolled in previous signups and 
the goal is to have 40 million to 45 million acres in the program 
by the end of 1990 
under the program farmers offer bids to take land from crop 
production and plant it to grass or trees for 10 years as a guard 
against erosion in return they get federal assistance to pay for 
up to half of the cost of establishing the protective cover plus 
annual rental payments for the crp land 
vern neppl acting executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp said monday that farmers may bid to enroll 
eligible land that has not been harvested in 1988 due to drought 
if their bids are accepted the producers will receive their 
first crp rental payments in 1988 neppl said also they will 
be guaranteed payments for nine more years an additional source of 
income regardless of weather condition during those years 
cropland that has been hayed in counties approved for drought 
relief is eligible for the crp if it meets program requirements 
but there may be a reduction in the 1988 payment neppl said 
producers also have the option of enrolling land for 1989 
enrollment of erodible land in the crp will help farmers meet 
the conservation provisions of the 1985 farm law neppl said those 
require producers to have an approved conservation plan for 
erodible land in place by jan 1 1990 to remain eligible for usda 
program benefits

the steepest grocery store increases in 4 
years pushed consumer prices up 04 percent in july as the effects 
of the summerlong drought reached consumers the government said 
today 
the 14 percent gain in grocery store prices was led by a 96 
percent jump in egg costs a 74 percent boost in poultry costs and 
a 47 percent gain for fresh fruits and vegetables 
julys overall gain if it persisted for 12 months would amount 
to a yearly inflation rate of 52 percent 
the department noted in todays announcement that the food price 
gains reflect rising input prices at least partially due to the 
adverse summer weather and showed that except for food price 
gains were moderate 
excluding food and energy costs consumer prices rose 03 
percent last month slightly less than the average monthly increase 
posted in the first half of 1988 
energy costs were up 03 percent largely due to a 07 percent 
increase in gasoline prices still gasoline is slightly cheaper 
than in december and 281 percent under its price peak of march 
1981 
housing costs rose at a 03 percent pace for the sixth straight 
month as declines in home heating oil and electricity costs offset 
higher charges for natural gas 
clothing prices dropped 06 percent after falling 03 percent in 
june those prices had risen 38 percent in the first five months 
of 1988 
the labor department said that larger than usual endofseason 
price reductions in womens clothing were responsible for most of 
the declines 
medical care costs jumped 07 percent to a level 66 percent 
above where they had been a year ago hospital expenses were up 10 
percent while the cost of prescription and overthecounter drugs 
gained 09 percent 
transportation expenses rose 04 percent after a 02 percent 
rise in june the higher gasoline prices were largely to blame 
new car prices were unchanged while automobile financing costs 
gained 02 percent used car prices were up 05 percent their 
second consecutive increase but were still below their level at 
the end of 1987 
tobacco prices were up 27 percent the steepest gain for any 
major segment of the monthly price compilation 
despite the food price increase meat costs overall declined 
slightly as pork prices dropped 22 percent and beef and veal 
prices rose just 01 percent as farmers trimmed herds 
cereal and bakery product prices gained 11 percent while 
cooking oil posted a 10 percent price increase 
food costs overall rose 10 percent for the month as slower 
advances of 05 percent and 04 percent respectively were posted 
for restaurant meals and alcoholic beverages 
the july increases brought the consumer price index to 1185 
meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 in 1982 
would have cost 11850 last month 50 cents more than in june and 
470 more than a year ago 
the reagan administration labor unions and major business 
groups such as the us chamber of commerce contrary to the 
federal reserve board all maintain that inflation remains under 
control and that any onemonth rise in consumer prices poses no 
problem 
the federal reserve earlier this month boosted its discount 
rate the interest it charges for overnight loans to banks from 
60 percent to 65 percent out of concerns that inflation was 
beginning to gain a toehold on the economy 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co of new york 
said a 05 percent increase in wholesale prices last month should 
be taken as a red flag of warning that the us economy is on a 
much higher inflation curve than the 4 percent to 5 percent that 
had been forecast for this year 
the behavior of wages tightness of labor markets 
increasingly tighter product markets and running out of slack 
between potential and actual output all suggest a higher range of 
inflation as an ongoing reality he said 
because of that sinai and other pessimists on the inflation 
front said the federal reserve can be expected to lean toward 
raising interest rates again after boosting them half a percentage 
point earlier this month but not necessarily before the november 
election 
other analysts however agree with the administration and 
business and labor groups that inflation remains under control 
michael evans who runs an economic forecasting firm in 
washington said most analysts were spooked by the july 
increase in wholesale prices 
in spite of what you may read in the headlines about the 
negative effects of the drought too many people working or too 
much being produced inflation expectations have returned to 
normal he said

an article of japans recently revised securities 
and exchange law broadening the ministry of finances powers to 
investigate suspicious trading took effect tuesday 
article 154 of the new law empowers the ministry to directly 
query companies listed on japans stock exchanges in its 
investigations of suspicious trading until now the ministry has 
only been able to gather information from the exchanges 
along with article 154 changes in securities law permitting 
trading of cashsettled index futures and options were put into 
effect tuesday 
reports in the japanese press speculated that article 154 was 
put into effect ahead of schedule in response to the public outcry 
over the shady dealings and possibly insider trading which came 
to light in two recent stock trading scandals 
there have been reports all over that enforcement of this part 
of the law was moved foward but these are all mistakes said a 
spokesman at the ministrys securities division 
both the ministry and the tokyo stock exchange are investigating 
unusual trading in shares of sankyo seiki manufacturing co ahead 
of the official announcement of a deal between sankyo seikei and 
nippon steel corp which sent sankyo seikei shares sharply higher 
the ministry enjoys wide discretion in the timing of enforcement 
of new securities law reports surfaced in recent weeks that the 
ministry might speed enforcement of some portions of the new 
securities law 
article 154 does not extend the ministrys reach in its 
investigations to companies whose shares are listed for 
overthecounter trading as those of recruit cosmos the center of 
attention in the other of the two recent scandals 
aides to a number of prominent politicians and public figures 
including journalists were found to have been allowed to buy 
shares of recruit cosmos before the shares were listed to trade 
over the counter the shares surged in value after the registration

consumer prices rose 04 percent in july while durable goods 
orders plunged 7 percent the biggest drop in four years the 
government said today in reports that cooled fears of inflation 
in the credit markets bond prices moved higher after the 
reports were released sending their yields lower traders bought 
bonds out of confidence that their value would not be eroded by 
surging inflation 
the rise in consumer prices was fueled by a 14 percent rise in 
prices at grocery stores the steepest onemonth rise in that 
category in 4 years according to the labor department report 
julys overall gain if it persisted for 12 months would amount 
to a yearly inflation rate of 52 percent 
the commerce department meanwhile said total orders for 
durable goods fell to a seasonally adjusted 1166 billion last 
month primarily because of a huge decline in orders for cars 
aircraft and ships and tanks 
it was the biggest decline in orders for durable goods since a 
72 percent drop in april 1984 in june orders had risen at the 
fastest pace in more than six years climbing by 87 percent 
prices of the widely followed 30year treasury bond were up 
about 6 for every 1000 in face value while their yields slipped 
to 938 percent from 945 percent late monday 
speculation about higher interest rates had weighed on the 
financial markets on monday pushing stock prices lower and bond 
prices lower 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 2578 to 
199022 on monday its first close below 2000 in nearly three 
months 
bond prices fell with the yield on the benchmark 30year 
treasury bond rising to 945 percent from 939 percent late in 
fridays session 
this is very nervous trading jack baker head of block 
trading at shearson lehman hutton inc said of mondays action 
this isnt the kind of market thats going to bring people off 
the sidelines 
the dow jones close monday was its lowest since it finished at 
195644 on may 27 the day before the threeday memorial day 
holiday when traders returned may 31 the dow climbed 7468 points 
declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of nearly 3 to 1 
among issues listed on the new york stock exchange 
the economy has been growing at such a strong pace that the 
federal reserve boosted its rate on loans to member banks by a half 
percentage point to 65 percent earlier this month in a bid to curb 
inflation 
mondays trading was characterized by indecision analysts said 
traders searching for clues to the economys direction looked ahead 
to todays report on consumer prices and thursdays revised 
estimate of secondquarter economic growth

university of houston officials were poised today 
to announce an agreement with du pont co for commercial 
development of the superconductivity discoveries of physicist paul 
chu 
university of houston officials declined to give details of the 
licensing agreement until it was announced at a press conference 
today at the university of houston 
but university of houston spokesman eric miller said the pact 
will mean several million dollars for the university in 
licensing fees for a superconducting material chus team discovered 
in 1986 he said future royalties would bring still more income to 
the school 
chu said he is pleased with the deal which reportedly could 
lead to commercial products using the material within three to five 
years 
i think its really great said chu who along with his 
research team is considered a leader in the the intense 
competition to develop a superconductor that works at or near room 
temperature 
the agreement ends more than a year of negotiations with du pont 
and other firms interested in commercializing the physicists 
discoveries 
superconductors are materials that conduct electricity without 
resistance and repel magnetic fields the working temperature of 
the new material is high enough to allow the use of cheap readily 
available liquid nitrogen as a coolant until that discovery 
superconductivity could be achieved only with liquid helium which 
is colder but more expensive 
a superconducting material that works at or near room 
temperature would hold the promise of major advances in the 
production and use of electricity more powerful magnets and 
motors more sensitive medical equipment and more powerful beams 
for smashing atoms 
university counsel scott chafin earlier this summer said faculty 
research guidelines at the time of chus discoveries called for a 
5050 split of profits between chu and the university adding that 
any agreement between chu and fellow researchers to divide profits 
is private 
chafin said the university of houston administration wanted the 
licensing agreement to go to a us company

inc executive is entitled to nearly 1 million in damages because 
he was denied stock privileges enjoyed by a fellow executive 
us district judge prentice marshall said monday that paul much 
was not dealt with honestly or fairly because he was forced by 
the company to sell back his duff amp phelps stock in 1983 when he 
quit for another job 
much had charged in his lawsuit that at the same time he was 
leaving the company the duff amp phelps board permitted another 
employee carol franchik to keep her stock after she was fired for 
having an affair with the firms chairman claire hansen 
on nov 29 1983 much sold back his 485 shares of stock in the 
privately held firm for 59910 
ms franchik however kept her stock until the company was 
sold then divested her 300 shares for a 600000 profit 
marshall said hansen allowed ms franchik to keep her stock 
because she had threatened to bring a potentially valuable gender

the united states should not be hindered 
in adopting an energy policy encouraging the use of coal because of 
concerns about the greenhouse effect and acid rain the 
president of the national coal association said 
richard lawson made his remarks while addressing a session 
monday on energy and the environment at the southern legislative 
conference a gathering of about 2000 lawmakers from 15 states and 
puerto rico 
its time to quit treating energy as just another market 
item he said youll never need air cover or a tow missile 
to get a unit train of coal to a generating station 
the lack of a national energy policy forces the united states to 
bend its foreign and military policies to protect its sources of 
imported oil making the true cost of that oil much higher than the 
market price said lawson a retired air force general 
although he has headed the coal group for just over a year 
lawson said i do know security and i do understand strategy and 
i sense the vulnerability of our country in that area is 
increasing 
estimates of domestic oil and gas reserves have declined 
recently he said while use of imported oil is greater now than in 
1973 the date of the first arab oil embargo 
lawson said the nation should reduce its use of imported oil to 
the point that a price increase or cutoff would not be catastrophic 
he said the country also should offer incentives for 
conservation and development of domestic supplies expand its use 
of coal finance more research and development of technology to 
burn coal more cleanly and develop synthetic fuels for use when 
the market makes them economically feasible 
he estimated that such a program beginning in 1990 would cost 
3 billion to 4 billion a year 
the unusually hot weather this summer and this decade has raised 
concern about the greenhouse effect in which carbon dioxide 
from burning of fossil fuels reduces the heat that is radiated into 
space 
although the issue should not be ignored lawson said few 
scientists believe the climate is already getting hotter because of 
the effect 
a lot of imaginations are going in and out of focus 
especially on capitol hill he said 
lawson said the greenhouse issue has been folded into the 
debate on acid rain which is caused when emissions from 
coalburning plants react with other chemicals and water vapor in 
the atmosphere 
congress he contended should reject a pending 
acidraincontrol bill to allow time for development of cleancoal 
technology partly because acid rain is declining even though the 
use of coal has increased

president reagan today signed landmark 
trade legislation and told an audience at this bustling west coast 
port the new law will keep america riding on a global wae of 
prosperity 
he said he was signing the bill despite misgivings over some of 
its provisions 
were here to sign a piece of legislation that will help our 
economy continue to grow and compete reagan said in remarks 
prepared for a signing ceremony at the port of long beach one of 
the worlds 10 busiest computerized cargo ports 
port officials say 606 million metric tons of cargo crossed 
long beach piers last year the most ever recorded at a west coast 
port 
the legislation authorizes us participation in current world 
trade talks streamlines procedures for retaliatory import curbs 
against unfair trade practices and makes many other changes in 
trade laws 
our administration and congress have come together in an 
effort to ensure open markets around the world reagan said it 
hasnt been easy but i have never doubted our ultimate victory 
because were riding a global wave 
country after country is recognizing that free trade is the 
key to a more prosperous future and that protectionism protects no 
one not even the special interests that want it so much 
reagan who had objected to what he said were protectionist 
features in earlier versions of the legislation said there are 
still some things in this bill i dont like 
he said the law could lead to an import fee that would be 
illegal under international law and inconsistent with our goal of 
moving toward free world trade 
he said the bill also appears to require exeutive branch 
officers to negotiate with foreign countries on specified trade 
topics which he argued is inconsistent with our constitutional 
principles 
he also objected that the bill purports to require the 
international trade commission to conduct investigations in 
response to a resolution passed by just one house or senate 
committee 
and so in signing this bill i am specifically noting that it 
will be implemented in a constitutional manner the president 
said 
the signing climaxes months of negotiation between the 
administration and congress over the bill which reagan vetoed when 
it was first sent to him because it contained a provision requiring 
a 60day notice to employees of plant closings and layoffs 
congress however promptly passed the advancenotice provision 
as a separate bill and reagan trying to minimize its importance 
as a democratic electionyear issue then let it become law 
without his signature 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas and his partys vice presidential 
candidate said over the weekend that the administration had 
resisted the plan every inch of the way 
bentsen the texas senator who was the bills prime sponsor 
said in a radio speech that this administration has been a 
reluctant partner they have clung stubbornly to the status quo 
ignored the mounting deficits and resisted a trade policy every 
inch of the way 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater asked whether bentsens 
key role on the bill put the president in an awkward position 
replied bentsen did a good job on this he worked on it a lot of 
years and so did we and everybody who worked on it gets credit 
the bill authorizes us negotiators to reach agreements in 
international trade talks streamlines the system of import curbs 
to protect american business and provides for retraining of those 
left jobless by foreign competition it also contains a potential 
25 billion in export subsidies for agricultural products and 
repeals the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil industry earnings 
which has not produced any revenue since oil prices plunged three 
years ago 
another provision allows the united states to retaliate against 
countries that do not abide by international agreements on workers 
rights aflcio president lane kirkland said monday he would ask 
the administration to invoke this provision against poland where 
the government ordered troops to secure major industrial plants and 
clamped curfews on three provinces hit by strikes in favor of the 
outlawed union movement solidarity 
from long beach the president was going to irvine to speak to a 
crowd expected to number 800 to 900 at a 500aplate fundraising 
luncheon for sen pete wilson rcalif 
while in los angeles the president plans to have private 
dinners with old friends and see his eye doctor and ear nose and 
throat specialist as he does annually during his latesummer 
california vacation 
first lady nancy reagans press secretary elaine crispen said 
mrs reagan would pay a call on decorators at the home in the bel 
air section of los angeles where the reagans plan to live after he 
leaves office jan 20

farm machinerymaker deere amp co more than 
tripled its earnings and increased sales 16 percent in the third 
quarter of 1988 despite the drought gripping much of the farm 
belt the company reported today 
deere based in moline reported net earnings of 81 million or 
114 per share up from 255 million or 38 cents per share for 
the threemonth period ending july 31 
sales for the quarter were 139 billion vs yearearlier sales 
of 119 billion for the period 
our increased profitability is due primarily to higher sales 
and production volumes some improvement in price realization and 
greater efficiencies in our worldwide operations deere chairman 
robert a hanson said in a news release 
however higher prices for some raw materials are partially 
offsetting these improvements 
hanson said it was hard to predict the impact of the drought on 
deeres earnings performance although crop yields are down the 
prices for farm products has risen and commodity reserves are 
dropping 
retail sales of our agricultural and lawnandgroundscare 
equipment were lower in the latter part of the quarter he said 
we believe continuing dry weather could affect retail demand in 
some areas during the remainder of the year 
deeres earnings for the first nine months of its fiscal year 
totaled 2349 million or 325 a share vs a net loss of 1317 
million during the same period of 1987 a strikemarred year sales

bob kemp remembers when he was a novice 
businessman and needed a loan he listed chicken licken goosy 
loosy and ducky lucky as collateral 
he got the money after explaining that the animals were the 
parade balloons on which he planned to build his company kemp 
balloons inc 
i told them thats what makes the money for me said kemp 
it was survival at that point wed only been in business a 
couple of years 
the turning point was president carters inauguration which was 
12 days away when the call came asking for a giant inflatable 
peanut 
we said if the peanuts there pay us if not forget it 
we made it in 12 days kemp said 
that accomplishment and the ensuing publicity launched the 
companys reputation as a premier builder of parade balloons 
kemps cast of more than 50 characters includes popeye the sailor 
man and his wife olive oyl the pillsbury dough boy poppin fresh 
woody woodpecker and felix the cat 
his colorful creations meander parade routes across the country 
and around the world including the tournament of roses parade the 
orange bowl the indianapolis 500 and other major festivals 
its fun its like being on the fringe of show business 
said the affable kemp 57 
on the paintsplattered floor of kemps suburban baltimore 
warehouse humpty dumpty sits in a corner with a perpetual grin on 
his massive face and popeyes head occupies much of the opposite 
side of the room various pieces of other characters wait for a 
fresh coat of paint or a call from a promoter who wants to hire a 
balloon 
weve done a lot of exciting things said kemp 
don lunday the executive director of the international 
festivals association in pasadena calif an organization of 
festival promoters and suppliers says kemp balloons is one of the 
oldest and largest balloon makers 
theres a quality about bobs but the fact remains he is 
expensive you can rent cheaper inflatables but the odds are they 
are not going to do what bobs do lunday said 
kemps balloons rent from 500 to 11000 depending on the 
character and the season prices go higher during holiday periods 
there are other balloon makers but i havent come across 
anyone who has the balloons bob has and the quality he has said 
jo hauck executive director of the indianapolis 500 festival 
associates inc a civic organization that stages festivities 
leading up to the big auto race 
his felix the cat has one arm that waves to everybody the 
kids just go wild said hauck 
kemp built his first balloons in 1973 for gimbels thanksgiving 
parade in philadelphia and made many of the balloons used in macys 
legendary parades 
this year kemp expects sales to top 1 million a long way for 
a man who says he learned how to starve while employed as a social 
worker hes also taught ballroom dancing sold cars promoted wine 
in california and was director of tourism for the city of baltimore 
kemp employs about 10 fulltime workers and as many as 30 during 
a busy period his son bobby is the chief designer once the 
design is created a pattern is traced on long sheets of black 
rubber the pieces are cut and sewn together then inflated and 
painted 
when his balloons leave the warehouse any number of things can 
happen popeye for instance was mistakenly taken off a plane in 
paris en route to a childrens passover festival in israel 
the balloon mysteriously arrived just in time for the festival 
but on the way home it was seized briefly by israeli customs 
agents who questioned how it had entered the country 
here at home its not uncommon to see adults try to poke 
poppin fresh in the stomach to make him giggle like the character 
does in television commercials since they cant reach that high 
spectators tickle his toes instead kemp says 
kemp refers to the dough boy as the little guy despite his 
height of 55 feet 
kemps worst moment as a balloon man came during the winter 
olympics in calgary where he staged his most ambitious project an 
inflatable canadian rockies that was 110 feet long 55 feet wide 
and 67 feet tall plans called for 25000 smaller balloons to be 
released from inside the mountains as two huge dinosaur balloons 
cavorted in front of the spectators 
high winds forced kemp to abort the project only a few moments 
after the mountains were inflated 
they were asking me bob is this mountain going to work we 
were calling the weather service every five minutes it was my 
decision he said the wind had died down we had 300 people to 
hold it down we had people with knives to deflate it if 
necessary we were prepared to immediately kill our balloon 
the place went crazy when it went up the wind hit and moved 
it about 10 feet thats when we murdered the mountains after we 
killed the mountain they stood up and applauded and went crazy it 
was an emotional moment for everybody 
his next goal is the franchising of his business which he hopes 
will bring in enough money for his final project balloon world a 
home for retired balloons 
it would be a place where people can stop in and see a part of 
history kemp said these are things they grew up with and saw 
on tv theyd be retired there it would have to be gigantic 
people could walk around and touch a 65foot popeye on the nose

singing cheering haitians gathered at a community 
center tuesday to celebrate a judges ruling on work permits that 
could eventually help 400000 foreignborn farm workers nationwide 
but federal immigration officials fretted that the decision to 
relax permit requirements puts a heavy burden on their bureaucracy 
and may foster more fraud in the program 
mondays ruling by senior us district judge c clyde atkins 
ordered the immigration and naturalization service to rehear the 
cases of 14000 farm workers most of them haitians and mexicans 
who had been turned down for agricultural work permits in florida 
georgia and alabama 
the judge found the ins was demanding excessive documentary 
proof that the workers met legal requirements and granted 
temporary permits to most of those denied until their new hearings 
without the permits they faced expulsion 
it has major national significance because the court has ruled 
there is a constitutional right to file for farm worker status 
said ira kurzban the attorney for the haitian refugee center 
which supported the suit it will affect over 400000 farm 
workers around the nation 
while the decision applied only to three states it can be used 
as a precedent in similar suits elsewhere he noted 
kurzban spoke after a rally at the refugee center in little 
haiti where 150 elated haitians waved signs listened to speeches 
celebrated and sang in creole 
atkins ruling said kurzban effectively shifts the burden of 
proof away from the farm worker as congress intended and makes 
the ins prove an applicant is not eligible 
the key issue was the requirement that farm workers prove they 
toiled at least 90 days in the united states before a 1985 cutoff 
date the ins has recently demanded pay stubs and other documents 
refusing to accept affidavits alone 
now kurzban said the ins must accept affidavits unless it can 
prove they are false the affidavits are necessary because many 
workers were illegal at the time and were paid under the table 
kurzban said 
the justice department is deciding whether to appeal atkins 
ruling said florida ins director perry rivkind who complained the 
order to rehear rejected cases puts an impossible burden on his 
agency 
it will cost tremendous sums of money and will required added 
man and womanpower to be brought in here to do it rivkind said 
moreover rivkind said the ins has already been granting 
permits to 85 percent of the applicants and was rejecting only 
those it genuinely felt were not eligible the new ruling makes it 
harder to reject false applications he said 
commmon sense would tell you it would attract fraud said 
rivkind people who just entered the united states come in and 
tell us they worked here in 1985

in 1794 norman smith had a thriving 
saddlery business not far from the open fields and untouched 
woodlands of new england 
today the smith worthington saddlery co the oldest 
continuously running saddlery company in the nation operates a 
stones throw from the dilapidated buildings of hartfords largely 
poor and gritty north end 
but while its surroundings have changed dramatically smith 
worthington does in many ways preserve the ways of the past 
still producing custommade englishstyle saddles by hand 
smith worthington is a famous firm and still much respected 
said james hutchins a historian at the natural museum of american 
history in washington dc 
hutchins is compiling two 19thcentury smith worthington 
catalogs into a book anyone who knows about saddlery knows about 
smith worthington he said 
in its heyday during the 1800s the firm had approximately 1200 
employees filled several hartford buildings and had branches in 
new orleans and new york 
the staff has been whittled down over the years to seven 
including three saddle makers and the business operates out of an 
airy warehouse stacked with cardboard boxes full of the 
paraphernalia of the horse world 
it specialized in 1794 in sidesaddles for women saddles 
calculated for both ease and beauty according to an 
advertisement 
but with the advent of the automobile and mass production of 
saddles the company evolved into a specialized supplier of 
englishstyle saddles and leather harnesses 
in addition smith worthington imports and distributes saddles 
it makes in walsall england 
the company was managed for 134 years by direct descendants of 
founder norman smith it passed in 1928 to a manager of the new 
york city branch of the business john allen roberts 
the firms name was so well established by the time roberts took 
over that it was a natural decision not to change it said curtis 
c hanks 42 the present owner in a recent interview 
among the companys former clients are victor borge and the shah 
of iran who made a special visit to hartford in 1958 with four 
members of the royal entourage to be fitted for saddles bridles 
and other equestrian equipment said curtis hanks father clinton 
hanks 72 who sold the firm to his son 
the younger hanks one of the companys three remaining saddle 
makers is a taciturn man who quickly becomes animated when he 
talks about his craft 
you put part of yourself in every saddle said curtis hanks 
a west hartford resident 
each saddle is individually measured to fit both horse and 
rider he said because horses like humans come in all shapes and 
sizes 
it used to be that most people were riding a morgan an 
arabian or a thoroughbred and you could pretty much say ive got 
a morgan therefore i need a morgan fit for it curtis hanks 
said 
but now crossbred horses are widespread and it is difficult to 
estimate animals proportions he said 
smith worthington today supplies saddles for several bigcity 
police forces including boston new york and hartford as well as 
jumping saddles used in international horse shows 
sgt donald tadiello supervisor of the hartford police 
equestrian unit said the 12horse unit uses 10 smith worthington 
custom saddles 
the saddles suit the special requirements of the police force 
tadiello said they are designed to be comfortable for both horse 
and rider over extended periods of time and have extra fittings 
such as brass rings for saddle bags ropes and night sticks 
smith worthington saddles sell for 1000 to 1300 each the 
prices reflect the materials used in the saddles and the 
laborintensive nature of the business curtis hanks said 
it takes a week to make one saddle in a process that hardly uses 
machines at all many of the materials are imported too and take 
time to obtain he said 
moreover the companys competitors are few curtis hanks said 
whitman saddle manufacturing in kalamazoo mich is the only other 
english saddle maker in the us he said 
although smith worthington mainly produces horse tackle it also 
makes harnesses and other leather products to order hanks said 
the company for instance has made harnesses for sled dog teams 
and for circus animals 
smith worthington also makes leather sandbags used by pratt amp 
whitney jetengine makers as molds for shaping metal curtis hanks 
said

the inability of finding easy ways to gloss over 
the danger of federal budget deficits leaves the white house 
congress and private sector advisory groups with no alternative but 
to bite the bullet 
biting the bullet is an appropriate term in this context 
because it suggests the pain that soldiers endured when in the 
absence of options a limb was surgically detached from their body 
without comfort of anesthesia 
there is no easy way out of the budget mess evidence of the 
dilemma is seen in deficitreducing ideas suggested included are a 
lowering or elimination of the home mortgage deduction and a tax 
on social security 
congress already has been asked to consider reductions in the 
mortgage interest deduction and if you talk to certain real estate 
and housing people youll find them arming themselves against 
attempts next year at elimination 
to even consider such a drastic move against what is considered 
a sacred right shows how painful and how extreme the matter is to 
homeowners removal of their tax deductions is not just an affront 
but an assault on a symbol 
perhaps even holier is the special tax treatment of social 
security beneficiaries but that too is under attack a research 
paper from the tax foundation for example suggests taxing 85 
percent of benefits received 
should that occur it would indeed demonstrate the painful 
twists and turns involved in seeking tax dollars 
in this instance a wageearner is taxed and the money sent to 
washington it is then reallocated to a former wageearner or other 
recipient there it would be taxed again and resent to washington 
to pay for various federal burdens perhaps to be resent later to 
the nowretired wageearner 
this latest proposal to tax social security benefits comes from 
the tax foundations shadow budget committee a group of 
private citizens with experience in finance and public policy 
the thrust of their proposal is that a substantial and permanent 
reduction in the budget deficit is not just a goal but an 
imperative and that the time for action is immediately their 
proposals illustrate how painful that will be 
urging a 100 billion cut from the unified budget deficit by 
1993 they begin by recommending 25 billion in defense spending 
cutbacks a suggestion that can set off an immediate storm from the 
defensefirst advocates 
some 20 billion would be cut from nondefense subsidies 18 
billion from social security and 10 billion from restraints in 
expenditures for entitlements total of cuts 73 billion 
the 100 billion goal would be exceeded by imposing a 
broadbased tax on energy consumption and adding in 10 billion in 
user fees or charges for the user of various federal services 
such as the coast guard 
what proposals such as this suggest is that after two decades of 
spending beyond their means americans must face reality cut back 
spending to the limits of national income and simultaenously pay 
off debts 
while all this is still in the discussion stage the message is 
likely to be interpreted by millions of americans as something 
worse than unbearable pain rather than biting the bullet that is 
they may feel shot by it

appeals filed in the days before ah 
robins cos bankruptcy reorganization was to take effect will 
delay payments to many dalkon shield claimants an attorney said 
tuesday 
three appeals to the plan had been filed as of tuesday on behalf 
of several hundred dalkon shield claimants the deadline for 
appealing is thursday one month after us district judge robert 
r merhige jr entered an order confirming the plan which includes 
a 25 billion trust fund for women claiming injuries from the 
dalkon shield birth control device robins sold 
the reorganization plan under which robins is acquired by 
american home products of new york cannot take effect until the 
appeals process has been exhausted however payments to some 
claimants from a 100 million cash fund set up by robins are 
scheduled to begin despite the appeals there are about 195000 
outstanding dalkon shieldrelated claims against the company 
we appealed because we thought the judge was wrong and because 
we thought our clients didnt get what theyre entitled to said 
alan b morrison an attorney for the public citizen litigation 
group in washington dc morrison said he will be the lead counsel 
for all the groups appealing 
morrison said his main points of appeal would be that the women 
were not given all the facts about how their claims would be paid 
when they voted on the reorganization plan and that their votes 
were not weighted in accordance with the size of their claims 
about 95 percent of the dalkon shield claimants voted in favor 
of the reorganization plan according to ballots tallied last month 
by robins morrison said the women were told they would be paid 
in full and the vote would have been different if they had a 
better idea of what kind of payments they would receive 
the appeals are illadvised misguided and against the 
interests of the vast majority of claimants said guerry 
thornton an attorney for the atlantabased dalkon shield victims 
assocation which supported the plan the 95 percent vote in favor 
of the plan by itself takes away almost every objection he 
said weve got the maximum amount that we can get as quickly as 
we can get it 
thornton said implementation of the plan may be delayed by as 
much as two years during appeals to the 4th circuit court of 
appeals and the us supreme court and suggested that interest 
lost on the trust fund during that time might amount to as much as 
200 million 
but morrison called those figues totally speculative and said 
it would take some time for the trustees to begin making payments 
even if the plan were not appealed i dont think theres going 
to be any significant delay he said 
thornton said the appellants claims had already been heard and 
rejected by the court and said some attorneys were considering 
asking for penalties against the appealing lawyers for filing 
groundless appeals 
a fourth appeal has been filed against a settlement approved by 
merhige of a class action suit filed against aetna casualty amp 
surety co which insured robins 
robins sought bankruptcy protection three years ago after 
paying about 530 million to settle 9500 lawsuits stemming from 
its sale of the iud in the early 1970s

a majority of the chief executive officers of 
the nations largest corporations believe george bush would raise 
taxes if elected president according to a survey released tuesday 
by fortune magazine 
the survey which will appear in fortunes sept 12 issue was 
taken just before the republican party convention began last week 
it polled 215 chief executive officers from the biggest us 
industrial and service companies 
bush has made his pledge not to raise taxes a central element of 
the campaign 
in the survey however 65 percent of the ceos canvassed said 
they believe bush would raise taxes while only 31 percent believe 
he would not 
ninetyeight percent of the chief executives polled believe 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis would raise taxes 
if elected 
many of the ceos believe bush would be less likely than dukakis 
to raise taxes on companies and affluent individuals and they 
suggest the republican candidate could opt for consumption taxes 
instead 
eightysix percent of the ceos said they will vote for bush in 
the november election compared with 7 percent who plan to vote for 
dukakis 
but the respondents said they werent as confident as they were 
in january that the republicans would retain the white house fifty 
percent now expect bush to win compared with 90 percent in 
january while 33 percent anticipate a dukakis victory 
dukakiss alliances with jesse jackson to his left and sen 
lloyd bentsen to his right are among the main reasons the 
executives believe a republican victory is now less certain the 
survey showed

the university of houston and du pont co on 
tuesday signed what officials said was a firstofitskind 
agreement under which the company will license and commercialize 
superconducting products and processes based on discoveries of 
school researcher paul chu 
the university receives an initial payment of 15 million under 
the agreement in addition du pont will pay the school 15 
million upon issuance to the university of a us patent covering 
the superconducting material developed by chu considered a world 
leader in the field and another 15 million two years after that 
patent is issued 
richard l van horn university president said the agreement 
could be worth millions more to the school because of royalties 
amounting to 50 percent on products of commercial interest to du 
pont and 75 percent on products not of commercial interest 
its very hard to estimate van horn said it could be in 
the area of 4 million or it could be the skys the limit it could 
be 10 million or 20 million or more it certainly will be in the 
millions of dollars 
the money will go for further research at the university he 
said 
superconductors are materials that conduct electricity without 
resistance and repel magnetic fields their use had been limited by 
the need to cool them with liquid helium to minus 450 degrees 
fahrenheit but chu and his research team who he referred to as 
unknown heroes found a new superconductor that works at higher 
temperatures 
the temperature of the new material is high enough to allow the 
use of cheap readily available liquid nitrogen as a coolant until 
that discovery superconductivity could be achieved only with the 
much scarcer liquid helium 
a superconducting material that works at room temperature holds 
the promise of major advances in the production and use of 
electricity more powerful magnets and motors more sensitive 
medical equipment and more powerful beams for smashing atoms 
constantine s nicandros executive vice president of du pont 
and president of conoco inc a du pont subsidiary said the 
30page agreement was better than a solid prospect on an oil well 
we regard paul chu and the university of houston as much more 
of a blue chip investment than a gamble nicandros said 
chu who under the standard university agreement stands to 
personally gain half of the profits the school receives from 
patents said du ponts presence would enable the benefits of 
discoveries in his laboratory to get more quickly into commercial 
development 
officials of du pont and the university of houston said it was 
difficult to estimate when products may become commercially 
available or what those products might be

tuesday after a listless session distinguished chiefly by one of 
the lowest trading volumes of the year 
the first of some widelyanticipated economic reports due for

pressure 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which fell 2578 points 
on monday to reach it lowest level in nearly three months gave up 
another 089 to close at 198933 that is its lowest close since

about 6 for every 1000 in face value as its yield fell to 938

follow the bond market higher the stock market demonstrated it 
is nervous over too much growth and has been surprised for 
several months now as to how strong things are

jaguar plc the british luxury car maker plans to 
eliminate about 1200 jobs over the next three years in a bid to 
increase efficiency the company said tuesday 
the move is part of jaguars efforts to match the efficiency 
levels of west german competitors bayerische motorenwerke ag 
maker of bmw cars and daimlerbenz ag maker of mercedes cars a 
company official said 
jaguar said the reduction in its manuallabor workforce from 
12500 workers to around 11300 will be achieved by attrition 
rather than layoffs 
through natural wastage we lose around 400 workers a year 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to reach 
our workforce target we simply wont replace those who leave 
the official said jaguars west german competitors produce about 
six cars for each worker annually compared with just over four 
cars a worker at jaguar 
by slimming our workforce and by continuing to invest in 
advanced manufacturing processes we intend to catch up he said 
a spokesman for the transport and general workers union which 
represents most jaguar workers said unions had been involved in 
negotiations over the manpower reduction proposals and were glad 
that there wouldnt be redundancies 
as part of a twoyear pay package negotiated last year with 
hourly workers jaguar intends to speed up production at its plants 
workers at its big coventry assembly plant in the english 
midlands first resisted the new productivity levels as unrealistic 
but later accepted the targets 
jaguars new production target is 54000 cars in 1988 compared 
with 48020 cars in 1987

years

unemployment since the summer of 1986 and from a new employment 
training program which was designed to equip people with the skills 
necessary to fill britains 700000 vacant jobs 
britain had an unemployment rate of 82 percent in july or 231

tuesday accusing groups led by the rales brothers with violating 
securities laws in their 27 billion bid for the retailing concern 
the suit filed against cardinal acquisition corp and city 
capital associates lp claims their outstanding 70ashare 
tender offer involves so much debt and so little equity that it 
would if consummated violate sec margin regulations 
the suit also alleges that the defendants failed to disclose 
that the takeover bid was being made on behalf of among others

they first offered to acquire the company for 64 a share last 
month the group is led by steven and mitchell rales of washington 
dc

the ultrix operating system 
digital the no 2 computer maker behind international business 
machines corp also announced new software for hooking computers

the new version of ultrix called ultrix32 version 3 ranges in 
price from 2100 to 56000 
digital until last year had been reluctant to give wholehearted 
support to ultrix preferring that customers use its own vms 
software which only works on digital computers 
what digital is recognizing is that they will have to meet the 
user demand for open systems and they are prepared to put money and 
organizational commitment behind that said nina lytton an 
analyst with the yankee group

include operating systems and in december appointed two vice 
presidents responsible for ultrix marking a major change in

president raul alfonsin said 
tuesday that unconventional ways must be found for latin 
american countries to repay their massive foreign debts and he 
suggested one way would be to freeze interest rates 
beginning next year we people of latin america will begin to 
find unconventional solutions to resolve the problem of foreign 
debt alfonsin said in an opening address to the 12th annual 
assembly of the latin american parliament 
these unconventional solutions cannot occur without a 
freezing of interest rates and cannot take second place to the 
march of the economies of the developed countries he said 
argentina brazil and mexico are the three developing countries 
with the highest foreign debt argentina recheduled last year most 
of its 56 billion debt but still has a hard time repaying 
interest that this year will total about 46 billion 
neighboring uruguays 53 billion debt divided theoretically 
among its 3 million citizens is one of the highest per capita in 
the world 
argentina currently is negotiating with the international 
monetary fund for a 12 billion standby loan after which it plans 
to seek new loans from commercial banks to help meet its interest 
payments 
the loans made mainly after the oil price increases of the 
1970s are tied to interest rates like the us prime lending rate 
and the london interbank offered rate or libor 
earlier this month the us prime rate rose by half a 
percentage point to 10 percent as interest rates rise so do 
repayment costs on the approximately 1 trillion owed by third 
world countries to foreign creditors 
you cant keep looking distractedly at the situation of latin 
america whose economies are devastated as if there had been a 
war said alfonsin who has never called for a debt moratorium 
but has urged creditor nations to lower interest rates 
the latin american parliament comprised of legislators from 
member countries and having no legislative power of its own was to 
take up the issue of drug trafficking and the political situation 
in central america as well as the foreign debt question before 
concluding on saturday

tugboat companies emerged from federal bankruptcy protection 
tuesday when family ownership was transferred to employees 
unimar international inc formerly wfi industries began 
operations with its 400 employees holding 73 percent of the

barge and shipbuilding contractors with major customers including 
the us department of defense the navy and the coast guard 
the company once was one of the states largest employers before

jobs and file for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of 
federal bankruptcy laws two years ago 
this is a bittersweet time for the woeck family liddle said 
of the unionled buyout but theyre not doing what most owners 
do theyre not just trashing the operation 
former owner richard woeck will serve as chief operating officer 
of the subsidiary united tug and barge and his son michael woeck 
will serve as chief operating officer of united marine tug and 
barge unimars other subsidiary 
john kissick managing director of drexel burnhams west coast

effort we have a model for troubled companies around the 
country kissick said

the international monetary fund approved a 
14 billion loan to brazil on tuesday to go along with proposed 
new lending of 52 billion from commercial banks an imf spokesman 
said 
the fund will disburse the new loan by installments through feb 
28 1990 so that the money can be cut off in case the fund decides 
that brazils economy has not performed as promised 
brazil reportedly has promised to cut government spending by 22 
percent as an economic austerity condition such as those often 
required by the imf 
the new loans will amount to less than the interest payments on 
brazils existing debt of 121 billion the largest in the third 
world last year brazil suspended interest payments on what it 
owed to banks but has begun them again this year 
finance minister mailson da nobrega said in july that the 
suspension has not been formally revoked but might be once the 
nations 700 creditor banks joined in the new bank loan agreement 
he announced last week in new york that 95 percent of the total had 
been committed 
in addition to its mounting debts the government of president 
jose sarney has been struggling with inflation which reached a 
record 2404 percent in july one report has suggested that the 
rate will reach 927 percent for the year well above the level of 
600 percent said to be the basis for the agreement between the 
government the imf and the banks 
the imf spokesman who insisted on anonymity did not say how 
soon the new loan would have to be repaid brazil will have 20 
years to pay back the 52 billion from the banks including an 
eightyear grace period during which only interest will be due 
on july 30 brazil agreed in paris with 13 creditor governments 
to delay repayment of 5 billion of its 15 billion debt to them 
the rescheduled debts which fall due between jan 1 1987 and 
march 31 1990 were delayed for 10 years with a fiveyear grace 
period 
brazil has not been making payments on principal of its bank 
debt either

more than 39000 consumers who own 
chrysler motors corp cars that were testdriven with disconnected 
odometers will receive at least 500 in restitution under a 
nationwide settlement detailed tuesday 
missouri attorney general william webster who served as the 
lead negotiator in the 16 millionplus settlement with the 
automaker earlier this year briefed reporters on the details at a 
news conference 
he said attorneys general from nine other states assisted in the 
settlement proceeding filed aug 19 in us district court in st 
louis 
the action was taken on behalf of consumers in 46 states and 
guam and puerto rico the states that did not participate in the 
settlement are georgia kentucky nevada and south carolina 
webster said 
chrysler agreed last year to pay about 16 million to settle the 
matter but approval of a settlement was delayed by lawsuits filed 
against it by consumers and authorities around the country 
chrysler pleaded no contest last year to federal charges of 
odometer tampering chrysler stopped disconnecting odometers in 
october 1986 after learning of the government investigation 
webster said his office as well as officials in certain other 
states were mailing letters to consumers who own cars test driven 
in the companys overnight evaluation program 
in the program which took place for years new cars were driven 
by company executives as part of the testing process before the 
vehicles were shipped to dealers odometers on those cars were 
disconnected while the executives drove them leading buyers to 
believe they had bought new cars 
the letters tell consumers what steps they must take to 
determine if they are eligible for a minimum of 500 in restitution 
from the company and outlines procedures they must follow 
chrysler also will run advertisements in the countrys 20 
largest newspapers on friday about the settlement webster said 
the settlement affects consumers who purchased a car made by 
chrysler before oct 9 1986 consumers must have owned that car on 
july 31 1987 to participate in the settlement 
only consumers who purchased cars test driven with a 
disconnected odometer in the companys overnight evaluation program 
will be affected webster said 
us district court judge john f nangle will hold a fairness 
hearing regarding the settlement oct 11 in st louis webster said 
consumers who have objections about the settlement must file 
complaints with the court by sept 30 
after the hearing consumers will have 90 days to submit to the 
federal court a proof of claim and release form regarding the 
settlemnt consumers who do not file such a claim forfeit all 
rights to participate in chryslers settlement the attorney 
general said 
chrysler has announced it would increase warranty coverage for 
cars on which odometers had been disconnected a handful of the 
cars were involved in accidents and consumers that purchased those 
cars will receive new automobiles webster said 
webster said mileage on affected cars probably ranged from 40 
miles to 200 or 300 miles 
when you put it in that context and consumers are getting 1 
to 10 for every mile driven plus a brand new warranty we think 
its a good settlement webster said 
webster said chrysler will be forced to pay at least 16 million 
in restitution regardless of how many of the 39500 consumers take 
part in the program so if only half of the consumers file claims 
they would receive 1000 webster said

natural disasters and rising grain farming costs 
have made it almost certain china will not achieve its 1988 grain 
production goals an official daily said wednesday 
the china daily quoting officials from the national research 
center for development of science and technology said 28 million 
acres of farmland in 18 provinces about 10 percent of chinas 
total have been hit by a severe drought 
another 173 million acres have been inundated by floods with 
25 million acres seriously damaged 
the report said summer grain output will fall short of the quota 
and a bumper autumn crop considered unlikely because of the 
natural disasters would be needed to reach the target of 410 
million tons 
most agriculture experts now say this years production probably 
will fall slightly short of the 402 million ton figure of 1987 
reports of a real disaster are certainly premature said one 
western diplomat who follows chinas agricultural situation the 
most likely projection is that the grain crop will be down a little 
bit from last year 
the china daily report said that only about 2584 million acres 
in autumn grains is being planted down 21 million acres from last 
year 
the report said government pricing policies also continue 
driving farmers away from grain and into vegetables and other cash 
crops that command higher prices on the free markets 
costs of such items as chemical fertilizer plastic sheeting 
pesticides and farm machinery have shot up in recent years 
governmentset prices for grain while somewhat higher have failed 
to keep pace with production costs 
the daily said prices of fertilizer and other items rose 13 
percent in the first five months of the year 
poor financial returns from growing grain have been a major 
reason for a threeyear slump in production after reaching a 
record 407 million tons in 1984 output fell to 379 million tons in 
1985 then edged back up to 391 million tons in 1986 and 402 
million tons last year 
premier li peng has said china must increase output to 500 
million tons by the year 2000 merely to keep up with population 
growth
