the governing party on thursday forced the 1989 
budget through a parliamentary committee paving the way for prime 
minister noboru takeshita to resign in a farreaching political 
scandal 
takeshita pledged tuesday to resign after parliament passes the 
budget to take responsibility for the scandal which involves 
influencepeddling and questionable stock dealings among senior 
government officials 
the liberal democratic party was expected to ram the budget 
through parliament later thursday the opposition is boycotting the 
session demanding new elections and that former premier yasuhiro 
nakasone be summoned to the assembly to testify about his role in 
the scandal 
the budget committee of the house of representatives japans 
powerful lower house took about two minutes to approve the budget 
there still was no clear successor to takeshita since many 
senior party leaders are linked to the scandal former foreign 
minister masayoshi ito 75 widely viewed as the top candidate for 
interim premier because he is untouched by the scandal expressed 
reluctance again thursday due to poor health 
on wednesday takeshita met with shintaro abe secretary general 
of the governing party and the two agreed to decide on a successor 
after japans april 29may 6 golden week holidays 
the normally unflappable prime minister appeared shaken 
following the suicide wednesday of ihei aoki 58 an aide since 
1958 and the man who handled takeshitas scandaltainted political 
donations 
i strongly regret his action takeshita told reporters 
we walked side by side for over 30 years 
aoki who had served takeshita since 1958 was found dead 
wednesday in his tokyo apartment police said he had slashed a 
wrist and an ankle with a razor and hanged himself after leaving 
notes to his wife and several other people including takeshita 
police declined to reveal the notes contents 
takeshita said he had not seen aokis note but thought it was 
possible the suicide was linked to the stockprofiteering and 
bribery scandal 
aokis name not takeshitas appeared on loans and share 
dealings with the recruit co that are under suspicion both for 
political ethics and bribery the company an information services 
conglomerate is accused of trying to buy influence with 
politicians bureaucrats business leaders and media executives 
author yotaro konaka a government critic said mr aoki had 
used all his might to protect prime minister takeshita by putting 
all blame on himself and he probably made his choice to die 
after losing the object to protect when the prime minister 
resigned 
tetsuro muroboshi who has written books on a number of 
corruption scandals said he could not the motive was 
responsibility for takeshitas fall 
i suspect mr aoki was cornered by something something he 
could escape from only by ending his own life muroboshi said 
takeshita announced his resignation plan after disclosures over 
the weekend that aoki had accepted a 384000 loan from recruit 
takeshita told parliament on april 11 that he had received more 
than 1 million in political donations from recruit but he did not 
mention the loan he told reporters later he had not known about it 
aokis name also was on opposition parties list of 154 
influential people who earned handsome profits after buying 
bargainprice stock in a recruit subsidiary before it was offered 
for public sale takeshita denied personal involvement in the stock 
deal 
prosecutors had questioned aoki several times fourteen 
bureaucrats and businessmen but no politicians have been 
arrested on bribery and securities law violation charges in the 
case 
the wide swath of recruits donations loans and share 
transactions cut through the political leadership have made it 
difficult for the liberal democrats to find a replacement for 
takeshita 
itos age and health he is a diabetic make most observers 
consider him an interim choice who would serve for a few months 
while the party chooses a longerterm leader the head of the 
liberal democrats becomes prime minster because of the partys big 
majority in parliament 
when the time is right he will announce his acceptance 
keichiro nakamura a aide to former prime minister miki told the 
associated press 
nakamura called itos acsencion certain and said his clean 
reputation will boost the liberal democrats ailing image 
hideo sato dean of the university of tsukubas college of 
international relations agreed 
i think we need exactly that kind of person sato said he 
is apparently not involved in big moneymaking connections with 
business and lives in a modest home 
ito served as acting prime minister briefly after prime minister 
masayoshi ohira died in june 1980

attorney general richard richard thornburgh on 
wednesday night praised a growing emphasis on international 
cooperation in the war on drugs and promised multinational 
operations against drug traffickers 
thornburgh spoke at the 20member international drug enforcement 
conference which president bush is to adress thursday morning as 
part of twoday visit to florida 
thornburgh spoke to reporters before his address to a closed 
session of the conference 
drug trafficking operations cross many national boundries and 
are beyond the reach of any one nation he said 
the attorney general added that during his trip to latin america 
last month he made plans for more combined efforts against drugs 
thornburgh praised the united nations drug convention adopted 
last december in vienna and called for its early ratification by 
the senate 
the multilateral agreement by more than 100 drugproducing and 
consuming nations is an effort to establish a set of 
internationally recognized drug trafficking offenses as guidelines 
for domestic law in each country 
in his speech released before the closed session thornburgh 
praised the arrest earlier this month of manuel felix gallardo who 
was thought to control much of the mexican drug trade 
none of us are naive enough to think that the arrest of one 
kingpin will dismantle any cartel thornburgh said but the 
fact that we now have untouchables such as felix gallardo and 
former colombian kingpin carlos lehder behind bars sends powerful 
signals worldwide 
all member nations of the conference have laws on the books or 
pending to control drugprocessing chemicals lawn said 
legislation signed into law last november by president reagan 
requires manufacturers to keep sales records and encourages them to 
report suspicious purchases of precursor chemicals to the dea 
the law drew particular praise from the colombian delegation 
which maintains its country has been blamed unfairly for the 
international drug scourge 
the seventh annual conference meeting in the united states for 
the first time has drawn upperlevel drug enforcement officials 
from latin america and canada in an effort to develop a hemispheric 
antidrug strategy 
on thursday bush is scheduled to participate in a simulated 
drug interdiction exercise and to address an opening ceremony at a 
hightech center where the us customs service and the coast guard 
will gather intelligence and coordinate the fight against drug 
smugglers throughout the eastern united states

three soviet cosmonauts returned to earth on 
thursday leaving the space station mir with no one at the helm for 
only the second time since it was launched more than three years 
ago 
the descent module touched down in kazakhstan in soviet central 
asia at 659 am moscow time the official news agency tass 
reported the soyuz tm7 landed about 90 miles northeast of 
dzheskazgan in cloudy skies with observation helicopters on hand 
launch director cosmonaut vladimir gzhenebekov told soviet 
television a little correction was made but there were no 
problems with the landing 
mir considered the showpiece of the soviet space program is 
expected to remain unmanned until august in what officials called a 
moneysaving move prompted by delays in preparing new scientific 
equipment for the spacecraft 
the soviet media and and candidates in recent elections 
complained the billions of dollars spent on space would be better 
applied to social services on earth 
officials also said the break also would give scientists a 
chance to review the masses of information gathered since mir was 
launched in february 1986 
cosmonauts alexander volkov sergei krikalev and valery polyakov 
spent wednesday packing a landing module and mothballing some 
onboard systems the tass news agency reported 
a new crew is scheduled for launch this summer for a sixmonth 
mission aboard the orbiting station the new cosmonauts are to 
install new modules that will approximately double the stations 
size and equipment and usher in the second phase of mirs service 
life tass said 
in september an afghan and a soviet cosmonaut were forced to 
postpone the landing of their soyuz tm5 capsule in soviet central 
asia for a day because of equipment and crew errors they touched 
down safely a day late but were running dangerously low on food and 
air 
in december two soviet cosmonauts returned from the mir after 
breaking the record for the longest time in space with a yearlong 
stay they and a french crew member stayed on board an unplanned 
extra three hours because the memory of a computer aboard their 
capsule overloaded soviet media reported 
gzhenebekov however denied that there were serious problems on 
those occasions on the television news broadcast

tens of thousands of chinese students cheered by 
bystanders surged through police roadblocks thursday to press for 
more democracy in a march that communist authorities had vowed to 
stop 
riot police fitted with helmets shields and sticks closed 
100acre tianamen square the students destination at the center 
of beijing truckloads of police were parked along the square 
about nine miles southeast of the campus area where the march began 
police get out of the way peoples police belong to the 
people the students shouted as they pressed through a barricade 
of about 300 police at a major intersection in northwest beijing 
student leaders urged youths from dozens of beijing universities 
to march to tiananmen square the symbolic center of china to 
protest harsh government statements condemning their 11dayold 
campaign for democracy 
government officials in mass meetings wednesday declared the 
demonstrations illegal beijing communist party secretary li ximing 
told a special meeting of 10000 city party officials we must 
firmly stop such riots 
however by noon the marchers had pushed through three police 
blockades set up along the route authorities gave way and there 
were no injuries 
it was like watching an iron bar bend one bystander said 
describing the police retreats when three truckloads of armed 
police pulled up at an intersection it was surrounded by a crowd 
shouting people love the peoples police the peoples police 
love people 
students with arms linked sang the national anthem and shouted 
long live democracy as they headed down the main road from 
their campuses to the square others shouted down with 
bureaucracy down with corruption 
students reported that thousands of troops had massed near the 
beijing normal university along the student route toward the center 
of the city 
i already know that i might die today i am prepared said 
one student 
thousands of bystanders along the street shouted get out of 
the way and dont beat them when police temporarily blocked 
the students at one intersection 
along the route thousands of people leaned out windows and 
applauded the students doctors and patients in bathrobes from a 
local hospital grabbed for pamphlets the students were handing out 
a chinese journalist speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
government moves against the protest were made by order of senior 
leader deng xiaoping to stop the students campaign against 
official corruption and for sweeping democratic reforms such as a 
free press 
the peasants support us the workers support us the army 
supports us so why should we be bothered by students the 
journalist quoted deng as saying tuesday the journalist from the 
official peoples daily spoke on condition of anonmyity 
spurred by the april 15 death of ousted communist party chief hu 
yaobang a reformer tens of thousands of students marched 
repeatedly to tiananmen square last week they held unprecedented 
sitins outside government and party headquarters in the largest 
student protest in four decades of communist rule 
more than 70000 students from 41 beijing schools began a class 
boycott monday they have demanded that 84yearold deng step down 
and they want premier li peng to open a dialogue with them 
loudspeakers at beijing university appealed to the students 
thursday we urge you to think what kind of problems will arise 
if you leave the university think what kind of effect this will 
have on your family and parents 
but the students have won widespread support from beijing 
residents who have donated more than 8000 to their campaign 
huge crowds have flocked to read the students posters and many 
people have expressed agreement in unprecedented streetside 
political debates 
in front of the peoples university one middleaged man told 
several dozen listeners wednesday he had canceled his newspaper 
subscriptions 
theres no point reading them all the papers are the same 
he said shanghai officials announced they had dismissed the editor 
of shanghais weekly world economic herald chinas most outspoken 
newspaper and would reorganize it

a second day of bad weather prevented the alaska 
national guard from bringing two soviet defectors to the mainland 
from little diomede island a guard spokesman said tuesday 
mike haller said that when weather permits a guard helicopter 
will fly the men from the island in the bering strait to nome from 
there they will be flown to anchorage to file formal requests for 
political asylum 
the two sought asylum just hours before officials signed a 
protocol aimed at easing travel restrictions between alaska and 
siberia 
their applications will be forwarded to the state department for 
review and a recommendation said gary johnson district director 
of the immigration and naturalization service the final decision 
rests with the ins he said 
the process usually takes several weeks johnson said 
soviet officials are aware of the defections but at this 
point we have no comment said andre dronov a soviet vice consul 
based in san francisco 
johnson declined to identify the men or provide additional 
information about them but sources on the island who asked not to 
be identified said the men were apprentice journalists from moscow 
in their mid30s they are staying at the local guard armory 
johnson said they were the first soviet defectors in his 10 
years with the ins in alaska 
the men were reported missing when the soviet delegation 
prepared to leave the island by helicopter after a party following 
the signing ceremony 
other national guardsmen helped the soviets search for the two 
said jim stimpfle a nome chamber of commerce official who had 
reached the island before the weather turned bad 
stimpfle said the guardsmen apparently either didnt know about 
the defections or felt it wasnt proper protocol to inform their 
soviet guests 
adj gen john schaeffer commander of the alaska national 
guard said the timing of the defections was embarrassing 
the governor is trying to get along better with the soviets 
and here comes a couple of people who are basically messing up the 
operation said schaffer all of us would have liked to say 
sorry guys lets try next week 
stimpfle still weathered in on the island said the defectors 
are being kept under tight security everything is hush hush 
he said theyve even got the armory windows blacked out with 
ponchos or something

no superheroes grace the pages of 
javier juarezs comic books no archvillains with maniacal plots to 
control the world and not a single pow zap or bam 
even so the blackandwhite adventures of felipe and his 
friends as they try to conquer a mountain of bureaucratic obstacles 
to become legal us residents may be the most dogeared literature 
in california 
distributed free at employment offices churches and social 
service agencies the booklets are lessons in applying for 
residency under the complex 1986 immigration reform and control 
act better known as the amnesty program 
amnistia or amnesty about applying for temporary 
residency was out of print soon after the release of 50000 copies 
a year ago the second phase about permanent residency and 
avoiding disqualification is in its second printing four months 
after distribution of the first 30000 copies 
weve never had this kind of response with any material 
before said emily goldfarb executive director of the san 
franciscobased coalition for immigrant and refugee rights and 
services which produced the books 
the potential audience in california exceeds 158 million the 
number of applicants for residency status under the amnesty program 
all this subject matter is deadly boring if you arent 
affected by it if you are affected by it its not deadly boring 
its terrifyingly boring said juarez 39 a former mexican 
government economist who got the idea after he married a us 
citizen and moved from mexico city to california 
so juarez lightened it up capitalizing on the gallows humor and 
love of storytelling he said is the heritage of mexico where 
political cartooning has enjoyed a long tradition and soap 
operastyle novellas are popular 
lots of people say why a comic book thats for a kid or the 
mentally retarded theres nothing comic about the situations 
portrayed in the comic books actually its a matter of life and 
death its going to determine where they live and work but 
theres no reason to lose your sense of humor 
when the characters discuss the difficulties of obtaining 
documents and witnesses sworn statements to prove theyve been in 
the country since jan 1 1982 the cutoff date for amnesty 
applications felipe laments even my motherinlaw wanted to 
use the opportunity to get rid of me 
the idea was so good that the immigration and naturalization 
service which had said it couldnt afford to produce juarezs 
book followed suit the government version also proved popular 
said scott nyborn outreach coordinator with the ins in san 
francisco i dont think we have any left actually 
juarez writes the scripts in spanish then translates them for 
english editions a former student of dramatic arts he gets help 
with illustrations from his mediawise family his father works in 
advertising his brother in filmmaking and his sister is a 
television director in mexico 
he strives to write the scripts in the idioms of everyday 
spanish while accurately imparting information about the amnesty 
program a task that can be a nightmare because experts 
frequently disagree on the complex law 
goldfarb believes that unlike with government brochures people 
hang onto the comics and read them aloud to their families 
reaching illiterate people who otherwise might be misinformed or 
exploited by swindlers 
theyre fun to read she said the graphics and the 
conversations and the cultural aspects of it are things that people 
can identify with 
amnistia dealt with the first phase of the amnesty program 
but applying for residency is just the first step the application 
dealines were may 5 1988 for aliens here since 1982 and nov 30 
for seasonal agriculture workers who had picked perishable crops at 
least 90 days between may 1985 and may 1986 
the second phase deals with permanent residency and problems 
like arrests unemployment and welfare dependancy that can make 
applicants ineligible 
two more issues are in the works to address mandated aids tests 
qualifying for government assistance including free and 
reducedprice school lunches and prenatal and infant medical care 
and meeting requirements for a basic understanding of english and 
american civics and history 
if the next issue wins a state grant goldfarb said the 
immigrant and refugee rights coalition plans to print 70000 copies 
for distribution by its 80 nonprofit member organizations in the 
san francisco bay area then make it available to other 
organizations throughout the state to reprint 
juarez said the widespread readership is its own reward and has 
inspired him to try producing as his next project an analytical 
spanishenglish language magazine for californias rapidly growing 
hispanic population

the dancers looked like winners as the new york 
city ballet opened its spring season playing its strongest suit 
choreography by george balanchine 
mozartiana from 1981 episodes from 1959 and 
tchaikovsky piano concerto no 2 from 1941 all choreographed 
by balanchine comprised tuesdays opening night program at the new 
york state theater 
on this occasion the modern movements in episodes to anton 
von webern music had the most bite and gave the most pleasure 
helene alexopoulos and leonid kozlov had a duet lighted by two or 
sometimes one spotlight just on them this gave their very 
athletic movements as when he faced the audience with her clinging 
upside down on his back a look of mystery and futurism 
we also saw modernlooking postures and moves in the duet by 
wendy whelan and jock soto these young dancers gave this great 
performance art a new look miss whelan not yet a principal or 
soloist was filling in for ballerina heather watts 
the other two couples in episodes were judith fugate and 
jukka aromaa and maria calegari and otto neubert peter frame 
seemed to be struggling with his angular solo

newspapers must use the latest technologies and 
updated advertising techniques in order to remain a competitive 
thriving force in their communities publishers have been told 
some newspapers are already following that advice with 
impressive results news executives were told at the american 
newspaper publishers associations 103rd annual convention on 
tuesday 
these papers for example are using telephone recordings of 
uptotheminute sports scores and boldly colored ads in the middle 
of their stock listings 
if newspapers are going to be as successful in the future as 
theyve been in the past we have to be much more zealous about 
getting close to our customers and staying there technology can 
help us do that said james k batten president of miamibased 
knightridder 
batten spoke to more than 500 people gathered for a morning 
session at the threeday meeting which ends today 
in 1967 he said 73 percent of american adults said they read a 
newspaper every day while last year everyday readership hit a 
new low of 51 percent and sank to 29 percent among the group 
that is key to our longterm future adults between 18 and 29 
that decline as well as the aging of the babyboom generation 
an increase in twoincome households and growing cultural 
diversity must be dealt with through technology batten said 
used intelligently the telephone and the computer can let us 
recreate the kind of personal relationships that newspapers had 
with their customers 20 or 25 years ago batten said 
he cited the providence ri journalbulletin which offers 
telephone recordings of soapopera updates publishing an access 
code for readers the code is changed daily so that those who want 
to use the service must read the paper to find it more than 20000 
calls a month are recorded on the system batten said 
in colorado he said the boulder daily camera gets more than 
77000 calls a month for recordings of sports scores and stories 
that come in after the paper has gone to press 
the systems are relatively inexpensive requiring little more 
than a personal computer phone lines and tape recordings batten 
said 
he said newspapers have little choice but to change with their 
readers 
these changes in readers are threats not to our existence 
but to our pricing flexibility to our ability to finance the news 
coverage that our communities deserve and that we want to 
provide batten said 
other threats include a trend among advertisers toward using 
direct mail and other techniques to communicate directly with 
consumers said frank a bennack jr president and chief executive 
officer of the hearst corp 
direct mail represents 14 percent of all us advertising and 
its growth is expected to outpace traditional media advertising 
bennack said 
newspapers must develop new strategies for capturing 
advertisers dollars such as updating their television guide 
sections and standardizing ad sizes used in the guides said jerry 
tillis marketing vice president at knightridder and president of 
the detroit free press 
tillis noted that with the spread of cable television more 
promotion dollars are being spent by networks stations and 
others 
another recommendation is adoption of the island position on 
the first page of agate stock listings in your financial 
sections he said 
craig standen president of the newspaper advertising bureau 
noted the recent introduction by portlands oregonian newspaper of 
a boldly colored ad in the middle of its sports scoreboard 
i think the longterm outlook for our business is bright he 
said but that future depends on our ability to change and make 
new opportunities happen

attracting more minority readers would enable 
newspapers to tap into fastestgrowing segments of the us 
population and could offset flat circulation trends a publishers 
task force says 
the group presented a 40page report titled cornerstone for 
growth how minorities are vital to the future of newspapers to 
news executives at the annual convention of the american newspaper 
publishers association on tuesday 
the study recommends that newspapers pursue not only minority 
readers but minority employees and advertisers as well 
what we have done in a very quantifiable way is to make the 
case that what is right and fair is also smart business said 
david lawrence jr publisher of the detroit free press and 
chairman of the task force 
daily newspaper circulation is about 63 million barely more 
than the 62 million of 1970 
but the task force report noted that 87 percent of the us 
population growth between now and the year 2000 will be among 
minorities principally blacks hispanics asianamericans and 
native americans 
further the report concluded more than 56 percent of workers 
joining the labor force between now and the year 2000 will be 
members of minorities in order to attract both this advertising 
target audience and future employees newspapers will have to 
adjust their sights to better serving minorities the report said 
this is a particularly useful tool for publishers as they 
continue to change their newspapers to better meet the needs of 
their communities said arthur ochs sulzberger publisher of the 
new york times and chairman of the anpa 
in addition to providing profiles on what some newspapers are 
doing to adapt to the changing demographics in their markets the 
report debunks myths about minorities that researchers said have 
slowed growth in newspaper readership circulation and advertising 
although some have suggested pursuing minority markets is 
futile because minorities dont read newspapers the report found 
minorities at higher income and education levels have the same 
readership rates as nonminorities about 70 percent 
although some argue that spanishspeaking and asian groups 
resist englishlanguage newspapers the report concluded their 
children will be among the newspapers future readers 
although some argue that minorities cant afford to buy 
newspapers or advertise in them the report found minority income 
levels increasing and growing faster than nonminority income 
while nonminorities disposable household income rose just 18 
percent from 1980 to 1986 comparable figures show blacks income 
increasing by 21 percent hispanics by 45 percent and 
asianamericans by 58 percent

on the day george bush took over the 
presidency from ronald reagan a phone conversation between two 
innkeepers added an old world footnote to the transition 
well then said john ofarrell in ballyporeen ireland to 
david harris in messing england i suppose its over to you 
and so it was on jan 20 one minute before opening time the 
mantle of presidential ancestral village passed from reagans 
ballyporeen to messing the english hamlet that bushs forebears 
left for the new world in 1631 
when it comes to the business of presidential roots its the 
pubs that seem to be first to have greatness thrust upon them 
a highlight of reagans 1984 trip to the town of his 
19thcentury peasant ancestors was ofarrells pub where he 
stopped for a drink 
now david and diane harris owners of the old crown inn are 
hoping bush will visit messing when he comes to britain at the end 
of may and stop by for a pint of local brew 
tucked away in the essex countryside one hours train ride east 
of london messing is largely a bedroom community so empty on 
weekdays that you could shoot a cannon through it and nobody 
would notice according to diane harris the innkeepers wife 
the prospect of presidential glory isnt universally welcomed 
there are one or two people who are apprehensive of hordes of 
tourists arriving and of commercialization and trivialization 
says roger carter chairman of the parish council 
but he doubts it will happen messings nice old buildings 
would look pretty daft if they were all modernized and turned into 
gift stores said carter an engaging touslehaired man of 46 
who takes messings presidential connection with a healthy sense of 
humor 
with one pub one restaurant four streets and 250 inhabitants 
the village is so small that its main street is called simply the 
street 
but as tourism becomes one of britains biggest industries 
essex county authorities have developed a heritage trail for 
american visitors and messing wants a piece of the action 
businesswise it will certainly be better for us we die a 
death during the week says mrs harris 
although there is no bush ancestral home or family burial place 
in messing the medieval church and quaint houses offer good photo 
opportunities 
george bush says carter is the biggest thing to happen to 
messing since an earthquake in 1884 knocked down the pub 
presumably if he comes the whole thing will be so 
fantastically organized that we locals will get totally squeezed 
out he says 
hugh peskett the respected british genealogist who traced 
bushs origins to messing says the president is directly descended 
from an aristocratic farmer who left for america in 1631 
mrs harris likes to daydream about the presidents ancestor 
strolling in for a drink at the very spot where shes now serving 
breakfast 
messings native population has dwindled over the centuries but 
it is now being replenished by affluent refugees from london 
carter 46 moved here six years ago and commutes to a senior 
post office job in london the harrises who are in their 40s 
arrived in 1986 after six years in bahrain and kuwait and bought 
the pub 
understandably messing rooted for bush in the election and the 
pub served cake and champagne when he won carter invited him to 
visit 
though noncommittal bush said in his reply that messing will 
always have a special place in our hearts 
in ballyporeen ofarrell says he had no regrets about ceding 
the crown 
i felt quite good about it because president reagan had a very 
successful tenure and it was good to see someone going out on a 
high note especially when theres so much pessimism about these 
days he said in a telephone interview 
as for harris hes just happy that fate has linked his village 
with bush its nice he said to see a local lad make good

they gather by the tens of thousands in the 
capital and elsewhere to call for more democracy the end of 
highlevel corruption and freedom of expression who are these 
students protesting communist methods what do they want here is a 
report by an associated press correspondent who went among the 
students for this story 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they come mostly from the families of 
intellectuals their parents are government officials many of them 
are communist party members and now they want to change china 
the tens of thousands of students who took to the streets in 
beijing last week and began an unprecedented class boycott monday 
are by no means the downtrodden of this country of 11 billion 
they are its future scientists writers teachers and diplomats 
and they are calling for a new china one that is democratic with 
a free press and respect for human rights 
li qiang a senior at beijing normal university remembers when 
he first began believing something was wrong with his country 
the son of a county official in chinas northwest li a member 
of the communist party recalled that people were always giving 
us presents 
there were big meals tv sets we never paid for anything 
last month we got a new video now we have three he said i 
didnt think this was strange until i left home and found out that 
governments arent supposed to work like that 
it was his first summer vacation from university 
my father wanted to welcome me home with a banquet we went 
out and had a party but we didnt pay the hotel manager owed him 
a favor because my father gave him state funds to repair his 
building 
li asked his father why he did not pay this is china was 
the answer 
this is not the china that i want to be a part of li said 
expressing a belief shared by many protesters 
lis classmate a 24yearold woman from inner mongolia said 
she was brought up to respect individual rights 
my parents are doctors and weve always had a good 
relationship they let me live my life never reading my private 
letters like other parents i only wish the government would treat 
me the same 
although not a member of the 48 millionmember communist party 
the woman belongs to its youth league a training ground for young 
communists 
she said she believes participating in the protest does not 
conflict with the marxism pushed by the league 
karl marx was a democrat i dont pretend to understand the 
real socialism that he wrote about but i know this isnt it she 
said 
like many students the woman was unclear about what kind of 
government she wants in china 
but i dont see that as a problem i know i dont understand 
democracy but my worry now is not with the future its with the 
present we have a system that is rotten 
indeed compared to the prodemocracy protests of 198687 
student demands a free press more funds for education and 
publication of the financial records of chinas leadership are 
relatively clear 
still most students expect the protests to fail they choose to 
view their movement in a romantic light as a glorious but 
inevitably futile cause 
when the time comes they will crush us said one young man 
as he gazed at thousands of chinese soldiers during a demonstration 
last week im not afraid but they will crush us just the same 
students said chinas increasing openness to the west and the 
large number of books translated into chinese also helped spark 
their discontent 
several students cited the 1957 book the new class in 
which former yugoslav official milovan djilas charged communism has 
produced a new class of privileged leaders instead of a classless 
society 
it was an enlightenment for me because it comes from a 
socialist country and from a top leader there too said a 
20yearold sophomore studying psychology 
many students said they looked up to leaders of western 
democracies 
i read in the paper that australias prime minister bob 
hawke admitted he had been a drinker and a bit of a playboy 
said one student that to me is a wonderful thing none of our 
leaders would ever do that they lack honesty and guts 
wu xi one of the few demonstrators from a peasant background 
said it was not until he took a trip back home after two years at 
university that he made up his mind to try and change china 
i remember when i was in high school we were taught to love 
deng xiaoping and really we did love him he said of chinas 
84yearold leader who instituted 1978 agricultural reforms 
returning land to peasants but this time when i went home my 
family could barely feed me if this is not dengs fault then i 
dont know who to blame 
many students openly look down on their countrymen expressing 
impatience with their unwillingness to provide more than some 
material and spiritual help to the demonstrators but they also 
doubt themselves 
the chinese people are numb they are asleep said one 
student but i dont know if we can wake them

student demonstrators in the past week have 
shouted what few chinese have dared to whisper that senior leader 
deng xiaoping is losing the support of the people 
in posters speeches and chanted slogans students are 
proclaiming that the savior of china is too old and too autocratic 
and should cede power 
deng who turns 85 in august is still believed to be widely 
admired among the populace for his decadelong program of 
marketoriented reforms but many people are angered by his 
governments failure to halt inflation and end rampant corruption 
rising public discontent was manifested when bands of youths 
many unemployed burned and looted buildings in riots that followed 
student rallies in two chinese cities 
during widespread prodemocracy demonstrations two years ago 
students praised dengs reforms which brought relative prosperity 
to millions of chinese one banner affectionately read comrade 
xiaoping how are you 
this time posters appeared reading deng xiaoping your time 
has come urging the old revolutionary to retire 
one poster compared him to tzu hsi the autocratic empress 
dowager who ruled china from behind the scenes as chinas last 
imperial dynasty crumbled 
some participants in beijing demonstrations last week smashed 
soda bottles on the ground in a symbolic act of disdain for deng 
the chinese word for small bottle sounds the same as dengs name 
xiaoping 
deng xiaoping is a great reformer but hes a dictator and 
dictatorships time is donesaid wuer kaixi a student leader at 
beijing normal university we are disappointed in deng said a 
beijing university student now we think he has made many 
mistakes he is trying to control power to the point of autocracy 
even though he is retired in name 
deng has sought to avoid the turmoil of mao tsetungs final 
years when factions fought for power while the mentally and 
physically enfeebled chairman lay dying in 1987 deng stepped down 
from all his posts except the chairmanship of the central military 
commission 
but he is still chinas undisputed leader the man the communist 
party and the government turn to when tough decisions must be made 
although western diplomats who attended meetings with deng 
recently insist he remains mentally sharp rumors persist he is 
losing his grasp 
a lot of people hope deng will die said one student he 
is old maybe he is crazy 
general outrage over corruption and nepotism among chinas 
leadership has also not spared deng one poster referred to dengs 
son who has been linked to shady business deals as head of the 
china welfare fund for the disabled as prince deng pufang 
intellectual disenchantment with deng heightened after the 
student demonstrations two years ago when he allowed or perhaps 
instigated a numbing political campaign against western liberal 
thought 
deng also oversaw the ouster of his chosen successor the 
reformist party chief hu yaobang it was hus death on april 15 
that touched off the current demonstrations 
intellectuals also chafe at dengs policy of pushing economic 
liberalization without tackling democratic reforms 
deng has said political reform meaning mainly a reduction in 
the partys role in government and business will take a decade 
and it will be at least 20 to 30 years before national elections 
are possible 
for most of chinas 11 billion people deng is the man who 
emerged from the ultraleftist chaos of the 196676 cultural 
revolution to restore family farms encourage private initiative 
and open china to the outside world 
but in the past year the economy has been staggered by 30 
percent inflation severe shortages of materials and energy panic 
buying and pandemic corruption 
even the peasants among the first to benefit when deng moved 
quickly to break up the communes are unhappy about soaring prices 
for fertilizer and feed and low prices for grain the state forces 
them to grow 
i remember when i was in high school we were taught to love 
deng xiaoping and we really did love him said one student from 
the countryside but this time when i went home my family could 
barely feed me if this is not dengs fault then i dont know who 
to blame

hes basically sentencing us to a dialogue with him about why 
we do what we do

one count of conspiracy to commit capital murder in the july 11 
1987 slayings of daniel seymour 25 and william price 25 
the judges tentatively set sentencing for june 6 
steigers attorney f mac buckley said he would apppeal he 
also said he would file a motion to dispense with the penalty phase 
of the trial on grounds that the states death penalty statute is 
unconstitutionally vague

albert steiger founder of the springfield massbased steigers 
chain of department stores 
seymour and price broke up a party on a culdesac near the home

his home where he picked up two guns and put on camouflage 
clothing and a black knit ski mask 
he returned to seymours home with two friends and shot seymour 
and price to death with a 9mm automatic pistol firing at least 19 
armorpiercing bullets at the victims 
during the fourmonth trial steiger was described as being 
obsessed with guns war games and sadomasochism 
buckley conceded that steiger shot the two men but argued his 
client suffered from mental disease 
steiger chose to have his case decided by the judges rather than 
a jury

the wife of the late shah of iran says she was 
reluctant to leave her homeland when her husband was deposed in 
1979 and offered to stay behind as a symbol of hope for his 
supporters 
i said to my husband if you think you should go because it 
would calm things then let me stay not that i would have 
interfered politically but if i had stayed people would have seen 
his representative and it might have given hope to our 
supporters said deposed empress farah diba in an interview in 
the junejuly issue of memories magazine 
farah said shes not sure the islamic revolution that forced her 
husband from his peacock throne could have been avoided 
progress caused so any changes and brought with it so many 
problems she said we were trying in one generation to jump 
from feudal and semifeudal conditions to the 20th century and 
beyond 
she said if iranians had known what his successor ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini and his followers would be like shes certain 
there would not have been a revolution

singer liza minnelli is doggedly denying reports 
that she had attempted to smuggle lilly her beloved cairn terrier 
into sweden 
we were given the wrong information werent we lilly said 
ms minnelli during an interview in her dressing room at the paris 
opera where she performed a benefit concert tuesday night with 
frank sinatra and sammy davis jr 
at the time of the incident april 9 swedish authorities said 
they suspected the american singing star had attempted to slip the 
dog into the rabiesfree country to circumvent a law requiring a

the wrong tree

home to grunt the abandoned pig los angeles county animal control 
officials said tuesday

newspapers and on television prompting about 300 calls from 
californians wanting to give the 3yearold porker a home one

the 25yearold arms embargo against 
south africa has been beaten by cheating smuggling and legal 
loopholes but still has stunted the growth of south africas 
military a book published today asserts 
the study by signe landgren of the stockholm international peace 
research institute says that although the south african arms 
industry claims to be selfsufficient it owes its existence to 
foreign technology most of it acquired legally 
arms and increasingly production knowhow have continued to 
reach south africa coming from the very western countries that 
agreed in the united nations to abide by the arms embargo 
restrictions landgren says in the book embargo 
disimplemented 
the book lists the united states britain west germany japan 
france israel and italy as having been among the most helpful 
landgren said that no matter how inefficient the embargo 
remains one of the few military sanctions that can be imposed on 
south africa and is valuable as a statement condemning the 
countrys apartheid system of racial segregation 
in the latest example of pretorias cloakanddagger 
acquisitions french police arrested three members of a northern 
irish protestant militia and a us businessman on saturday police 
said the four were delivering stolen parts of a britishmade 
blowpipe missile launcher to a south african diplomat 
british news reports said the stateowned armscor the armaments 
corp of south africa apparently supplied small arms or cash to 
protestant extremists in exchange for blueprints of sophisticated 
british weaponry 
the united nations imposed a voluntary arms embargo on south 
africa on aug 7 1963 and made it mandatory in 1977 sanctions 
were tightened in 1984 with a resolution discouraging countries 
from buying south africanproduced weapons 
the ban often was ineffective and had the countereffect of 
spurring the south africans to build up their own arms industry 
the study said 
but it also deprived pretoria of updated weapons systems 
restricted its access to new technologies and curtailed the supply 
of spare parts 
the embargo has been a limiting factor to some extent in south 
africas efforts to expand its military strength says the study 
citing us congressional testimony 
the study also quotes a 1985 un report that says buying 
smuggled or black market weapons added 20 to 100 percent to the 
countrys arms procurement costs 
smuggling operations are hidden by creating dummy companies 
using phony labeling diverting shipments to new destinations at 
sea or in midflight and forging enduser certificates it says 
the embargo also is circumvented legally by importing civilian 
products which have military applications such as electronics and 
telecommunications gear the study says 
nuclear technology was one area where the embargo failed to stop 
south african advances it says 
it reports that by the time the united nations ordered a halt to 
nuclear cooperation in 1977 south africa had acquired 
weaponsgrade expertise to go with its vast uranium resources the 
worlds second largest reserves 
its possession of nuclear weapons remains an open question 
but its capacity to produce such weapons is equal to that of almost 
any industrial nation in europe the book says 
unlike western restrictions on technology transfers to the 
soviet bloc no multinational organization exists to monitor the 
embargo against south africa and there is no list of banned goods 
to guide enforcement landgren wrote 
the 16nation parisbased coordinating committee for 
multinational export control cocom set up in 1948 has a 
300000item list of military contraband which could be applied 
against south africa landgren said 
south africas arms production capability was acquired through 
licensing agreements and by buying stakes in armsmaking 
multinational companies the study says 
in 1963 south africa said it had 120 foreign licenses before 
the embargo became obligatory 14 years later pretoria gained 
licenses to produce weapons systems like the french mirage 
jetfighter the israeli reshef gunboat and the scorpion sea 
missile also israeli 
equipped with the technology the south africans could continue 
production after the franchises were withdrawn 
one classic case of a clandestine acquisition was the g5 
artillery piece based on howitzers obtained from the usowned 
space research corp in quebec canada and the belgian poudreries 
reunis de belgique 
the g5 deal involved contacts through a cia agent and israeli 
intermediaries south africa bought a dutchbased firm and created 
dummy companies in liechtenstein barbados and canada 
the first shells were bought from west germany bound for spain 
and redirected to south africa production lathes for the guns came 
from france and the shell fillings were imported from west germany 
by way of paraguay and brazil the g5 technology was later 
reexported to iran

the lebanese forces the christians main 
militia have obtained six surfacetosurface missiles from iraq 
capable of hitting the syrian capital of damascus christian 
sources report 
but the christians besieged in their coastal enclave north of 
beirut are not likely to use the sovietdesigned frog7 missiles 
except as a last resort lest they bring down the full weight of the 
syrians formidable firepower 
the christians led by army commander gen michel aoun have 
been battling the syrians and their moslem allies since march 8 
no independent confirmation could be obtained that the 
christians acquired the missiles 
but iraq syrias main arab rival is known to have provided the 
christians with t54 tanks multibarreled rocket launchers armored 
personnel carriers and other weapons in hope of bogging syria down 
in the lebanese quagmire 
the christians and their foes have been fighting it out with 
heavy artillery rockets and giant mortars wreaking widespread 
destruction on both sides 
more than 100000 shells have rained on beirut and its environs 
at what military experts estimate is a cost of 70 million in 
expended ammunition 
hundreds of buildings have been hit and by police count more 
than 270 people killed and nearly 1000 wounded despite arab 
league peace efforts the carnage shows no sign of ending 
the frog missiles carry warheads containing 1210 pounds of high 
explosive and have a range of 43 miles thats enough to reach 
damascus if the missiles were fired from mobile launchers in the 
mountains that form the christian enclaves eastern flank 
a highranking christian officer in the lebanese army conceded 
that six missiles are not a serious number and that the frog7s 
can hardly affect the military balance except for a momentary 
transfer of the battle to the syrian capital 
a senior source in the 6000strong lebanese forces noted we 
would use the frogs only when were completely cornered because 
syrias retaliation will be one of total obliteration 
both men spoke on condition of anonymity 
the syrians have about 40000 troops based in lebanon mainly 
moslem sectors under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
military experts in beirut say that totals 15 percent of syrian 
military strength and 10 percent of its firepower 
they estimate that the syrians have used just 60 percent of 
their firepower in lebanon against the christians and have not used 
their large air force 
syria possibly fears aerial clashes with israel which patrols 
lebanese airspace at will and conducts retaliatory raids on targets 
in lebanon after attacks against israeli targets 
if the syrians really wanted to pulverize the christians they 
could do it one western military analyst noted so far they 
have chosen not to but what they have deployed can wear the 
christians down through attrition 
a lebanese army officer commented some of the howitzers used 
were designed to demolish bunkers and knock out runways 
he referred to the sovietmade s23 180mm howitzer with a range 
of 26 miles and firing a 187pound shell 
the m1952 240mm sovietdesigned mortars used by the syrians is 
one of the more destructive weapons being employed 
one 220pound shell pierced the residence of spanish ambassador 
pedro manuel de aristegui this month killing him and several 
family members 
chief warrant officer youssef bitar a veteran army explosives 
officer in lebanons 14 years of civil war said the shell 
penetrated two stone ceilings leaving a onemeter diameter hole in 
each before exploding in the dining room where the family was 
sitting 
ordnance experts believe the shell was probably fired from 
syrian positions in schweifat two miles south of the ambassadors 
residence 
the christians probably fear the syrians bm21 stalin 
organs the most 
these mobile rocket launchers can spew out 40 122mm rockets in 
20 seconds enough to blast a whole city block with high explosives 
its like hell breaking loose on doomsday said zeina 
sweidan a 23year old interior designer whose home in the 
christian district of sin elfil was bracketed by a bm21 salvo 
recently

earthquakeshattered homeland

today after medical teatment here probably will end up living in 
makeshift housing possibly even tents doctors said 
its hard dr nishan g goudsouzian said they dont know 
whats waiting for them at the end of the line 
they are among 14 children returning to the soviet union today 
two months after us doctors brought them from armenia for 
treatment of injuries they suffered in decembers devastating 
earthquake 
they leave behind 23 other children who require additional care 
the children ages 9 to 14 were brought to hospitals in 
massachusetts new york connecticut pennsylvania and missouri by 
project hope after a team of doctors who visited victims of the 
earthquake selected them for advanced care 
a day before her scheduled departure gayane danced in the lobby 
of massachusetts general hospital shouting armenia armenia

thin patch of skin protecting part of her brain doctors grafted 
skull from the back of her head onto her forehead 
artjom who is not related to gayane arrived at massachusetts 
general with two badly crushed legs the boys grandmother who 
shielded him while he was buried underneath rubble for four days

i had no muscles said artjom speaking through an interpreter 
but now i can stand up 
artjom walked into a room at the hospital barely using one 
crutch doctors said he would have to learn to walk again because 
of a lack of wheelchair facilities in armenia 
gayane artjom and their mothers stayed in armenianamerican

clinic established in yerevan armenia to track the quake victims

he was an architect and a hospital porter an 
aeronautical engineer and a sculptor a decorated soldier and a 
monastery gardener 
ludwig wittgenstein also was one of the centurys greatest 
philosophers and today on the centennial of his birth his memory 
is being celebrated at cambridge university where he was professor 
of philosophy 
wittgenstein conferences are taking place in austria and other 
countries while in britain where wittgenstein became a 
naturalized subject in 1938 the highlight is todays concert at 
trinity college cambridge 
we will have some bruckner brahms and schubert and also 
something by josef labor an obscure composer but wittgenstein 
liked him said nicholas denyer a teaching fellow in philosophy 
at trinity 
wittgensteins complex theories of language thought patterns 
and logic led to the conclusion that everything that mattered most 
could not be put into words 
he is regarded as difficult to understand says denyer 
his ideas are of such interest that they have attracted more 
commentaries and expository works than most 20thcentury 
philosophers he remains a controversial figure and a lot of 
issues he opened up in his later work are still being explored 
wittgenstein was born in vienna on april 26 1889 and spent his 
last 22 years at cambridge three of his four brothers committed 
suicide and he lived on the edge of madness and suicide until 
cancer killed him in 1951 at age 62 
he was extraordinary said christopher sykes a film 
producer who explored wittgensteins life in a film broadcast by 
the bbc last week 
he was a pretty good architect an aeronautical engineer who 
invented a jet system not long after the wright brothers first 
flew a logician and philosopher of amazing talent a fearless and 
multidecorated soldier in world war i a village schoolmaster a 
monastery gardeners assistant a sculptor hospital porter in 
world war ii and cambridge professor sykes said in an interview 
people who knew wittgenstein described him as good looking 
striking not very tall with deep hyacinthblue eyes of military 
bearing aristocratic he said 
most of wittgensteins only book published during his lifetime 
tractatus logicophilosophicus was written under fire on the 
eastern front and completed in an italian prisonerofwar camp it 
proposed the idea of a logically perfect or ideal language the 
prototype of which he saw in mathematical logic 
seven other works were published after his death 
his mentor the british philosopher bertrand russell said that 
when he read the first sentence a wittgenstein essay i became 
persuaded that he was a man of genius 
wittgenstein was not really at home in the 20th century 
wittgenstein never married said sykes he liked solitude 
in a log cabin he built in norway in a hut in galway on the west 
coast of ireland and on the gower peninsula in wales 
he liked detective stories and the cinema especially 
westerns he always sat in the front row so there would be nothing 
in his field of vision except the screen to try to free his mind 
of the philosophical questions that troubled him

the elderly are inadequately protected from 
medical insurance frauds house commerce committee chairman john d 
dingell said today while vowing to introduce legislation that would 
tighten enforcement 
there will always be scammers and schemers but we neednt 
make their job so easy dingell declared in a statement kicking 
off a hearing of the oversight and investigations subcommittee he 
also heads 
taking advantage of old people is easy he said it is 
also reprehensible it must stop 
the michigan democrat who called state insurance regulators 
prosecutors and members of elderly advocacy groups before the 
panel acknowledged that insurance regulation can be highly 
technical 
but when regulations are policies are writen in terms that 
only a select few can understand the public has been hoodwinked 
he said no amount of legalistic babble can obfuscate the fact 
that elderly people are being skinned and that the law is not 
protecting them 
dingell released the results of a general accounting office 
study of the amount of claims paid out by hospital indemnity 
policies compared with the amount of premiums collected 
using 1987 statistics it showed an average loss ratio of 527 
for 37 policies meaning the companies paid out nearly 53 cents of 
every dollar collected in premiums 
he had released another gao study two weeks ago that showed only 
marginally better payouts for medigap policies sold to supplement 
coverage under the giant medicare health program for americas 33 
million elderly and disabled 
while medigap plans cover such things as the oneday hospital 
deductible not paid by medicare indemnity policies are those that 
pay the beneficiary a certain amount of cash for each day 
hospitalized 
simply put hospital indemnity plans are not really medical 
insurance just a bad gamble for older persons james p firman 
president of united seniors health cooperative told the 
subcommittee in testimony submitted in advance 
hospital indemnity plans have always been a bad deal for older 
persons said firman now with improved hospital coverage 
under medicare hospital indemnity plans do not cover any 
significant risk faced by most older persons 
earl r pomeroy the north dakota commissioner of insurance and 
vice president of the national association of insurance 
commissioners told the subcommittee the association has already 
revised the minimum standards required by medigap policies to take 
into account the expanded coverage under the expansion of medicare 
last summer to include catastrophic illness care 
however pomeroy said the restructuring of the private policies 
has not meant a corresponding decrease in premiums for the private 
policies purchased by more than twothirds of medicare 
beneficiaries 
several factors have wiped out any refunds or credits and in 
fact are contributing to net increases in the premiums on the 
existing business said pomeroy the factors are the length 
of time since the last premium increase recent loss ratio 
performance increase in utilization and in price of medical 
services and addition of new benefits to the policies

house republican whip newt gingrich says he 
doesnt feel snared by his own trap despite similarities between 
the ethics complaint against him and the charges he instigated 
against house speaker jim wright 
i knew full well that this issue might well come up when i 
filed charges against jim wright gingrich said tuesday 
referring to the complaint rep bill alexander dark filed 
against him with the house ethics committee i knew full well the 
intensity and savagery of the democratic response 
the complaint filed earlier this month alleges 10 violations 
of house rules in a partnership set up in 1984 to promote sales of 
window of opportunity a book coauthored by gingrich his 
wife marianne gingrich and political associate david drake 
many of the investors in the partnership were republican 
political activists who later obtained tax writeoffs from the 
arrangement 
gingrich and his wife who was the general partner of cos 
limited partnership released hundreds of pages of documents 
tuesday and then appeared together at a news conference in an 
effort to lay to rest the charges outlined in alexanders complaint 
but the news conference turned stormy as reporters persisted 
with questions about the parallels between the ethics problems 
facing wright and those confronting gingrich mrs gingrich upset 
by the questions walked out of the room midway through the session 
what we did we did legally correct we did ethically correct 
we did it out in the open and it is above board gingrich said 
and i think thats a huge difference between us and jim wright 
the partnership involved 18 individuals and three corporations 
that put up 5000 each to promote the book in exchange for a 
promise of half of the publishers profits but the partnership 
reported more than 100000 in losses from 1984 to 1988 and those 
losses were divided among the partners for tax writeoffs 
gingrich acknowledged that some of the partners had a direct 
interest in legislation and his office handled routine requests 
for some of them but he denied that he provided any of the 
partners unusual or extraordinary personal help with any 
problem they had with the federal government 
house rules prohibit members from accepting gifts worth more 
than 100 from persons with direct interest in legislation but 
gingrich said the 5000 each investor put into the deal did not 
constitute a gift because each one thought there was a reasonable 
chance that it might make money 
gingrich and his wife each earned 7018 in royalties on the 
book under a contract that provided the three authors with a total 
royalty of 10 percent on hardback sales and 8 percent on paperback 
sales 
gingrich said the arrangements surrounding his book may have 
been unusual but they were not unethical in comparison he said 
wrights bulk book sales were unethical 
wright is charged with violating house rules limiting outside 
income by arranging bulk sales of his book to specialinterest 
groups in lieu of speaking fees book sales are not covered by the 
income limits while speaking fees are 
we wrote a real book working with a real publisher 
distributed to real bookstores and sold to real people for a 
realistic standard royalty gingrich said jim wright did none 
of those things 
gingrich also said that his wifes work for the partnership was 
more substantial than that done by wrights wife in a business 
arrangement that prompted several ethics charges against the 
speaker 
she actually did the work for the money she got gingrich 
said of his wife he said the 350 pages of tax returns 
incorporation papers and financial records released tuesday 
represent her work for the partnership 
as general partner she received a 10000 payment in 1984 for 
setting up the partnership and later received a 2 percent interest 
in the partnership and another 1500 payment for her work

the state department is joining a delegation 
of nicaraguan opposition leaders in accusing sandinista authorities 
of trying to rig national elections set for next february 
the opposition leaders ranging from an antisandinista 
communist to usbacked contra rebels said tuesday that 
nicaraguan officials are attempting to ensure victory by stacking 
the allpowerful supreme electoral council in their favor and by 
denying the opposition equal access to media outlets 
the state department leveled similar charges and appealed to the 
sandinistas to meet opposition demands for a more equitable process 
at issue is legislation approved by recently by the 
sandinistadominated legislature setting forth ground rules for the 
elections 
tuesday was the deadline established at a central american 
summit meeting last february in el salvador for setting in motion 
an electoral process that will culminate in national elections 10 
months from now 
nicaraguan embassy spokeswoman cecilia lopez said the new laws 
were approved with the participation of the political parties 
represented in the legislature and are in compliance with the terms 
of the central american summit 
in a telephone interview she said the law allows opposition 
parties more air time for campaign purposes than they would have 
received under their original request 
in addition she said the sandinistas consistent with another 
pledge made at the summit have released about 1700 national 
guardsmen who served the rightist regime which was ousted by the 
sandinistas a decade ago 
twelve opposition leaders outlined their criticisms at a news 
conference after discussing the issue with united nations and 
organization of american states officials 
the delegates included eli altamirano of the nicaraguan 
communist party and three members of the ussupported contra 
rebels 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
administration shares the criticisms of the opposition leaders 
the electoral law approved last week is not the result of good 
faith bargaining between the government of nicaragua and the 
internal opposition groups and was unilaterally imposed after 
being passed by the sandinistadominated legislature she said 
she said the law includes a provision requiring that the 
election council which the sandinistas control receive onehalf of 
any foreign political contributions 
the law she said ignores proposals made by the internal 
opposition for absentee balloting and procedures for ensuring 
unlimited access for international election observers 
a new law governing press conduct she added includes penalties 
for disseminating information which the interior ministry 
determines to be a violation of national integrity and allows 
officials to order closures of up to four days

a justice department brief defending the 
administrations plan to test more than 1500 white house employees 
for drugs says two workers have been fired in the last 2 years 
because of illegal drugs 
in one case the employee a motor vehicle operator tested 
positive at a hospital for cocaine says a declaration by charles 
easley the security officer for the office of administration in 
the second instance an accounting technician was arrested for 
possession of cocaine outside the complex shortly after departing 
work 
both employees were fired easley said in his declaration which 
is part of the justice department brief 
the positions held by the two fired workers would be subject to 
random drug testing under a plan originally proposed by the reagan 
white house and now being pursued by president bush 
the brief was filed late monday in the us district court where 
30 employees of the executive office of the president filed suit in 
january to block the random drug tests as unnecessary and 
unconstitutional 
a hearing on the case is scheduled for may 11 
there have been revelations earlier that two national security 
council clerks resigned and there had been two resignations and two 
firings in the uniformed division of the secret service stemming 
from a drug investigation that surfaced last may 
but there had been no previous mention of the two employees in 
the office of administration the part of the executive office of 
the president that provides administrative support to the rest 
the plan calls for random drug testing of 1520 of the 1850 
employees in the agencies in the executive office of the president 
including the office of management and budget the national 
security council the council of economic advisers the council on 
environmental quality and the office of the us trade 
representative 
the reagan white house announced last june 30 that everyone on 
its payroll would be subject to random drug tests in 60 days but 
that program was held up by court challenges 
the suit by the employees of the white house complex is one of 
more than 50 suits filed by employees throughout the government to 
stop drug testing 
these are extremely loyal people loyal to the president and 
loyal to government administration their american civil 
liberties union attorney jeffrey f liss has said they just 
think random drug testing is unconstitutional not justified an 
invasion of their privacy and demeaning 
the justice department in its brief cited two recent supreme 
court decisions a 72 ruling in favor of testing of railroad 
crews after accidents and a 54 ruling upholding a customs service 
policy of testing applicants for law enforcement jobs in support 
of the plan to test the executive office employees 
the department also noted that those to be tested already had 
willingly allowed extensive background checks in order to get their 
sensitive jobs thus voluntarily limited their right to privacy 
the test involved here detracts little from their already 
limited privacy rights the brief says 
the brief notes that the employees are the personal staff of 
the president of the united states 
just about all of these employees designated for random 
testing have access to the president and the white house complex 
or to classified andor sensitive information or to both it 
says 
their roles as advisers to the president and participants in the 
development of domestic and foreign policies make random 
urinalysis drug testing for such employees reasonable the brief 
says their regular access to highly sensitive or classified 
information makes random drug testing a necessity 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said march 29 that 
president bush was displeased by the employees suit saying the 
government must ensure a clean workplace

drug planes used airstrips on the ranch of 
john hull in costa rica while the former indiana resident helped a 
secret us operation to aid the nicaraguan contras witnesses told 
a foreign relations narcotics subcommittee 
a senate committee report on international drug trafficking says 
five witnesses identified hull as a participant in international 
drug trafficking hull whose property included airstrips was 
charged in costa rica last january with drug trafficking and 
violating that nations neutrality 
the report said that in addition to his drug activities hull 
also defrauded the overseas private investment corp of 375000 
when he pocketed a loan for a wood products factory that never 
produced anything 
the report obtained tuesday from sen john f kerry dmass 
said only one of the five witnesses told the panel he personally 
witnessed cocaine being loaded in hulls presence onto planes 
headed for the united states 
the witness was identified as gary betzner a drug smuggling 
pilot serving a 27year prison term for running a continuing 
criminal enterprise for trafficking in cocaine 
another witness werner lotz said he heard about drug flights 
to hulls ranch from the colombian and panamanian pilots who 
allegedly flew the planes 
lotz described the strips as refueling stops and told the 
subcommittee according to the report that hull was paid for 
allowing their use 
lotz a costa rican was convicted in the united states for 
conspiracy to import drugs in 1985 and sentenced to four years in 
prison he was deported at the conclusion of his sentence to costa 
rica 
the report also said hull and two associates applied for the 
opic loan in 1983 saying they wanted to finance a joint venture 
wood products factory that would make wheelbarrow and ax handles 
for the us market the money was advanced on march 30 1984 
by the end of 1985 after one interest payment the loan lapsed 
into default and opic officials began to recognize that the 
project was a fraud and that hull had made false representations 
in making the application to opic the report said 
the agency found according to the report that the money was 
deposited in hulls indiana bank account and the funds withdrawn by 
hull in cash hull told opic that wanted the cash to buy costa 
rican money on the black market to get a more favorable exchange 
rate 
in fact costa rica has a favorable exchange rate for foreign 
investment and the excuse hull offered does not make sense the 
report said what appears to have happened is that hull simply 
took the money inasmuch as no equipment was purchased for the 
factory no products were shipped from it and hulls partner 
testified that he never saw the money 
the justice department told the panel theres an ongoing 
investigation into the loan 
opic eventually tried to sell the property hull put up for 
collateral but to prevent a sale far below the market price opic 
bought its own property for 187500 
later opic negotiated an agreement with a purchaser who was 
required to make no down payment and to repay opic its 187500 
only from future proceeds of the sale of timber cut on the land 
hull was the focus of news reports during the unraveling of the 
irancontra affair citing the use of his ranch as a conduit for 
arms to nicaragua there were also published reports at the time 
that he was involved in drugs

a crippled united airlines flights crew worried 
about staying aloft and boosted each others spirits during the 
harrowing return to honolulu after their plane ripped open in 
flight according to a cockpit recording transcript released 
tuesday 
the transcript was released as the national transportation 
safety board opened a hearing into why united flight 811s cargo 
door blew off sucking nine passengers to their deaths and knocking 
out two engines 
speculation has focused on the failure of a latch to work 
properly although the crew at first thought the damage might have 
been caused by a bomb 
the federal aviation administration released its transcript of 
recorded radio conversations between the airplane and the honolulu 
control tower earlier this month the transcript of the cockpit 
recording released tuesday was the first indication of what crew 
members said to each other during the 25minute return to honolulu 
the boeing 747 departed shortly before 2 am hst on feb 24 
from honolulu bound for sydney australia with 337 passengers and 
18 crew the flight was uneventful until 209 am when pilot 
david cronin said what the expletive was that 
i dont know replied first officer al slader of langley 
va 
then there is the sound of a loud bang and power to the 
recording unit was interrupted for 21 seconds there is the sound 
of an alarm horn 
goin down cronin of incline village nev said followed 
by emergency descent 
i think we blew a door or something slader says seconds 
later 
tell the pa the ah flight attendant to get ah prepared 
for an evacuation cronin said 
the crew shut down the damaged no 3 engine flight engineer 
mark thomas of albany ind began dumping fuel as the plane limped 
back to honolulu 
at 213 am cronin said i think we might have some damage 
out there 
we got a control problem here cronin said seconds later 
at 214 cronin noted a problem with the no 4 engine and the 
crew discussed flying the massive plane on just two engines 
can you maintain 240 knots slader asked 
yeah just barely cronin replied 
yeah but were losing altitude slader said 
i know it cronin said 
at 216 thomas offered to go into the passenger cabin to check 
the situation 
seconds later cronin announced no fuel flow to no 4 engine 
what a expletive of a thing to happen on your ah second to 
last month slader told cronin 
no expletive cronin then 59 and on his secondtolast 
flight replied cronin retired 10 days later on reaching the

after a sixsecond silence the crew turned back to flying the 
plane 
at 219 cronin told the tower they would like all the medical 
equipment we can get 
thomas warned against flying too fast because of the gaping 
hole and slader wondered what the minimum airspeed was under the 
circumstances 
i wouldnt go below 240 he said

star wars research is focusing on a concept 
called brilliant pebbles consisting of thousands of satellites 
under three feet long and designed to knock down enemy missiles 
says defense secretary dick cheney 
cheney told congress on tuesday that he remains a strong 
advocate of star wars known formally as the strategic defense 
initiative but is recommending that the budget for fiscal 1990 be 
cut to 46 billion from the 59 billion proposed by former 
president reagan 
he said president bush believes very deeply that we need to go 
forward with strategic defense 
much sdi research will focus on the brilliant pebbles concept 
said cheney although sdi officials later said that weapon is one 
of several spacebased antimissile satellites under consideration 
the budget level for star wars will buy us the capability to 
look aggressively at brilliant pebbles said cheney if 
brilliant pebbles does not work out the ultimate deployment date 
of the current spacebased missile program would slip by two 
years he did not set a date 
plans call for the president and congress to decide in 1993 or 
1994 whether to go ahead with star wars said pentagon spokesmen 
several years later deployment could begin on the first elements 
surveillance satellites and groundbased missiles 
brilliant pebbles drew backing from the outgoing sdi chief lt 
gen james abrahamson who predicted in a feb 9 memorandum that it 
could be deployed in space for about 25 billion far under 
estimates of 45 billion for other sdi orbital systems 
the concept calls for between 3000 and 5000 satellites about 
three feet long and weighing less than 100 pounds apiece to be 
placed in orbit up to 400 miles above the earth according to 
retired lt gen daniel o graham a strong backer of star wars 
each satellite would be housed in a protective cocoon called a 
life jacket from which it would be ejected in time of war if 
everything worked sensors aboard the satellites would spot and 
track enemy boosters and rockets would propel the pebbles 
toward the boosters destroying them before they could release 
their warheads 
the other spacebased interceptor sbi under consideration 
calls for several hundred satellites each armed with about a dozen 
interceptors which would be fired at enemy boosters 
brilliant pebbles and sbi rely on a boost surveillance and 
tracking satellite in high earth orbit designed to spot boosters 
at launch 
brilliant pebbles is the brainchild of lowell wood a physicist 
at the federal lawrence livermore laboratory in california he is a 
protege of edward teller who is known as the father of the 
hydrogen bomb and helped persuade reagan to launch his star wars 
campaign 
cheneys remarks drew applause from sdi backers and skepticism 
from star wars critics who note that any spacebased system would 
violate the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty and thus lead to a 
new round in the arms race 
graham the head of the prostar wars lobbying group high 
frontier said he was delighted by cheneys remarks 
critics noted that the pentagon has done relatively little work 
so far on brilliant pebbles 
the fundamental problem is that there is no there there at 
this point it is just a neat idea said john pike director of 
space research for the federation of american scientists 
i think it is entirely premature for the administration to be 
making the claim that this will pan out said pike calling 
cheneys remarks a triumph of faith over fact 
sdi is spending 40 million on brilliant pebbles this year a 
tiny fraction of its overall budget and only 10 percent of the 400 
million it is spending on two groundbased interceptors that would 
likely also be deployed in any antimissile defense 
the brilliant pebbles budget for fiscal 1990 has not been 
disclosed but an sdi spokesman maj alan freitag said we 
certainly take our direction from the secretary of defense and the 
administration technology will also be a determining factor 
sdi spokesmen stressed that brilliant pebbles was just one 
possible component in a system that would include layers of 
surveillance satellites spacebased kill vehicles and groundbased 
antimissile missiles 
its just one element among spacebased interceptors that we 
are looking at col louis seelig the sdi comptroller told 
reporters 
brilliant pebbles is not what sdi officials call a mature 
technology on which much research has been done said capt 
bruce jackson another sdi spokesman but it is probably an 
advanced concept that we could bring to fruition quickly and at a 
lower cost than other versions 
the sdi director lt gen george l monahan jr is scheduled 
to appear before the senate appropriations committee next tuesday 
to explain exactly how the lower budget proposal would affect sdi 
research through fiscal 1990

the rose garden is one of the most 
meticulously kept and manicured tracts of real estate anywhere but 
president bush views it as another chunk of mother earth 
nearing the 100day mark in his presidency bush has been making 
active use of the white house grounds especially now that the 
weather lends itself to outdoor pursuits 
i wish that all of you who love nature and love the earth 
mother earth could have been with agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter and me as we walked through the beautiful rose garden area 
of the white house bush told a radio audience 
it is at its most beautiful this time of year and i get a 
kick out of seeing all the tourists from middle america and 
agricultural america and everyplace coming to the peoples house 
he said during a recent broadcast sponsored by the agriculture 
department 
and while the 18acre estate hardly qualifies as the great 
outdoors bush is the latest in a string of presidents and their 
families to enjoy the grounds since thomas jefferson first obtained 
funds to fence them in 
woodrow wilson grazed sheep on the rolling south lawn during 
world war i an early photograph shows benjamin harrison posing 
there with his grandson and a pet goat 
caroline kennedy rode macaroni her pony on the grounds amy 
carter had a tree hut 
herbert hoover played medicine ball outside with his cabinet 
harry truman pitched horseshoes an outdoor sport that bush has 
revived 
theodore roosevelt whom bush sometimes refers to as a role 
model established the first tennis courts 
gerald ford had an outdoor swimming pool built and swam there 
franklin roosevelt did calisthenics on the white house lawn as 
secretary of the navy in wilsons cabinet 
rutherford hayes marked off a croquet court warren harding and 
dwight eisenhower practiced golf shots on the lawns 
the rose garden which sits right outside the oval office has 
been a popular spot for bush who has been using it extensively in 
recent weeks to honor championship basketball teams and volunteer 
groups and to welcome foreign dignitaries 
the recently negotiated budget agreement was announced in the 
rose garden and bush used it for launching his 441 million 
education package and for signing a bipartisan agreement on contra 
aid 
the rose garden was also well used by other presidents 
gerald ford campaigned for reelection from the rose garden 
in 1976 and ronald reagan used it frequently for receptions and 
ceremonies 
the white house grounds are also the site for dog walks now as 
in past presidencies 
think of the deficit reduction as exercise like walking the 
dog every day bush told a california audience on tuesday 
believe me i know exercise keeps you at the top of your game 
that may be so but if truth be known barbara bush is the one 
who usually walks first dog millie on the white house grounds 
ever since eisenhower first used the south lawn as a landing pad 
for helicopters presidents have begun and ended trips there bush 
is no exception 
coming home from their most recent weekend at the presidential 
retreat in camp david md the president and mrs bush stepped 
from their helicopter and walked toward the white house first dog 
millie was on hand and bolted away from a group of greeters toward 
the president who outstreched his arms 
the dog zoomed right past bush and stopped lovingly at the feet 
of mrs bush 
another recent vignette outside the white house was also played 
without words 
it was a crisp spring morning as bush began his current fourday 
trip across the country with a helicopter ride from the south lawn 
of the white house to nearby andrews air force base the way he 
starts all trips 
first staff members then the bushes boarded the helicopter 
known as marine one he gave a wave and the doors of the craft 
swung shut its rotors began to whirl faster and faster and then 
stopped 
something was wrong the takeoff had been delayed the several 
dozen onlookers looked around expectantly what was wrong 
then all eyes swung to the right where a solitary figure in a 
business suit was hurrying across the lawn clutching a brief case 
the redfaced official looked disbelievingly at his watch 
shaking his head huffing and puffing toward the waiting helicopter 
a door swung open and a tardy chief of staff john sununu climbed 
aboard

the bush administration pledged cooperation 
with the successor to prime minister noboru takeshita but analysts 
say japans next government may be too weak to deal with the united 
states on trade and other issues 
regardless of who succeeds takeshita usjapanese 
relationships will be marked by disputes over japans 50 billion 
trade imbalance pressures in congress for japan to contribute more 
to its own defense and japanese criticism of the us deficit 
the resignation also leaves the troubled fsx fighterplane deal 
hanging at least until a successor to takeshita takes office 
we will continue to work closely with the new prime minister 
and the new government presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said upon receiving news of the resignation monday 
and state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler emphasized to 
reporters on tuesday that us relations with japan remain strong 
ms tutwiler noted that secretary of state james a baker iii 
had a close personal warm friendship with takeshita baker 
will miss his good friend she said 
baker worked closely with takeshita when they both served as 
their respective governments chief financial officers 
in remarks that hinted at the difficulties that may lie ahead 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash lauded takeshita for 
his courage in helping carry out trade agreements that were viewed 
unfavorably at home 
the decisions to import more american beef and citrus were 
very deeply offensive to japanese farmers and created a very 
negative political reaction in japan foley said 
the congressman said he believed it may be extremely 
difficult for the united states to win any further trade 
concessions from japan until a strong government is able to come to 
power 
takeshita linked to an influencepeddling scandal has 
announced his resignation but his successor and the timing of his 
departure remain unclear in the meantime it appears possible an 
elder politician might become interim prime minister 
this could create some shortterm uncertainties in the 
relationship analysts said 
in the broadest sense the effect will be of a weakened 
government being unable to take bold actions said robert 
scalapino of the asian studies institute at the university of 
california at berkeley 
scalapino who specializes in japanese political and security 
issues said the move toward a caretaker government or even one led 
by an elder statesman means it will be difficult for the japanese 
to meet us demands for any changes in policy be it in trade 
defense or economic matters 
a weak government cant support bold new policies he said 
susan pharr director of the program on usjapan relations at 
harvard university struck a similar tone 
it sets back usjapan relations because it could slow 
things down for a while said ms pharr a professor of 
government at harvard its not a major setback but its not the 
best situation you could hope for either 
ms pharr said that without a strong leader in place in japan 
the countrys bureaucracy tends to exert more influence 
it doesnt help speed things along she said we want 
things to happen more quickly than they will happen she said 
paul volcker who worked closely with japanese economic 
officials during his eight years as chairman of the federal 
reserve said he did not believe takeshitas resignation will have 
any lasting impact on usjapan relations 
it is not helpful to have a japanese government leaderless for 
a period of time but i am not sure that is going to happen he 
said 
former japanese ambassador yoshio okawara predicted that the 
policies of the current government which have included significant 
support to the united states in such areas as third world debt 
would be continued by the caretaker government chosen to succeed 
takeshita 
but he added that during this unstable political situation no 
new initiatives can be taken

larry brinkin couldnt take a leave from 
his job after the death of his homosexual lover of 11 years but a 
proposed law would give him and other city employees the same 
bereavement leave as married couples 
the measure proposed tuesday effectively would redefine the 
family by legally equating homosexual and unmarried relationships 
with marriage for 24000 municipal employees 
the legal world must reflect the realities that exist in our 
private existences said supervisor harry britt who wrote the 
domestic partnership legislation both gay people and 
unmarried heterosexuals have been denied the fundamental right to 
live in love and happiness 
a narrower version of the legislation was vetoed by thenmayor 
dianne feinstein in 1982 she called it too vague 
but this time mayor art agnos endorsed the measure from the 
start and eight members of the 11seat board of supervisors signed 
on as cosponsors the ordinance will be heard before a city 
committee on may 11 
if approved it would be the most farreaching measure of its 
kind although three california cities berkeley santa cruz and 
west hollywood allow municipal employees to add partners to health 
benefit and pension plans 
the ordinance would ban discrimination by any city agency 
against people because of the nontraditional relationship status 
it also requires that steps be taken to extend many benefits to 
people in committed relationships that now are provided only to 
married people including dependent health care and legal standing 
in housing contracts 
the message is that san francisco is a place where it is 
understood that the family unit even if it is nontraditional is 
paramount to our lives in terms of our survival the support we 
need to keep us free from loneliness to help us economically 
said brinkin who unsuccessfully sued his former employer southern 
pacific over the denied leave 
although the ordinance would not apply to the private sector 
the san francisco chamber of commerce announced it would begin a 
study of the issue with the aim of informing businesses what 
benefits they should offer employees in such relationships 
britts measure would require domestic partners to have a joint 
home and to share basic living expenses although each could 
maintain a second home they also must register with city hall or 
for those wishing confidentiality with a notarized statement filed 
with an independent third party such as a private attorney 
the measure has been criticized by some religious groups 
the san francisco roman catholic archdiocese will not support 
any effort to weaken the institution of marriage to tinker with 
it or put any parallel system alongside it said spokesman 
norman phillips 
but tom dimaria of the washingtonbased national gay and 
lesbian task force called domestic partnership a fundamental 
requirement for homosexuals to be accepted by society 
this tells people that gay and lesbian relationships are a 
viable healthy and acceptable new form of the traditional 
family dimaria said 
the measure directs a city task force to examine all city 
policies and practices to identify those that put nonmarried 
couples at a disadvantage 
eventually homosexual and unmarried heterosexual partners could 
have legal standing in real estate and rental contracts and could 
become eligible for rental and housing programs offered now only to 
traditionally families sick leave for city employees whose lovers 
or parents are seriously ill also would be expanded 
partners also would have hospital and jail visitation rights 
similar to traditional family members 
by city charter supervisors can only ask the citys health 
services system an independent agency that runs city hospitals 
clinics and health benefit programs to extend benefits to domestic 
partners with agnos as mayor britt hopes the departments 
compliance will be routine 
if adopted san francisco would be the only major metropolitan 
city with such a measure several other cities including 
washington dc and madison wis currently are studying the 
issue 
west hollywood which has a large homosexual population also 
offers a domestic partnership certificate and 219 couples have 
registered since 1985

nine members of congress warned in a letter to 
the house budget committee chairman that a proposed reduction in 
nasas budget could so cripple the us space station that 
cancellation becomes a real option 
the letter sent to rep leon e panetta dcalif on tuesday 
said that a senate resolution calling for a 13 billion reduction 
in budget authority for general science and space would be absorbed 
largely by reducing the amount allocated for space station freedom 
cutting the station the letter said would be tragic for 
the country because it would affect the nations ability to produce 
and utilize new technology that could be developed in space 
it is imperative that we are not pennywise and pound foolish 
with our civil space program said the letter the 
competitiveness of future generations depends on our vision 
the letter was signed reps mike andrews dtexas robert a 
roe dnj robert s walker rpa bill nelson dfla ronnie 
g flippo dala jack brooks dtexas jerry lewis rcalif f 
james sensenbrenner jr rwis and mary roe oakar dohio 
this year is a crucial year in the development of the station 
and a year when the funding must increase to keep the project on 
track the letter said a cut of this magnitude may not kill 
the space station but it will so handicap its development that 
cancellation becomes a real option 
in a related letter to panetta dale d myers acting 
administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration 
said that if the space budget cut proposed by the senate resolution 
becomes law we would have no choice but to restructure the 
entire civil space program and without doubt the space station 
would be a major victim 
myers added discontinuation of the space station would be a 
national tragedy we would be cutting more than the space program 
we would be discarding our nations aspirations for and investment 
in the future 
the space station would be a permanently orbiting laboratory 
that would permit astronauts and scientists to spend months in 
space the station also would have facilities for industrial 
research it is to be built with the joint cooperation and funding 
of japan the european space agency and canada 
deborah matthews an aide to andrews said the space station 
received about 900 million under the fiscal 1989 budget that ends 
sept 30 and that nasa has asked for about 15 billion for fiscal 
1990 
the house budget committee is to consider appropriations for 
general science and space on thursday

its an awkward time for crop and weather 
forecasters who remember last years drought and searing heat 
some say its too early to tell what to expect others say its 
later than you think 
analysts in the agriculture department say the us wheat crop 
could be significantly larger than last years droughtreduced 
harvest and they point out that most of this years corn hasnt 
even been planted yet 
on the other hand private economist john schnittker said 
tuesday that poor moisture reserves in much of the nations 
midsection have already taken a bite out of this years crop 
yields and it could worsen if the rains arent abundant this 
spring 
schnittker head of schnittker associates a washingtonbased 
agricultural consulting firm said that the 1988 drought remains 
the leading force in world agriculture at least until more is 
known about this years crops of wheat and corn 
both schnittker and the usda project huge declines in world and 
us inventories as a result of last years droughtshriveled 
yields in north america 
by july 1 he said the global grain inventory going into the 
new 198990 season will be down to a 61day supply compared with 
an 87day reserve last summer that will be the smallest reserve 
since the early 1970s when global grain stocks were drawn down to 
a 57day supply 
speaking to a meeting of the national association of 
agricultural journalists schnittker said the supply situation puts 
the united states sort of on the razors edge because of the 
uncertainties about 1989 crop conditions 
although many areas are dramatically improved from last summers 
drought parts of the great plains and corn belt are still woefully 
dry even in some areas that have moderate surface moisture the 
reserves deep in the subsoil are scant 
and if we do have a second adverse cropgrowing season the 
effect will be substantially larger in the commodities markets and 
in the consumer food retail markets than they have been the past 
year schnittker said 
the reduced 1988 harvests forced up market prices for the major 
crops as it became apparent that the us granary would be 
partially emptied 
schnittker said he finds himself disagreeing quite a lot 
with usdas chief meteorologist norton strommen who told the farm 
writers earlier that he was still optimistic about crop conditions 
improving and that nationally the united states can have a 
productive year 
strommen and others maintain that the fate of the us winter 
wheat crop will not be known for another month or so and that 
farmers still have not planted spring wheat or made much of a dent 
in planting corn 
if i seem a little on the optimistic side it may be that im 
looking at changes that have occurred and the improvements that 
have taken place since the fall of 1988 and the real harshness of 
the 1988 drought strommen said 
acknowledging that there are pockets of drought problems 
still around kansas for example where about 75 percent of the 
winter wheat is reported in very poor or poor condition strommen 
said many other sections of the country have had good moisture last 
year in recent months 
when you put all of the big parts together the overall 
outlook for the country is much improved over what it was last 
year strommen said but we are still deeply concerned about 
the pockets and the problems we have in the western great plains 
and the central part of the corn belt 
schnittker said that strommen may turn out to be right but it 
seems to me with the extreme subsoil drought concentrated on 
the central corn belt at the moment that it is prudent for private 
forecasters at least to reduce the probable corn yield a little 
bit 
already he said the moisture problems have shaved this years 
average corn yield somewhat if all had been normal the yield 
trend pointed to an average of about 120 bushels per acre but 
schnittker says he thinks 115 bushels are more likely 
that would mean a 1989 corn harvest of about 754 billion 
bushels up from 51 billion bushels estimated for 1988 the usda 
currently estimates last years corn harvest at 492 billion 
bushels but has not projected the 1989 crop 
based on april 25 conditions schnittker forecast this years 
total us wheat harvest at 215 billion bushels about 300 million 
bushels less than the output would be if moisture conditions had 
been normal last years wheat harvest was 181 billion bushels

a federal safety board is trying to stop the 
workload from increasing at a major southern california air traffic 
control center that officials say already has the reputation of an 
understaffed pigpen 
the national transporation safety board after a special 
investigation into nine operational errors at the coast radar 
approach control facility in santa ana raised questions tuesday 
about the centers ability to keep airplanes from flying into each 
other 
youve got an understaffed pigpen here by the faas own 
evaluation said board member jim burnett he referred to a 
statement by former federal aviation administration chief donald 
engen who in 1986 visited the santa ana center and dubbed it the 
pigpen of the faa 
the board said controllers at the center regularly work sixday 
weeks directing half a million flights a year between los angeles 
and san diego board staff members said there have been reports of 
health problems at the center with employees taking excessive sick 
leave and complaining about working conditions 
full staff at the facility would be 66 but the faa has only 
been able to find 24 qualified controllers primarily because of 
the high cost of living in the area 
the board recommended that the faa seek to hire local military 
personnel and others as assistant controllers so regular 
controllers at the facility can receive additional training 
the board which met for four hours said it opposed faa plans 
to expand the center and nearly double the workload unless the 
staff can also be at least doubled 
the board also called for a national task force to develop 
changes in procedures at the center 
an investigation began after a british airways jumbo jet and a 
smaller american airlines jetliner came within 19 miles of each 
other at the same altitude on feb 13 over westminster calif the 
planes were far enough apart to avoid a near miss incident but 
faa rules require aircraft in the area to be separated by at least 
three miles horizontally and 1000 feet vertically 
the board blamed the incident on a controller who was distracted 
by other duties at the facility 
the inquiry was expanded after investigators found there had 
been seven other operational errors in the past year a ninth 
occurred april 6 they also recorded several complaints from 
officials and employees at the center 
the board urged that the faa give a high priority to 
consolidation of air traffic control operations now handled by 
separate facilities at santa ana los angeles burbank and ontario 
calif but board members acknowledged it could take five years or 
more to build the new center for which a site has not yet been 
selected 
in another safety matter related to air traffic in southern 
california the board called for a review of prearranged or 
silent coordination procedure used by controllers in southern 
california and some other areas to determine if there is any 
degradation of safety the procedure formerly outlawed by the 
faa allows controllers to send planes from one control area to 
another without orally alerting the controller who is to take over 
handling of the plane 
the board inquiry was its first major investigation into an air 
traffic control operation since it began recommending upgrading at 
chicagos ohare international airport after operational errors 
increased there in 1986 
the faa has started a program to give ohare controllers extra 
pay and officials have said they expect the center to be up to 
full staff by may 
the pay program was originally intended to apply to several 
facilities where the faa has had difficulty hiring controllers but 
board members said there are moves in congress to limit the pay 
incentive to chicago

doctors should stop using the drugs tambocor 
and enkaid to treat patients with mildly irregular heartbeats 
because studies show an unexpectedly high death rate among users 
federal authorities say 
the two drugs may continue to be used to treat patients in 
emergencies in which the heart has slipped into a lifethreatening 
rhythm 
about 200000 heart patients take the medicines regularly and 
most of these patients suffer only from mild heartbeat 
irregularities officials at the national heart lung and blood 
institute said tuesday 
the rate of deaths among patients taking the drugs was 
discovered only after a mortality study was conducted by the nhlbi 
the study was intended to determine if heart attack patients who 
suffered mild heartbeat irregularities lived longer if they took 
medicine to modify that irregular beat or arrhythmia 
instead the study found that death was almost twice as frequent 
among those who took the drugs as among those who took the placebo 
i was stunned and shocked when i was presented with the 
results of the drug trials said dr thomas bigger chairman of 
the institutes steering committee for the drug trials 
a third drug called moricizine will continue to be used in the 
drug trials that drug is not now on the market and has no brand 
name 
frank young the food and drug administration director said 
that letters will be sent to doctors to modify the use of tambocor 
and enkaid and that labeling instructions also will be changed 
doctors are being advised to discontinue use of the two drugs for 
patients with only mild heartbeat irregularities 
young said however that patients taking the medicines should 
not change the use or dosage until instructed to do so by a 
physician 
tambocor and enkaid are the only members of a pharmaceutical 
class called 1c drugs in this group work to slow electrical 
conduction in the heart fiber 
young said that there are other drugs still on the market for 
treatment of mild heartbeat irregularities and that mortality 
studies have not been conducted for them 
tambocor is manufactured by 3m riker laboratories its generic 
name is flecainide enkaid whose generic name is encainide is 
manufactured by bristolmyers 
representatives of both the drug companies said they were 
working with the fda to change the instructions on how their drugs 
could be used a bristolmyers official said that patients with 
unused drugs could be reimbursed but a representative of riker 
laboratories said no decision had been made by his company on that 
issue 
in the drug study researchers were to select a total of 4400 
patients aged up to 80 who had suffered a heart attack recovered 
and then experienced mild arrhythmias patients with such heartbeat 
irregularities are known to have a twotothreetimes greater 
chance of dying from a later heart attack than those without such 
heart arrhythmias 
half of the patients in the study were prescribed one of the 
three drugs tambocor enkaid or moricizine the other half of the 
patients were to take a placebo usually a sugar pill 
the study began in june 1987 and is still enrolling patients 
on april 17 a board monitoring the safety of the trial noted 
that of 730 patients receiving tambocor and enkaid for about 10 
months 57 died or suffered cardiac arrest while of 725 patients 
receiving placebos only 22 died of cardiac arrest

defense secretary dick cheney says he believes 
its likely that soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs reform plans 
would fail and he may be forced to change course or hand over power 
cheney told congress on tuesday that as a result the united 
states and its nato allies must resist the temptation to respond to 
gorbachevs proposals for reducing arsenals and troop strengths and 
stick to the policies it has advocated until now 
cheney testifying before the house armed services committee 
said he had watched gorbachev and had become convinced that he 
seeks change inside the soviet union but primarily because the 
soviet system has been a failure 
however i think its going to be extremely difficult for him 
to succeed and i think there is a very real likelihood that hell 
either have to reverse course or that for one reason or another 
ultimately have to resort to force perhaps in eastern europe 
perhaps in terms of dealing with the ethnic unrest inside the 
soviet union 
and of course theres always the possibility that his 
successor may arrive fairly soon and may pursue radically different 
policies than he has he said

the us fish and wildlife service has 
reversed course and decided to give the spotted owl protection as a 
threatened species 
environmentalists hope the decision will save the ancient 
forests of the northwest the timber industry says the move could 
lock up vast areas of the region to logging 
a federal judge in seattle had given the agency until monday to 
review its decision of more than a year ago not to list the owl 
under the endangered species act 
we will present a finding to the court that listing of the owl 
as a threatened species is warranted and begin steps to officially 
propose it for listing said meg durham a spokeswoman for the 
fish and wildlife service 
once the owl is proposed for listing as a threatened species a 
yearlong review will begin during which management plans for 
protection of the bird could be developed and public comment sought 
the fish and wildlife service in december 1987 refused to list 
the owl and environmental groups filed suit district court judge 
thomas zilly ruled the initial decision not to list the owl was 
arbitrary and capricious and gave the agency until may 1 to 
review its decision

a light drizzle was falling and a breeze 
blew across prince william sound when coast guard cmdr steve 
mccall radioed the grounded exxon valdez for a damage report 
ah not at the present time steve the tanker skipper 
replied in a deep slow voice 
joe hazelwood here a little problem here with the third mate 
but were working our way off the reef weve ah been holed and 
were ascertaining right now were trying just to get her off the 
reef and well get back to you as soon as we can 
two hours later the magnitude of the spill became clear to 
mccall when the tanker reported that 138000 barrels about 57 
million gallons of oil had been spilled into the water according 
to transcripts of radio conversations released tuesday 
mccall who had been roused from bed in the early morning hours 
of march 24 told hazelwood to take it slow and easy after the 
skipper said he was trying to dislodge vessel from the reef 
you know im telling you the obvious but take it slow and 
easy and were getting help out as fast as we can mccall said 
were in pretty good shape right now stabilitywise and ah 
trying to extract her off the shoal here hazelwood answered 
you can probably see me on you radar and ah once we get under 
way ill let you know do another damage control assessment 
before you make any drastic attempt to get away make sure you 
dont you know start doing any ripping said mccall you got a 
rising tide you another about an hour and a half worth of tide 
in your favor ah ah once you hit that max i wouldnt recommend 
doing much wiggling 
hazelwood responded that major damage has kind of been done 
and we kind of rock and rolled over it were just kind of hung up 
on the stern here were just ah well drift over it ah ill 
get back to you 
mccall told the associated press on tuesday that hazelwood 
didnt sound inebriated 
i perceived his voice to be that of someone stressed 
concerned about his vessel mccall said 
hazelwood is charged with operating the vessel while 
intoxicated reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of 
pollution into the water all misdemeanors 
among other developments 
the state says 112 million gallons actually spilled exxon had 
estimated it at 101 million gallons 
seas up to 15 feet and gale force winds stymied oil skimmers 
and todays forecast offered little hope of a break 
hatcheries this week released the first 62 million salmon fry 
into the sound since the spill though their fate is uncertain 
said the prince william sound aquaculture corporation 
the release was timed to coincide with the peak of flowering for 
plankton that provide food for the tiny fish 
you cant stop mother nature said heather mccarty 
spokeswoman for the nonprofit association 
the pink salmon fry which made up most of the release are due 
to return as adult fish in the summer of 1990 
two crews traveled six hours from valdez to green and seal 
islands where by thursday they will use propane cannons and 
screamer shells to scare away migratory birds stopping over on 
the oilcoated beaches 
the taped conversations between the coast guard and the tanker 
were released after a freedom of information act request from the 
anchorage daily news 
exxon said hazelwood was not on the bridge when the ship ran 
aground but had turned over the tanker to his third mate who 
wasnt licensed to steer the ship through the sound 
hazelwoods attorney dick madson says his client will return 
to alaska voluntarily perhaps as early as next week and definitely 
before a may 5 extradition hearing in new york 
mccall stopped short of endorsing hazelwoods attempt to refloat 
the tanker but said he probably used all his mariners skills 
after the ship ran aground 
not knowing whether he was stuck rocking the boat gently was an 
appropriate decision by hazelwood that probably didnt worsen the 
spill mccall said 
once he satisfied himself the vessel was going to stay there 
he shut his engines down mccall said had the ship freed itself 
from the reef it probably would have sunk he added 
judging whether hazelwoods decisions were appropriate is a 
tough shot to call from a warm office mccall said the ships 
captain is always in a better position to determine his fate than 
we are

a former fruit picker enjoyed his first 
taste of freedom today after 21 years in prison because a judge 
said perjury and prosecutorial misconduct got him convicted in the 
deaths of his seven children 
i dont feel freedom yet 53yearold james richardson said 
tuesday following an eighthour hearing in the desoto county 
courthouse where he had been sentenced to death in 1968 
i guess its going to take a while to get use to it but im 
going to keep trying to make that step 
retired circuit judge clifton kelly assigned to review the case 
by the state supreme court freed the black man who was convicted 
by an allwhite jury after agreeing with defense attorneys that 
prosecutors allowed perjured testimony and withheld evidence 
the enormity of the crime seven children poisoned to death 
is matched only by the enormity of the injustice to this man 
said kelly 
although the state has 10 days to order a retrial janet reno a 
special investigator assigned to the case said it will be closed 
richardson was released in the custody of attorney ellis rubin 
who took him to his condominium near daytona beach where a press 
conference was scheduled for this afternoon 
richardsons first wish was to eat a shrimp dinner said rubin 
after richardson was freed his wife annie mae cried on the 
courthouse lawn threw her arms up and said thank you thank 
you 
right now i feel fine richardson said within my heart i 
knew that these great men were going to get me out they werent 
going to let me stay in there 
in addition to rubin he was referring to attorney mark lane 
whose 1971 book arcadia raised questions about the conviction 
in the october 1967 poisonings 
a long and crooked path has brought us back to arcadia lane 
said and after 21 years its appropriate that it should end up 
again in arcadia 
rubin and lane accused former state attorney frank schaub of 
railroading richardson into a death sentence which was commuted to 
life in prison in 1972 they said schaub manufactured testimony 
against richardson because of shoddy investigation and a failure to 
find another suspect they said richardson was an easy target 
because he was illiterate poor and black 
schaub has filed a defamation of character lawsuit against the 
two attorneys he also accused state officials of conducting a 
hatchet job and called richardson a childkiller 
and retired judge john justice who sentenced richardson said 
as far as i am concerned a mass murderer is going to walk the 
streets 
but ms reno the dade county state attorney appointed by gov 
bob martinez to look into the case said richardson did not get a 
fair trial 
she said schaub and thenassistant state attorney john treadwell 
withheld six key pieces of exculpatory evidence that could 
have changed the outcome 
lane charged that schaub treadwell and thensheriff frank cline 
forced jail inmates and others to testify against richardson and 
suppressed evidence favorable to the defendant 
the defense also presented testimony pointing to babysitter 
bessie reece as a prime suspect ms reece 67 is in an arcadia 
nursing home suffering from alzheimers disease and is unable to 
communicate with anyone although two nurses filed affidavits last 
year that she confessed to serving the children the pesticidelaced 
food 
the children ages 2 to 8 died within hours after eating a 
lunch of grits beans rice and gravy laced with parathion which 
is now banned richardson said he and his wife were working in a 
citrus grove in the southwest florida farming community when their 
children were poisoned 
rubin told the judge that richardson deserved not only freedom 
but compensation from the state 
the governor responded mr richardson has lost too many years 
of his life in prison but my hope is that this decision will give 
him an opportunity to rebuild

profession specifically and women generally 
nightingales is one of several television programs 
criticized recently by advocacy groups 
the fox broadcasting corps marriedwith children and

on the show which premiered in january weve been beaten over 
the head with baseball bats

the crew of united flight 811 struggled with 
their crippled jetliner for eight minutes before they realized 
passengers had been swept to their deaths through a giant hole in 
the plane a transcript shows 
the transcript from the cockpit recorder was released tuesday as 
the national transportation safety board opened a threeday hearing 
into why the forward cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off 
shortly after the plane left honolulu on feb 24 nine passengers 
were killed 
eight minutes after the trouble began flight engineer mark 
thomas returned to the cockpit after inspecting the damage 
the right side is gone its just open youre just lookin 
outside thomas told pilot david cronin and copilot al slader 
looks like a bomb he said 
fuselage slader asked 
yes fuselage its just open thomas said some people 
are probably gone i dont know 
six seconds of silence followed then the crew frantically 
discussed flying the plane 
at the hearing boeing engineer james fitzgerald testified that 
the 747s 800pound cargo doors are safe 
but pan am engineer robert dann told of a 1987 incident in which 
a 747 cargo door partially opened on a flight out of london 
forcing the jetliner to return to the airport 
more than a dozen times during the past six years boeing 747s 
turned back in flight because of indications that a cargo bay door 
was open federal investigators said 
there has been speculation the cargo door might have broken free 
when the latching mechanism failed after the united accident the 
federal aviation administration ordered all us airlines to 
reinforce the relatively lightweight aluminum latch mechanisms with 
steel 
the plane was bound for sydney australia with 337 passengers 
and a crew of 18 when the accident occurred 
the transcript showed the crew worried about staying airborne 
boosted each others spirits during the harrowing 25minute return 
to honolulu 
minutes into the flight at 209 am hst pilot cronin asked 
what the expletive was that 
i dont know replied slader of langley va 
a loud bang is heard power to the recording unit then was 
interrupted for 21 seconds before an alarm horn is heard 
goin down cronin said followed by emergency descent 
i think we blew a door or something slader said seconds 
later 
the crew shut down the damaged no 3 engine and thomas of 
albany ind began dumping fuel 
at 213 cronin of incline village nev said i think we 
might have some damage out there 
we got a control problem here cronin said seconds later 
at 214 he noted a problem with the no 4 engine and the crew 
discussed flying the massive plane on just two engines 
can you maintain 240 knots slader asked 
yeah just barely cronin replied 
yeah but were losing altitude slader said 
i know it cronin said 
then at 216 cronin announced he had no fuel flow to no 4 
engine

us sen dave durenberger says his 
investigation by the senate ethics committee concerning a lucrative 
book contract is leftover from his reelection bid and will come to 
nothing 
the only reason theres an investigation is because in the 
middle of my campaign a bunch of democratic lawyers decided they 
wanted to make an issue out of something that was old news the 
minnesota republican said and the ethics committee has to 
follow up the investigation 
durenberger confirmed tuesday that the committee was 
investigating a complaint that he laundered 100000 in 
speaking fees in a deal with piranha press for books written under 
his name on defense and health issues 
the deal appeared similar to the one that landed house speaker 
jim wright in political hot water but the senate investigation has 
no connection with the houses queries into allegations against the 
texas democrat 
mine was a legal arrangement durenberger said this 
coincides with jim wright so it gets to be a little more news i 
cant imagine that there will be any consequences at all 
a group of minnesota attorneys many of whom are democratic 
officeholders or party activists filed a complaint in september 
with the ethics committee about the bookpublishing deal 
durenberger had abandoned the arrangement more than a year earlier 
in the face of criticism 
the complaint alleges that durenberger collected about 100000 
in personal income by circumventing the senates selfimposed limit 
on speaking fees it alleges he redefined his audiences with 
various interest groups as promotional appearances for the sale 
of his books 
the money from those appearances went to a publisher and then 
back to durenberger 
senators are paid 89500 a year and they can keep up to 40 
percent more in speaking fees or 35800 for 1987 durenberger 
reported an income range of 147456 163550 with honoraria of 
50050 of which 15350 was given to charity 
in the wright case the house ethics committee has voted to 
charge the speaker with using his book publishing contract to evade 
the limits on outside income the committee said wright encouraged 
groups to buy his book reflections of a public man instead of 
paying him a normal speaking fee 
durenberger or his staff members have said the senator cleared 
his bookpromotion arrangement with the federal election 
commission the complaint alleges that the senator may have 
misrepresented the exact nature of the deal to the commission 
the complaint was filed during durenbergers campaign to retain 
his seat against a bid by democratic state attorney general hubert 
h humphrey iii humphrey campaign manager joe tessmer acknowledged 
in september that the campaign provided information to help the 
lawyers group prepare the complaint 
durenberger said members of his staff have been interviewed by 
the ethics committee and said he expects to meet with the 
committee an official for the committee would not confirm or deny 
any investigation

police said they found no witnesses to 
verify a report by tv host morton downey jr that he was attacked 
in an airport bathroom by skinheads who painted swastikas on him 
and tried to shave his hair 
as police tuesday continued an investigation of the incident 
kofytv owner jim gabbert said he would cancel local broadcast of 
downeys show if police find the tale was concocted as a publicity 
stunt 
downey responded to reports that his claim could not be 
substantiated saying he would have to be bordering on a little 
bit of insanity to have made up the attack 
downey 56 was in san francisco to promote his show when he 
said he was attacked in a restroom at san francisco international 
airport by someone who put his arm around my throat and his other 
hand across my eyes and dragged me to a stall he said 
they sat me down on the toilet one guy sat on me and another 
one started cutting my hair said the bombastic program host 
known for his arrogant aggressive style 
about the time downey said he was assaulted a bomb threat 
forced kofy to leave the air during the time slot for the 
syndicated series the show returned to the air after about 30 
minutes 
downey said that the assault story is true but cannot be 
verified because police were not in the bathroom where he was 
jumped 
you can listen to all the other stories of people who werent 
there but thats fine said downey in an interview with 
wwortv in secaucus nj where he returned later tuesday 
police at san francisco international said they were 
investigating the incident reported to them at 1130 pm monday 
what hes claiming doesnt appear to be the case at all 
airport spokesman ron wilson said we have not yet been able to 
confirm any of the statements mr downey made 
authorities found no evidence of skinheads in the area he added 
downey was cleanly dressed when spotted later in a limousine at 
the airport and showed no signs of being in a scuffle said wilson 
scissors and a marking pen were found in the restroom but no 
physical signs of a fight were present he said 
in an interview with the san francisco examiner downey 
displayed swastikas scrawled across his face shirt and pants his 
right eye was bloodshot and bruised his head partially cut 
downey said he believed his assailants to be skinheads young 
white supremacists with shaved heads who have been reviled on his 
television show he said his music director david lloyd pulled 
him from the stall where the attack reportedly occurred and helped 
him out of the building 
in an interview with kofy while en route to new jersey downey 
said i said to david lets get the hell out of here i dont 
want to make a big deal out of this i dont want any geraldotype 
pictures taken 
he apparently was referring to published photos of a bloodied 
geraldo rivera after a scuffle on his tv show

voters cast ballots today to fill 
wyomings lone seat in the us house of representatives vacated 
when dick cheney was nominated defense secretary 
the 40day campaign often turned negative with the two 
frontrunners democrat john vinich and republican craig thomas 
engaging in heated exchanges 
the special election was watched by both national parties the 
republicans hoped to salvage some pride after earlier this year 
losing special elections in indiana and alabama democratics hoped 
for a sweep with a vinich victory 
officials predict turnout will be about 65 percent of registered 
voters slightly lower than normal 
some voters had had enough of the campaign 
its negative its dirty its sleazy cheyenne resident 
lee foster said of the gop campaign that called into question 
vinichs integrity and the democratic portrayal of thomas as a gop 
pawn 
appearing on the ballot as independents were craig mccune a 
cheyenne railroad engineer who collected just 1900 votes when he 
ran for the house seat as a libertarian last november and daniel 
johnson a white separatist who moved from california to wyoming in 
midmarch 
neither mccune nor johnson were expected to gain many votes 
although the casper startribune wyomings largest newspaper 
endorsed mccune because of the assassination politics displayed 
by vinich and thomas 
in the last 10 days polling by the democrats and republicans 
showed a slight trend toward thomas 
vinich has been campaigning for 19 months beginning when he 
entered a race for us sen malcolm wallops seat he narrowly 
lost and then won the democratic nomination for cheneys seat 
thomas 56 is general manager of the wyoming rural electric 
association who was elected in november to his third term in the 
legislature vinich 38 is a restaurant and bar owner who has 
spent the last 15 years in the legislature 
at one point in the race the national republican congressional 
committee seemed on the verge of torpedoing its own mans campaign 
ed rollins a highpaid strategist hired to reverse gop 
fortunes played into vinichs hands by declaring that he was 
calling the shots for thomas 
wyoming is something ive had hands on since day one said 
rollins 
vinich used the comments to charge that thomas didnt control 
his campaign but the democrats had their share of mistakes the 
bulk of vinichs campaign contributions came from outofstate 
labor groups thomas then portrayed the democrat as beholden to 
organized labor with little wyoming support 
vinich also attacked thomas for being soft on crime because 
of a legislative vote the republican cast in favor of a 
splitsentencing bill but the bill was opposed by only two 
legislators and even former gov ed herschler a highly popular 
democrat disagreed with vinichs position

nearly 75 percent of american indian college 
students dont earn degrees because of poor academic preparation 
inadequate financial aid or personal problems according to a 
survey 
the simple truth is most native americans and their families 
do not have the financial resources required to pay their 
college bills concluded the study the forgotten minority 
native americans in higher education by robert n wells jr a 
professor of government at st lawrence university in canton 
the survey conducted by mail in august included responses from 
33 two and fouryear institutions with at least 4 percent american 
indian enrollment 
it found that graduation rates had improved slightly during the 
1980s thanks primarily to better minority counseling and support 
systems on some campuses 
but the study concluded that retention and graduation rates 
remain disturbingly low it found that 273 percent of american 
indian students entering college earned degrees but more than half 
drop out in their freshman year 
according to federal statistics 201 percent of american indian 
college students from the high school class of 1980 earned either 
bachelors degrees or twoyear associate degrees 
fiftyfive percent of all students in fouryear private schools 
and 46 percent of fouryear public college students eventually earn 
bachelors degrees according to federal figures 
some 91000 of the 125 million students in us colleges are 
american indians or alaskan natives according to latest us 
department of education figures 
the average cost of attending the schools in the survey was 
5400 but the average financial aid grant was 1531 per student 
that leaves at least a 3000 unmet need for each american indian 
student 
in an interview wells also cited lack of indian faculty at the 
institutions surveyed there were an average of nine such teachers 
at the colleges surveyed at his own institution st lawrence 
there are three indians on the staff but none are classroom 
teachers he said 
on the positive side nearly half the schools surveyed 16 had 
teacher training programs tailored for american indians 
the colleges cited four culprits hindering american indian 
college students inadequate academic preparation difficulty 
adjusting to the college environment personal and family problems 
and financial difficulties 
some of the personal problems include lack of family support 
homesickness substance abuse and inadequate transportation the 
survey found 
without solid support system on campus the native american 
student will often split before the academic financial or personal 
problem is addressed it said

new federal tax laws and the 1987 stock market 
crash put the squeeze on gifts to colleges and universities with 
contributions declining in 198788 for the first time in 13 years 
the boomy days appear to be over on campus as on wall 
street concluded an annual survey released tuesday by the 
council for aid to education 
it estimated that gifts to higher education totaled 82 billion 
in the 198788 school year down 35 percent from the 85 billion 
the previous year 
it was only the third yeartoyear decline since the council 
began the survey in 195455 said spokesman paul r miller 
but council officials noted the decline followed two years of 
explosive growth in contributions when alumni giving increased by 
25 percent a year 
the increases we have been logging over the past decade 
averaging some 12 percent annually just could not be sustained 
indefinitely said john r haire the councils president 
haire said donors apparently decided to make major gifts before 
jan 1 1987 anticipating changes in federal tax law that made 
charitable contributions less advantageous 
the october 1987 stock market collapse further depressed the 
level of contributions haire said 
the council said it did not expect a quick return to 
doubledigit annual increases 
alumni giving in 198788 totaled 204 billion down 13 percent 
from the previous years 234 billion nonalumni contributions 
were 193 billion off 67 percent from 204 billion 
corporate giving totaled 185 billion up 19 percent from 
182 billion a year ago foundation support rose 62 percent from 
15 billion to 16 billion religious organizations donated 197 
million 34 percent less than the 204 million a year earlier and 
contributions from other sources totaled 574 million up 4 percent 
from 552 million in 198687 
the survey results were based on data gathered from 1142 
colleges and universities accounting for about 85 percent of all 
private gifts received by higher education institutions

the foreign office said today that iran has 
expelled or refused to readmit 18 britons in apparent retaliation 
for britains expulsion of 18 iranians in the dispute over salman 
rushdies the satanic verses 
a foreign office spokesman said britain has formally protested 
the iranian move through the swedish embassy in tehran 
sweden began looking after british interests in iran when iran 
broke diplomatic ties with london on march 7 after britain refused 
to ban rushdies novel moslem clerics say the book blasphemes 
islam 
irans spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini told 
moslems on feb 14 to kill rushdie for writing the novel 
rushdie an indianborn british citizen has been in hiding 
since khomeinis threat which was backed by the offer of a 52 
million bounty from two iranian moslem clergymen 
the foreign office spokesman who in accordance with british 
practice declined to be named said irans deadline for the britons 
to leave expired tuesday and some were already back in britain 
we first heard something was happening on april 19 the 
spokesman said 
as we understand it some of the 18 were people who were in 
britain at the time they were expelled and are simply not being 
allowed to return 
they appear to have been a pretty random crosssection of the 
britons who are there some of them were longterm residents some 
were businessmen some were academics a whole crosssection 
we have told iran through the swedish embassy that the action 
is completely unjustified 
he could not say what official reason iran had given for its 
action over the 18 britons 
prime minister margaret thatchers government said when it 
announced the expulsion of the 18 iranians that they were perceived 
as a security threat several of the 18 expelled iranians were 
classified as students in britain who also worked at the iranian 
embassy in london

guilty pleas by two men accused of 
smuggling illegal animal drugs should serve as a warning to farmers 
and veterinarians who consider using unapproved chemicals 
government spokesmen said 
dr robert clack a veterinarian from pittsfield ill and 
heinz dall an importer from ossining ny each pleaded guilty to 
two felonies in a hearing before us district judge david hansen 
on tuesday 
clack pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and another of 
making a false statement dall pleaded guilty to a conspiracy 
charge and another stemming from the importing of the illegal drug 
chloramphenicol 
both face up to 10 years in prison dall could be fined more 
than 500000 and clack up to 260000 
seventeen additional charges against clack and a dozen 
additional charges against dall will be dismissed when the men are 
sentenced july 18 
clack dall and a third man who previously pleaded guilty were 
charged in november with conspiring to ship tons of outlawed drugs 
from canada to animal feed manufacturers veterinarians and 
sometimes directly to farmers throughout the midwest 
these three were among the largest people involved in the 
black market trade said prosecutor henry lahaie a justice 
department lawyer 
two of the 16 drugs involved are prohibited for use on any 
animal being raised for food in the united states and three other 
drugs are prohibited in hogs or cattle because of their toxicity 
the government said four others are carcinogens and one 
chloramphenicol is a powerful antibiotic that has been linked to 
aplastic anemia a leukemialike blood disorder 
the antibiotics are mixed with feed to prevent the spread of 
disease in animals 
clack dall and jeffery engel president and general manager of 
the now defunct custom feed blenders of fort dodge were accused of 
masterminding a scheme to truck tons of the untested improperly 
packaged or illegal veterinary drugs into the united states from 
canada camouflaging the cargo in truckloads of wood chips or 
furniture 
engel who earlier pleaded guilty to three counts will be 
sentenced aug 25 he faces a maximum of 10 years in jail and a 
fine of up to 750000 as part of their pleas all three also 
agreed to cooperate with the government in future prosecutions 
against other illegal importers 
farmers and veterinarians who used the drugs will not be 
charged lahaie said but he said the case should be a warning to 
them to use only approved drugs 
i think most of them are lawabiding and theyll straighten 
up he said 
richard teske deputy director of the center for veterinary 
medicine at the food and drug administration in rockville md 
said the guilty pleas were a mixed blessing 
i think a trial would have provided a good deal of focus and 
public attention on this issue so well lose some of that he 
said but you never know what a jury is going to do 
he said he hopes the pleas would send a signal to farmers and 
others who might be tempted to avoid higher prices of fda approved 
drugs 
we think its important for people to understand the dangers 
of using drugs that are essentially untried and not subjected to 
the quality control process of those approved by the fda teske 
said

doctors removed the lens of the left eye 
from the 5yearold victim of last weeks k mart bombing but they 
refused to speculate on whether she would regain at least partial 
vision in the eye 
erin bower remained in satisfactory condition after tuesdays 
twohour operation at methodist hospital where she has been since 
the april 17 bombing at a k mart store most of her left hand was 
blown off and her eye ripped open when she picked up a pump 
toothpaste container and detonated a concealed pipe bomb filled 
with gunpowder and bb shot 
the lens had to be removed to avoid inflammation and further 
damage said john minturn an eye specialist who operated on erin 
the lens is located behind the iris and focuses light toward the 
back of the eye 
the blood that was within the left eye is showing signs of 
dispersing minturn said 
still well need time and further healing to decide and see 
how much vision shell recover he added 
the loss of a lens may require her to wear a corrective lens 
if her eye has some potential vision in it possibly a contact 
lens would correct the loss of the normal lens minturn said at a 
hospital news conference 
investigators said tuesday that a woman who telephoned the k 
mart to apologize for the bombing likely was not involved 
the kind of statements she made could really be made by 
anybody said detective earl k cooper of the marion county 
sheriffs department 
of more than 400 calls received by authorities mondays call 
was the first confessing to the bombing investigators said 
investigators have concentrated their search on two men seen 
leaving the store moments after the blast one of those men they 
believe might have bought bb shot at the same k mart three days 
before the explosion

vanderbilt univeristy researchers plan 
to proceed with adrenal tissue transplants to treat parkinsons 
disease even though only four of its 18 transplant patients showed 
distinct improvement 
the university performed the nations first adrenal tissue 
transplant in april 1987 hospital officials in december announced 
a clinical trial of 240 parkinsons patients half of whom would 
undergo the surgery to determine the transplants benefits 
early results are expected to be published next week in the 
archives of neurology the publication follows a recent american 
academy of neurology report urging great caution before 
largescale human studies of the procedure are launched 
an estimated 100 adrenal tissue transplants have been performed 
in the united states 
parkinsons disease which afflicts an estimated 15 million 
americans is marked by trembling and muscular rigidity and is 
caused by degeneration of the basel ganglia of the brain 
vanderbilt neurosurgeon noel tulipan agreed doctors should move 
slowly 
i think a lot of people started doing this operation without 
having the vaguest idea what they were doing the result is we 
still dont know what the real benefits of the operation are and 
thats the real reason for us to do the study were doing he 
said 
the surgery involves removing one of the patients adrenal 
glands on the upper part of the kidney and grafting the adrenal 
medulla or inner core from the gland into a specific nucleus of 
the brain 
based on the four patients who showed improvement researchers 
have been unable to determine which patients are more likely to 
benefit from the operation 
the parkinsons trial under way at vanderbilt will help 
determine which if any patients suffering from the crippling 
disorder will benefit from the operation tulipan said 
vanderbilt researchers led by dr george s allen chairman of 
neurosurgery reported improvements that lasted for at least one 
year in patients with mild as well as severe parkinsons 
the 18 patients ages 35 to 69 were followed up at either six 
or 12 months tulipan said no patient worsened because of the 
operation one patient died from a heart attack unrelated to the 
transplant he said 
the reasons for the improvements are unknown but tulipan said 
researchers concluded that older patients with existing cognitive 
impairment should not undergo the operation until further study 
they also hope patients who did improve during the followup 
period may still benefit from the transplant 
none of the four patients showing improvements was cured 
tulipan said 
its not as if their shaking has stopped or any of their other 
symptoms have been cured he said its just that they are 
somewhat better 
the neurology academy said the positive results from the 
transplants have been less dramatic than those originally reported 
by mexican researchers who first attempted the operation 
they reported in the new england journal of medicine in 1987 
that two patients who had undergone the procedure had shown 
impressive results

syrian gunners blasted the christian 
enclaves coastline with sporadic artillery and rocket fire today 
as the arab league began talks on ways to halt lebanons 
14yearold civil war 
police said the bombardment aimed to keep closed the only escape 
route for about 1 million christians trapped in the enclave north 
of beirut 
there were no reports of casualties in the shelling that 
targeted a 10mile coastal stretch between jounieh and byblos 
by police count at least 272 people have been killed and 991 
wounded since the current fighting broke out march 8 
army commander gen michel aouns 20000 mostly christian troops 
are pitted against an alliance of syrian forces and druse warlord 
walid jumblatts progressive socialist party militiamen 
two cypriotflagged ferry boats survived shelling by syrian and 
druse fighters over the the past five weeks to evacuate more than 
13000 christians from the port of jounieh 
but sailings by the larnaca rose and the baroness m were 
suspended monday by aoun so that a french navy tanker could unload 
6000 tons of fuel needed to reactivate power plants 
power was restored in beirut tuesday for two hours a day ending 
a 10day blackout caused by lack of fuel at the main power plants 
in christian and moslem areas of the divided capital 
shipping officials in larnaca cyprus said it was not known when 
ferry service to jounieh would be resumed 
an arab league mediation committee began discussions tuesday 
night in tunisia on a peace plan for lebanon that would include 
sending a multination observer force of at least 200 arab officers 
to monitor a ceasefire 
according to kuwaiti foreign minister sheik sabah alahmed 
alsabah head of the committee lebanons parliament would then 
elect a new president who would form a national unity government 
committed to political reform 
the plan was to be presented today to an emergency foreign 
ministers session of the 22member arab league at its tunis 
headquarters 
lebanons parliament failed to elect a successor to president 
amin gemayel before his 6year term ended last september minutes 
before he stepped down gemayel named aoun a maronite catholic 
like himself as head of an interim military cabinet to rule 
pending election of a new head of state 
but moslems and leftists rejected the appointment and pledged 
allegiance to the mostly moslem cabinet of acting prime minister 
salim hoss a syrianbacked sunni moslem who governed under gemayel 
the rival cabinets struggle for power has split the army and 
threatens to formalize lebanons de facto partition into sectarian 
cantons 
aoun has approved sending an arab observer force as a first 
step toward ending the fighting but stressed that the ultimate 
objective remains ending the syrian and israeli occupation of 
lebanese territory 
israel occupies a strip of territory in south lebanon as a 
buffer against crossborder attacks by palestinian guerrillas 
syria maintains 40000 troops in moslem areas of northern eastern 
and central lebanon as well as west beirut under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
shiite moslem militia leader nabih berri a major syrian ally 
rejected the proposal for an arab observer force saying we need 
them to help us politically we dont need more armies 
his statements were seen as a proxy rejection of the arab league 
plan by syria which considers lebanon its own backyard

the espionage case against an fbi agent 
whose romance with a soviet spy led to his imprisonment on two life 
terms will be pursued the prosecutor said after a court reversed 
the conviction 
we may reappeal and we have other means us attorney 
robert bonner of los angeles said apparently referring to requests 
for appeals court rehearing or supreme court review if those 
fail we will retry the case 
bonner who headed the prosecution in the case said he would 
weigh his options after reading tuesdays decision by the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals overturning richard millers conviction 
miller whose 1986 conviction for spying rested heavily on the 
results of his lie detector test was granted a new trial after the 
court said such evidence should not have been allowed he is the 
only fbi agent ever convicted of spying 
the court said us district judge david kenyon wrongly allowed 
prosecution witnesses to relate the questions miller was asked by a 
polygraph examiner the answers he gave and the examiners 
conclusion that he was probably lying 
miller a 20year fbi veteran was charged with furnishing a 
classified document to the soviet union in return for a promise of 
65000 in cash and gold he was sentenced to two life terms plus 
50 years in prison 
his attorney joel levine said he was pleased by tuesdays 
decision but that the victory comes a little late for miller 
we would be more pleased if we didnt have to wait almost five 
years for a fair trial with a client in custody referring to the 
time miller has spent behind bars since his arrest 
another defense lawyer stanley greenberg said they would seek 
to have miller released on bail pending a new trial he said miller 
is in the federal prison in rochester minn 
the ruling that miller did not have a fair trial should come 
as no surprise to any fair and impartial observer of the miller 
proceedings greenberg said the prosecution brought to this 
case an endjustifiesthemeans mentality that i have never before 
witnessed in a court of law 
the polygraph evidence bolstered the credibility of millers 
later admissions of wrongdoing the heart of the prosecutions 
case said judge dorothy nelson in the 30 decision 
the court like most others in the united states has 
consistently refused to allow liedetector results as evidence of 
truthfulness because of doubts about the devices reliability 
nelson also said kenyon had made other errors including 
allowing testimony by a government witness identified as an expert 
on soviet recruiting methods to be used to attack millers 
character 
miller was convicted in june 1986 of passing secrets to the 
soviets through his lover svetlana ogorodnikova a soviet 
immigrant whom he had met in 1984 she and her husband nikolay 
ogorodnikov pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage and 
are serving prison terms 
miller was charged with furnishing a classified document that 
sets forth annual us intelligence needs to his lover for delivery 
to the soviet consulate in san francisco in august 1984 
he claimed to be playing along with the soviets in an 
unauthorized attempt to infiltrate their us spy network his 
lawyers portrayed him as a wellmeaning fbi misfit who dreamed of 
redeeming his career but prosecutors pictured him as a bitter 
vengeful failure easily recruited as a spy

students said today that government threats to 
suppress the largest student movement in communist chinas history 
have only increased their resolve to make the countrys leaders 
embrace democratic reforms 
student leaders said a class boycott that began monday has 
spread to 41 universities and colleges around beijing involving 
more than 70000 students at least four more schools joined the 
protest today they said 
two protest leaders said students were ready to stage street 
demonstrations again as they did when they began their campaign 10 
days ago 
chinese leader deng xiaoping on tuesday ordered authorities to 
crack down on the protest said a journalist at the peoples daily 
the voice of the ruling communist party 
the peasants support us the workers support us the army 
supports us so why should we be bothered by students the 
journalist quoted the 84yearold deng as saying 
his remarks prompted the peoples daily to publish a harsh 
editorial that called the student movement a planned conspiracy 
aimed at overthrowing the government the editorial said further 
protests would be forbidden 
the countrys major newspapers and radio stations carried the 
editorial and millions of communist party members met to discuss 
it and to prepare for the crackdown 
more than 1000 party members met in beijing and resolutely 
condemned the illegal student activities said the beijing city 
television news 
the beijing daily meanwhile published an order from the city 
government telling students to disband their illegal unions 
most of the unions were formed last week after students in beijing 
voted down the official student organizations which are set up by 
university officials 
about 10000 troops from the 38th army a special force for 
suppressing civic disturbances have taken up positions in 
buildings near university campuses students and chinese sources 
said 
student leaders pledged to defy the government and said they 
were ready to go back to the streets to protest if the government 
does not heed their demands for negotiations 
if the government does not agree to a dialogue we will march 
in the streets said beijing university student leader wang dan 
at a meeting attended by 2000 students at the political science 
and law college that is our right we will take the movement to 
the people 
since early last week tens of thousands of students have been 
agitating for fundamental changes in chinas political system 
including a free press and publication of the financial records of 
chinas leaders 
they have also called for the resignations of deng and of 
premier li peng 
we will only develop into a strong country when we respect 
human rights and allow the people more freedom said one student 
at qinghua university weve had an emperor for too long what we 
need is a president 
students at several universities said they were outraged by the 
editorial and accused the staterun press of distorting facts 
the editorial is rubbish it is filled with lies and it 
insults the students wuer kaixi a student leader from beijing 
normal university told the crowd at the political science and law 
college 
the editorial accused the students of trying to overthrow the 
government and insinuated their movement in beijing was connected 
to violence last week in xian and changsha two provincial capitals 
last week crowds of youths entered the ranks of protesting 
students and went on rampages in changsha and xian looting stores 
burning automobiles and buildings and beating policemen 
the disturbances received prominent play in the chinese press as 
the government sought to associate them with the largely peaceful 
protests in beijing 
the media has remained largely silent about protests friday and 
saturday in beijing when more than 150000 students and their 
supporters spent the night at tiananmen square to call for 
democracy and commemorate the death of ousted communist party 
leader hu yaobang 
hu a relatively liberal politician was purged in 1987 for not 
cracking down hard enough on prodemocracy protests 
the peaceful protest was one of the largest in communist chinas 
40year history and to date the clearest rejection by chinas youth 
of the system

an aide who served prime minister noboru takeshita 
for 31 years and handled scandaltainted donations that helped sink 
takeshitas career committed suicide today 
police said ihei aoki 58 who had served takeshita since 1958 
was found dead at his apartment in tokyo he had slashed a wrist 
and an ankle with a razor and hanged himself they said and he 
left notes to his wife and several other people including the 
prime minister 
takeshita appeared shocked by the death he told reporters he 
had not seen aokis note but thought it was possible the suicide 
was linked to the longrunning recruit scandal 
i strongly regret his action we walked side by side for 
over 30 years said takeshita who announced tuesday he would 
resign soon to take responsibility for his and his partys 
involvement in the scandal 
aokis name rather than takeshitas appeared on loans and 
share dealings with the recruit co that now are under suspicion 
both for political ethics and bribery the company an information 
services conglomerate is accused of trying to buy influence with 
politicians bureaucrats business leaders and media executives 
prosecutors had questioned aoki several times so far 14 people 
face charges in the recruit scandal but none of them is a 
politician or political aide like aoki 
last weekend news reports said aoki had accepted a 384000 
loan from the recruit co in 1987 when takeshita was campaigning 
to succeed yasuhiro nakasone as prime minister the money which 
was paid back was said to have been used in the campaign 
the revelation of the loan embarrassed takeshita because he did 
not include it in a report to parliament on april 11 when he said 
he had received more than 1 million in legal political donations 
from recruit the loan forced him to change his account of his 
involvement with the controversial company and two days later 
takeshita announced his decision to resign 
takeshita did not blame aoki in his departure statement but 
news reports monday said he had not known of the loan at the time 
he spoke to parliament because his aide had not informed him of it 
until saturday 
in 1976 a driver who had carried bribery cash committed suicide 
after the emergence of the lockheed scandal that led to former 
prime minister kakuei tanakas conviction of bribery 
meanwhile political factions in the governing liberal 
democratic party were consulting about a successor to takeshita 
who said he would not leave office until parliament passes the 1989 
budget likely some time next month 
the most frequently mentioned candidate was masayoshi ito 75 a 
former foreign minister who has appeared reluctant to take up the 
post at a time of political crisis he said tuesday the post should 
go to a younger person 
the yomiuri shimbun newspaper reported today that ito was the 
choice agreed upon at meetings late tuesday between takeshita and 
other party leaders 
the daily asahi shimbun said a majority of governing party 
members judged ito as the only appropriate candidate because he is 
untainted by the scandal 
the recruit co is accused of seeking influence and favors by 
selling prelisted shares in a subsidiary at bargain prices to 
politicians bureaucrats business leaders and media executives 
takeshita through aoki and a relative was a recipient of such 
shares which skyrocketed in value after they went on sale to the 
public in late 1986 
profits from selling the shares reportedly went into political 
funds not only takeshitas but nakasones and those of other top 
leaders of the liberal democrats 
aoki received 2000 of the shares which yielded a profit of 
about 30000 
the wide swath of recruits donations loans and share 
transactions cut through the political leadership have made it 
difficult for the liberal democrats to find a replacement for 
takeshita 
itos age and health he is a diabetic make most observers 
consider him an interim choice who would serve for a few months 
while the party chooses a longerterm leader the head of the 
liberal democrats becomes prime minster because of the partys big 
majority in parliament

widespread rioting that began over 
a land dispute between mauritania and senegal has left at least 26 
people dead and 675 injured hospital sources said today 
the sources said they only knew about casualties taken to the 
main public hospital of nouakchott the mauritanian capital 
violence also has occurred in dakar senegals capital and in 
many other cities and towns in the two neighborhing west african 
countries but there has been no reliable word on the number of 
casualties outside nouakchott 
on tuesday mauritanian officials began airlifting their 
countrymen out of dakar to avoid further violence 
the hospital sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
they had no breakdown of how many of the dead and injured were 
senegalese and how many mauritanian they said 20 of the injured 
were in serious condition 
violence has been spreading for two weeks since a border 
incident set off rising tensions over competing claims by 
senegalese and mauritanians to farm areas along the senegal river 
which forms the border between the two nations 
the streets of nouakchott were calm today on tuesday police 
rushed through the streets of the sandblown capital of 500000 
people and broke up crowds who roamed the poor quarters and 
occasionally surged onto the citys main streets to attack 
senegalese and sometimes wreck or burn shops 
an 8 pm to 6 am curfew remained in effect in nouakchott and 
nouadihbou maurianias main port 
in dakar 375 miles to the south mauritanian ambassador mokhtar 
ould zamal said 100 mauritanian men and women had been airlifted 
out of the city tuesday 
officials at the mauritanian consulate speaking on condition of 
anonymity said thousands more mauritanians had taken refuge at the 
main mosque in dakar 
antimauritanian violence was not quelled in the senegalese 
capital until 4 am tuesday after the army was called out and 
police fired tear gas 
both countries have reinforced their troops along the senegal 
river as tensions mounted over the land dispute 
both nations have tried to calm tensions since mauritanian 
soldiers allegedly killed two senegalese farmers in senegals 
diawara border village april 9 at least two people have died in 
violence in senegal since then 
sporadic violence against mauritanian shopkeepers in dakar and 
senegalese in nouakchott grew into widespread fighting on sunday 
mauritania straddles arab north and black west africa 
twothirds of its 2 million people are moors of arabberber 
extraction the rest are black mostly from the southern river 
region nearly all of senegals 7 million people are black 
the dispute concerns the right of senegalese to farm on a 
senegal river island even before the colonial period the black 
toucouleur people farmed both sides of the senegal river after 
both countries became independent from france in 1960 senegalese 
toucouleur continued to farm the mauritanian side they had 
considered their own for generations 
moors to the north traditionally nomadic herders did not farm 
but the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up 
new farmland and spurred mauritanian interest in agriculture all 
along the border senegalese are being forced off the land

a wary state board of education has 
endorsed a 10year plan for boston university to run the school 
system in impoverished chelsea 
the boards 74 vote tuesday followed hours of passionate 
argument chelsea officials and parents hailed bu as the citys 
rescuer teachers and hispanic groups protested that the plan runs 
roughshod over constitutional rights 
in giving its approval the board attached strings to make bu 
more accountable to the public 
chelsea is a downattheheels city of 26000 north of boston 
with a large proportion of immigrants and the elderly teacher 
salaries are low as are test scores and the high school dropout 
rate of 17 percent is among the states highest 
the takeover plan which calls for bu to pump in millions of 
dollars in donations and the knowhow of its faculty and students 
is subject to approval by the legislature but that is considered 
virtually certain 
boston university represents a hope a dream for us chelsea 
school committee member bruce henderson pleaded during the board 
meeting here 
boston university is our salvation said parentteacher 
association leader rosemary carlisle 
but juan vega of the chelsea commission on hispanic affairs 
complained that bu and city officials ignored requests for more 
information and a spanish translation of the plan 
others raised fears that bu would do away with bilingual 
education in the school system where about half the 3300 students 
come from homes of hispanic origin 
teachers unions are fighting the plan in court as 
unconstitutional 
in its action tuesday the board said the legislature should 
make bu hold open meetings and make records available to the 
public if bu rejects this the board said the legislature should 
make the legislation expire in two years 
gov michael dukakis said his opinion of the plan depends on 
the terms and conditions

the isolated mountain home of jack blevins 
had electricity this morning for the first time in his 69 years 
three months after volunteers began negotiating to get a power 
company to bend its rules 
its somethin aint it blevins said after the power came 
on tuesday afternoon 
blevins lives in a north carolina mountain cove 200 yards from 
the virginia line 
the only nearby utility appalachian power co in virginia has 
a policy against selling electricity across state lines but it 
agreed last month to route the sale through a north carolina 
electric cooperative 
the volunteers who negotiated the arrangement celebrated with 
blevins by crowding into the cabin they had built for him and 
switching on all the lights the donated television and the donated 
refrigerator at the same time 
caseworkers with the blue ridge opportunity commission 
discovered blevins last fall living with his nowdeceased 
73yearold brother tom in a wooden house with gaps in the walls 
large enough to walk through 
since there was no road the volunteers reached the house by 
easing vehicles along an abandoned railroad bed and across a series 
of rickety trestles high over big horse creek 
workmen from appalachian power ambled toward the cabin from the 
virginia state line to see if all was working properly 
blevins stuck his head out the door and grinned 
come on in he said the power got here before you did

the chairman and ranking republican on the 
senate armed services committee today gave defense secretary dick 
cheney high marks for crafting cuts in the pentagon budget but 
expressed concerns about some of the specific reductions 
sens sam nunn dga and john warner rva commented a day 
after cheney outlined planned reductions delays and cuts totaling 
10 billion before the house armed services committee the savings 
were required to meet the fiscal 1990 budget level of 2956 
billion for the defense department agreed upon by the white house 
and congress 
i think defense secretary cheney and president bush stepped up 
to the plate and made some tough decisions here under very rough 
circumstances nunn said on abcs good morning america 
but he said he is very concerned about the decision to 
scrap the marine corps v22 osprey a battlefield aircraft 
designed to take off like a helicopter but fly like an airplane 
that has very strong implications for future commercial 
aviation as well as for the military nunn said 
the pentagon had hoped to spend 259 billion on 663 ospreys 
including 13 billion in 1990 cheney called the decision to drop 
it his most difficult 
warner interviewed with nunn gave cheney very high marks 
and added i think were going to follow the bushcheney plan 
very closely 
however warner a former secretary of the navy said he is 
concerned about heavy cuts falling on that service 
im concerned about our deployments beyond the united states 
where our young men in many instances and now women aboard ship 
have to be gone for six and seven months and the stress that puts 
on families he said 
if the strategic assessment bush has promised to send congress 
the first week in may tells us we can cut back on some of those 
deployments abroad and the time then i think the impact is 
somewhat less severe warner said 
navy cuts outlined by cheney included retiring the coral sea 
one of the last two world war iiera aircraft carriers 
transferring to the reserves 10 frigates retiring seven 
destroyers canceling production of the f14d fighter and 
scrubbing the purchase of the last los angelesclass nuclear attack 
submarine 
cheney also got a generally approving reaction from the house 
armed services committee during his daylong presentation tuesday 
now theres much in what you presented that i dont like some 
of which i disagree with but im willing to buy it as a package 
rep bill dickinson of alabama ranking republican on the 
committee told cheney 
among cheneys proposals were a reduction for the army navy and 
air force in activeduty strength of more than 21 million by 
16800 men and women the defense secretary left intact a proposed 
36 percent pay hike for those in the military 
cheney who has been on the job just 39 days said the process 
for the ultimate republican hawk was extremely difficult but 
he knew of no other way to cut the budget 
among the bigticket items facing major changes were 
star wars the program pushed by ronald reagan to develop 
lasers and other exotic weapons to shoot down enemy nuclear 
missiles will lose 1 billion from its proposal 1990 budget 
giving it a new total of 46 billion 
the b2 stealth bomber will have its production pushed back a 
year to 1993 almost 41 billion is being cut from the fiscal 1990 
and 1991 budgets for the radarevading plane recent estimates of 
500 million per plane make it the most expensive in history 
the national aerospace plane a joint project with nasa will 
be scaled back drastically the highspeed transport could fly 
around the world in just hours cheney decided to cut the projects 
fiscal 1990 budget by twothirds from 300 million to 100 million 
the midgetman nuclear missile a singlewarhead missile that 
would be small enough to be carried and fired from a truck 
launcher will be held to 100 million despite president bushs 
decision to develop the missile in addition to a railbased version 
of the mx nuclear missile 
spending for the mx in fiscal 1990 would total 12 billion 
with another 22 billion earmarked for fiscal 1991 
democrats and republicans expressed their opposition to the 
elimination of the v22 osprey arguing that the technology 
associated with the program makes it an aircraft whose time has 
come 
rep solomon p ortiz dtexas said he wouldnt be surprised 
if 10 years from now we were buying the technology from someone 
else and rep curt weldon rpa asked cheney to provide the 
documentation he used in deciding to kill the osprey 
youre going to hear much more about it weldon said this 
program has strong support in the congress 
but cheney stood by his decision reminding house members that 
bush and congress agreed on the total defense budget and in light 
of the programs lack of affordability he had no other choice 
i urge you to work your wiles and come out with another 27 
billion cheney told the panel after at least five lawmakers had 
criticized the decision 
earlier dickinson had cautioned the defense secretary against 
weakening his stand 
if you dont hang tough and if you let them start opening the 
package and the whole thing comes unglued were going to continue 
to have the fights in the congress with the admininstration across 
the whole myriad of weapons systems and we really havent 
accomplished much he said

mikhail s gorbachev has dropped a quarter of the 
most senior members of the communist partys top policymaking body 
and installed his own men and women 
at a central committee meeting tuesday the soviet president 
remolded the bodys membership in a maneuver expected to make it 
easier for him to wage his campaign for reform 
seventyfour of the committees 301 full members retired 
including former president andrei a gromyko and many other 
holdovers from pregorbachev days and 24 people were promoted to 
full membership 
the committee also retired 24 of its nonvoting members and 12 
members of the central auditing commission which handles party 
finances 
party ideology chief vadim a medvedev told a news conference 
that all had volunteered to step down 
the military lost a substantial voice in the central committee 
at least nine senior officers were dropped and just one officer was 
promoted from candidate status to full membership 
the changes left the central committee with 251 full members 
party personnel chief georgy p razumovsky told the news conference 
medvedev told reporters the number of committee members might go 
up or down later the next opportunity to add voting members would 
be at the party congress in 1991 but nonvoting members could be 
added at any central committee meeting 
while the politburo is the party and soviet societys ruling 
body it is the central committee in its several meetings a year 
that sets policy goals 
the committee also is empowered to make changes in the 
politburo and a stronger hand in its affairs could make it easier 
for gorbachev to bring supporters into the ruling body 
the retiring officials issued a joint request that referred to 
gorbachevs campaign for perestroika or restructuring it is 
essential for us in the interest of the common cause to give up 
our powers 
medvedev remarked this is a serious and important milestone 
in our course perestroika which shows that our party is 
realistically assessing its own work and is quite critical about 
its own activities 
the resignations followed the first contested nationwide 
elections in 70 years of communist rule on march 26 dozens of top 
party and government officials including more than 30 regional 
party chairmen were defeated 
medvedev said 83 members of the central committee had lost the 
government and party jobs that entitled them to committee 
membership officially they lost their jobs because of poor health 
or age but some clearly fell from political favor 
medvedev said a few of the 83 were too ill to sign their 
resignations 
western observers call such inactive officials dead souls 
and say they can be a conservative force slowing reforms the term 
was borrowed from nikolai gogols 1842 novel dead souls 
gorbachev has complained that opposition to his social and 
economic reform program extends all the way to the central 
committee which has included many officials who were seated long 
before he became party leader in march 1985 
in a speech to the central committee the 58yearold kremlin 
chief praised the retirees for working hard for perestroika 
many of us had to give up our habits and stereotypes of 
thinking and still at this time of utmost importance for the 
development of our society the central committee rose to the 
occasion gorbachev said 
but in remarks carried by the official tass news agency he 
added the situation has changed considerably comrades vast 
changes have taken place over this period also in state bodies and 
this required personnel changes 
tass said the retirees included gromyko who retired as 
president last fall former politburo members geidar a aliev and 
mikhail s solomentsev and former nonvoting politburo member 
vladimir i dolgikh 
also dropped were sergei sokolov who was retired as defense 
minister in 1987 after west german teenager mathias rust flew a 
plane onto red square and karen demirchyan and kyamran bagirov 
who lost their jobs as first secretary of the armenian and 
azerbaijani parties respectively in ethnic unrest last may 
among those promoted were yevgeny velikhov vice president of 
the soviet academy of sciences and thought to be a close gorbachev 
supporter and the ambassador to west germany yuli a kvitsinsky 
an arms control expert who negotiated on space weapons with us 
officials in geneva

seeking new cancer treatments and patients willing 
to try them american researchers are turning to the soviet union 
scientists from the national cancer institute in bethesda md 
and the danafarber cancer institute in boston said tuesday they 
are starting the first joint study of experimental cancer therapies 
with soviet hospitals 
the study will involve tests of new therapies on several hundred 
soviet and american patients over the next two years said dr emil 
frei iii director of the danafarber institute 
sen edward m kennedy said the study marks a resumption of 
collaboration in cancer research that began in 1972 but ended when 
the soviet army entered afghanistan in 1979 
it is one more sign that the cold war is finally behind us 
said the massachusetts democrat whose son edward jr was treated 
for bone cancer at danafarber 
american researchers have had difficulty enrolling large numbers 
of patients in clinical trials which sometimes involve placebos 
and side effects 
dr vincent t devita jr a former head of the national cancer 
institute said last year that doctors reluctance to put patients 
in drug comparison studies was a national disgrace that slowed 
the search for better treatments 
frei said the goal of the collaboration is to share expertise 
were not using them the soviets in any sense he said 
they will be the primary beneficiaries of both the technology and 
the treatments 
hallie baron a spokeswoman for the danafarber institute said 
the project was initiated by the soviets who are eager to receive 
new technology and drugs from american companies 
what the soviet side is providing the advantage of the soviet 
health care system is that it is very centralized which allows 
them to get just the right patients from all over the country and 
bring them to moscow for these studies said chris aho another 
spokeswoman for the institute 
kennedy said the study may involve exchanging some patients 
between the countries 
besides the national cancer institute and the danafarber 
institute the american hospitals participating in the study are 
the jonsson comprehensive cancer center in los angeles and roswell 
park cancer center in buffalo ny

the countdown for fridays launch of 
atlantis with the magellan venus probe progressed in squeaky 
clean fashion today and some work was ahead of schedule a nasa 
test director reported 
we have no significant open items and were on schedule 
albert sofge said 
the countdown which started tuesday continued toward a liftoff 
at 224 pm friday todays major task was the loading of liquid 
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant aboard the space shuttles 
powerproducing fuel cells 
air force capt thomas strange shuttle meteorologist said the 
only weather concern remained the possibility of strong crosswinds 
of about 17 mph that could be dangerous if atlantis had to make an 
emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad 
otherwise he said the forecast was for clear skies and 
temperature of 87 degrees 
six hours after launch astronauts mark lee and mary cleave are 
to release the 7600pound magellan probe and a rocket is to propel 
it on a 468day journey to venus 
magellan is to reach its destination in august 1990 swooping 
into orbit around venus to begin a 243day period during which it 
is to map up to 90 percent of the cloudshrouded planets surface 
with the probes high resolution radar system 
after releasing magellan the astronauts will conduct 
experiments for four days then return to earth 
were not really in charge of the deep space probe 
commander david walker said tuesday after he and his four crew 
members arrived from their training base in houston 
were fortunate enough to be part of the team that gets to 
send it up there were going to give it a little boost along the 
way then the rest of the nasa team will make sure that it gets to 
venus and does its job were mighty proud to be part of it 
the other crew members are pilot ron grabe and mission 
specialists cleave lee and norman thagard 
the mission costs 550 million and the radar images could reveal 
much about the history of venus and the evolution of earth 
stephen saunders of nasas jet propulsion laboratory in 
pasadena calif said it is hoped the computerenhanced images 
will answer a major question of why earth and venus evolved so 
differently even through at the beginning of the solar system they 
were almost identical

opposition leaders today urged radical 
students and workers to halt their protests and said south korea 
could be plunged into political chaos if they dont police clashed 
with protesters in two cities 
the leaders of the three main opposition parties also accused 
president roh taewoos government of fomenting unrest with harsh 
crackdowns on opponents and by failing to carry out promised 
democratic reforms 
kim daejung kim youngsam and kim jongpil in a statement 
aimed at radical students and workers said we warn against an 
expansion of leftist forces trying to overthrow our democratic 
system through violent revolution 
about 5000 striking workers clashed with riot police for a 
third day in changwon about 180 miles south of seoul 
workers hurled firebombs and rocks at police and set fire to 
drums of oil to hold back charging troopers 
in another clash about 600 radical students shouting down 
with roh taewoo hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police at 
hankook university in seoul police used multiple tear gas 
launchers to combat the students 
police said there were injuries in both cities but they gave no 
details 
the government issued a warning today against a major rally that 
radical workers and students planned monday to mark the may day 
holiday the government said police would block the seoul rally 
organizers vowed to defy the warning and said they expected 
100000 people to attend 
in another development student leaders announced plans for a 
march friday to the north korean border for talks with communist 
students on reuniting the divided korean peninsula police issued 
orders banning the march and a planned rally sunday in seoul by 
labor groups 
the united national democratic movement the nations main 
dissident alliance said the police actions were an illegal abuse 
of power and vowed to go ahead with demonstrations 
the students and dissidents lack popular support because of 
their violence and extreme views and are not seen as a serious 
threat to the government but government leaders say a wave of 
strikes for better pay are damaging the economy and could lead to 
serious political unrest 
the trade and industry ministry said today that strikes this 
year had so far cost about 35 billion in lost production 
including nearly 900 million in exports 
two of the nations three automakers hyundai and kia have 
virtually halted production because of strikes at companies making 
components according to yonhap the south korean news agency 
the opposition leaders known as the three kims said they would 
try to form a new opposition alliance and demanded the government 
keep its promise to punish former officials of the authoritarian 
regime of former president chun doohwan 
chun went into rural exile last november after apologizing to 
the nation for corruption and rights abuses under his rule but 
opposition parties are demanding top chun lieutenants also be 
prosecuted for wrongdoings 
the three kims said roh must keep an election promise to hold a 
referendum roh called off such a vote in march saying it would 
divide the nation 
the three opposition leaders have formed alliances in the past 
but they are deeply divided and have often clashed the last 
opposition alliance collapsed earlier this year in a dispute over 
whether the government should hold rohs promised referendum 
roh a former general won elections in december 1987 after the 
three kims all ran and split the opposition vote roh succeeded his 
former ally chun who took power with military backing in 1980

vice president dan quayle heard 
australian grievances today about us farm subsidies and told 
prime minister ob hawke that he must accept the political 
reality officials said 
quayle launched into talks with hawke soon after he and his wife 
marilyn is arrival on the first leg of a fournation tour of the 
pacific and the far east 
australian and us officials briefing reporters described the 
private 90minute meeting as particularly warm and said the 
overriding theme of the talks was that australianus relations 
are in excellent shape 
quayle is to spend five days in australia representing president 
bush at this years celebration of australianamerican friendship 
week 
defense issues had been expected to overshadow the talks 
following new zealand prime minister david langes announcement 
tuesday that he is considering formally ending his countrys 
participation in the anzus military alliance 
instead bilateral economic issues dominated with hawke 
complaining about us farm subsidies that he said hurt australian 
wheat exports 
there were lengthy discussions on trade said the sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
quayle according to the officials explained it was not the 
us intention to deliberately target australia with its export 
enhancement program which is designed to counter the trade 
strategy of the european economic community 
they said hawke provided the vice president with analytical and 
statistical evidence about how australia was suffering from us 
trade policies and that quayle took note of the concerns 
while both leaders agreed on the need for free trade quayle 
told hawke that the us farm bill is a political reality the 
sources said 
quayle and hawke agreed that australianus relations had 
never been in better shape and that australia remains a 
steadfast ally 
new zealands lange said he viewed the viewed the anzus defense 
pact as dead because of continuing restrictions in its relations 
with the united states which virtually cut off relations because 
of new zealands refusal to accept port visits by nuclearcapable 
ships 
but hawke said it was impossible to view langes threat further 
because at this stage it is only hypothetical one official 
reported 
en route here quayle made a twohour stop in sundrenched 
american somoa time enough to convince him he liked it and the 
happy campers who live there 
maybe ill just stay for a few days quayle told the 
islanders who honored him at a native ceremony and showered him 
with gifts as he spoke a samoan beauty queen in a sarong dress 
shielded him from the hot sun with an umbrella 
in exchange for the gracious reception the vice president 
proclaimed tuesday a public holiday for the roughly 38000 people 
here 
i have the power to declare this a holiday you can have 
the rest of the day off quayle told a cheering crowd of about 
2000 gathered under palm trees at tafuna international airport 
townspeople greeted him with sweetsmelling flower leis and a 
brass band 
later quayle told reporters the holiday had been the idea of 
gov peter colema 
the relaxation in pago pago came in sharp contrast to the 
grueling pace quayle had kept for the previous 32 hours 
in that time he delivered a speech in chicago met with former 
president ronald reagan in los angeles attended a security 
briefing in honolulu and played basketball at 3 am at hickam air 
force base there 
quayle proclaimed tropical american samoa a delightful change 
of pace 
you all look like happy campers to me said quayle the 
first vice president to visit the territory since walter mondale 
came to the outpost 11 years ago happy campers you are happy 
campers you have been and as far as im concerned happy campers 
you will always be 
quayle stressed to the islanders the importance of education as 
a way of opening opportunities 
school children waving miniature american flags lined the narrow 
road that brought the quayles to nuuli village a cluster of 
houses with corrugated iron roofs and open sides 
at a traditional ceremony the quayles sat on grass mats under a 
thatchedroof lodge belonging to the village chief the quayles 
were presented with 30 cases of canned wahoo tuna a decorated mat

when brad schranke of seattle arrived at the 
supreme court building to begin his 19hour wait to witness an 
argument on abortion rights police officers told him he was nine 
hours early 
i got here at 3 pm yesterday schranke told a reporter 
this morning the police did not start giving out numbers for 
courtroom seats until midnight but we arranged our own numbering 
system 
at midnight schranke a transportation engineering student at 
the university of washington was given no 1 
todays hourlong argument scheduled from 10 to 11 am est 
focuses on abortion regulations in missouri 
but state officials and the bush administration are urging the 
court to use the case to reverse or curtail its landmark 1973 
ruling that women have a constitutional right to abortion 
twentyfour people were arrested in protests outside the court 
this morning a court spokesman said all were charged with 
unlawful entry for crossing police lines a misdemeanor carrying a 
maximum penalty of 60 days in jail and 100 fine 
schranke said he opposes the earlier ruling i believe that 
god is the creator and man has no right to take a life god has 
created he said the baby has to have the choice 
dartmouth college sophomores clay fong of alameda calif and 
jordy green of south strafford vt were among the earliest 
arrivals 
fong described himself as a strong supporter of abortion rights 
if the constitutional right to abortion were taken away it would 
have a devastating impact on the country he said american 
individual rights are at a crossroads 
green said he was neutral on the abortion issue and trying 
to learn more about it 
both sides are very articulate in communicating their views 
green said adding that his 16hour wait in line had proved an 
educational experience 
maureen duffy a madison wis lawyer said she had come to the 
court just because this is part of history 
i think thats why a lot of people are here she said to 
see the court in action and to witness history in the making 
between 150 and 200 members of the public usually can be seated 
in the imposing courtroom on a firstcome firstserved basis 
but because the justices and other court officials had reserved 
an usually high number of seats for friends and family members 
only 40 to 50 seats were available for the general public court 
spokeswoman toni house said

more than 80 palestinian leaders from jerusalem 
and the occupied lands today rejected the prime ministers election 
plan and demanded an international conference to resolve the middle 
east conflict 
we believe real peace in the region cannot be achieved by 
projects that are calculated to appeal to the media to end the 
palestinian uprising and to win time the leaders said in a 
statement it was the first formal response from local palestinians 
to the peace proposal prime minister yitzhak shamir outlined in 
washington earlier this month 
shamir proposed elections be held in the occupied west bank and 
occupied gaza strip to select palestinians who would hold talks 
with israel on an interim solution for the troubled region after 
two years discussions would begin toward a permanent solution 
the plan as outlined by the shamir government rules out any 
participation by the plo which israel considers a terrorist 
organization 
in their statement the palestinian leaders called on israel to 
recognize the necessity of negotiations with the plo within the 
framework of an international conference it called the palestine 
liberation organization the sole legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people 
the statement said shamirs election plan was an attempt to 
divide our people into inside and outside palestinians 
it said the signers rejection of the election proposal does 
not indicate a rejection of elections as a democratic process but 
is the rejection of a project which ignores the essense of the 
conflict 
this isolated occurrence of elections does not illustrate how 
it will lead to the end of the occupation and to palestinian 
national independence 
it urged that the united nations be given authority to 
administer the occupied territories during a transitional period to 
palestinian statehood 
the statement distributed in arabic and english was signed by 
83 prominent palestinians many known to favor the plo 
shamirs top spokesmen could not be reached for comment because 
of the passover holiday foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said 
he realizes the palestinians want a final solution not an interim 
one but that the israeli thinking is if we start from the end 
we wont have a beginning this is the idea behind the stepbystep 
approach 
chief among them was faisal husseini of arab east jerusalem who 
recently returned from meetings with egyptian officials in cairo on 
the shamir plan 
husseini is considered the chief spokesman for the plo in the 
occupied lands he has been held in jail without being charged for 
most of the 16month palestinian uprising and also has met with 
israeli officials on their peace plans for the territories 
during the uprising against israeli occupation of the 
territories 450 palestinians and 18 israelis have been killed 
others who signed the document included university professor 
sari nusseibeh of jerusalem haidar abd alshafi head of the red 
crescent society in gaza gabi baramki head of beir zeit 
university mayor hilme hanoun of tulkarem and audeh alranteesi 
an anglican priest from ramallah 
the united states has backed the idea of elections in the 
occupied lands and has called on israel and the palestinians to 
work out a way to hold such balloting president bush said after 
shamir presented his plan that he believes israel must end its 
occupation of the territories but that he does not favor the 
creation of a palestinian state late last year the united states 
reversed a longstanding policy and opened talks with the plo 
the soviet union has been a major proponent of an international 
conference which also has the backing of major arab states 
including egypt and jordan 
todays statement said israel finds itself more 
internationally isolated than ever before israel has been 
stripped of its main support and has been revealed as a terrorist 
state suppressing with blood and force a civilian population 
struggling with legitimate means for national independence 
the palestinian leaders put forward a fourpoint plan calling on 
israel to 
recognize the palestinians as a people with a right to a secure 
life and an independent state 
recognize the necessity of negotiations with the plo within the 
framework of an international conference 
allow the united nations to administer the territories in the 
interim 
allow the international conference to give suitable 
guarantees of security for all states in the region according to 
definite principles agreed upon by all the parties

a state department official disputes evidence 
in the oliver north trial saying the us government backed away 
from a plan approved by president reagan to give honduras extra 
us aid in return for supporting the nicaraguan rebels 
the comments tuesday by michael g kozak to a house subcommittee 
came in response to disclosure of the plan at norths trial the 
jury in the trial returned to the courthouse this morning for its 
fifth day of deliberations 
reagan initialed a feb 19 1985 memo prepared by north and 
introduced at his trial approving a plan to link more than 110 
million in extra aid to honduras support for the contra rebels 
that support consisted primarily of allowing the rebels to 
maintain base camps in honduras at the time congress had banned 
military aid to the contras 
the month after reagan approved the plan thenvice president 
george bush visited honduras and told president roberto suazo 
cordova that reagan had directed expedited delivery of us 
military items and other aid to the country according to a 42page 
admission introduced at norths trial honduras did receive the 
additional assistance and continued to support the contras 
but kozak acting assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs maintains that the extra aid wasnt 
conditioned on contra support 
the plan was disapproved at the objection of the state 
department on the grounds that conditionality linkage between 
us assistance and any assistance to the resistance was contrary 
to us policy kozak told the house appropriations subcommittee 
on foreign operations 
kozak offered no details on how the plan came to be scrapped he 
wasnt asked by the subcommittee about the fact that reagan had 
approved it 
kozak at one point mischaracterized the 42page admission 
saying that north whose lawyers prepared the document has 
linked a trip of the vice president to a secret plan that was 
never approved in fact the admission does not address whether 
bush during his visit to honduras told suazo the extra aid was 
contingent on contra support 
bush has repeatedly refused to discuss the contingent aid plan 
or his actions during the honduran trip saying it could prejudice 
norths trial 
the court admission was prepared by norths lawyers and the 
prosecution in concert with us intelligence agencies 
kozak referred to the admission as a fiction and said it was 
primarily the product of north and his lawyers some changes were 
made by the independent counsel prosecuting the north case but 
administration officials were permitted only to screen it to excise 
classified information he said kozak said he was among the 
officials who screened it 
the plan which reagan approved included an emissary who would 
carry a signed copy of a letter by reagan urging support for the 
contras according to the feb 19 1985 memo initialed by the 
president the emissary was then to very privately explain our 
criteria for the expedited economic support security assistance 
deliveries and enhanced cia support said the memo from national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane 
the document marked memorandum for the president was 
prepared by north and an nsc colleague raymond f burghardt 
according to a notation at the bottom of the document 
reagan put his initials in two locations including the line 
marked ok for the recommendation saying that you authorize us 
to proceed as outlined above 
the whole proposed linkage that was included in norths plan 
was disapproved was not made there was no discreet emissary 
kozak maintained 
another document introduced at norths trial reflects opposition 
by kozaks area of the state department then headed by elliott 
abrams 
a feb 15 1985 memo from north to mcfarlane says that abrams 
operation has clearly indicated that they do not desire to have 
an emissary that there is no need to explain the 
conditionality 
a feb 25 1985 memo from north to mcfarlane seems to suggest 
that the emissary idea was proceeding it says that reagans letter 
to suazo urging support for the contras will be delivered by ray 
burghardt norths colleague on the nsc staff 
we seem to be well on the way toward an early release of the 
additional aid norths memo continues 
north is charged with 12 criminal counts including lying to 
congress to cover up the irancontra affair illegally converting 
travelers checks from a contra leader to his personal use and 
conspiring to defraud the treasury

a student protest that resulted in 52 
arrests will not stop military research at the university of 
massachusetts the chancellor says 
police in riot gear tuesday arrested 29 students camped inside 
memorial hall on trespassing charges twentythree others were 
arrested for lying in front of the police bus to prevent it from 
leaving authorities said 
chancellor joseph d duffey issued a statement telling the 
students that pentagonfunded research will continue on the 
25000student campus 
the policy will not be negotiated with students he said 
until faculty and trustees in deliberate process modify these 
policies they remain policies governing faculty research at the 
university of massachusetts at amherst 
the occupation of the campus building began with about 35 
students on monday afternoon by tuesday evening about 300 
students stood outside the chanting and looking on as the students 
inside the hall were arrested 
christobal bonifaz an attorney for the arrested students said 
they refused to give their names to police identifying themselves 
as either john doe or abbie hoffman 
umass spokeswoman jeanne hopkins said about 40 students left the 
building tuesday morning after administrators told them they would 
be arrested after 5 pm 
graduate students were told they could face suspension and any 
teaching assistants arrested probably would lose their jobs she 
said 
the takeover was the second against military research at the 
campus in a week seven protesters were arrested april 19 
all research at the university is nonclassified and researchers 
must make their work public under university rules 
about 116 million or 22 percent of all grant money received 
at the university came from the defense department in 1988 
according to the school 
the local american friends service committee contends that 
armyfunded anthrax bacterial research is dangerous to the town 
which the school disputes

the senior republican on the house ethics 
committee angered at being snubbed by key witnesses in the case of 
house speaker jim wright suggested today that the panel might cite 
the witnesses for contempt 
there are a lot of options a contempt citation is one said 
rep john myers rind who returned to washington from a 
fruitless trip to san antonio texas with ethics committee 
chairman julian dixon dcalif 
were in good faith trying to do what has to be done myers 
said relating how he and dixon had waited tuesday to interview a 
group of five investors in a texas gas well that yielded little gas 
but did produce large profits for wrights blind trust 
a halfhour after the group failed to appear a hotel employee 
came to inform the investigators that the witnesses werent coming 
i dont think thats proper treatment for anyone myers told 
reporters we thought wed get this behind us but if they dont 
want to cooperate they can slow us down and they have 
myers said the ethics committee would meet thursday to discuss 
the status of the case which has left wrights position as speaker 
in jeopardy he said failure of the texas witnesses to appear 
raised questions about why they did not want to testify 
maybe theres something more to that myers said i think 
we have to look at this with even more scrutiny why didnt they 
want to appear 
in the capital wrights colleagues continued to focus on 
charges that he sold bulk quantities of his book reflections of 
a public man to evade house limits on outside income the 
speaker said he might consider giving the profits to charity if the 
ethics panel suggests it 
the ethics panel issued its findings in the 10month 
investigation last week formally charging wright with 69 instances 
of violating house rules the panel said he had improperly received 
145000 in gifts from a fort worth business partner with a direct 
interest in legislation and had used bulk sales of a book he wrote 
to evade limits on outside income 
the panel is considering whether there is clear and 
convincing proof of the 69 alleged violations and if so whether 
to recommend disciplinary action to the house 
the committee left open one area of inquiry how wrights blind 
trust profited heavily from a oneday investment last may in the 
drilling venture at sabine lake near the texaslouisiana line 
wrights investment partnership with developer george mallick 
invested 9120 cash in the well on may 10 then sold the interest 
later that day for a 340000 profit even though oil and gas flows 
at the time had dwindled the well later was abandoned 
the committee is studying the amount of profit over a few 
hours time myers said it doesnt look good 
but in a letter to the committee washington attorney stanley m 
brand argued that the panel was overreaching in commanding the 
testimony of five people he represents san antonio financier 
morris jaffe his son md doug jaffe investors jeff prestridge 
and dave myers and marlyn cherry jaffes bookkeeper 
the ethics committee said it wanted to determine whether wright 
knew about the well deal which involved the jaffes a west 
germanowned firm and the blind trust established for wright in 
1987 said richard phelan the ethics committees special outside 
counsel 
wright contends he was ignorant of the deal because it occurred 
within his blind trust 
brand in the letter he released argued that the drilling 
venture was outside the scope of the ethics committees original 
resolution of inquiry voted last june 9 
serious legal questions are raised by the sheer overbreadth of 
these subpoenas brand wrote adding that his clients were given 
just a week to prepare for their testimony 
the development threw another procedural roadblock in the way of 
the case which already was bogged down in negotiations between 
wrights lawyer william oldaker and committee counsel phelan over 
conditions for wright to appear before the panel for a personal 
defense 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo told reporters many of her 
democratic colleagues have discussed the advisability of wright 
giving back any profits he made from the book deal which is the 
most troubling charge to many of the speakers colleagues 
we have all said that we thought that restitution made a lot 
of sense she said wright could say ok i probably stretched 
it too far and donate the money to charity without admitting 
wrongdoing she said 
asked about the suggestion wright said if thats what the 
committee wants me to do of course id do it 
but he defended the book sales saying i never consciously 
considered that buying books was payment for my making a 
speech

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
april 25 
the flint mich journal on president bushs first 100 days 
no we havent noticed an increase in the number of times the 
pledge of allegiance is being recited even though the pledge was 
one of the biggest issues in last novembers presidential election 
but that of course cant be the standard by which we measure 
the first 100 days of the bush administration 
neither can we use what bush has called the vision thing 
and nobody seems to have an accurate handle of how many thousands 
of points of light started shining since the white house changed 
occupants 
but george bush can be fairly judged on his handling of the 
economy the war on drugs environmental protection foreign 
policy government administration and his pledge to transform 
america into a kinder and gentler nation 
in general hes been doing a good job a better job than we 
expected if we were to peg a letter grade to his performance it 
would be a c but his progress has come slowly slower than a 
clock in a classroom on a beautiful morning in may

failure to improve the us educational system could saddle 
americas economy with enormous longterm costs a 
congressional joint economic committee said april 18 
the committee said america is falling behind in promoting 
literacy and job skills even though it already spends more money 
per student than any other country in the world 
other nations recognized long ago that their economic futures 
were closely linked to the education and training of their young 
people 
there are many valid reasons to promote education but the joint

the item sumter sc on the ban on handguns 
few public debates are as impassioned as the one revolving 
around the possession of firearms 
the debate has long focused on handguns but recent events have 
shifted that focus to imported assault weapons the use of ak47s 
in a number of horrific crimes lately for instance has led to a 
temporary ban on imported semiautomatic assault weapons 
it is certainly a simple task for a criminal to obtain an ak47 
but to stop them from being imported is to deny a lawabiding 
citizen the right to acquire one 
perhaps but let it not be forgotten that the assualt weapon is 
in fact a weapon it was specifically designed for and is almost 
always used for killing people 
to put it in the hands of sportsman does not endow it with 
anything more noble and to compare it with a sportsmans fowling 
piece is absurd

the albuquerque nm tribune on congressional ethics 
it was fitting that president bushs plan for tightening ethical 
standards in government was made public shortly before speaker jim 
wright was accused of 69 violations of house rules 
it was a reminder that while the democratic congress has focused 
so much attention of late on allegations of wrongdoing in the 
executive branch the national legislature has a substantial factor 
of sleaze 
in presenting his plan bush appropriately made the point that 
the public finds it hard to understand why certain behavior is 
considered criminal when committed by an executive branch 
official but is perfectly legal when committed by someone in 
another branch of government 
bush said if washington is to be a level playing field then 
every player should be treated the same 
well said

trappings are on seemingly ordinary people 
police described the 12 youths who raped and beat the 
28yearold woman as schoolboys who were part of a larger group 
that harassed at least nine people during a twohour period 
evil does exist in the heart of mankind sometime behavior is

but while we wish them well wed like someone to come forward 
with a little glossary of terms so the rest of us can keep up with 
advancements 
such things as heavy water palladium electrodes and helium4 
make some of us wish we hadnt dozed during science class 
for whatever its worth fusion might be something to get 
excited about but the bottom line is that for most of us the 
result is confusion 
we cant wait for it to be invented maybe then someone will

the west palm beach fla post on the uss iowa explosion 
in all 47 sailors died in the horrible explosion aboard the uss 
iowa families friends and all of us who relied on those men to 
guard our seas want to know why they died 
was it because the navy insists on maintaining a needlessly 
dangerous and outdated weapons system it is a question that 
deserves careful study 
the navy already has jumped to the defense of its battleships 
and its enormous 16inch guns this is not the time for that 
type of defensive thinking 
instead the navy should thoroughly examine the reasons for the 
explosion inside the world war iivintage gun turret 
then the navy must realistically determine whether this is the 
best and safest technology available to its fighting men

the daily world aberdeen wash on the uss iowa explosion 
the explosion that killed 47 men aboard the battleship iowa was 
a tragic reminder of the risk that goes with military service a 
risk often not fully appreciated by the american public 
the accident has revived some of the criticism expressed several 
years ago when the government reactivated four old world war ii 
battlewagons 
after the iowa explosion april 19 one critic was prominently 
displayed on television complaining about the ships 
oldfashioned ammunition oldfashioned technology and 
oldfashioned wiring 
despite the criticism the recommissioned battleships serve many 
military purposes they have been outfitted with the latest 
communications and electronic warfare equipment and each has been

to suggest as some have that the battleships should now be 
remothballed is like saying that the frigate fleet should be 
scrapped because the uss stark while on patrol in the persian gulf

by a missile fired by an iraqi warplane

san gabriel valley calif tribune on foreign oil reliance 
the spring surge in gasoline cost has boosted pump prices in 
california by up to 30 cents a gallon 
not surprisingly the alaskan oil spill coupled with the 
unvarnished greed of major american oil companies were all it took 
to send gas prices soaring 
yet even before the disaster in prince william sound crude oil 
prices had been rising steadily for several months as the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and other 
foreign producers gained greater control over the world market 
today in fact the united states is potentially far more 
vulnerable to price manipulation by the opec cartel than in 1973 
when the first oil shock dealt a body blow to the economies of the 
industrialized democracies 
during the 1970s this country relied on imported oil for about 
onethird of its total consumption after seven years of declining 
domestic production amid sharply rising fuel use the united states 
now depends on foreign sources for half of its petroleum needs 
during 1988 exploration and drilling by the us oil industry 
declined to their lowest levels since recordkeeping began in 1940 
 
if fuel costs continue to mount higher inflation will 
inevitably hasten a recession in this country and probably on a 
global scale as well

huron sd daily plainsman on house speaker james wright 
it would appear that house speaker jim wright of texas is in a 
heap of trouble 
in light of the recent charges we do not believe that wright 
can function effectively in his role as speaker of the house it 
would be best if he would step down from that position 
wright represents texas in the us house of representatives it 
will be up to those voters as to whether or not he remains in the 
house 
the president already has been told by the us senate that his 
first nominee for secretary of defense john tower also of texas 
was ethically unsuited for the job 
unfortunately bush and tower didnt withdraw voluntarily it 
was put to a vote and the president lost 
it would appear to us that until the investigation is completed 
wright should step down as speaker of the house

san antonio expressnews on welfare reform 
while some in congress might think the welfare reforms they 
enacted last year were sufficient the congressional budget office 
or cbo has produced a detailed study of that complcated package 
that makes it clear that it was reform in name only 
the lawmakers who pushed through the family support act of 1988 
boasted that it would pay for itself by moving lowincome families 
off the welfare rolls and into productive employment 
but the cbo now calculates that the measure will actually end up 
increasing the number of families on welfare the total package 
will cost billions above current welfare costs 
that would be ok if the result were to rescue poor people from 
the welfare trap instead washingtons continued resistance to 
genuine reform will cause even more dependency

statesmanjournal salem ore on lech walesas poland 
lech walesa deserves another nobel peace prize 
by peaceful and dogged persistence he convinced the communist 
government of poland to recognize the outlawed labor union 
solidarity and to hold free elections 
will poland set an example to other communist nations you bet 
 
some governments and citizens hungarys for example are 
openly enthusiastic and excited about setting out on their own with 
more political freedom and human rights for the people and a new 
economic engine for the nation 
its no mystery why the polish government yielded to solidarity 
and walesa it wants to gain economic help from the united states 
and other western nations 
president bush quickly pledged an economic aid package that may 
total 1 billion 
we can follow walesas example and let time take its course we 
can quietly help soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev achieve the 
reforms in the soviet union and in eastern europe that the west has 
tried for so long to promote

burlington county times willingboro nj on bush and the oil 
spill 
president bush has been keeping track of the alaska oil spill 
but his observations have been from afar 
why should he take a presidential yacht into the filthy oil 
slick or an old navy minesweeper for that matter 
it is better the president figured to permit the cleanup of 
the prudhoe oil without the distraction of a visit from the head of 
state 
and a visit is all it would have been regardless of the 
opportunity to get some good newsreel footage for the next 
campaign there is very little a clean shaven chap from washington 
can do when that oily ring threatens to creep above the shoe tops 
actually the oil spill will probably be fuel for bushs 
opponent when the reelection effort starts remembering the 
mileage bush got from the filth of boston harbor the democrats 
would be remiss if they didnt make reference to the 
administrations handsoff handling of the spill situation

the milwaukee journal on college freshmen and varsity sports 
hunter rawlings president of the university of iowa has 
lighted a fire of controversy by saying college freshmen should not 
be allowed to participate in varsity sports 
we agree 
rawlings announced his intention to bar freshman athletes from 
playing or even practicing varsity sports if a national ban is not 
enacted within three years by the national collegiate athletic 
association 
he acknowledged that sports can tie students to a university 
but added that it goes too far when it causes a skewing of 
priorities 
at iowa some athletes have taken courses in watercolor 
painting karate billiards and bowling rawlings realizes that the 
main business of a university is intellectual not physical

enterprisejournal mccomb miss on sports emphasis 
the emphasis this country and several others puts on athletics 
has gotten out of hand the pressure to succeed and the dreams of 
multimillion dollar professional and endorsement contracts is 
corrupting amateur sports worldwide and having a detrimental effect 
on the us education system 
to gain a competitive edge players and coaches are willing to 
bend or break the rules using illegal drugs passing money under 
the table recruiting juvenile delinquents 
the school also cooperate giving preferential treatment to 
athletes by holding them to lesser academic standards than the rest 
of their student 
parents have also gotten in the act of trying to skirt the 
system by holding back their children in school so they can have an 
advantage 
sports is an afterschool activity children are in school to 
learn how to read and write not how to throw a pass 
if parents want their children to succeed theyd be better 
advised to focus their attention on books not baskets

a criminal investigation has been launched into 
the use of tear gas by troops who broke up a proindependence 
demonstration in soviet georgia a foreign ministry spokesman said 
today 
nineteen people died in the clash april 9 and another person was 
shot and killed for violating a curfew imposed to curb further 
demonstrations at least 1100 people were injured in the melee in 
the georgian capital of tbilisi 
vadim perfiliev said at a news briefing that the investigation 
is being carried out by the chief military prosecutor due to the 
fact that tear gas was used on demonstrators in tbilisi a criminal 
case has been opened he said 
perfiliev denied anyone died as a direct result of tear gas or 
any chemical substance used by soldiers to disperse the 
demonstrators 
when autopsies were performed the reasons for death were not 
the use of chemical gas or chemical substances he said 
this contradicted reports by the georgian minister of health 
irakli managarishvili who said tuesday that at least two of the 
victims died from gas used by troops managarishvili also said 
several others died from asphyxiation that may have been induced by 
the unidentified substance 
officials in moscow have confirmed only that tear gas was used 
but doctors treating injured protesters said the victims were 
suffering a paralysis of the central nervous system caused by an 
unidentified chemical substance 
one of the victims gilo oniani spoke with foreign 
correspondents in tbilisi on monday during a trip arranged by the 
foreign ministry 
mrs oniani a 34yearold factory worker who was sprayed in the 
face with an aerosol told reporters was unable to sleep due to 
nervous agitation and unable to eat due to pain in her abdomen 
manana gamsakhurdia the wife of jailed protest organizer zviad 
gamsakhurdia said in a telephone interview today that two men came 
to mrs onianis hospital room late monday and threatened her for 
speaking to reporters 
perfiliev said a commission made up of top scientists from 
moscow leningrad and other major cities had been formed and would 
join in the investigation of the clashes 
there are contradictory versions around the events in 
tbilisi he said including the question of how many gases were 
used 
the experts will be able to make their conclusions and the 
public and representatives of the mass media will be informed of 
them as soon as possible perfiliev said

investigators today said they believe a 
young woman found dead along interstate 195 is the ninth victim of 
a new bedfordarea serial killer 
bristol county district attorney ronald a pina would be very 
surprised if this were not a victim of the killer who left the 
bodies of eight women along southeastern massachusetts highways

the woman was under 30 and had been dead 10 to 12 months he 
said the body found monday will be checked against dental 
records of three missing women to identify the victim martin said

where it was found the position of the body certain evidence 
found at the scene and information gleaned from the autopsy 
tuesday the spokesman said 
he would not be more specific about the findings 
the autopsy which was to continue today did not immediately 
determine the cause of death he said bristol county investigators 
have declined to say how seven of the eight other victims died 
they have said one was strangled 
the eight victims so far identified all had links to new 
bedfords weld square area a district known for drugs and 
prostitution the first of the bodies was found in july

the villagers of langa on wednesday 
mourned the loss of one of swedens last wolves which had made 
friends with villagers dogs but pillaged reindeer herds 
the wolf was killed last week six months after wandering into 
the area displaying an unusual lack of fear of humans a 1600 
reward was offered for the arrest of the killer 
police and the nature protection department refused to say how 
the animal was killed while the case was being investigated 
reindeer herdsmen denied responsibility 
the killing ended a month of squabbling over the wolfs fate and 
whether it should be moved to another area 
the department said it concluded the wolf would try to go back 
to its old hunting territory if it was moved and attempts to scare 
it away with rubber bullets failed 
the 150 villagers in langa 240 miles northwest of stockholm 
said the wolf had caused them no harm they said it had played with 
their dogs ignored sheep flocks and at times passed within six 
yards of humans 
the wolfs death left only nine known wolves roaming wild in the 
valleys and deep forests of sweden 
hunting regulations allow reindeer herders to shoot a wolf only 
if it is caught in the act of attacking their herds

according to police samuel gallezzo 23 initially tried to get 
arrested by tossing a newspaper vending machine through a window 
saturday night but officers only gave him a summons for 
misdemeanor vandalism 
then police said he walked into police headquarters early 
sunday and told sgt richard rogalski i want to be arrested 
rogalski asked why for stealing a bus gallezzo said 
what bus rogalski asked 
the one parked out front gallezzo replied 
rogalski found a 175000 bus belonging to western massachusetts 
bus lines parked at the curb and accommodated gallezzo 
but gallezzo was only briefly a guest of the city after he 
pleaded innocent to larceny of a motor vehicle monday he was 
released on his own recognizance 
if all he wanted was a night in jail there are easier ways he 
could have done it said police chief david labato and if he 
was looking for a place to sleep he could have just stayed in the 
bus or gone to one of several shelters 
director william nagle said he let gallezzo stay at the 
northampton honor court a facility for alcoholics when gallezzo 
told him last week that he was living in a tent but asked him to 
leave saturday 
he started some trouble with one of my boys so i sent him 
packing nagle said

investors are lining up to become shareholders in 
the mappa mundi in a plan to keep the 13thcentury map at hereford 
cathedral organizers said wednesday 
a new company called mappa mundi plc is offering the public 
7450 shares at about 1700 each to raise more than 12 million to 
keep the map at hereford and pay for repairs to cathedral 
hereford cathedral caused a national uproar when it announced 
last year it was auctioning off its medieval treasure possibly to 
foreign buyers to pay for the muchneeded repairs 
it then had hoped to raise 43 million selling the 708yearold 
map which shows jerusalem at the center of the world and hereford 
at the edge 
but the church of england subsequently joined forces with 
financiers to launch the unusual privatization 
the bishop and the dean of hereford cathedral said they have 
been inundated with more than 100 applications from as far away as 
the indonesian capital of jakarta and israel to buy shares in the 
map 
bishop of hereford john eastaugh said he planned to buy a share 
for his wife and that many members of the friends of hereford 
cathedral also planned to take up the offer 
eastaugh said we are asking people to give a particular sum 
and to have an actual share in this great treasure which belongs to 
the nation 
i feel very excited i shall feel relieved when weve got the 
money in 
the offer opens may 3 for a 42day period and all shareholders 
are to receive reproductions of the map bearing a seal and signed 
by the bishop and the dean peter haynes 
the idea was dreamed up by marketing specialist paul billingham 
who was upset when he read about the planned sale in the 
newspapers he approached financiers who then put the idea to the 
bishop and the dean 
i think they had a tough time and it was a difficult decision 
for them to make we had to explain something to them that was 
obviously alien but im glad theyve gone this route billingham 
said

soccer fans hurled bricks smashed 
store windows and looted a toy store today in unrest that broke out 
before the netherlandswest germany world cup qualification match 
police said 
dutch fans threatened to storm the stadium unless more tickets 
were made available 
eights fans were arrested and an undetermined number were 
injured in the clashes which began in the afternoon as fans were 
arriving for tonights match in rotterdams feyenoord stadium said 
police spokesman ger de jong 
police on horseback and officers in riot gear were called in to 
disperse the estimated 500 rioting fans in one case a police 
helicopter suddenly dived to within about 30 feet above a group of 
marauding youngsters 
dozens of store windows were smashed de jong said shopkeepers 
lowered steel blinds and boarded up windows in an effort to protect 
their property 
its not really clear to us whether theres a confrontation 
going on between rival dutch and west german fans de jong told 
the associated press 
most fans in the downtown shopping area where the rioting took 
place appeared to be dutch because of their orange scarves orange 
is the color of the dutch national team 
authorities said the rotterdam stadium which holds 57000 
people was sold out except for 5 percent of the tickets which 
were not being sold to avoid overcrowding dutch groups said they 
would storm the stadium unless more tickets were sold 
a stampede at a soccer match april 15 in sheffield england 
killed 95 people when fans some apparently without tickets rushed 
into a standingroomonly section of the stadium 
police deployed 600 officers including 250 riot police to 
quell any disturbances during the match 
fans will be subject to rigorous ticket checks and be frisked 
before being admitted to the stadium de jong said 
last year in the semifinal match of the european soccer 
championships the dutch national team beat west germany 21 that 
event sparked widespread street revelry 
on monday the team of west german coach franz beckenbauer was 
forced to evacuate its hotel in nearby wassenaar because of a bomb 
threat no bomb was found an unidentified person claiming to be a 
member of west germanys red army faction terrorist group made the

president bush said today the nation must 
accelerate exploratory oil drilling and make greater use of natural 
gas and coal resources 
saying the united states remains too heavily dependent on 
foreign oil more than 15 years after the energy shortage that 
produced long gas lines in 1974 bush told a joint session of the 
texas legislature we need a national energy policy that relies 
not only on oil but on many other sources 
bush who set himself up in the texas oil business in the late 
1940s and became a millionaire before entering public life said in 
his prepared remarks i know there are still a few dark clouds 
remaining on our economic horizon 
but he said texas is showing signs of recovering from the 
business slump brought about by the decline of the energy industry 
in recent years and this has happened because an increasingly 
diversified economy has brought tens of thousands of hightech jobs 
to the state 
still no matter how diversified and hightech texas has 
become a strong domestic energy industry is important to the 
future of this state and all of america bush said i find it 
disturbing that nearly 50 percent of americas oil is imported 
this is not good for our national security 
maximizing use of oil resources will make the country less 
dependent on imported fuel he said and increasing reliance on 
alternative energy resources will give the country a cleaner 
environment 
the president reiterated that the nation must not retreat from 
oil exploration because of the huge spill from the tanker exxon 
valdez off the coast of alaska 
we are using federal resources intelligently in the cleanup 
effort he said we are working with industry to develop an 
improved plan in the event of a future spill 
but shutting down our domestic energy production is no answer 
and would merely increase our dependence on foreign oil bush 
said to reduce our dependence on foreign oil we must return to 
high levels of exploratory drilling 
he said he intends to stimulate domestic oil drilling with tax 
credits and other incentives 
bush did not cite those incentives but during his campaign for 
the presidency he suggested a 10 percent tax credit for oil and 
gas exploration up to 10 million of costs and 5 percent above that 
he also proposed eliminating 80 percent of intangible drilling 
costs as subject to the alternative minimum tax for independent 
producers 
in his speech today bush called on congress at long last to 
fully decontrol natural gas i believe that this will happen soon 
he said he believes the nation can and must use more safe 
nuclear power and said that coal has a bright future 
as we all become increasingly concerned about the need for 
clean air we must look more to natural gas and to nuclear power 
he said we must produce more of our corn crop to produce 
ethanol more of our natural gas to produce methanol 
greater use of these two will rapidly improve the air quality 
of our most heavily populated cities the president said

surgeon general c everett koop on wednesday 
joined the national cancer institute and the american cancer 
society in a campaign to get physicians to help their patients quit 
smoking 
they have put together a brochure outlining basic steps doctors 
should take to make smoking advice part of standard medical 
practice and theyre sending the pamphlet to 100000 primarycare 
physicians 
seventy percent of americans see their doctors at least once a 
year koop said if doctors can get across to their patients 
some selfrewarding goal for stopping smoking i believe the 
problem can be nearly licked 
about 48 million or 29 percent of american adults smoke and 
one in every six deaths in the united states is attributed to the 
effects of smoking according to public health officials 
the surgeon general the countrys most outspoken public health 
official in the fight against smoking said new clinical trials 
conducted by the national cancer institute show that smokers 
whose doctors help them quit are up to six times more likely than 
other smokers to kick the habit for good 
however many physicians are reluctant to counsel their patients 
on smoking because they are uncomfortable with the subject dont 
believe they can help and feel they are intruding on a patients 
privacy he said 
by giving doctors the information they need to help patients 
quit and offering training sessions for physicians koop believes 
doctors will join the campaign and actively work to help their 
patients stop smoking 
if only 10 percent of physicians routinely advised smokers to 
quit and succeeded with only one in 20 patients more than a 
million smokers would quit each year in addition to the million 
or so who already quit annually said joseph w cullen deputy 
director of the division of cancer prevention and control at the 
national cancer institute 
the fourstep guidelines developed by the institute and the 
cancer society on the basis of clinical trials advise physicians 
to ask patients about their smoking habits and advise each smoker 
to quit 
then doctors are asked to help patients willing to try to quit 
by setting a quit date giving the patient selfhelp material and 
prescribing nicotine gum if needed for heavier smokers finally 
they should arrange for followup support including phone calls or 
office visits 
the booklet also advises physicians on how to help patients 
manage weight gain and other withdrawal symptoms 
nearly half of all american adults who have ever smoked have 
stopped koop said noting that physicians have been leading the 
way as less than 10 percent of them smoke 
now its time for doctors to act in another way to preach 
what they practice koop said

war ended in april 1975 with a communist victory over the 
usbacked south vietnam government

when it agreed to accelerate cooperation on the issue in exchange 
for washingtons help in encouraging private humanitarian aid to 
vietnam 
ten us military specialists have been in vietnam since april 
12 working with vietnamese counterparts in the fifth joint field

a vineyard accused of trying to squeeze too 
much profit from anheuserbusch by passing off wine made from 
cheaper grapes instead of zinfandel has agreed to pay the alcohol 
company nearly 11 million 
the settlement made last month and disclosed in court documents 
tuesday involved a lawsuit filed in federal court earlier this 
year 
the suit said anheuserbusch had contracted to buy 900 tons of 
100 percent zinfandel grapes from bavaro brothers a grower in the 
san joaquin valley town of escalon the grapes were to be sent to 
verdugo vineyards in acampo for processing into white zinfadel wine 
but a government inspection found some of the wine delivered to 
master cellars an anheuserbusch division was made from as little 
as 229 percent zinfandel juice that meant the wine by law could 
not be sold as white zinfandel 
instead of having a value of 1 million its worth barely 
197359 the suit said 
under the agreement approved by us district judge a wallace 
tashima bavaro agreed to pay anheuserbusch nearly 11 million 
in return bavaro can try to sell the thousands of gallons of wine 
and apply the money to the settlement 
a ton of zinfandel grapes can sell for 950 compared to 150 
for say chenin blanc according to the suit

the house banking committee today prayed for 
divine guidance to rise above narrow selfinterest as it began 
work on savings and loan legislation and then immediately adopted 
a provision designed to favor the hometown bank of a powerful 
lawmaker 
other amendments to help out two of the nations largest bank 
holding companies first interstate of california and chemical 
bank of new york swiftly followed 
the votes came as the panel debated legislation recommended by 
the bush administration to bail out the savings and loan industry 
and the thorny issue of what type of capital requirements should be 
imposed on sampls 
both the administration and the two party leaders on the 
committee now want to make sampl owners put up 225 of their own 
money as tangible capital for every 100 they lend 
if we adopt weak standards and allow the kitchen sink to 
count as capital we are voting to shift the burden to the 
taxpayers committee chairman henry gonzalez dtexas said in an 
opening statement 
however rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the panels 
financial institutions subcommittee said the new standards will 
drive healthy honest sampl operators out of business and precipitate 
the need for another taxpayerfinanced bailout in the future 
instead of going in and removing the crooks we are choosing 
to launch a poison gas attack on the industry and adopting the 
philosophy of kill em all annunzio said 
the unusual opening prayer was offered by del walter fauntroy 
ddc a baptist minister who said that in his 19 years in 
congress he had never felt such a need for divine guidance before 
after the prayer the committee approved 3711 an amendment 
that gonzalez said was intended to protect from a liability 
provision only the frost national bank of san antonio his hometown 
annunzio who favors lessstringent sampl capital standards than 
the administration now wants led the opposition your amendement 
comes at a bad time he told gonzalez everyone is asking for 
private legislation 
immediately afterwards the committee approved an amendment by 
reps elizabeth patterson dsc thomas carper ddel and steve 
bartlett rtexas exempting first interstate and chemical bank 
from financial liability in their acquisition of two institutions 
in texas 
both amendments were unopposed by the administration several 
more calling for similar exemptions were on the committees 
schedule 
gonzalez said his wylies and the administrations new desire 
for stricter capital standards than first sought are the guts of 
this whole issue 
anything less he said will simply mean that we let the 
industry once again roll the dice with taxpayers money 
however sampl supporters and even some of the industrys harshest 
critics in the past expressed fears that a new demand for a cash 
equity infusion that large and that quickly by june 1991 will 
drive 800 to 1200 of the nations 2950 remaining thrifts out of 
business 
the bush administration wants to come in and practice 
euthanasia on institutions that are not in trouble complained 
rep john j lafalce dny a past critic of sampl practices 
these immediate and precipitous demands are going to create a 
bank panic that will bring 10 times as much trouble as we need 
lafalce said bushs initial 90 billion bailout proposal was 
built on the premise that roughly 500 sampls would fail the capital 
test he first sought instead of the 800 to 1200 that would be 
unable to meet the proposed new 225 tangible standard 
if we drive institutions unnecessarily into insolvency it is 
the american taxpayer who will bear the increased cost a far 
greater cost than anyone is presently contemplating he said 
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
estimated the cost to the government of liquidating sampls that fail 
to meet the proposed new tangible capital standard at 130 
billion twice what bushs initial proposal and a senateapproved 
version would cost 
bushs initial proposal unveiled in february called for doubling 
the capital required of sampls from the current 3 percent to 6 
percent but none of that capital under his proposal had to be 
tangible in the form of stock or retained earnings easily 
convertible to cash 
theoretically an sampl could remain in business with no direct 
equity investment by its owners under bushs initial legislative 
initiative 
the house banking committees financial institutions 
subcommittee two weeks ago imposed a 15 percent tangible 
capital requirement as did the senate last week 
both of those actions were praised by administration officials 
who then decided late last week that even more tangible capital 
should be required according to congressional and administration 
sources 
among the 2700 technically solvent sampls at the end of the year 
only about half of their 60 billion in capital was tangible 
the rest 21 billion in socalled supervisory good will 
4 billion in subordinated debt and 3 billion in deferred loan 
losses is all the result of what critics call smoke and 
mirrors accounting practices 
that phantom capital accounting was greatly expanded by 
congress and the reagan administration in the early 1980s to 
encourage healthy sampls to take over sick ones as a way of avoiding 
payouts from the federal deposit insurance fund which is insolvent 
itself

a prosecutor calls it the biggest whitecollar 
crime case in state history with the main trial expected to last 
three months and charges pending in several counties and it all 
concerns a clam 
not just any clam this is about the worlds secondlargest 
species of clam a longnecked ugly thing called a geoduck 
pronounced gooeyduck after an indian word for dig deep 
with about 135 workers washingtons geoduck industry in 1987 
generated 18 million for the state which leases tracts for 
harvesting in puget sound hood canal and other inland marine 
waters state officials said they had no figures on the commercial 
value of the harvest 
at an auction this spring four of 12 bidders won rights to 
seven tracts covering 300 acres at a record average price of 68 
cents a pound said james mckillip of the state department of 
fisheries depending on the catch the state could realize 19 
million to 35 million said bob hoyser a state department of 
natural resources leasing manager 
but booming demand also generated clamscam a complex 
criminal case against seven people and eight corporations and a 
criminal profiteering civil suit against most of the same 
parties and a few others 
the defendants are accused of overharvesting and taking geoducks 
from outside their leased tracts since 1970 
the clams are found along the west coast from british columbia 
to southern california and weigh as much as 10 pounds 
washington and neighboring british columbia have the only 
noteworthy geoduck industries with average known harvests of 46 
million pounds in washington and 10 million pounds in british 
columbia between 1980 and 1985 said mckillip 
in the united states geoduck is frequently used in canned and 
fastfood chowder and occasionally as an entree in restaurants 
its got kind of a sweet taste you can tell when its used 
in chowder said mckillip 
the succulent flesh also is a sushi superstar and topquality 
live geoducks sell for as much as 12 a pound in japan 
but the monster mollusks look well odd with a sinuous brown 
neck or siphon that extends from several inches to a few feet out 
of a shell six inches or longer producing disgust disdain and 
occasional titters at seafood stands 
would you promise me one thing please dont call me the 
geoduck queen pleaded king county deputy prosecutor marilyn b 
brenneman in a telephone interview last week this is the kind of 
case that could follow me the rest of my life 
brian d hodgson 50 of olympia carol k kondo 58 of federal 
way and mark e pearce 37 of olympia each could face life in 
prison if convicted of leading organized crime four others 
including kondos daughter cindy rommel face lesser felony 
charges 
as top officers suppliers and associates of the nowdefunct 
washington king clam inc of fife and related companies they are 
accused of illegally taking more than 1 million pounds of geoducks 
worth at least 18 million 
brenneman called it the largest state whitecollar crime case 
ever tried in washington courts 
two of the nine people initially charged in the criminal case 
have pleaded guilty to reduced charges and agreed to testify for 
the state 
hodgson kondo pearce rommel and another criminal defendant 
also are among those being sued by the state for treble damages an 
amount that could exceed 3 million 
brenneman predicted the king county criminal trial will last at 
least three months with testimony from 130 to 150 of the 180 
potential witnesses she has listed she also planned to present 
1000 to 2000 of the 70000 bank records shipping receipts and 
other documents identified as potential evidence 
jury selection began last week and was expected to run at least 
through late this week court officials said 
charges involving other areas of puget sound and hood canal are 
pending in kitsap mason jefferson and pierce counties 
washington king clam formed in 1970 by hodgson with kondo 
holding a minority interest led in developing the export trade and 
in recent years controlled 90 percent of the states geoduck 
industry mckillip said 
documents filed by prosecutor norm maleng said about 40 former 
washington king clam employees or business associates told of 
illegal harvesting of the brobdingnagian bivalves since the company 
was formed 
dan donohoe of the prosecutors office said the 20month 
investigation unearthed a pattern of crimes that began as far back 
as 1970 and continued over the years with the most recent incident 
last october 
with the filing of charges last fall the state canceled five 
leases to geoduck harvest by then owned by a japanese company and 
principals in the case were banished from further bidding

president bush said today he wants former 
president reagan to take on various missions and assignments in 
the foreign policy field 
answering reporters questions as he and reagan began a meeting 
at the former presidents office here bush said he wanted to keep 
reagan fully informed about world events 
the president also said that in his talks with some 35 world 
leaders since taking office last jan 20 he has found that the 
respect for him reagan around the world knows no bounds 
i hope i can talk him into various missions and assignments as 
time goes by bush said as he sat next to the man he served as 
vice president for eight years 
reagan said he considers the white house in good hands as 
bush nears the 100day mark of his presidency and that his 
successor was doing fine 
bush did not specify what assignments he was considering giving 
to reagan and the former president did not respond to bushs 
statement about his plan 
but bush did say that i have a lot more to learn from 
president reagan and i learned a lot about principle and the world 
as it really is i wanted to talk to him about change abroad 
get his advice 
neither bush nor reagan would respond to reporters questions 
about the irancontra trial of fired white house aide oliver north 
on grounds the matter was still before the courts heres one 
where i think were both in the same boat reagan said 
reporters had asked reagan whether he had been aware of white 
house documents that were never seen by the congressional 
investigative committees 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said tuesday that 
bush has talked by phone to reagan a few times bush chatting with 
reporters aboard air force one earlier this week said i dont 
ever say what i talk to the president about 
but then bush did acknowledge he had called reagan recently to 
discuss news reports that quoted bush aides anonymously as making 
disparaging statements about reagan i thought an explanation was 
in order the president said 
one such story which had unnamed bush aides mocking reagans 
laidback management style led white house chief of staff john 
sununu to warn presidential aides against making such statements 
the bushreagan meeting comes at a time when bush is making 
highprofile public appearances aimed at restating administration 
themes as bush nears the 100day mark of his presidency 
bush put in a 14hour day in california tuesday giving a 
businessoriented speech at the ford aerospace plant in palo alto 
then visiting a 213acre ranch in the orange county hill country 
that had been a drug distribution center 
he was reunited with hispanic republican supporters on the 
campus of the university of california at los angeles and wound up 
the day by watching major league baseballs baltimore orioles beat 
the california angels 81 at anaheim stadium 
many of you know the history of the ground we stand on said 
bush as he stood before huge stacks of money more than 4 
million seized in the raid that broke up the drugdealing center 
once a warehouse of death now its a source of hope he 
said 
speaking to the hispanic audience bush noted that he soon was 
to meet with one of americas greatest presidents im talking 
about californias alwaysfavorite son and my good friend ronald 
reagan 
the former president and his wife nancy are enjoying their 
retirement here said reagan spokesman mark weinberg he said the 
reagans spend a considerable amount of time answering mail and will 
continue to travel and speak 
but the former president has not attracted huge crowds at some 
public speaking engagements and he recently waived his 50000 
honorarium when a smallerthanexpected crowd turned out for a 
speech at arizona state university 
in his more than three months in office bush also has distanced 
himself from some reagan policies and has adopted a more energetic 
presidential management style 
bush though a lifelong member of the national rifle 
association has moved to limit the proliferation of assaulttype 
weapons by imposing a ban on imports of many of these guns 
unlike reagan he moved quickly to strike a bipartisan agreement 
with congress that essentially puts the united states on a 
diplomatic rather than military course in seeking democratic 
reforms in nicaragua 
bush also has proposed a more farreaching ethics package and 
will likely seek a strengthening of the clean water act a more 
environmentalist position than reagan took

rain fell in parts of bangladesh on 
wednesday after people across the country prayed for an end to a 
drought that threatens to destroy almost 50 percent of the rice 
crop 
hours after the prayer by more than 75000 moslems led by 
president hussain muhammad ershad it rained in the capital of 
dhaka and three other districts the weather bureau said 
the rain 16 inches to 96 inches was not enough to ease 
drought conditions but it was a welcome relief 
religious affairs minister nizamuddin al azad said people knelt 
in mosques temples churches and pagodas across the nation to pray 
for rain thousands more could not attend the ceremonies because of 
traffic jams 
about 26 of the countrys 63 administrative districts have been 
suffering by a lack of rainfall agriculture is the main occupation 
of most of the countrys 110 million people 
some areas have irrigation channels and pumps but most of the 
canals ran dry when subterranean ground water levels plunged news 
reports said 
bangladesh one of the worlds poorest countries with a per 
capita annual income of 160 alternates between flood and drought 
last summer more than 1400 people died in floods that submerged 
fourfifths of the lowlying nation 
bangladesh produces about 17 million tons of grains a year the 
target of the spring rice crop which has been affected this year 
by the drought was 56 million tons 
in addition bangladesh imports about 2 million tons of grains a 
year to meet the shortfall of 15 million tons in production and 
build a reserve 
the drought and the hot weather has also threatened operations 
at the countrys lone hydroelectric power plant near the southern 
port city of chittagong about 120 miles southeast of dhaka the 
project was set up in the mid1960s by the united states 
weather forecasters say there will be no respite from the 
drought for another two weeks and a hot spell will aggravate the 
situation in the coming days 
an agriculture ministry official said nearly half the crop would 
be destroyed if the drought persisted a few more days 
i fear the crop loss may be 50 percent of the total no rains 
in the next few days may spell disaster for agriculture the 
official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
a senior government official said monday the government had 
sufficient grain reserves to prevent people from starving 
the government is determined that no one will die for want of 
food said relief minister sirajul hussain khan

minister saying his age 75 and his health problems as a 
diabetic should disqualify him nevertheless many observers 
believe he would serve if asked 
ito served as acting prime minister nearly 10 years ago 
following the sudden death of his political mentor prime minister 
masayoshi ohira 
it was a difficult time for the liberal democrats they had just 
suffered serious losses in an election called by ohira then 
divided by internal battles the governing party lost a 
noconfidence vote in parliament 
national elections followed less than two weeks later 
under itos stewardship the governing party closed ranks and 
won zenko suzuki became prime minister in july 1980 and named ito 
as foreign minister 
ito served in that capacity until 1982 when he resigned in a 
dispute over relations between japan and the united states 
after a summit meeting the opposition objected when the 
government used the term alliance to describe the japaneseus 
ties the government blamed itos ministry for failing to explain 
the term did not imply japan would build up its military or be 
dragged into future us wars 
ito resigned in typical japanese fashion to accept 
responsibility for mixup a move that further bolstered his 
reputation for integrity 
hideo sato dean of the university of tsukubas college of 
international relations said japan would do well to offer ito the 
job 
i think we need exactly that kind of person to cope with the 
crisis sato said ito is a lowprofile person a consensus 
builder he is apparently not involved in big moneymaking 
connections with business 
ito also has no party power base of his own and is instead a 
member of a faction headed by kiichi miyazawa a former prime 
minister hopeful who was forced to resign as finance minister due 
to ties with recruit 
ito a 1936 graduate of the prestigious law faculty of tokyo 
university which has produced much of japans postwar elite was 
elected to the house of representatives for eight straight terms 
from a prefecture in northern japan 
his first term in elected office began in 1963 after he rode 
the bureaucratic fast track to the posts of vice minister of 
agriculture and forestry and director general of the fisheries 
agency 
ito served as chairman of the policy affairs research council 
one of the partys top three positions under takeshitas 
predecessor yasuhiro nakasone

under the handy but artificial deadline of 100 
days president bush is receiving the first report card of his 
presidency before any real test of his ability to handle the job 
the early assessments offer neither rave reviews nor harsh 
criticism bush wins praise for his outstretched bipartisan hand 
and his open style but catches grief for what he might call the 
vision thing his failure to articulate any direction other than 
an intention to pursue a moderate version of reaganism 
even mikhail s gorbachev has expressed impatience with how long 
it is taking the new administration to complete its foreign policy 
review 
perhaps the most difficult ordeal of the bush administrations 
first months was the fight over his nomination of former texas sen 
john tower to be secretary of defense 
the senate rejected the nomination after a long partisan 
bloodletting an event sure to leave scars but despite widespread 
expectations that it signalled congress intent to challenge the 
new president for dominance the bitter fight has largely faded 
from memory 
in fact bushs willingness to work with the 
democraticcontrolled congress has led to compromises on the budget 
and contra aid issues on which the reagan administration never 
came close to agreement with the democrats 
i think hes done a pretty good job said senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine mitchell said benchmarks like 
100day assessments were completely arbitrary simply a 
creation of others 
while there is no magic to the 100day mark bush himself walked 
into that trap the day after his landslide victory he said we 
will now have 70whatever days it is to formulate a game plan a 
first 100 days priorities if you will and theyll be specific 
and i will do my level best to fulfill my commitments to the 
american people 
no such specific game plan emerged either during the transition 
or in his inaugural address which was more an exercise in setting 
a stylistic tone than spelling out an agenda 
a good start was the presidents own lowkey assessment of 
his first three months in office 
he cited bipartisan agreements with congress on the budget and 
contra aid and his plan to stabilize the troubled savings and loan 
industry 
presidential scholar james david barber of duke university was 
less generous i think his grade is incomplete we still have yet 
to see what hes going to do if anything 
but the ultimate tests of presidents are events that adhere to 
no timetables 
let the economy turn sour the stock market drop or interest 
rates inflation or unemployment jump or let americas image 
abroad be shaken by a terrorist act or other foreign policy crisis 
and the public will take its measure of the presidents 
philosophical bearings and leadership ability 
bush has not yet faced a major crisis his predecessors ronald 
reagan and jimmy carter are remembered far differently for their 
ability to deal with hard times 
few presidents could match reagans skill dealing with 
adversity whether it was the prolonged recession that marked his 
first two years in the white house or the deaths of 241 american 
servicemen in 1983 when a terrorist bomb destroyed a us marine 
barracks in lebanon 
few presidents showed less talent for dealing with adversity 
than carter who was unable to deflect public unease over an 
economy battered by opec and the frustration that built during the 
iranian hostage crisis 
at the hundredday mark of their administrations reagan and 
carter either couldnt predict or didnt recognize the events on 
which their terms would be judged 
carter began with the image of a president with a distinctive 
style who knew where he wanted to go he gave a positive assessment 
of his first 100 days citing his energy program nuclear arms 
reduction proposals and emphasis on human rights 
four years later reagan was firmly in charge and looking 
certain to win congressional approval of his tax and budget cutting 
proposals he weathered an assassination attempt and gave a clear 
demonstration of the style and wit that would serve him so well 
throughout his presidency 
while reagan was president he clearly was the dominant figure 
in washington 
is bush somehow less a commanding figure than his predecessor 
for six of his eight years reagan had a republican senate 
said mitchell i think there was a marked difference between 
reagans first six years and his last two when the democrats were 
back in control of the senate i think the fairer test is 
bushs first months against reagans last two years and there i 
think the difference is not so great 
the maine democrat called bushs effort to reach out to congress 
a marked improvement over the reagan years he cited the 
agreement on contra aid which he said was an initiative of his 
administration 
but bush didnt escape free of criticism mitchell said there 
was a complete failure of leadership on the alaska oil spill 
and he criticized bushs stands on legislation to increase the 
minimum wage and to intervene in the eastern air lines strike 
both he and we recognize there will be differences said 
mitchell

the bush administration came down wednesday on 
the side of the changes soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has 
engineered in the communist party leadership and said it hoped the 
result would be a strengthening of democratization and openness 
in a statement the administration described gorbachevs purge 
of 74 central committee full voting members and the promotion of 
several of the soviet leaders proteges as dramatic and stressed 
they were a matter of internal soviet policy 
but the administration then went on express hope that whatever 
changes occur their effect is to strengthen and promote the reform 
process in the soviet union toward greater democratization and 
openness 
the statement was read by margaret tutwiler the state 
department spokeswoman in response to questions at the 
departments daily press brefing secretary of state james a baker 
iii will hold talks in moscow may 1011 with gorbachev and foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
they are expected to set a date for a resumption of ussoviet 
negotiations to reduce longrange nuclear missiles and to discuss 
prospects for arabisraeli negotiations baker also may make 
preliminary preparations with gorbachev and shevardnadze for a 
summit meeting between president bush and the soviet leader 
bakr last week praised the economic reform program gorbachev has 
undertaken but said the soviet leader could be in trouble unless 
there are consumer goods on the table and in the markets 
baker told the american society of newspaper editors that the 
risk to the soviet leader could come from opponents of change 
entrenched elements of the bureaucracy and from sources of 
nationalistic discontent 
he said gorbachevs economic program known in russian as 
perestroika was in the best interest of the united states and the 
world because it would lead to a more secure and stable soviet 
union 
we very much want perestroika to succeed baker said in 
response to a question after a speech we very much want the 
general secretary to succeed 
but baker said political reform in the soviet union was 
proceeding faster than economic reform that might trigger 
something he said these things generally have to proceed 
apace 
the purged 74 party officials and another 35 nonvoting members 
who also were jettisoned represented a potential source of 
opposition to gorbachevs reforms 
the situation has changed considerably comrades gorbachev 
said after the removal of nearly onefourth of the central 
committee membership vast changes have taken place over this 
period also in state bodies and this required personnel changes

the comedians tv son 
miss ball died of a ruptured aorta at cedarssinai medical 
center in los angeles wednesday morning hospital officials said

playing the drums at age 2 was a professional drummer at age 4 and 
is now drummer with david and the giants a christian rock group 
he lives in jackson with his wife kathy a ballerina

federal regulators on wednesday took a first 
step in considering whether to approve a merger of southern 
california edison and san diego gas amp electric a hotly contested 
deal that would create the nations largest private utility 
the case has broad implications for the electric power industry 
including a possible impact on legal and political clashes over 
utilities use of their monopolistic powers 
the federal energy regulatory commission voted to send the 
proposed california merger to an administrative law judge for 
hearings on a limited number of issues the judge would then 
recommend a final action by the commission 
last week stockholders of the two utilities approved the deal 
under which southern california edisons parent company scecorp 
based in rosemead would acquire san diego gas amp electric in a 
stock swap valued at about 256 billion the surviving company 
would be controlled by scecorp 
the deal requires approval by a variety of regulatory agencies 
including the california public utilities commission and the 
federal energy regulatory commission 
the san diego utility serves 1 million customers in san diego 
county and parts of orange county southern california edison has 
38 million customers in central and southern california 
the two utilities have pledged to cut power rates for san diego 
commercial industrial and agricultural customers by 5 percent and 
to make a 10 percent reduction in rates for residential customers 
this would mean a savings to customers over the next decade of 17 
billion the companies have said 
san diego and several other california cities as well as the 
state attorney general and some utility industry associations are 
opposed to the proposed merger on a variety of grounds mainly that 
it would dimnish competition 
the city of san diego has raised especially strong objections 
it has accused southern california edison of coercing the san diego 
utility into agreeing to the merger 
a legal petition by the city includes depositions from two 
former members of the san diego gas amp electric board of directors 
who testified under oath that southern california edison 
inflicted transmission access problems on its merger target 
the city claims this was done to pressure san diego gas amp electric 
to agree 
the federal energy regulatory commission earlier said there was 
not enough evidence of coercion to formally consider the matter 
but in its order wednesday the commission said it would allow the 
city of san diego to present more information 
in its order to the administrative law judge the commission 
rejected a request by a group of california cities including 
riverside and anaheim to deny the merger before holding hearings 
the cities contend the merger is anticompetitive 
the federal order also rejected a request by the city of san 
diego that the mergers possible environmental implications be made 
part of the review process 
the commission said that based on currently available 
information the proposed merger raised no issues that would 
require an environmental impact statement it added however that 
it might reconsider the matter if new evidence arose later in the 
merger review 
among the issues to be considered at the administrative law 
hearing are the probable effects of the merger on utility rates and 
the expected benefits of integrating the two merging companies 
electrical generation and transmission systems 
no date was set for the hearings the companies merger 
agreement of last year sets a deadline of march 31 1990 for 
gaining final regulatory approval

the death toll from a killer apparently stalking 
prostitutes and drug users rose to nine wednesday as investigators 
tentatively identified another body left along a southeastern 
massachusetts highway 
authorities said an autopsy on the ninth victim found monday 
along interstate 195 in marion yielded a preliminary 
identification but they declined to release the name pending 
confirmation with dental records 
police said the position of the body and other details matched 
those of the previous eight victims all women ages 25 to 36 who 
lived in or near the seaport of new bedford 
but investigators declined to make the details public citing a 
rash of false confessions 
we have people who have come in here and confessed to these 
crimes but we ask them how did you do it what transpired how 
did you leave the women and the information they give is just 
very wrong said jim martin a spokesman for the bristol county 
district attorneys office 
accounts by a highway worker and others who found the bodies 
have led to speculation that the women have been strangled with 
their clothing and left face down or in fetal positions but 
almost any conversation on a new bedford street is likely to yield 
a new theory 
none of the murders appears to be recent forensic experts said 
the bodies all found since july had been lying along the highways 
for months 
despite the decomposed state of the bodies investigators have 
been able to identify all of the previous eight as drug users or 
prostitutes 
bristol county district attorney ronald a pina has said he has 
several suspects and a grand jury has been hearing evidence for 
months but no indictments have been issued

its the kind of story william saroyan 
might have written if he were still alive 
the plot 
what to do with the ashes of the late author that is to say the 
half of his ashes that werent sent to soviet armenia after he died 
in 1981 at age 72 
the characters in this human comedy to borrow the title of 
saroyans most popular novel 
friends who want his remaining ashes interred in the local 
armenian cemetery topped by a monument fitting for fresnos famous 
native son 
the william saroyan foundation which isnt certain what 
should be done with saroyans ashes 
newspaper columnist eli setencich who is having the time of 
his life writing about saroyans ashes 
it was setencich who started the fuss by writing in his fresno 
bee column last week that half of saroyans ashes still were 
sitting on a shelf in a local mortuary and some folks were 
thinking of putting them in ararat cemetery 
an associated press story about setencichs musings drew the 
attention of robert setrakian president of the william saroyan 
foundation in san francisco which was one of the places saroyan 
spent time when he wasnt in fresno or paris 
setrakian wrote a letter to ben amirkhanian one of the fresno 
folks who favors a move to the cemetery for saroyans ashes which 
are encased in an urn carrying an inscription that calls saroyan an 
author and humanitarian 
frankly i find this whole article disturbing what with the 
apparent cavalier approach by some of mr saroyans friends as 
well intentioned as they may be setrakian wrote 
the letter pointed out that saroyan directed that upon his death 
he be cremated and half of his ashes be taken to an appropriate 
location in armenia 
the directive quoted by setrakian makes no mention of any 
desired final resting place for the other half of his ashes 
whether on a shelf or wherever 
setrakian insisted however that the foundation has legal 
control of the ashes he said trustees would consult with saroyans 
sister cosette saroyan about her wishes 
amirkhanian said tuesday saroyans sister thought it was a 
wonderful idea to build a monument at the cemetery and he would 
work with the foundation in an attempt to locate the ashes there 
setencich concluded on wednesday that saroyan probably is up 
there somewhere enjoying the squabble over his ashes and writing 
a neat story about it

more than 80 influential palestinians in the 
occupied territories wednesday turned down prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs plan for elections leading to an interim solution to the 
palestinianisraeli conflict 
in their first formal response to the shamir proposal the 
palestinian leaders said no elections could be held while israel 
maintained forces in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
they derided the shamir plan as a stalling tactic aimed at 
ending the 16monthold palestinian uprising and called for 
negotiations with the plo within the framework of an 
international conference until the establishment of a palestinian 
state many of the statements signers are proplo figures 
shamirs plan calls for elections to select palestinians from 
the occupied territories to hold talks with israel on an interim 
solution for the troubled region after two years discussions 
would begin toward a permanent solution 
shamir rules out any participation by the plo which israel 
considers a terrorist organization and says there never will be an 
independent palestinian state in the territories 
the plan outlined by shamir during a visit to washington 
earlier this month won the cautious approval of president bush 
but the soviet union and major arab states such as egypt and 
jordan have said they favor an international conference under un 
auspices 
shamirs top spokesmen could not be reached for comment because 
of the passover holiday 
alon liel foreign ministry spokesman said i realize the 
difficulty the palestinians are having with the fact that shamir is 
speaking about an interim agreement and is not indicating anything 
about the final status but he said that israelis fear the gap 
between the two sides is too great to bridge without a phased 
approach 
i want to stress that the israeli thinking is if we start from 
the end we wont have a beginning liel said this is the idea 
behind the stepbystep approach that was accepted by the 
americans 
the palestinians statement issued in arab and english 
described the shamir plan as calculated to appeal to the media 
to end the uprising and to win time it insisted that the plo is 
the sole legitimate representative of the palestinian people 
and that any election plan that excluded the plo was an attempt 
to divide our people into inside and outside palestinians 
the statement did not rule out elections entirely but said they 
must come in a framework that would lead to formation of a 
palestinian state 
this isolated occurrence of elections does not illustrate how 
it will lead to the end of the occupation and to palestinian 
national independence it said 
the united nations it said should be authorized to administer 
the territories during a transitional period to palestinian 
statehood 
chief among the 83 signers of the document was faisal husseini 
of arab east jerusalem who has met with egyptian officials on the 
shamir plan he earlier met with israeli officials on their peace 
proposals 
husseini is considered the main spokesman for the plo in the 
occupied territories and he was held in jail without charges for 
most of the uprising 
others who signed the document included university professor 
sari nusseibeh of jerusalem haidar abd alshafi head of the red 
crescent society in gaza gabi baramki head of beir zeit 
university mayor hilme hanoun of tulkarem and audeh alranteesi 
an anglican priest from ramallah

environmental groups and six states called on 
the interior department on wednesday to strengthen regulations 
being used as guides in estimating damage to natural resources from 
the alaska oil spill 
the present regulations which interior officials have confirmed 
are being used in negotiations with exxon corp already are the 
subject of a lawsuit claiming they are too lax on polluters and 
prevent adequate compensation for major oil or toxic chemical 
spills 
the regulations place an absurdly low value on wildlife and 
other resources maintained joan claybrook president of public 
citizen an advocacy group which is among those who have challenged 
the regulations in court 
the critics asked in a letter to interior secretary manuel lujan 
that the regulations be rewritten so that more than market 
value of destroyed resources is used in assessing recovery costs 
in a longterm settlement on damages caused by the alaska spill 
in addition to ms claybrook the authors of the letter included 
the attorneys general of ohio colorado maine texas rhode island 
and connecticut the regulations also have been criticized by the 
national wildlife federation and officials of a number of other 
states as being too easy on polluters 
interior department officials acknowledged in interviews tuesday 
that the government has agreed to use guidelines giving polluters 
the option of paying only the market value of resources they 
destroy rather than the cost of restoring the environment to its 
prespill condition if the market value is cheaper 
the decision comes despite administration promises to seek 
complete restoration of losses from the exxon valdez tanker 
spill that has fouled alaskas wildliferich prince william sound 
the regulations in question stem from the 1980 superfund law 
which required interior to establish guidelines on assessing damage 
resulting from an oil spill or discharge of toxic chemicals 
the regulations were supposed to make it easier for states and 
federal trustees of public lands to recover damages but interior 
took nearly six years to draw them up and according to critics 
did so in 1986 substantially along the lines sought by the oil 
industry 
the rules are there they make sense and were going to start 
to use them said cecil hoffman a senior interior official 
involved with the damage assessment effort the intent is that 
were going to set a dollar value on the damages 
ms hoffman said however that the regulations are viewed as a 
framework for making the assessments and do not necessarily 
preclude other actions being taken 
the rules however are under challenge in the federal courts 
three environmental groups and 10 states have filed suit accusing 
interior of violating the superfund law by making the regulations 
too lax 
in february six weeks before the exxon spill the justice 
department vigorously defended the regulations at a hearing before 
the us court of appeals in washington no decision has yet been 
made by the court 
the rules create a myriad of economic scientific and 
administrative obstacles to the recovery of funds needed to restore 
damaged resources maintains eric glitzenstein an attorney for 
public citizen 
erik olson an lawyer for the national wildlife federation 
another plaintiff in the suit said if the damage assessments are 
determined under interiors regulatory guidelines exxon could well 
escape substantial liability 
during the recent court hearing justice department attorneys 
defended the reliance on use value and market value to 
determine damages on natural resources lawyers for the 
environmental groups and states argued that total cost of 
restoration and replacement should be required 
under some guidelines the value of a seal might be as little as 
15 because that has been determined as the value of its pelt 
while a seabird such as the puffin might be merely 788 the 
environmental lawyers said 
other plaintiffs in the suit which was filed last year are the 
environmental defense fund and the states of new york new jersey 
ohio california connecticut colorado massachusetts maine 
rhode island and vermont

officials have embraced a daylight 
rule to ban kissing and other affectionate displays between 
students but the american civil liberties union says the rule 
smacks of violating constitutional rights 
the daylight rule which means daylight must be visible between 
students was enacted at nederland school last week about 270 
students grades 7 through 12 attend the rural mountain school 
west of boulder which offers many teenagers their primary meeting 
place 
as a faculty we just got tired of saying things to kids about 
kissing in the hallways said teacher marsha skaro 
students who violate the rule get a written warning a second 
offense merits a letter to parents a parentstudent conference 
with school authorities is required for the third further 
discipline is not specified 
boulder county schools superintendent jim hagar said the rule is 
the schools prerogative 
however david miller regional legal director of the aclu said 
discipline beyond notification of parents could threaten 
constitutional rights of privacy and freedom of association as 
soon as they start to discipline somebody then we at the aclu will 
take the matter very seriously miller said tuesday 
students said they resent the crackdown as a violation of basic 
human rights that will only drive them into surrounding forests 
i think the teachers are going way too far said danny 
brennan 16 im friends with a lot of girls and now i cant 
even touch them 
i think its kind of dumb said stephanie dewey 16 who had 
been caught with the arm of dave lund 17 around her shoulders 
the teacher told us to be careful but dave goes ill 
put my arm around my girlfriend if i want to we got written up

demonstrations that led to some arrests a crush of reporters and 
television cameras recording both spontaneous and planned news 
conferences and competing rallies that spilled over to the nearby 
us capitol grounds

constitutional right to privacy and a missouri law restricting 
abortions 
outside the building the arguments were less formal as more 
than 200 demonstrators and onlookers milled about 
not the church not the state women must decide our fate 
chanted a group of abortion rights demonstrators they later

tempered by the current court makeup 
there are four new justices since the court legalized abortion 
nationwide in 1973 three of them appointed by thenpresident 
reagan 
were very concerned about the reagan influence on the 
court she said adding that a ruling upholding the missouri 
regulations while not banning abortions could end access to 
abortions for the young and the poor 
a stream of speakers filed to a bank of microphones on the court 
plaza when the morning argument session ended 
james bopp general counsel to the national right to life 
committee said opponents of the missouri law are seeking to 
expand the right to abortion the question is whether the court is 
ready to make that right more absolute 
next in line was st louis lawyer frank susman who had just 
completed his arguments opposing the missouri regulations 
cutting through any legalese susman said he would offer a 
sound bite to sum up his views that the court should reaffirm its 
historic 1973 decision roe vs wade 
roe works susman said you cannot put the cork back in 
the bottle you cant turn the clock back 16 years

the importation of millions of baseballstyle 
cloth caps from china does not threaten material injury to the 
american headgear industry the us international trade commission 
said wednesday 
the commission voted 60 to reject an antidumping petition 
filed by the headwear institute of america representing 32 us 
enterprises the petition sought to establish that the chinese caps 
were being sold at an unfairly low price that threatened harm to 
us producers 
if the commission had approved the petition additional duties 
of about 20 percent would have been added to the price of 
chinesemade cloth caps hats and visors 
the commission found that 367 million worth of the headgear 
covered in the case was sold last year in the united states half 
of it imported 
chinese shipments last year representing 28 percent of the 
value of all such imports amounted to 78468000 caps and visors 
with an import cost of 515 million even more came from taiwan 
which accounted for 31 percent of the imports while 27 percent of 
the foreignmade headgear came from south korea 
us cap manufacturers employing 4895 people are scattered 
about the country with many concentrated in missouri iowa and 
kansas the commission said

watering hole 
much of the bidding was subdued a set of steer horns fetched

advocates of food irradiation called on 
wednesday for widespread use of the controversial processing 
technique in the united states to help prevent health risks from 
infected poultry and other food 
it is estimated that nearly 40 percent of the poultry sold in 
this country contains deadly salmonella bacteria said david 
rothbard president of the committee for a constructive tomorrow a 
washingtonbased group promoting food irradiation 
rothbard told a news conference that this bacteria infects 
more than 2 million americans annually and is responsible for at 
least 2000 deaths each year 
he said irradiation can be effective in dealing with salmonella 
bacteria as well as other microorganisms parasites and insect 
pests in food which present serious health risks 
opponents of food irradiation contend that the process creates 
new chemicals in food some of which may be harmful 
they have also voiced concern over potential nuclear 
contamination of the environment from radioactive isotopes 
cobalt60 and cesium137 which are used in the irradiation 
process 
rothbard noted that maine has already adopted legislation 
banning food irradiation and a similar bill is likely to pass the 
massachusetts and new jersey legislatures many other states are 
considering similar measures 
he said his organization was launching a national grass roots 
program designed to educate citizens and government officials about 
the benefits of this safe technology 
rothbard contended that opponents of food irradiation have 
relied on flawed scientific studies and used scare tactics to 
block widespread use of the processing technique 
the committee for a constructive tomorrow describes itself as a 
newly formed nonprofit group that promotes freemarket and safe 
technological solutions to various consumer and environmental 
concerns 
rothbard said the groups funding comes from individual 
contributions foundations and corporations but he declined to 
provide details about specific foundations and companies involved 
with the effort 
also appearing at the news conference was edward s josephson a 
biochemist representing the council for agricultural science and 
technology a nonprofit organization based in ames iowa 
supported by 28 professional societies involved with food and 
agriculture 
there is no single confirmed piece of evidence that eating 
irradiated food can be harmful to health he said 
josephson said that while food irradiation currently is being 
used in the united states only to process spices elsewhere around 
the world it is being utilized with 14 foods in 20 countries 
including france japan and the soviet union 
jason liles an aide to rep douglas bosco dcalif said bosco 
was planning to introduce in the house within the next few days a 
bill that would rescind a 1986 decision by the food and drug 
administration permitting sale of pork and certain vegetables that 
have been irradiated 
the legislation also would call for the national academy of 
sciences to determine whether food irradiation is safe majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine is planning to introduce a 
companion bill in the senate liles said 
sharin sachs a spokeswoman for the us department of 
agricultures food safety and inspection service said that in fall 
1987 usda asked the fda for clearance to propose use of irradiation 
on poultry to date however the department has received no 
response from the fda she said 
in january 1986 usda approved the use of lowdose irradiation 
on fresh pork to sexually sterilize microscopic worms to prevent 
them from multiplying within the body and causing the disease 
trichinosis 
groups opposed to food irradiation include the san 
franciscobased coalition to stop food irradiation 
denis mosgofian the organizations director said last july 
that scientific studies showing adverse effects have been ignored 
or suppressed one study he said found chromosome damage in 
humans four weeks after they ate freshly irradiated wheat 
irradiation of food actually changes the food rearranges its 
chemistry creates new chemicals many of which are toxic 
mosgofian said irradiated food has been shown repeatedly to 
produce adverse effects to both animals and humans who consumed 
it

sitting in the audience as the supreme court 
heard arguments on abortion wednesday was jane roe a texas 
cleaning woman whose case brought the 1973 landmark roe vs wade 
decision legalizing abortions 
roe whose real name is norma mccorvey has emerged from 
anonymity to enter the public fight over abortion and to argue that 
the decision she won should be preserved 
im very overwhelmed she acknowledged seeming a bit 
bewildered as she met with reporters away from the hectic scene of 
demonstrators outside the supreme court 
mccorvey 41 answered questions with great difficulty 
stumbling through a nineline written statement and later questions 
but assisted by her attorney gloria allred mccorvey disputed 
suggestions she has been used in the case and said she has stepped 
forward at considerable risk because she still believes in the 
cause of a womans right to an abortion 
our law is in jeopardy for all the women of the united 
states she said i have to protect roe vs wade 
allred a feminist lawyer from los angeles said mccorvey has 
been in hiding in los angeles since april 4 when someone fired 
three shotgun blasts into her dallas home as she slept hitting 
windows and the front door 
norma feels that it is likely that the attack was made by a 
person or persons who oppose the roe vs wade decision and who wish 
to frighten her out of speaking about the issue she said she 
has also in the past been subjected to other forms of harassment 
as a result mccorvey was accompanied by security guards who 
checked credentials and searched some bags of reporters meeting 
with her 
mccorvey as jane roe said she agreed to become a test case in 
the legal challenge of antiabortion laws when she became pregnant 
with a second child in 1970 she said she considered an illegal 
abortion and was revolted by conditions at a visit to a backalley 
abortionist 
but she didnt have an abortion instead she gave birth and put 
her child up for adoption without knowing even its gender her 
lawyer said mccorvey considered the experience far more traumatic 
to her than an abortion would have been 
yet mccorvey said she has recently begun efforts to locate that 
adopted child whose conception triggered the landmark case 
allred who says she is not assisting in that search insists 
theres no irony or inconsistency there the whole point is its 
about a womans right to choose she said 
so what would norma mccorvey once jane roe say to this child 
well i obviously wouldnt discuss politics right away she 
said id just say im your mom how about a hug 
allred said mccorvey has only a modest income cleans other 
peoples homes for a living and has a 10th grade education a 
movie is being made of her life and she is receiving money as a 
consultant on the project she has also set up a jane roe 
foundation to finance her security and conduct prochoice 
activities

the prime minister wednesday presented 
parliament with three bills that would normalize relations between 
the communist state and the roman catholic church and guarantee the 
church autonomy 
passage of the bills expected next month will clear the way to 
establishing diplomatic relations between the polish peoples 
republic and the vatican the vatican for years has refused to 
grant relations until the local churchs status is resolved 
proclaiming the start of a new era prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski introduced the package in a speech to the 
460member sejm or parliament that dwelt on the long rocky 
history of churchstate relations after communists came to power in 
1944 the legislation was agreed to by church negotiators earlier 
this month 
to a large degree it formalizes freedoms that the church had 
already won in practice for itself and the more than 90 percent of 
polands 38 million people who consider themselves roman catholic 
one bill defines the states attitude toward the church as a 
sovereign organization operating within the constitution but free 
to manage all its internal affairs a second bill grants equal 
rights to all denominations bars discrimination based on religion 
and guarantees freedom of worship the third bill entitles clergy 
to state oldage pensions 
the bills were referred to an extraordinary committee pending 
the next meeting of the sejm in may 
it is a historical event said professor stanislaw stomma a 
catholic lawyer and former sejm deputy who participated in many of 
the early battles with the state over church issues 
the negotiations were long because of political reasons but 
now the situation is mature and it is a wise step on both sides a 
great new historical fact he said in an interview with the 
associated press 
rakowski told the sejm it will be up to historians to 
determine the scope of the responsibility and the fault of the 
sides which participated in the historic argument over the role of 
the catholic church in the socialist system today we have those 
arguments behind us we live in a different era 
but he implied that much of the blame rested with the 
authorities generally revolutions do not tolerate dialogue 
rakowski said 
rakowski noted that meetings between the head of the communist 
party and the head of the polish church were so rare in the 1970s 
as to be sensations every time but in the last eight years he 
said first secretary wojciech jaruzelski and primate cardinal 
jozef glemp have met 14 times contacts between provincial party 
leaders and local bishops also have become routine he said 
after world war ii communist leaders abrogated the prewar 
agreement giving the legal basis for church activities in poland 
and the episcopate was forced to wage a constant battle for the 
churchs survival in the years that followed 
in the stalinistera drive to strip the society of religion 
church properties were seized heavy taxes were levied on parishes 
seminarians were drafted into the army bishops faced show trials 
and the unbowed primate cardinal stefan wyszynski of warsaw was 
held under guard in harsh conditions for three years in 195356 
unions of patriotic priests opposed to the church hierarchy 
were set up and pax a catholic lay group loyal to the 
authorities was created with the right to publish religious works 
wyszynski was released in october 1956 as wladyslaw gomulka came 
to power replacing the stalinist boleslaw bierut but gomulka 
continued a cold war against the church virtually forbidding 
construction of churches and attempting to restrict the teaching of 
catechism to children

a congressional report shows that political 
appointees are taking over midlevel federal jobs traditionally 
held by career civil servants a house subcommittee chairman said 
wednesday 
rep gerry sikorski dminn chairman of the human resources 
subcommittee of the committee on post office and civil service 
released a general accounting office report showing that 64 
political appointees in 18 agencies had recently been converted to 
career status 
the increasing number of conversions of political appointees 
into career positions is troubling especially where they 
infiltrate midlevel management positions traditionally held by 
longtime civil servants sikorski said 
sikorski called upon the bush administration to implement some 
of the recommendations of the privately financed national 
commission on the public service which has recommended among other 
things a decrease in the ratio of political to career employees 
the commission in recommendations submitted to the president 
last month called for reducing the number of political apointees 
from 3000 to 2000 
the gao said that in its survey which covered the last quarter 
of 1988 42 agencies reported that they had not named any political 
appointees to career positions 
eighteen agencies reported 64 such appointments 29 of which had 
actually been made earlier but not reported said the gao an 
investigative arm of congress 
fiftythree of the appointments were made competitively and 11 
were noncompetitive according to the gao report 
a task force of the national commission on the public service 
in a report submitted to members of congress on tuesday said 
the more of these midlevel management positions that are 
converted to political appointments the more civil servants are 
forced to recognize that they are in deadend career tracks 
in the report it submitted to the president the commission said 
federal civilian employment has held remarkably steady over the 
past three decades even as the number of presidential appointees 
has doubled then doubled again 
there is growing evidence that excessive numbers of 
presidential appointees may actually undermine effective 
presidential control of the executive branch the commission said

antisenegalese violence in the 
mauritanian capital has killed at least 26 people and injured 675 
in the past two days a hospital source said wednesday soldiers 
patrolled the streets 
clashes stemming from a land dispute between the west african 
neighbors also have broken out in dakar senegals capital and in 
many other cities and towns 
but there has been no reliable word on the number of casualties 
outside nouakchott 
the roving mobs of shouting clubwielding mauritanians 
disappeared from nouakchotts streets wednesday as army units 
patrolled the city 
mauritanian officials said residents respected the 8 pm to 6 
am curfew imposed by president maaouiya ould sidahmed taya and 
there were no incidents overnight it was not known when the 
curfew imposed tuesday would be lifted 
interior minister gibril ould abdallahy on tuesday condemned the 
violence and called attacks on mauritanias senegalese residents 
unacceptable 
a source at nouakchotts main public hospital who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said 26 senegalese and mauritanians had 
died and 675 were injured 
he said others may have died or been treated for injuries at the 
capitals other clinics and medical facilities 
other unofficial sources confirmed more than two dozen deaths 
and hundreds of injured the government said it had no casualty 
report on the riots that exploded monday and tuesday 
violence has been spreading for two weeks since a border 
incident set off rising tensions over competing claims by 
senegalese and mauritanians to farm areas along the senegal river 
which forms the border between the two nations 
on monday and tuesday angry crowds in the capital of 500000 
hunted down senegelese citizens and beat them their shops and 
homes were sacked and burned 
police broke up the rioting with tear gas and clubs 
the mauritanians were angered by similar treatment of their 
compatriots in senegal 
in dakar 375 miles to the south mauritanian ambassador mokhtar 
ould zamal said 100 mauritanian men and women had been airlifted 
out of the city tuesday 
soliders and police using tear gas quelled antimauritanian 
violence in the senegalese capital early tuesday 
both countries have reinforced their troops along the senegal 
river as tensions mounted over the land dispute 
diplomatic observers said the clashes have shaken both 
governments 
neither of these governments can be comfortable with these 
events and im talking about their stability said one senior 
diplomat on condition of anonymity 
both nations have tried to calm tensions since mauritanian 
soldiers allegedly killed two senegalese farmers in senegals 
diawara border village april 9 at least two people have died in 
violence in senegal since then 
mauritania straddles arab north and black west africa 
twothirds of its 2 million people are moors of arabberber 
extraction the rest are black mostly from the southern river 
region nearly all of senegals 7 million people are black 
the dispute concerns the right of senegalese to farm on a 
senegal river island after both countries became independent from 
france in 1960 the black toucouleur people of senegal continued to 
farm the mauritanian side they had considered their own for 
generations 
moors to the north traditionally nomadic herders did not farm 
but the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up 
new farmland spurred mauritanian interest in agriculture and 
prompted them to force senegalese off the land

king hussein said wednesday there may have 
been errors in the governments economic policies and he appealed 
for unity and an end to riots over price increases 
it was the monarchs first address to the nation since last 
weeks unrest which killed nine people 
speaking on staterun jordan television hussein did not name a 
new cabinet to replace that of prime minister zaid rifai rifai 
resigned monday because of the rioting 
the king vowed to take all appropriate measures and promised 
to move in quick steps toward holding parliamentary elections 
jordan has not had general elections since 1967 when israel 
captured the west bank which supplied half the deputies in 
jordans nowsuspended 60member parliament 
hussein last year severed links with the west bank and a new 
election law calls for a 72member legislature elected wholly from 
jordan 
many observers said the lack of a public voice in government fed 
frustrations and contributed to the riots during which protesters 
called for rifais ouster and blamed him for falling living 
standards 
yes there may have been a mistake here or a mistake there as 
a result of the endeavors of this official or that regarding the 
priorities assigned to internal development he said but 
someone who looks closely and fairly at these mistakes cannot 
possibly see in them anything but minor forces compared with the 
extent of the straits we are facing 
four days of disturbances were triggered april 18 by increases 
of 10 percent to 50 percent in the price of gasoline cigarettes 
heating oil and other goods the increases came on top of a 
steadily devalued dinar which has severely reduced living 
standards 
the rioting was the worst domestic violence in jordan since the 
army crushed palestinian guerrillas in 1971 
hussein said his economic austerity program was painful 
but to turn to violence destruction burning and killing is 
not a modern method of expressing discontent and it is not a 
method which we know in our country where all channels between 
citizen and official are open he said 
he noted that violence was aimed at government property such 
as health centers water pumps and transportation services 
arent we ashamed and sorry because we damaged ourselves we 
the people of a stable nation the nation of dialogue and 
development he asked 
the king noted that much of the nations 6 billion debt was 
incurred to build up jordans armed forces on the longest 
confrontation strip with israel 
he also alluded to the fact that other arab states failed to 
provide much of the 125 billion over 10 years promised at a 1978 
arab summit 
was it a mistake to support our armed forces or is is a 
mistake to trust a brother who promised help which is the promise 
which encouraged us to borrow hussein said

soviet television on wednesday said a research 
center would be built near the site of the chernobyl nuclear 
disaster but a scientist said officials are withholding data on 
atomic energy three years after the disaster 
in kiev people gathered in the main soccer stadium wednesday 
night to mark the anniversary of the april 26 1986 reactor fire 
and explosion which sent a plume of radioactive debris into the 
atmosphere and killed at least 31 people 
the mass meeting in the ukrainian capital 80 miles from the 
nuclear plant was entitled chernobyl should not be repeated 
the evening news show vremya announced that scientists worldwide 
would study at the new research center near chernobyl it did not 
say when the center would be built or specify its exact location 
izvestia reported wednesday that energy authorities still 
routinely censor sensitive information about the number of 
accidents fires fatalities and pollution of the atmosphere 
despite president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
strict limits remain on what can be disclosed about the nuclear 
power program boris paton president of the ukrainian academy of 
sciences told the government newspaper 
we cannot obtain information about atomic and conventional 
energy the number of accidents and fires at stations breakage of 
equipment which causes material damage losses of human life and 
even about the catastrophic pollution of the environment he said 
paton said he wanted to publish excerpts of an energy ministry 
decree in connection with the anniversary of the disaster but the 
decree carried a notice banning publication of its contents in 
nonconfidential correspondence telegraph messages and those 
materials printed in the regular press or destined to be taken 
abroad 
paton criticized the policy that allowed ministry officials to 
determine what was secret 
in an accompanying editorial izvestia called on energy 
officials to end secrecy but noted unfortunately and scientists 
confirm it with conviction it is too early to speak about full 
glasnost in the field of atomic energy and the consequences of the 
chernobyl accident 
the newspaper said 116000 people were moved from their homes in 
the contaminated area and 8 billion was spent in cleanup 
operations 
loss of human life which cannot be evaluated and loss of 
faith in atomic energy are just the top layer of problems which we 
all face after the tragedy izvestia said 
a deputy to the chairman of the ukraine council of ministers e 
kachalovsky told izvestia there is still not enough reliable 
information about chernobyl and existing information is often 
distorted 
the effects of the chernobyl explosion are still being felt in 
the region surrounding the nuclear plant which still has four 
reactors in operation 
the weekly moscow news said there were widespread rumors that 
people living in the region of chernobyl would be allowed to buy 
individual geigercounters but so far no such devices are on sale 
in short to stop all these rumors about the high rate of 
radioactivity geiger counters should be available to everyone 
the newspaper said 
any new project of building an atomic power station even the 
existence of old ones raises doubts of the people it said 
only in the conditions of total glasnost and under public control 
can such tragic events like what happened in chernobyl can be 
prevented that has to be remembered by everybody who is connected 
with the atomic energy field 
a group of foreigners visiting chernobyl wednesday was told that 
scientists believe the destroyed reactor is cooling down the 
television said the report said a repaired section of the atomic 
station is scheduled to resume functioning on friday

an investor looking for a place to put 1000 
in 1984 might not have thought of the manila stock market but if 
he had taken the plunge he would have found the average return on 
his investment at the end of last year to be 14880 said a study 
published wednesday 
on us markets the average return for the four years the 
value of the stocks themselves plus dividents would have been a 
tame 1910 
manila showed the best average return worldwide in a study by 
the international finance corporation which looked at stock 
markets in both major money centers and 31 third world countries 
the corporation owned by 133 governments is the agency of the 
world bank that lends to private industry 
the corporations charles o sethness said the large gain in the 
value of stocks on the stocks on the manila exchange was all due 
to the instability until former president ferdinand marcos left 
the manila exchange jogged along through 1985 without much 
change despite the violent political campaign that led to the 
victory of president corazon aquino but took off after marcos flew 
to exile in hawaii in february 1986 
by june 1987 the average return on stocks had reached a level 
nearly 16 times the level of 1985 
there was a sharp drop in manila when markets worldwide crashed 
in october 1987 but by the end of last year total returns were 
back almost to their peak 
returns on stock in the third world seem to have little to do 
with a countrys prosperity according to the world bank the 
average filipino had an annual income of only 590 in 1987 a 
slight increase after a decline of several years the country has 
an active communist insurgency and a 30 billion debt 
an investor in the market of relatively prosperous south korea 
would have done well but only a little more than half as well as 
in the philippines his 1000 would have turned into 7890 in the 
four years 
in the southern african republic of zimbabwe headed by president 
robert mogabe a professed marxist the return would have been only 
a little less 7320 
the survey does not cover other countries where governments call 
themselves socialist but are experimenting with capitalism 
sethness said a market in shanghai deals only in what he considers 
preferred stocks while in budapest the trading has been largely in 
bonds he reported that the yugoslav government has been consulting 
with the corporation on the possibiity of opening a market but has 
not yet done so 
brazil turned in the best market performance in 1988 although 
the country has the third worlds largest debt and inflation was 
running at more than 1000 percent by the end of the year the 
hottest stock was acesita a steel company which chalked up a 
return of 8313 for shares worth 1000 at the start of the year 
as in any market investors can lose their shirts on third world 
exchanges stock prices were mostly down last year in southern 
europe and africa by 37 percent in turkey and venezuela and by 25 
percent in portugal

attacks on the citys meter maids more than 
doubled last year and now average about three assaults per week 
they have been punched spit on pelted with beer bottles and run 
over 
one angry parking violator smashed a watermelon over a ticket 
writers head 
a popular bumper sticker reads meter maids eat their young 
the hostility is palpable in this city where car owners feel the 
boston tea party led to an inalienable right to park where they 
please as long as they want the problem is compounded by office 
towers that have shot up bringing in more drivers while the 
number of legal parking spaces has stayed the same 
but city officials are cracking down on meter maid abuse the 
134 meter maids 30 of whom are men and all of whom prefer to be 
called parking enforcement officers are being trained to walk 
away from irate motorists and are told to use their walkietalkies 
to call for help and the city is aggressively prosecuting 
offenders 
slowly but surely the words getting out that people cant 
beat up on meter maids any more said investigator edward t 
oliver 34 one of eight officers assigned to protect the 
ticketwriters 
still olivers tales would discourage job applicants on 
friday while a meter maid was writing a ticket the driver looked 
straight at her backed up over her foot and drove off leaving her 
prone on the sidewalk he said a few minutes later the suspect 
came back without his car and was arrested he said 
it turned out he owed over 400 worth of parking tickets 
oliver said 
he also recalled a drunk who swung a beer bottle at a meter 
maid a motorist who ran over a meter man and sent him to the 
hospital and the man with the watermelon 
we had a couple of kids from a local college after knocking a 
woman to the ground and hitting her they spat on her and left 
he said i found this woman old enough to be my mother sitting on 
the sidewalk crying with saliva dripping off her face it was 
terrible 
transportation commissioner richard dimino refused to allow 
meter maids to be interviewed for this article because theyve 
had an awful lot of bad press in the past a spokeswoman said 
but one meter maid buttonholed while she was shooing away a 
doubleparked car wednesday said she is harassed and insulted 
about 30 times a day 
just now a guy called me a bad name she said adding that 
once a man threatened to shoot me 
the woman who refused to give her name said more police 
protection is needed 
about 250 people have been prosecuted for verbal or physical 
abuse in the last two years and the conviction rate has been close 
to 100 percent said robert francis the citys director of 
municipal security 
francis attributed some of the increase in assaults from 50 in 
1987 to 134 in 1988 to stepped up enforcement including 
roundtheclock parking patrols begun last year 
the statistics also may be inflated by better recordkeeping and 
increased reporting from meter maids who for the first time are 
seeing their tormentors punished francis said 
deputy transportation commissioner rina cutler said the number 
of tickets written has increased only slightly she blamed the 
attacks on more cars fighting for the available parking spaces a 
problem that will only get worse when reconstruction of the citys 
central artery begins 
there will never be enough parking spaces in boston for 
everyone who wants to bring their car in she said

the federal government will speed up the 
handling of benefit claims for the families of 47 sailors who died 
in an explosion aboard the battleship uss iowa officials said 
wednesday 
the department of veterans affairs and dod have expedited the 
claims from these families and also are providing assistance to 
them to help them apply for the benefits said jim holley a 
staffer with the house veterans affairs committee 
all 47 crew members who were killed april 19 when an explosion 
tore through a turret during a training exercise carried the 
maximum of 50000 in life insurance available under a military 
policy administered by the veterans department those checks should 
be mailed within a month said john brizzi counsel to the house 
veterans affairs subcommittee on compensation pensions and 
insurance 
it usually takes 30 to 60 days to process monthly death benefit 
claims after the forms are filed by families he said 
i would expect benefits might be payable as early as june or 
july brizzi said explaining that that estimate takes into 
account the time it takes the family to file for the claim in 
addition to the processing theyll receive a lot of assistance 
here because this is an abnormal case 
holley said benefit claims also were expedited when large 
numbers of service personnel were killed in an airplane crash over 
newfoundland in the bombing of marine headquarters in lebanon and 
in the iraqi missile attack on the uss stark 
aside from the insurance payment and monthly benefit checks the 
families will receive six months salary from the department of 
defense the military also will pay funeral costs 
the families will receive educational benefits and health 
coverage as well brizzi said 
a private fundraising drive sponsored by shearson lehman 
huttons norfolk office has collected more than 35000 said gary 
compton a company vice president he said the money will be 
distributed to the families beginning this week

south africanled security forces on 
wednesday handed over 31 captured nationalist guerrillas to un 
officials as part of efforts to get namibias independence process 
back on track 
the guerrillas were taken by un and red cross officials from 
the northern garrison town of oshakati to ruacana on the border 
with angola later they were to be transported to bases of the 
southwest africa peoples organization inside angola 
territorial officials said four other captured guerrillas 
accepted an amnesty offered by south africa and asked to remain in 
namibia 
the turnover of prisoners occurred a few hours before the south 
african army and police units were to be confined to their bases so 
guerrillas still at large could have unhindered passage across the 
border into angola 
radio stations aircraft and police vehicles have been 
broadcasting recorded messages from swapo commanders telling 
guerrillas that by wednesday evening only un forces would watch 
the border 
more than half of the 1600 guerrillas who crossed into namibia 
earlier this month have gone back the staterun south african 
broadcasting corp said tuesday only a dozen have appeared at 
unmonitored assembly points because security forces are nearby 
about 290 guerrillas and 27 security force members were killed 
in fighting after the incursion according to police the conflict 
jeopardized the un independence plan which calls for elections 
in november that swapo is favored to win 
south african officials says the 60hour safe passage period 
will be swapos last chance to get its fighters out of the 
territory and into unmonitored bases in angola 
the fighters may return unarmed in a few weeks to participate 
in the unsupervised election campaign swapo is favored to win 
the election 
albert nekewaya one of the guerrillas released wednesday said 
he and his comrades had been ordered to enter namibia and report to 
un peacekeepers 
we didnt know there would be trouble but they the 
security forces shot and so we shot back he said our aim was 
not to fight against anybody but only to give ourselves up to untag 
the un force 
swapo guerrillas mostly operating from bases in angola have 
fought since 1966 to end south africas 74year rule over namibia 
also called southwest africa 
under the un plan swapo and south african forces were to be 
confined to bases starting april 1 but there was no arrangement 
for swapo fighters inside namibia the incursion prompted south 
africa to seek and receive un permission to let its military 
units leave their own bases to pursue the guerrillas

abortion opponents led by the bush 
administration urged the supreme court in a longawaited courtroom 
showdown wednesday to overturn its landmark 1973 ruling that women 
have a constitutional right to end their pregnancies 
outside police arrested 27 abortionrights activists among a 
noisy crowd of people demonstrating on both sides of one of the the 
nations most divisive issues those arrested were charged with 
crossing a police line 
in sharp contrast the hourlong argument session took place in 
a packed but hushed courtroom 
the united states asks this court to reconsider and overrule 
its decision in roe vs wade said harvard law professor charles 
fried referring to the ruling that legalized abortion 
but frank susman a st louis lawyer representing those who 
successfully challenged an abortionlimiting missouri law in lower 
courts argued there can be no ordered liberty for women without 
control over their childbearing 
missouri attorney general william webster urged the court to 
restore the states abortion regulations even if it does not 
reverse the broader 1973 decision which was based on womens 
privacy rights 
fried a former justice department official called back to 
government duty for wednesdays session argued we are not 
asking the court to unravel the fabric of privacy rights which 
this court has woven we are asking the court to pull this one 
string 
susman responded it has always been my personal experience 
that when i pull a thread my sleeve falls off there is no 
stopping it is not a thread he is after 
questioning by the justices was brisk but not as aggressive as 
it has been in many argument sessions of recent years 
seven of the nine court members probed the positions of the 
three lawyers in front of them only justices thurgood marshall a 
strong supporter of abortion rights and harry a blackmun author 
of the 1973 decision remained silent 
the justices who do not necessarily have to reconsider roe vs 
wade in resolving the missouri dispute gave little indication as 
to how broad their decision will be they are expected to announce 
their ruling by july 
at one point justice antonin scalia a potential swing 
vote along with justices sandra day oconnor and anthony m 
kennedy asked whether the court must consider the nature of a 
fetus 
can you derive a fundamental right to abortion without 
making a determination as to whether the fetus is human life or 
not scalia asked 
it is very hard to say it must be a fundamental right 
unless you make a determination that the organism that is destroyed 
is not a human life scalia suggested 
susman said an assertion that life begins at conception as 
stated in the missouri regulations is not a verifiable fact but 
a question verifiable only by reliance upon faith 
fried said the bush administration was not asking the court to 
end all protections for women whose lives might be endangered by 
childbirth 
we are not here suggesting that the court allow bloodthirsty 
regulations he said 
when asked by oconnor whether he thinks there is a 
fundamental right to decide whether to have a child or not fried 
said i would hesitate to formulate the right in such abstract 
terms 
even if the court rules on the missouri abortion regulations 
narrowly the decision will be viewed as a barometer of the current 
justices commitment to the 16yearold ruling in roe vs wade 
the three justices appointed by former president reagan 
oconnor scalia and kennedy are conservatives generally 
considered skeptical about the legitimacy of the earlier decision 
the justices will take their initial vote in the missouri case 
friday in a closeddoor meeting only they attend they will discuss 
their views beginning a process that will include drafting and 
redrafting opinions 
in an attempt to sway the justices americans in record numbers 
have been writing and telephoning the court to express their views 
tens of thousands of letters arrive each day and the courts two 
switchboards were so flooded with calls that a rarely used third 
board had to be activated 
the roe of the 1973 ruling norma mccorvey was in the 
audience for wednesdays arguments the texas cleaning woman has 
emerged from anonymity to enter the public fight on the side of 
abortion rights 
in roe vs wade the court said a womans decision to have an 
abortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to 
her and her doctor 
the court said states may interfere in the abortion decision 
during the second trimester only to protect the womans health and 
may take steps to protect fetal life only in the third trimester 
24 to 28 weeks into the pregnancy when the fetus can survive 
outside the womb recent scientific advances have called into 
question some of the cutoff points in the decision 
a federal appeals court relying on roe vs wade struck down 
five provisions of the missouri law as unconstitutional 
a ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for 
performing abortions not necessary to save a womans life 
a ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or 
assisting an abortion 
a ban on using tax money for encouraging or counseling 
women to have abortions 
a requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus older than 
19 weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb by determining 
lung maturity and other testing 
a declaration that the life of each human begins at 
conception

legislation to improve the transportation of 
coal from mines to distant power plants through the construction of 
pipelines cleared the house interior committee wednesday 
the committee approved the bill the coal pipeline act on a 
2213 vote it allows coal pipeline companies approved by the 
interior secretary to use the federal power of eminent domain to 
gain access to land so they can lay pipes 
the technology has existed for years to use pipes to transport 
coal mixed with water the bill covers such slurry pipelines as 
well as those in the future using other media such as natural gas 
to transport coal 
the railroad industry has opposed the legislation 
rep morris udall dariz who chairs the interior committee 
said pipelines could carry about 70 million tons of coal annually 
while total coal production each year for the next two decades is 
expected to be about 275 million tons 
it is difficult for me to understand how the railroads will 
suffer loss of jobs when there will be at least 200 million 
additional tons of coal for them to haul udall said 
he said other countries like the soviet union and italy have 
jumped ahead of the united states by building coal pipelines using 
the technology developed here 
this legislation will increase our energy security create new 
jobs and provide much needed competition in the coal 
transportation market he said 
the bill requires that the interior secretary determine that 
pipeline construction is in the national interest before approving 
use of eminent domain for any pipeline construction company 
it also says construction could occur only if state water laws 
and other regulations allow it 
udall said the major issue that has stood in the way of the bill 
in the past has been whether jobs would be lost 
an amendment added to the bill at the suggestion of rep austin 
murphy dpa requires that pipelines be constructed only with 
us made products unless those supplies are 20 percent more 
expensive than products from abroad

south africa which once had access to 
topline arms technology is now dependent on pirates and arms 
smugglers to update its military weaponry the author of a new book 
on the south african arms embargo said wednesday 
signe landgren of the stockholm international peace research 
institute said the embargo hindered but could not stop the growth 
of south africas power 
the united nations imposed a voluntary arms embargo aug 7 
1963 which was made mandatory in 1977 restrictions were further 
tightened in a 1984 resolution urging countries to boycott south 
african arms exports 
the embargo was defeated for many years through cheating or 
exploiting legal loopholes said ms landgren whose book embargo 
disimplemented was published wednesday 
all south africas military technology was imported from the 
very same nations which took part in the embargo she said at a 
seminar on her book 
the general conclusion can be one of a long history of 
failure thats correct if you look at each individual sale she 
said but i see very visible effects of this embargo 
she cited south africas refusal to deploy mirage aircraft in 
angola last year for fear of losing any to antiaircraft missiles 
equipment problems could have been a contributing factor to the 
decision to withdraw from angola and namibia she said 
the study argues that no matter how inefficient the embargo 
remains one of the few military sanctions that can be imposed on 
south africa and is valuable as a political statement condemning 
the countrys apartheid system of racial segregation 
ms landgren also said that a growing interdependence in 
developing new technologies and greater adherence to the embargo 
are factors making pretoria increasingly vulnerable to the 
sanctions 
south africa is more and more isolated she said noting 
that israel one of its stronger allies in recent years had 
distanced itself from pretoria 
it is left completely in the hands of private smugglers with 
all that that implies in terms of insecurity said ms landgren 
in the latest example french police last weekend broke up an 
alleged plot by protestant extremists from northern ireland to hand 
over to a south african diplomat parts of a stolen britishmade 
blowpipe shoulderfired antiaircraft missile 
last year west german authorities uncovered an attempt to 
smuggle submarine blueprints to south africa which has announced 
plans to build its own submarine by 1992 
ms landgren estimated that buying smuggled weaponry on the 
black market and pirating their design cost the south africans 
three or four times the normal price 
as a member of the british commonwealth south africa in the 
1950s had stateoftheart equipment britain and the united states 
stopped their open sales of equipment after the first embargo 
the west europeans fell all over each other to conquer a part 
of this lucrative market said ms landgren 
after the europeans came japan and israel it is pointless to 
look for one scapegoat we are all part of the south african 
market she said 
south africa launched an arms manufacturing program by 1961 and 
the embargo was a belated attempt to stop a development which 
already had begun she said 
in the book ms landgren said the ban had the countereffect of 
spurring the south africans to further develop their arms industry 
but it also deprived pretoria of modernized weapons systems 
restricted its access to technology and curtailed the supply of 
spare parts 
smuggling operations are hidden by creating dummy companies 
using phony labeling diverting shipments to new destinations at 
sea or in midflight and forging enduser certificates the book 
says 
but legal avenues were more important for building up the 
industry it says 
by the time the embargo took effect south african had 120 
foreign licenses to produce weapons before the arms ban became 
obligatory 14 yeas later the armaments corp of south africa 
armscor was legally producing weapons systems like the french 
mirage jetfighter and the israeli reshef gunboat armed with the 
scorpion sea missile 
the embargo also is circumvented legally by importing civilian 
products which have military applications such as electronics and 
telecommunications gear the study says

whittle plans to provide an average of 50000 in video 
recording equipment television monitors and satellite dishes to 
each of the schools participating in the channel one daily news

selling up to two minutes of commercial time in each 12minute 
show schools are required in exchange to run the full show for the 
entire student body each day in the test ads were run for 
shampoo candy bars jeans and sneakers 
turner said he had a lastminute change of heart on the issue of 
advertising and decided to ban it altogether after hearing 
complaints from educators at a meeting that preceded the news 
conference 
gary marx an official of the american association of school 
administrators said he told turner that he found any kind of 
advertising objectionable on a news show for schools 
christopher whittle who heads whittle communications and has 
overseen the development of channel one said in a statement 
following turners announcement that we wish the cable industry 
the best of luck in its endeavor to bring free news and information

officials have launched a criminal investigation 
into the use of tear gas by soldiers who rushed thousands of people 
demonstrating for independence in soviet georgia a foreign 
ministry spokesman said wednesday 
but the spokesman vadim perfiliev denied that tear gas or any 
other chemical substance used by the soldiers killed anyone in the 
april 9 clash in the southern republics capital of tbilisi 
the denial contradicted reports by the georgian minister of 
health irakli managarishvili that at least two of the 20 victims 
died from the gas and several others died from asphyxiation that 
may have been induced by the unidentified substance 
at least 1100 people were injured in the melee in which 
soldiers charged the rally with sharpened shovels 
president mikhail s gorbachev in remarks carried wednesday by 
the news agency tass said the ruling politburo ordered that 
everything that happened in the clash be thoroughly 
investigated 
but its already clear now that we should all use political 
methods and the force of law not to permit a repetition of anything 
similar gorbachev said in the closing speech at a meeting 
tuesday of the policysetting central committee 
in his first direct statement on the georgian clash gorbachev 
said the incident showed that party leaders must improve their 
communication with the masses 
perfiliev told a news briefing that the investigation is being 
carried out by the chief military prosecutor due to the fact 
that tear gas was used on demonstrators in tbilisi a criminal case 
has been opened he said 
he said none of the victims had died from tear gas or other 
chemicals 
when autopsies were performed the reasons for death were not 
the use of chemical gas or chemical substances he said 
the announcement of the inquiry came one day after the united 
states denounced the use of poison gas on demonstrators and urged 
the soviets to investigate what happened during the confrontation 
officials in moscow have confirmed only that tear gas was used 
but doctors treating injured protesters in tbilisi said they were 
suffering from a paralysis of the central nervous system caused by 
an unidentified chemical substance 
one of the victims gilo oniani spoke with foreign 
correspondents in tbilisi on monday on a trip arranged by the 
foreign ministry 
mrs oniani a 34yearold mother and factory worker who was 
sprayed in the face with an aerosol told reporters she was unable 
to sleep due to nervous agitation and unable to eat due to pain in 
her abdomen 
manana gamsakhurdia wife of jailed protest organizer zviad 
gamsakhurdia said in a telephone interview wednesday night that 
two men came to mrs onianis room late monday and threatened her 
for speaking to reporters 
perfiliev said a commission made up of scientists from moscow 
leningrad and other major cities had been formed and would join in 
the investigation of the clashes 
perfiliev said the the inquiry would take some time there are 
contradictory versions around the events in tbilisi he said 
including the question of how many gases were used 
on tuesday givi gumbaridze chief of the georgian communist 
party acknowledged that soldiers used a harmful gas and said 
some people died from poisoning 
the defense ministry newspaper red star on saturday identified a 
chemical used against the protesters as an incapacitating agent 
dubbed cheremukha 
its main ingredient is chloroacetophenone the newspaper said a 
western military attache in moscow said the substance was similar 
to but stronger than tear gas 
demonstrations in georgia first began april 4 when protesters 
criticized calls from members of the republics ethnic abkhazian 
minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by 
georgians 
other protesters have demanded georgia secede from the soviet 
union because of alleged interference from the central government 
the republics senior party official dzhumber patiashvili took 
responsibility for the april 9 attack and resigned

the bush administrations plan to develop both 
the mx and midgetman missiles came under attack wednesday from 
house democrats with a handful directing their criticism at the 
armed services committee chairman for dealing with the white house 
without their consultation 
lawmakers said the pentagon proposal of 12 billion funding in 
fiscal 1990 for the railbased version of the multiplewarhead mx 
nuclear missile and 100 million on the singlewarhead midgetman 
sounds the death knell for the latter program 
its not a twomissile package in reality its really a 
onemissile package said rep les aucoin dore who referred 
to the plan as a sucker deal 
if you go through with those figures you might as well kiss 
the midgetman missile goodbye said rep nicholas mavroules 
dmass 
defense secretary dick cheney had recommended moving the 
nations 50 mx missiles from silos to deployment on railroad cars 
rather than developing the midgetman former president reagan and 
scores of congressional republicans have favored the mx 
but president bush chose quick deployment of the mx and 
researchanddevelopment funding for the midgetman 
democrats including senate armed services chairman sam nunn of 
georgia and house armed services chairman les aspin of wisconsin 
supported the midgetman and urged cheney to include funding for the 
missile in the pentagon budget 
about a dozen house democrats met with aspin to express their 
opposition to the mxmidgetman plan and their displeasure with his 
efforts to arrange a deal without their advice 
rep barney frank dmass charged that when aspin worked out a 
deal on strategic weapons with cheney he was not representing the 
united democratic opinion 
another massachusetts democrat rep edward markey said a 
deal of this nature should not have been cut without full 
consultation of the democrats 
we are grandstand observers he said 
aspin chairman of the armed services committee since 1985 said 
he was speaking for myself i was talking for my own point of 
view 
the wisconsin democrat said he sought assurances from cheney 
when the defense secretary testified tuesday before the committee 
that the midgetman would not be squeezed out 
aspin argued that us arms control negotiators need both the mx 
and midgetman as a bargaining chip with the soviet union in 
strategic talks and said he made that point with his colleagues 
after frank left the meeting 
the massachusetts democrat claimed the position was a brand new 
one for aspin 
the armed services chairman played down the meeting rejecting 
suggestions that the session was cantankerous mavroules called 
the session healthy there might have been some 
disagreements 
but frank said the meeting was loud and aucoin indicated 
that when members told the armed services chairman that 
consultation is different than notification there was some 
testiness on that point 
frank asked if the meeting signals a rebellion among the party 
said it is not a rebellion it is a reminder to him aspin that 
he was never authorized to make this kind of deal 
aspin chairman of the armed services committee since 1985 was 
voted out of his post in 1987 by house democrats angered by the 
wisconsin congressmans support of the mx missile and aid to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
he later rallied and won back his chairmanship frank was one of 
the liberal democrats who supported aspin 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a member of the house armed 
services committee who attended the meeting said those in 
attendance which included members who have worked on arms control 
and aspins selection were unhappy with the chairmans failure to 
consult them 
nobody thought we were given a proxy for this we were very 
upset that there was arrogance that they had this deal schroeder 
said 
the colorado democrat who has expressed an interest in the 
chairmanship said the tom toms are beating

the supreme court is considering in reviewing 
invalidated provisions of a missouri law whether to alter its 1973 
ruling in roe vs wade that women have a constitutional right to 
abortion 
in 1973 the court said a womans decision to have an abortion 
during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and 
her doctor 
the court said states may interfere in the abortion decision 
during the second trimester only to protect the womans health and 
may take steps to protect fetal life in the third trimester only 
when the fetus can survive outside the womb the court said that 
occurs sometime between 24 and 28 weeks 
a federal appeals court relying on roe vs wade struck down 
these provisions of the missouri law as unconstitutional 
a ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for 
performing abortions not necessary to save a womans life and a ban 
prohibiting any public employee from performing or assisting an 
abortion 
a ban on using tax money for encouraging or counseling 
women to have abortions 
a requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus thought to 
be at least 20 weeks old weeks is capable of surviving outside the 
womb by testing for weight gestational maturity and lung capacity 
a declaration that the life of each human begins at 
conception 
in arguments wednesday the bush administrations lawyer 
harvard law professor charles fried focused on the 1973 decision 
while missouri attorney general william webster emphasized the 
state laws provisions 
st louis lawyer frank susman representing opponents of the 
missouri law urged the justices to uphold the appeals court ruling 
fried said the united states asks this court to reconsider 
and overrule its decision in roe vs wade 
webster said states have effectively been forbidden not only 
to prohibit abortion but usually to regulate abortion in any 
significant way we contend that the government is certainly 
not obligated to become an advocate for abortion 
susman said there can be no ordered liberty for women without 
control over their childbearing

gen manuel antonio noriega called 
the political opposition in panama traitors on wednesday 
noriega head of the defense forces and as such de facto leader 
of panama is not running for president in may 7 elections but is 
actively campaigning for the government coalition 
while talking to hundreds of local leaders wednesday noriega 
quoted an article in us news amp world report as saying the us 
government is spending 10 million to help the opposition in the 
panamanian elections 
the story appearing in this weeks edition of the 
washingtonbased weekly newsmagazine said president bush ordered 
the expenditure us officials have declined comment 
noriega said accepting the money amounts to betrayal by the 
unpatriotic panamanians 
the official news agency panapress said wednesday the 10 
million is part of a 120 million program the us government has 
promised to the opposition 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara has denied 
the reports of us financing 
we have not asked for nor received nor will we ever receive 
any money from foreigners in the united states or any other 
power endara said 
according to noriega now none of them opposition can say 
that they havent received 10 million we dont know to whom they 
gave it but we know they have it 
noriega said in answering a reporters question that differences 
with the united states are no more than the reincarnation of 
provocations since we signed that wretched treaty for the panama 
canal in 1904 
noriega pressed panamanians not to retreat from the 1977 
agreement with the united states under which control of the 
waterway reverts to panama on dec 31 1999 
not one step back the general declared 
he insists that problems with the united states are based on 
us plans to break that treaty and refuse to turn over the canal 
uspanamanian relations have been poor since february 1988 
when noriega orchestrated the ouster of president eric arturo 
delvalle the united states still recognizes delvalle as panamas 
head of state 
delvalle had tried to fire noriega after a federal grand jury in 
florida indicted him on drug smuggling and money laundering 
charges noriega denied the charges 
american election observers have announced their intention to 
watch the panamanian balloting but panama has complained about 
their presence

a package of federal relief measures to help 
farmers in kansas and other states recover from the current dry 
spell that has gripped parts of the nations midsection was 
announced wednesday by agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
rain is what these states need but i cant guarantee that 
yeutter said however i trust the assistance we are able to 
provide will help 
the assistance included permission for qualified farmers to 
graze livestock and cut hay on land taken from production under 
conservation portions of this years crop programs 
livestock and poultry producers also will be able to buy surplus 
grain owned by the departments commodity credit corp at half 
price in a related program ccc will help pay feed cost for 
farmers who must purchase more than usual amounts of feed for 
livestock 
yeutter said he had directed the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service to respond within 24 hours to requests from 
the agencys state offices for drought aid 
kelly shipp yeutters press secretary said the aid package is 
essentially the same as usda made available in the 1988 drought 
which spread by summer throughout most of the nation and cut last 
years harvests sharply 
asked if there were significant changes from what was offered 
last year shipp said not really its pretty straightforward 
shipp said that while kansas is expected to benefit greatly from 
the emergency assistance farmers in a number of other states are 
expected to be eligible including iowa nebraska oklahoma and 
texas others are expected to qualify too she said 
yeutter also announced that a 1989 usda drought task force has 
been established headed by undersecretary richard t crowder who 
oversees international affairs and commodity programs 
the action followed yeutters visit april 14 to the hardhit 
winter wheat drought area with sens robert dole and nancy 
kassebaum rep pat roberts kansas republicans and gov mike 
hayden 
on capitol hill meanwhile usdas chief meteorologist norton 
strommen told members of congress that except in the central great 
plains the weather outlook for crops has improved greatly 
conditions are much more encouraging than in 1988 strommen 
said 
but he said the damage from a february freeze and lack of spring 
rain has caused irreversible damage to a large part of the winter 
wheat crop in the texas and oklahoma panhandles west kansas and 
southern nebraska 
strommen said he expects a more normal distribution of summer 
rainfall and a weather pattern favorable to the spring planting 
that is beginning

a house panel on wednesday endorsed 
legislation that would ease the way for soviet jews and 
pentecostalists seeking refugee status in the united states 
the legislation seeks to undo a change in justice department 
policy last summer that substituted casebycase review for the 
previous practice of allowing into the united states all soviet 
jews and evangelical christians on the grounds they were suffering 
from religious persecution 
the bills author rep bruce morrison dconn said he hoped 
the bush administration would act on its own to undo the action of 
thenattorney general edwin k meese iii 
but if attorney general dick thornburgh doesnt act morrison 
said well push the bill through the committee approved the 
legislation on a 54 vote 
the legislation states that both jews and pentecostalists have 
been persecuted by the soviet government and should be granted 
refugee status automatically 
the bill which would be valid for only 17 months to give time 
for a longerterm solution to be devised would also grant 
automatic refugee status to residents of laos vietnam and cambodia 
wishing to enter the united states 
meese restricted the refugee flow to deal with a growing flood 
of soviet jews armenians and pentecostalists taking advantage of 
the kremlins liberalized emigration policies 
morrison chairman of the house subcommittee on immigration 
refugees and judicial reform called meeses decision an 
overkill that placed unnecessary hardships on thousands of soviet 
citizens wanting to come to the united states 
about 5000 of an estimated 30000 soviets who have applied 
since oct 1 for refugee status have been turned down the 
rejections as well as an unprecedented number of applicants have 
created a backlog of more than 20000 soviets waiting to enter the 
united states 
to counter the growing backlog and respond to the increasing 
number of applicants thornburgh proposed legislation earlier this 
month that would allow the administration to admit 30000 people as 
special immigrants to the united states every year 
jewish groups contend thornburghs proposal would absolve the 
administration of having to pay for the soviets resettlement as 
must be done for refugees and would send a signal to the soviet 
leadership that the united states now accepts soviet human rights 
policy 
we have people suffering waiting in moscow and wondering if 
gorbachev is going to change his mind said rep barney frank 
dmass he said the matter was obviously not a high priority for 
the administration 
but rep lamar smith of texas one of four republicans to vote 
against the bill argued that the administration was nearing the 
start of consultations with congress on raising the ceiling of 
refugees allowed into the country 
the administration has been saying since february that it would 
ask congress for additional refugee slots beyond the 94000 
approved for this fiscal year to take care of some of the soviet 
overflow

the federal communications commission on 
wednesday granted media executive rupert murdochs request to 
transfer his boston tv station to a trust in order to comply with 
fcc rules barring ownership of a broadcast station and newspaper in 
the same city 
the fcc in a 30 vote said murdochs twentieth holdings corp 
could turn over uhf station wfxt in boston where murdochs news 
america publishing owns the boston herald to trustees edward w 
brooke the former us senator from massachusetts and hugh l 
carey the former new york governor 
but the commission said that in order to assure the station was 
properly insulated from murdoch and his affiliate companies 
which include the 20th century fox film and tv operations 
twentieth holdings could not have approval of any possible sale of 
the station 
the commission also said the station could have no 
communications that is it could not use fox programming or 
be an affiliate of the fox tv network of stations 
at the same time the commission denied two competing 
applications for the license of wfxt 
the commission said its nocommunications standard for broadcast 
trusts was well established when twentieth bought the station in 
1986 and that any communication between the trustees and any 
twentieth affiliate no matter how limited is prohibited 
however the commission allowed the station to use syndicated 
programs for which it previously had contracted until the existing 
contracts expire 
this action as a practical matter will end the stations 
ability to remain a fox affiliate and to acquire programming from 
fox on an ongoing basis the commission said 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick called the provision barring 
continued affiliation a harsh result but said precedent was 
well established regarding the overall provisions of trust 
transfers 
twentieth holdings has 60 days to comply it also could ask the 
fcc to reconsider appeal to the courts or ask for a commission 
hearing on the conditions or it could divest the property 
attorneys for murdoch did not immediately return a call seeking 
comment 
under terms of the transfer murdoch will relinquish control but 
still receive any profits the trust will expire if wfxt shares are 
sold if the station stops operations or if the boston herald is 
sold if the station is sold the trustees must try to sell the 
shares to one buyer and the price must exceed 35 million 
the station has been valued at between 30 million and 50 
million 
murdoch engaged in a bitter battle with congress in 1987 over 
his ownership of the two boston media outlets as well as his 
ownership of the new york post and wnywtv in new york 
sens ernest hollings dsc and edward kennedy dmass had 
pushed a measure through congress late in 1987 prohibiting the fcc 
from eliminating or modifying the crossownership rules and barring 
it from extending any waivers to the rules 
the herald at the time which had been editorializing against 
kennedy called his congressional action a vendetta 
the fcc had given murdoch a waiver allowing him to own both 
boston outlets until june 30 1988 
a federal appeals court overturned the congressional action but 
murdoch decided to seek fcc permission to transfer the station to 
the trust the fcc gave him another extension while it considered 
the request 
murdoch through his australianbased news corp owns extensive 
newspaper holdings in europe north america and australia

here is a brief look at some of the comments 
made wednesday during supreme court arguments in a case in which 
the justices are being asked to overturn the courts 1973 decision 
that said women have a constitutional right to abortion 
first we are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of 
unenumerated and privacy rights which this court has woven in 
previous cases rather we are asking the court to pull this 
one thread said charles fried for the bush administration 
frank susman for those who challenged the missouri law 
disagreed saying he fried does not seek to unravel the 
whole cloth of procreational rights but merely to pull a thread it 
has always been my personal experience that when i pull a thread my 
sleeve falls off there is no stopping it is not a thread he is 
after it is the full range of procreational rights and choices 
that constitute the fundamental right that has been recognized by 
this court 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
susman said i think the basic question whether this is a 
human life or whether human life begins at conception is not 
something that is verifiable as a fact both sides would agree 
as to when a heartbeat can first be detected both sides would 
agree as to when brain waves can first be detected but when you 
try to place the emotional labels on what you call that collection 
of physiological facts that is where people part company

two of britains leading food manufacturers 
offered a 170000 reward wednesday for information leading to 
blackmailers who have put glass shards pieces of razor blades 
thumbtacks and caustic soda in baby food 
hj heinz co ltd and cow and gate ltd offered the joint 
reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the 
culprits the companies said they received blackmail demands but 
would not elaborate 
since april 7 28 incidents of tampering involving baby food 
have been reported including 11 on wednesday the government said 
at least three people have suffered minor injuries 
scotland yard said it was coordinating a nationwide police 
inquiry 
it is difficult to imagine the twisted minds that could mount 
such a vicious attack on defenseless babies home office minister 
john patten told the house of commons he said the government 
pledged to resist all attempts at consumer terrorism 
the victims so far are a 9monthold girl in oxford who cut her 
mouth on a piece of razor blade and two mothers cut by glass 
hidden in jars of infant food none required hospital treatment 
in one incident sodium hydroxide or caustic soda was used to 
spike a jar of baby food the white substance is a strong caustic 
base used in chemistry and oil refining 
londons daily mail reported wednesday that blackmailers 
apparently were trying to extort money from supermarkets and food 
companies it said several major supermarket chains had received 
threats 
heinz whose parent company is the pittsburghbased food giant 
and cow and gate said internal investigations determined their 
products were not tampered with during production they said they 
would not submit to blackmail 
patten told parliament there were no signs the baby food had 
been infected during the manufacturing process and that police had 
considerable evidence of contamination at a later stage 
heinz warned parents to be vigilant when feeding their children 
and said it shared parents sense of outrage that a tamperer is 
prepared to target a victim as precious and vulnerable as a baby 
it said stocks were removed from shelves and replaced in all 
incidents where tampered products were found 
ted smyth director of corporate affairs for hj heinz corp in 
pittsburgh said the parent company shares the universal 
outrage over the tampering 
he said in reply to a question we have no reason at all to be 
concerned about tampering of products in the united states smyth 
said the cases were limited to britain 
a supermarket in the northwest city of blackpool removed all 
heinz products after a jar of baby food was found to contain 
slivers of glass and other supermarkets said they were considering 
withdrawing all heinz and cow and gate products 
spiked jars were first found in london and the central cities of 
bedford and leicester but more cases have since been reported 
across southern and western england 
in bradfordonavon diana tyndall said she cut her lip on a 
piece of glass as she tasted a jar of fruit dessert she was about 
to feed her 6monthold daughter 
in luton a mother who had heard news reports of the tampering 
said she cut her finger while checking a jar of egg custard 
intended for her 7monthold daughter 
as i took the second spoonful out it hit something in the 
food said susan hunt 24 i put my finger in to see what it 
was and a piece of glass cut me 
i think they are out of their minds doing this she said 
at the moment my baby could be in hospital because of them it is 
murderous i am going to feed her on packet food from now on

an emergency food program for warplagued 
southern sudan will move less than half the needed grain before 
rains cut off outlying villages a un official said wednesday 
relief workers began the 132million un operation april 1 
with the intention of shipping 115500 tons of food to locations 
around the southern sudan by midmay the rainy season begins then 
isolating villages and making roads and airstrips unusable 
however james p grant the director of operation lifeline 
sudan said wednesday that only 37000 tons of food had been 
delivered and 10000 more tons would be distributed in the next 10 
days or so 
he acknowledged that the program would not meet its goal of 
moving 115500 tons of food by midmay 
we clearly are going to fall short of that target but we 
certainly will get more tonnage in grant told reporters after 
returning from inspecting the programs progress 
in short everything is moving but also everything is moving 
slower than we would have hoped he said 
operation lifeline sudan is seeking to stave off up to 100000 
anticipated deaths from starvation last year as many as 500000 
sudanese died because of famine caused by floodings and civil war 
grant said delivery of food will go on through the rainy season 
but much of the grain will have to be stored at central 
distribution points he said hunger will drive many remote 
villagers to the storage sites compounding the problems of a 
population displaced by the fighting 
the sudan peoples liberation army has been fighting the central 
government since 1983 the christian and animist rebels want 
greater autonomy from the moslemcontrolled government in khartoum 
among the difficulties operation lifeline sudan has encountered 
are attacks on a convoy by tribesmen a railroad strike and 
ethiopias refusal to allow shipments of food on its roads 
bordering sudan 
grain deliveries are now being divided about equally between 
rebelheld and governmentcontrolled areas grant said he said 
both sides have agreed to let food convoys trains barges and 
airlifts pass through designated corridors of peace 
unicef which grant directs is coordinating the relief effort 
with the food and agriculture organization the international 
committee of the red cross governments and private agencies

hundreds of rival soccer fans 
battled each other and attacked police wednesday during riots on 
the day of the netherlandswest germany world cup qualifier at 
least 23 people were reported injured 
fans also rampaged downtown before the game hurling bricks at 
police and smashing windows 
police said they arrested 40 fans mostly during fights outside 
the feyenoord stadium while the two teams were playing inside 
according to police spokeswoman ellen peeters she said rival fans 
attacked each other and battled police who intervened 
about 1500 fans were involved in that disorder police said 
authorities deployed 600 officers including 250 riot police 
during the match for fear of a repeat of the stadium disaster in 
sheffield britain on april 15 when 95 people were killed in the 
crush of the crowd 
dutch fans had threatened to storm the 57000capacity stadium 
on wednesday unless more tickets became available for the soldout 
game some people believe such a stampede is what caused the deaths 
in sheffield 
earlier wednesday police battled about 500 fans some of whom 
hurled bricks and wooden sticks in a downtown shopping 
neighborhood police said they said the rioters also looted a toy 
store and smashed dozens of shop windows 
police on horseback and riot officers with batons broke up the 
crowds in one case a police helicopter dived to within about 30 
feet of a group of marauding youngsters 
dutch television said 40 people were injured including three 
policemen the discrepancy with police figures could not be 
resolved immediately 
wednesdays game ended in a 11 tie 
after least years european championship semifinal against west 
germany dutch fans cheered their countrys 21 victory with street 
revelry and open hostility toward the germans some saw the win as 
revenge for nazi germanys occupation of the netherlands in world

about 400 to 450 people rallied wednesday 
at the state capitol to protest chippewa indian treaty rights that 
allow them to spearfish off their reservations before anyone else 
is allowed to fish 
while protesters gathered outside more than a dozen business 
people from northern wisconsin urged state officials to do act on 
the spearfishing issue before the annual spring ritual permanentlu 
damages the tourism industry 
northern wisconsin be it just or not is perceived as a 
fishless and a raciallly bigoted vacation land said john 
sprister a resort owner youve got our lives in your hands 
dont drag this thing out 
the protesters object to the chippewa being allowed to leave 
their reservations and spear walleyed pike muskellunge and other 
trophysized fish on public lakes before rodandreel season begins 
the indians spearing season began sunday and on tuesday one 
band was met at lakes by hundreds of protesters three of whom were 
arrested tuesday 
the indians treaty rights on fishing hunting and gathering 
food plants were upheld in 1983 by a federal court 
the businesssmen said they did not doubt the sincerity of 
attorney general don hanaway and gov tommy g thompson in trying 
to negotiate a settlement with the chippewa but that the public 
did not realize what they were doing 
im sure you people are working night and day on this but the 
perception is that nothing is being done campground owner al 
vehrs said 
the efforts are not in question here its the results of 
those efforts that were not satisfied with said jim galloway 
president of the boulder junction chamber of commerce 
the 1983 ruling on the tribes fishing rights came in a suit 
filed on behalf of the tribe 15 years ago parts of the suit on 
such issues as timber rights are still unresolved 
hanaway said public officials need the help of business leaders 
to convince the people of northern wisconsin that the case would 
take an additional five or six years to resolve in court and that 
a negotiated settlement is the only way to quickly resolve the 
issue 
tribal members are expected to spear only about 30000 fish this 
spring compared with an annual hookandline walleye catch of 
about 800000 fish annually in northern wisconsin 
hanaway also said northern wisconsin was being falsely labelled 
as a racist area because of the protests against spearfishing 
the fact is that there is racism but its by a very very tiny 
minority he said 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals ruled in 1983 that the 
rights the chippewa retained to hunt fish and gather on public 
lands off their reservations in roughly the northern third of the 
state had not been extinguished by later treaties or other federal 
actions 
since then us district court rulings have defined broad 
treaty rights for the states roughly 18000 chippewa indians 
including the right to a modest standard of living from fish 
game and timber on public lands

james richardson tearfully thanked 
god his attorneys and the governor wednesday on his first full day 
of freedom after spending 21 years behind bars in the poisoning 
deaths of his seven children 
free at last free at last thank god almighty im free at 
last richardson said borrowing the phrases that were 
immortalized by civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
a judged ruled late tuesday in arcadia the southwest florida 
town where the children died that the former orange pickets 1968 
trial on a charge of murder was tainted by prosecutorial misconduct 
and perjured testimony 
retired circuit judge clifton kelly assigned to review the case 
by the state supreme court released richardson to the custody of 
miami attorney ellis rubin 
richardson 53 started his day with a stroll on the beach near 
the state prison where he spent much of his confinement which 
included a harrowing stay on death row 
its a pleasure to walk on the beach see the sunlight 
picking up sand and dirt kicking my feet in the water ive never 
felt that in 21 years he said 
richardsons wife annie mae called her husbands release a 
miracle from god 
former comedian dick gregory has offered richardson a 10year 
contract to work for him at his fort walton beach nutrition center 
and discussions are under way for a featurelength movie on 
richardsons ordeal 
richardson described the horror of being on death watch having 
his body shaved and watching his coffin being built before his 
sentence was commuted in 1972 when the us supreme court struck 
down the nations death penalty statutes 
you can almost taste the sense of death on your tongue he 
said 
he said he thought he was going to die during heart surgery 18 
months ago but richardson said he feels no bitterness toward those 
who put him on death row i dont have no hate in my heart 
the state has 10 days to order a retrial but attorney mark 
lane whose 1971 book arcadia claimed richardson was framed 
predicted the case will be closed 
gov bob martinez issued an executive order that leaves the 
final determination about a new trial to janet reno the special 
prosecutor he appointed to review the case 
the governor also encouraged ms reno to continue her 
investigation into the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of 
officials involved in the prosecution 
rubin and lane accused former state attorney frank schaub of 
using manufactured testimony to railroad their black client in the 
trial before an allwhite jury 
schaub denies there was anything improper in the trial and has 
filed a defamationofcharacter suit against the two attorneys 
schaub accused lane and rubin of orchestrating richardsons release 
to feed the ever increasing demand for fictionalized stories from 
the news and closely allied entertainment industries 
reno told kelly james richardson did not receive a fair 
trial key evidence was withheld that could have changed the 
outcome she said 
richardsons lawyers and the special prosecutor presented 
testimony pointing to baby sitter betsy reese as a prime suspect 
ms reese 67 is in an arcadia nursing home suffering from 
alzheimers disease two nurses filed affidavits last year that she 
confessed several years ago to poisoning the children ranging in 
age from 2 to 8 
the children died oct 25 1967 hours after eating a lunch 
tainted with insecticide richardson and his wife were working in a 
citrus grove eight miles away when the baby sitter served the lunch

authorities excavated the bodies of more than 200 
people who had been shot during josef stalins rule and buried in a 
mass grave outside kiev the official news agency tass reported 
wednesday 
tass quoting from a report in the weekly literaturnaya gazeta 
said the bodies of foreigners were among those found during four 
days of excavation at a site in the darnitsa forest it did give 
the exact days for the excavation 
the government has estimated the site contains from 6000 to 
68000 bodies but unofficial estimates said bodies of up to 
300000 people were stacked in the grave 
a government commission in march found that the bodies buried at 
the site were those of victims killed under stalins repressions 
not by nazi soldiers as three previous official inquiries had 
ruled 
the commissions conclusion in march supported testimony of 
elderly witnesses in the nearby village of bykovnia who said they 
saw trucks that dripped blood rumbling to area in the 1930s before 
the nazis occupied the area 
the personal belongings found in the mass graves will 
undoubtedly help clear up the bykovnia case said tass quoting 
the newspaper 
tass said gunshots pierced many of the skulls 
it said the grave also contained servicemen and civilians from 
other countries citing evidence of foreign uniforms footwear and 
toothbrushes 
earlier commissions on bykovnia had blamed the nazis for the 
killings even though villagers insisted the bodies were already 
there when the germans occupied kiev in september 1941 
the report blamed several generations of bureaucrats in kiev 
with covering up stalinist crimes at the site 
the villagers broke five decades of terrified silence to accuse 
josef stalins secret police of the killings after the ukrainian 
government erected a monument in may 1988 blaming nazi occupiers 
for the crime the villagers forced ukrainian authorities in 
december to establish the commission 
western historians estimate 20 million soviets were killed under 
stalin particularly during the great purge of the late 1930s but 
soviet officials ignored the dark side of stalin for most of the 
past 50 years 
the examination of stalins crimes begun briefly under nikita s 
khrushchev and was revived in 1987 under president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness 
western historians also blame the soviets for the massacre of 
4250 polish officers unearthed in 1943 in a mass grave 310 miles 
away in the katyn forest earlier this year polish authorities 
said stalins forces killed the officials although official soviet 
commissions have blamed the nazis 
a joint polishsoviet commission is examining katyn and other 
blank spots in soviet history

house democratic leaders pulled a 47 billion 
spending bill off the floor wednesday after rebellious lawmakers 
rejected a plan to cut 1 billion from the pentagon budget to 
strengthen the war on drugs and finance other domestic programs 
house speaker jim wright of texas responding to defeat in the 
first budget test of the year pledged corrective surgery that 
would satisfy disgruntled democrats and republicans 
leaders wanted to pay for the spending in the bill by curtailing 
defense foreign aid and many domestic programs by 14 billion 
but the effort failed when minority republicans were joined by 
democrats seeking to protect their favorite programs from 
acrosstheboard cuts 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash who offered the 
spendingcut amendment said the vote was a sign of the 
divisiveness of budget issues and not a signal that the democratic 
leadership was weakened by the controversy surrounding wright and 
his personal finances 
i dont think it reflects on leadership problems foley 
said this is not a vote of confidence issue 
one of the 92 democrats who voted against their leaders plan 
was rep robert roe dnj chairman of the house science space 
and technology committee roe said he opposed the acrosstheboard 
cuts because they would have sliced too deeply into the programs he 
oversees 
from our point of view we were battling the loss of about 
100 million from science and space he said 
foleys proposal would have produced 14 billion in savings by 
shaving 57 percent off most government programs the provision 
would have produced cuts this year of 1 billion in defense 353 
million in domestic programs and 43 million in foreign aid 
white house budget director richard darman had sent lawmakers a 
policy statement in which he said he would urge president bush to 
veto the fiscally irresponsible measure 
and in a letter to house minority leader bob michel rill 
defense secretary dick cheney said the defense cuts would force the 
pentagon to stop paying reenlistment bonuses reduce training 
hours eliminate five to 10 construction projects lay off 
scientists and engineers and curtail weapons testing 
this would have very serious consequences for the manning of 
our forces he wrote adding that he too would seek a veto 
but loyal democrats countered that the spending cuts were slight 
and could be dealt with by federal agencies 
all were talking about are revisions of 57 percent so we can 
cover some of the priorities we in congress think are needed 
said rep neal smith diowa 
looming over the battle was the veto threat from the bush 
administration which labeled the overall bill fiscally 
irresponsible and said the democrats proposed 1 billion in 
defense cuts would be too harsh 
the legislation deemed a dire emergency by its supporters 
would provide money for the 1989 fiscal year which ends sept 30 
included would be 12 billion for veterans programs 892 million 
for guaranteed student loans 822 million for antidrug efforts 
600 million for last years forest fire costs 
republicans complained that the legislation would leave spending 
levels well above limits agreed to in a 1987 budget pact between 
congress and thenpresident reagan they also said it would push 
this years deficit even further beyond the 135 billion limit set 
in the budget the 1989 shortfall is expected to surpass 163 
billion without counting this measure 
if a satirist wanted a perfect lampoon about how the congress 
of the united states makes economic policy if a cartoonist was 
looking for the biggest blubbering whale in the ocean to harpoon 
if he wanted a model of a turkey they need to look no further 
than this bill said rep silvio conte rmass 
the legislation was endowed with symbolic importance because of 
the recently concluded agreement between bush and congressional 
leaders on next years budget 
republicans argued that with work on 1990 deficit reduction just 
beginning it looked bad for congress to begin its work this year 
by boosting the 1989 shortfall the ranking republican on the house 
budget committee rep bill frenzel of minnesota called the 
legislation the moral equivalent of banana republic fiscal 
policy 
democrats used some of the bills spending such as its funds 
for new prisons training for new law officers and other antidrug 
measures as a test of bushs willingness to pursue initiatives he 
has endorsed 
if youre serious about dealing with the drug problem in this 
country youll vote yes said rep david bonior dmich the 
deputy house whip 
but republicans argued that the drug expenditures and other 
parts of the bill could have waited until next year 
it makes a good show great charade im for drug abatement 
and against abuse and all of that sort of thing said michel 
but i tell you folks theyve got more money now than they can 
spend 
the 47 billion measure would also provide 423 million for 
state foster care programs 250 million for reparations for 
japaneseamericans who were interned during world war ii 154 
million for the homeless 127 million for unemployment assistance 
100 million for refugee assistance and 88 million for public 
housing 
the senate has yet to consider the spending bill

israeli soldiers reportedly shot and killed 
three palestinians and wounded at least 63 during a general strike 
wednesday in the occupied lands and masked attackers killed an 
arab accused of collaborating with israel 
also wednesday more than 80 palestinian leaders in the occupied 
lands rejected a government proposal for elections leading to an 
interim peace plan the leaders many of them proplo said the 
elections were a ploy calculated to appeal to the media to end 
the palestinian uprising and to win time 
they said only an international peace conference with plo 
participation can solve the middle east conflict their signed 
statement was the first formal response by local palestinians to 
shamirs proposal 
in another development the leaders of five major christian 
denominations in jerusalem denounced israels crackdown on the 
uprising protesting what they described as excessive use of 
force and the unprovoked harrassment of palestinians 
the joint statement marked the sharpest criticism of israel by 
christian leaders since the december 1987 start of the uprising it 
was signed by the heads of the greek orthodox roman catholic 
armenian syrian and anglican churches 
wednesdays violence occurred mostly in the gaza strip a 
stronghold of the islamic fundamentalist group hamas which called 
the strike on the anniversary of the capture of mecca in saudi 
arabia by the prophet mohammed in 630 
the widespread clashes apparently were sparked by the death of 
sharif khatib 16 who was killed by troops during a confrontation 
in gaza citys sabra neighborhood arab reports said the army 
confirmed that khatib was killed by army gunfire 
about 300 sabra residents some waving outlawed palestinian 
flags and chanting god is great carried khatibs body 
through the streets troops fired live ammunition to disperse the 
funeral march wounding at least 13 palestinians arab reports said 
the violence spread and 17yearold ammal mohammed hussein was 
fatally shot in the head by troops in the nearby shati refugee camp 
an army official confirmed the death but said the circumstances 
were under investigation 
at least 45 other palestinians most of them teenagers were 
shot and wounded in stonethrowing clashes with troops in gaza 
they included a 2yearold girl from gaza city who was seriously 
injured by a plastic bullet in the head 
in the west bank 8yearold issam omar aniss was fatally shot 
in the chest when soldiers opened fire on stonethrowers on the 
tulkarem refugee camp arab hospital officials said a least five 
palestinians were wounded in west bank clashes including a 
9yearold boy from tulkarem camp who was reported in critical 
condition with a plastic bullet in the eye 
an army official confirmed 10 wounded in the occupied lands and 
said he was investigating the report of the tulkarem death he 
noted that in two cases bodies were taken by relatives for quick 
burial before army investigators arrived the army usually lags 
hours behind hospitals in confirming casualties 
masked assailants carrying automatic rifles gunned down the 
alleged collaborator fayek erar at his home in the northern west 
bank village of ras atiya arab reporters said the 40yearold 
property dealer became the sixth victim in a week apparently 
targeted for cooperating with israel 
the army confirmed the death and said police were investigating 
the plobacked leadership of the 16month uprising declared 
wednesday a day of accounting for the collaborators 
the four deaths brought to 451 the number of palestinians killed 
in the uprising eighteen israelis also have died in the violence 
also wednesday a palestinian detainee was found dead in his 
cell at the israels ketziot detention camp where hundreds of 
palestinians are held without charge or trial 
an army official said the man identified as 21yearold omar 
hassan ismail sakut from gazas bureij refugee camp apparently was 
killed by fellow prisoners during a dispute he did not elaborate 
the palestinian leaders called on israel to recognize the 
necessity of negotiations with the plo within the framework of an 
international conference and described the plo as the 
palestinians sole legitimate representative 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs plan calls for elections in the 
occupied lands to choose leaders who would negotiate an interim 
settlement with israel 
shamir has ruled out talks with the plo israeli withdrawal from 
occupied lands and the formation of a palestinian state the 
palestinians said they did not reject the idea of elections but 
wanted any vote to be part of an overall plan leading to israeli 
withdrawal and palestinian independence 
foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said wednesday he 
understood the difficulty the palestinians are having is with the 
fact that shamirs plan is speaking about an interim agreement and 
is not indicating anything about the final status 
however he said the plans main objective is to open talks

being replaced in a major overhaul of the bureau that deals with 
the arabisraeli dispute and india and pakistan 
a us official insisting on anonymity confirmed on wednesday 
a washington times report that the five had been notified by john 
kelly who is awaiting senate confirmation to head the bureau that 
they should seek new jobs elsewhere in the foreign service 
kelly told them at a meeting at the department last friday that 
he wanted to make a fresh start the official said kelly is 
recalling james p covey the us deputy ambassador to egypt to 
serve as his principal deputy in the bureau of near eastern and 
south asian affairs 
the five officials being reassigned include paul j hare who is 
running the bureau while kelly awaits confirmation by the senate 
hare a former us ambassador to zambia played a key role in 
the meetings president bush and secretary of state james a baker 
iii held here this month with three visiting middle eastern 
leaders egyptian president hosni mubarak israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir and king hussein of jordan 
hare son of raymod hare a former us ambassador to egypt is 
considered primarily a specialist in african affairs the four 
others being reassigned are howard schaffer a peter burleigh 
william a kirby and edward s walker 
the bureau one of the most complex in the state department 
deals with the middle east the persian gulf and the indian 
subcontinent schaffer has specialized in india pakistan and 
afghanistan burleigh in the gulf and kirby and walker on 
arabisraeli issues 
covey a protege of former secretary of state henry a 
kissinger has served in israel and egypt kelly meanwhile is a 
former us ambassador to lebanon who was publicly criticized by 
former secretary of state george p shultz for not informing him of 
instructions he had received from the national security council 
during the surreptitious sale of us weapons to iran 
whether kelly will play a dominant role in shaping us policy 
in the middle east is not apparent dennis ross who heads the

the government declared its support 
for the strained nato alliance wednesday in a rebuttal of us and 
british officials dismayed by its call for early superpower talks 
on shortrange nuclear arms 
there has never been a german intention to pursue an 
independent course chief government spokesman hans klein said at 
a bonn news conference it is not our intention to jeopardize the 
alliance 
us and british officials have harshly criticized chancellor 
helmut kohls decision to press for prompt superpower talks to 
reduce the number of shortrange nuclear weapons 
us defense secretary dick cheney described such negotiations 
as a dangerous trap he said it would be a mistake to risk 
cutbacks in this kind of weapon while the sovietled warsaw pact 
holds an advantage in conventional forces in europe 
referring to criticism from british prime minister margaret 
thatcher klein said kohl would restate his governments position 
when the two leaders meet in west germany on sunday 
the chancellor will endeavor to explain the west german 
position again in an atmosphere of trust and friendship klein 
said 
mrs thatcher on tuesday harshly rejected kohls proposal she 
said shortrange missiles are part of nato strategy which cannot 
be undermined by any one country 
however the west german government responding to domestic 
pressure and overtures from soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
contends the climate is right to step up arms control efforts with 
the soviet bloc 
west germany has said nato should postpone a planned upgrading 
of shortrange missiles while pursuing negotiations on reducing 
their number 
in copenhagen denmark the danish government on wednesday 
joined several other nato allies that have backed west germanys 
stand on the shortrange missiles 
there is no need to decide on the modernization of natos 
shortrange missiles in europe until the beginning of the 1990s 
danish foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen told visiting foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany

ronald reagan defending president bush 
against criticism he was moving too slowly in dealing with the 
soviets insisted wednesday that bush was doing just fine his 
first 100 days in office 
for his part bush said as he met with reagan for the first time 
since taking office he had a lot more to learn from the former 
president about what reporters wanted to know life its own 
self bush said 
i learned a lot in eight years learned a lot about principle 
learned a lot about the world as it really is bush said 
in a gesture of respect bush went to reagans office 34 
stories high above los angeles rather than have the former 
president come to him at a hotel suite it was their first meeting 
since bushs jan 20 inauguration 
bush said he wanted to draw on reagans knowledge about 
changes that are taking place abroad japan nato europe all 
over the place and get his advice 
reagan asked about bushs first months in office told 
reporters i think hes doing just fine 
he was a major part of everything that we did during 
reagans eight years in office the former president added 
when a reporter mentioned that bush has been criticized for 
taking his time in returning to arms talks with the soviets and 
opening contacts with president mikhail gorbachev reagan 
reiterated hes doing just fine 
asked about oliver norths trial in which the former national 
security council aide said he believed he had reagans 
authorization for operating a clandestine scheme to arm the 
nicaraguan contras reagan said he and bush both were in the same 
boat in that they could not comment on the case 
reagan also refused to criticize his onetime vice president for 
cutting back funding for reagans onceprized star wars missile 
defense plan and for seeking humanitarian aid not military 
assistance for the contra rebels 
i think that i can rest assured that he means to maintain our 
national security reagan said 
both bush and reagan said they hoped that arguments being heard 
wednesday that the supreme court would set the stage for outlawing 
abortion 
bush said he hopes to tap reagan for some missions or 
assignments in the future he said he had nothing specific in mind 
but added the respect for him reagan around the world knows no 
bounds 
nearing the end of a hectic fourday trip bush later flew to 
austin to address the texas legislature then he was heading to 
miami where on thursday he will participate in a series of events 
to highlight antidrug efforts and also will dedicate an 
alzheimers disease center 
addressing issues dear to the hearts of texans bush called on 
congress to pass a responsible savings and loan bill and said 
america was buying too much foreign oil 
he told the lawmakers there is no place on earth like texas 
bush claims texas as his adopted home state 
now im no cowboy bush said i pitch horseshoes for a 
living but i dont ride broncos 
texas oil industry has been battered for several years by low 
petroleum prices moreover the state has more failed savings and 
loans than any other 
bush said unemployment was at its lowest level in four years and 
that the energy industry was being depended upon less for jobs 
still no matter how diversified and hightech that we become 
a strong domestic energy industry is important still important to 
the future of this state and in my view all of america bush 
said 
i find it disturbing that nearly 50 percent of americas oil 
is imported said bush a onetime oil man this is not good 
for the national security of the united states of america 
bush reiterated his position that the massive oil spill in 
alaska should not lead to cutbacks in oil exploration 
conservationists have called for a ban on drilling in the arctic 
national wildlife refuge 
bush said that shutting down our domestic energy production is 
no answer and would merely increase our dependence on foreign oil 
we must and we will maintain a strong energy industry 
bush said the continuing crisis of failures in the savings and 
loan industry was among the few dark clouds still on the 
horizon 
the president praised the senate for acting quickly on an sampl 
bailout bill and said i call on the house of representatives to 
pass a responsible sampl bill as soon as possible 
he said his proposal includes 37 million for the justice 
department so that those who willfully abuse the trust of small 
savers can expect to be pursued tried and if guilty put in 
prison 
bush flubbed a line in his speech where he was talking about 
hopes to conquer cancer instead he said cancer conquer 
he made a good recovery by referring to the speech given by 
texas state treasurer ann richards ridiculing him during last 
summers democratic national convention 
ann richards was right bush said i kept putting that 
silver foot in my mouth 
she was standing in the front row of the legislative hall and 
applauded along with the rest of the crowd

two researchers who say theyve used ordinary 
lab equipment to master fusion the process that powers the sun and 
the stars told congress wednesday they will duplicate their 
experiments for government scientists in hopes of quieting skeptics 
we have 19 experiments being set up now university of utah 
chemist stanley pons told the house science committee including a 
demonstration of roomtemperature fusion for scientists from the 
los alamos national laboratory 
pons said the federal scientists will monitor the experiment at 
utah then dismantle it and take it to the national laboratory in 
new mexico for further tests 
pons and his collaborator martin fleischmann of the university 
of south hampton in england are making the arrangement to silence 
some of the skepticism about their claim to have discovered a way 
to achieve fusion using ordinary lab equipment assembled on a table 
top 
their announcement of cooperation with los alamos came after 
rep sid morrision rwash questioned them closely about why so 
many other laboratories have not been able to duplicate their 
results and asked if they would perform the experiment before 
independent observers 
we are very happy to tell people how we have been able to do 
it said fleischmann but he added that those who cant duplicate 
the process should publish in full reports of their failures 
several other researchers have said their experiments appeared to 
confirm the utah scientists endeavors 
rep marilyn lloyd dtenn said reports on the fusion process 
indicated that the energy levels achieved were low she asked pons 
and fleischmann if they had actually achieved a useful 
temperature with the reaction 
weve had a cell warm up to the boiling point said 
fleischmann adding however that scaling the process up to a 
useful level raises many new problems 
we think its feasible but it will require a very high 
effort 
pons and fleishmann announced their discovery march 23 stunning 
nuclear physicists around the world who have attempted to achieve 
fusion for 25 years using multimilliondollar machines 
the hearing was jammed with journalists scientists and 
industrial representatives anxious to learn more about a reaction 
that some predict could produce plentiful electric power with 
little environmental pollution or threat 
pons told the committee how he and fleischmann had inserted 
electrodes of platinum and palladium in a flask containing 
deuterium oxide or heavy water electrical current was applied to 
the platinum electrode pons said forcing deuterium atoms into the 
crystal lattice of the palladium 
he said that after the experiment ran for several hours the 
deuterium became compressed and fused giving off heat almost four 
times as great as the energy the experiment had consumed 
the utah researchers said they built their initial experiment 
for about 100000 but fleischmann said that production of a 
scaleup device will cost about 10 times that and that the next 
phase producing enough energy to be useful would cost 
millions 
chase peterson president of the university of utah appeared 
with pons and urged the committee to respond quickly to the fusion 
discovery by pushing for federal aid to establish a fusion research 
center at the university 
peterson said that the utah legislature had allocated 5 million 
for the project and had collected more than 1 million in private 
donations 
what level of funding do you believe is needed asked rep 
george e brown jr dcalif 
the figure that comes to mind is 25 million said peterson 
several committee members reacted favorably to his suggestion 
but added that coming up with the money would be difficult in a 
climate of budgetary restraint 
other scientists who testified urged the committee not to rush 
to support of the utah research 
we scientists need at least two months to evaluate the 
significance of this process said steven jones a brigham young 
university fusion researcher 
george miley a fusion researcher at the university of illinois 
told the committee that putting millions of dollars into the utah 
experiment now could hurt energy research in general 
a failure could set fusion research back by years he said 
i urge us to no overeact and put all our eggs in one basket 
mike saltmarsh head of the fusion energy program at the oak 
ridge national laboratory in tennessee said his lab and other 
federal facilities have all tried to duplicate the utah process 
the results have all been negative he said we have seen 
no heat generated by the process 
saltmarsh told the committee it would be a real mistake to 
try to dray firm conclusions at this point 
he said many questions about the utah experiment still need to 
be answered before it is understood 
one of the elements to be investigated said fleischmann is the 
metal that can be used in cold fusion the palladium used by the 
utak researchers is an expensive metal that is available in only a 
few places on earth 
fleischmann said other experiments are under way to find if 
other metals can be used palladium may be the best choice but 
there may be also other possible choices he said 
researchers in texas california and washington have reported 
what may be fusion reactions but many other laboratories have 
reported failed efforts scientists in the soviet union and hungary 
reported experiments with reactions that may be fusion 
fleischmann said followup articles detailing how the experiment 
is being conducted will be published in scientific journals 
pons said part of the controversy revolves around the different 
way in which chemists and physicists announce the results of their 
work the utah experiments have come under heavy criticism from 
fusion experts because the precise details needed for duplication 
of the work have not been released 
pons said that physicists typically circulate a prepublication 
copy of their research to colleagues for informal review 
for chemists it is done in a different way he said the 
review is left up to the journal 
the march 23 announcement stunned the international physics 
community which has spent millions of dollars over the last 
quarter century attempting to achieve fusion using massive machines 
filled with plasmas heated to temperatures of up to 100 million 
degrees 
many experts believe fusion to be the ultimate energy source 
the nuclear process is the opposite of the fission reaction that 
now powers atomic generating plants fission occurs by splitting 
atoms and the process leaves behind highly radioactive spent fuel 
fusion derives its energy by forcing atoms of deuterium or 
hydrogen together the reaction produces an atom of helium a burst 
of energy and a neutron experts believe fusion energy would 
produce a much smaller amount of radioactive waste and that fusion 
power plants could be operated with deuterium oxide or heavy 
water a chemical that can easily be extracted from seawater 
natural fusion energy is the power that causes the sun and the 
stars to shine stellar fusion is created when the massive force of 
gravity in stars forces hydrogen atoms to fuse giving off heat 
light and helium most hot fusion research is an attempt to 
duplicate the pressure and heat process seen on the sun

an incontinent retarded 7yearold with aids 
may attend public school and sit at a desk alongside other mentally 
disabled children her age a federal judge ruled wednesday 
eliana martinez had been told she could attend class only if she 
remained isolated inside a glass booth her adoptive mother rosa 
martinez took her battle to court saying she would not send her 
daughter to school to sit in a glass cage 
eliana wont have to be separated from her 10 classmates under 
the ruling by us district judge elizabeth kvachevich which the 
childs attorney thinks will have effects around the country 
and she will be at class thursday with bells on said the 
attorney steve hanlon after ms kovachevich ruled the child posed 
no significant health risk to other children 
all she understands is she will be going in to play with some 
little people she doesnt know what school is she hasnt been to 
it said her mother 
the judge has finally entered a ruling i am recommending it 
be followed said school board attorney crosby few the 
partition is a moot question now there wont be one she will be 
in the classroom just like the other kids i hope this is the end 
of it 
few said school officials had hoped to have a couple of days 
before eliana attended class we had hoped to be able to educate 
the parents first to answer all their questions and inquiries 
before hand the education will just have to come later 
its been a difficult time for all of us said hanlon he 
said he thinks school officials will be as glad as we are to put 
this matter behind us 
theres been a great deal of misinformation in the case he 
said adding that he approved of a court requirement that the 
school system educate pupils and parents at elianas school about 
aids 
the judge also noted that mrs martinez didnt object to a 
oneonone aide for eliana or a daily examination by a school nurse 
to determine if attendance is advisable that day 
in december the 11th us circuit court of appeals sent the 
case back to ms kovachevich saying the child must be placed in a 
regular classroom unless evidence proves eliana posed a significant 
risk to other children through bodily secretions 
through affidavits and sworn statements ms kovachevich said 
she learned eliana is capable of being instructed not to suck or 
mouth her fingers and that she is well on her way to being fully 
toilettrained 
the judge said she took that into consideration in making her 
decision as well as two other factors the childs doctor told the 
court he doesnt think the risk merits such precautions as 
isolation and the pediatric association now makes no 
recommendation for a restricted environment for youngsters who 
cannot control bodily secretions 
initially ms kovachevich ruled aug 8 than eliania could 
attend manhattan elementary school but had to remain inside an 
enclosed plexiglass partition until she was toilettrained and 
learned to stop sucking her fingers 
hillsborough county school officials fought attempts to admit 
her they feared she might transmit the deadly incurable acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome virus through bodily fluids 
but hanlon and mrs martinez a nurse who adopted eliana as an 
infant in her native puerto rico isisted that to develop fully 
eliana needed to be with other children

an ordinance that would give unmarried or 
homosexual city workers equal standing with married employees will 
start a nationwide trend in both the public and private sectors 
supporters predicted wednesday 
city officials are expected to approve the measure which 
virtually redefines the family mayor art agnos endorsed the 
measure at its introduction tuesday and eight of the 11member 
board of supervisors signed as sponsors 
this is landmark putting into city law in the first major 
city in the country that lesbian and gay couples and unmarried 
straight couples have a right to dignity in their relationships 
larry brinkin of the citys human rights commission said wednesday 
if approved the ordinance would be the most farreaching of its 
kind in the country said matt coles of the american civil 
liberties unions san francisco chapter who spent more than a year 
helping draft the final version 
the measure broader than one approved in 1982 by city 
supervisors but vetoed by thenmayor dianne feinstein applies to 
24000 city employees it is not known how many would be directly 
affected 
the ordinance would ban discrimination by city agencies because 
of nontraditional relationships and would extend many benefits 
like dependent health care and pension benefits currently 
provided only to married couples 
it also would expand sick and bereavement leave for employees 
whose lovers or parents are seriously ill or have died 
the ordinance would also formalize nondiscriminatory policies 
already in effect such as visiting rights for domestic partners at 
city hospitals and city jails said coles 
the only policy in practice that has not been changed to 
accommodate nontraditional families is one that grants free passes 
to transit workers spouses he said 
controller sam yockey has determined that the provisions of the 
plan will not cost the city since city employees pay for dependent 
health benefits 
supervisor harry britt author of the original and the new 
version of the measure defended the need for the legislation 
wednesday 
society must not interfere with the basic relationships that 
make up our lives said britt who is gay 
coles believes the measures biggest impact will be in the 
private sector 
this will be used by private employers and private 
instutitions to finally acknowledge these types of relationships 
he said we know many have wanted to do this but needed us to 
show them how and by what standards and under what conditions 
the san francisco chamber of commerce announced tuesday that it 
is reviewing domestic partnership policies that can voluntarily be 
adopted by businesses the chamber has not taken a stand on the 
ordinance 
britt aide rick ruvolo said his office has been flooded with 
inquiries about the proposal from governments citizen groups and 
companies around the world 
san francisco has about 158000 nonfamily households which 
includes roommate situations as well as committed nonmarital 
relationships said agnos citing 1980 census bureau figures the 
city has 140000 family households 
the only major opposition is expected to come from religious 
groups 
norman phillips of the san francisco roman catholic archdiocese 
said the church cannot support any effort to weaken the 
institution of marriage to tinker with it or put any parallel 
system alongside it 
the law would require domestic partners to have a joint home and 
share basic living expenses although each could maintain a second 
home they also must register with city hall or for those wishing 
confidentiality with a notarized statement filed with a third 
party such as an attorney 
to put the measure into effect the board will have to negotiate 
with 10 different insurance providers and with three unions which 
each have seats on the sevenmember health board

irans information minister on wednesday 
revealed details of what the iranians say is a us spy operation 
in iran alleging the agents included military officers clergymen 
and civilians official reports said 
in a televised news conference mohammad mohammadi reyshahri 
said the cia had carried out acts of terrorism and sabotage in 
iran including assassinations of highranking officials the 
islamic republic news agency reported the dispatch was monitored 
in nicosia 
these spy networks were organized by the united states to 
infiltrate the islamic republic system and divert the revolution in 
the next decades reyshahri said 
irna quoted him as saying the iranian agents had been recruited 
by the cia mainly from those iranians calling at us embassies 
abroad for various purposes such as obtaining visitors visas to the 
united states 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said last week he 
had no information on the iranian allegations they make similar 
claims every once in a while about american spies when they need a 
little attention he said 
reyshahri said the agents all were linked to a cia base at 
weisbaden near frankfurt in west germany he said west germany and 
an unidentified neighboring country of iran cooperated with the cia 
in the operation 
reyshahri identified 20 of the alleged agents seven of them 
officers in the armed forces he said they were only some of those 
who had been arrested 
among those named were three senior naval commanders who 
according to unconfirmed reports from iranian dissidents were 
executed in early april for plotting to overthrow the government 
reyshahri identified them as commodore kianoosh hakimi capt 
ghahreman malekzadeh and capt touraj riyahi 
reyshahri did not say whether any of the accused agents were 
still alive or if they had been executed 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani who broke the news about 
the arrests on friday said all the alleged agents were still alive 
and under interrogation 
though resyhahri did not name the neighboring country accused of 
cooperating with the american spy operation he read from the 
testimony of one alleged agent who said they were taken for 
training to another country via turkey 
he said agents in the armed forces had given the cia information 
about iranian naval movements in the persian gulf during the 
eightyear iraniraq war 
reyshahri said tens of agents had been arrested and that other 
arrests would follow in the coming weeks irna reported 
but he said that if the agents identified themselves before 
being caught their sentences would be shorter 
responding to a question from an iranian reporter reyshahri 
said the iranian intelligence service known as savama learned 
about the alleged cia network in 1985 but that the arrests were 
made only a few months ago 
the alleged agents all passed lie detector tests before being 
recruited and were given regular annual training in espionage 
techniques including the use of codes development of photographic 
film and use of special radios and cameras reyshahri said 
he said equipment used by the alleged agents such as special 
photgraphic film and cameras were imported into iran packaged as 
medicine 
the agents allegedly reported to the cia about iranian military 
sites number of personnel in the armed forces and government 
offices and military and civilian flight routes reyshahri said 
reyshahri named the head of one of the alleged networks as 
masoud dalvand irna reported 
among the others was a foreign ministry expert on legal affairs 
bahman aqaei and another lawyer named manuchehr azar 
two other spies included masoud bidvar and jamshid amiri both 
employed in the oil industry 
the only clergyman among the group was identified as 
heshmatollah maqsudi

lucille ball the daffy comedian whose 
harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy but delighted 
viewers for four decades died wednesday of a ruptured abdominal 
artery she was 77 
the actress star of the hugely popular i love lucy and 
related situation comedies seen in more than 80 countries had 
undergone major heart surgery april 18 
she had been recovering steadily getting out of bed and joking 
with the staff but shortly before dawn wednesday she went into 
cardiac arrest due to internal bleeding and could not be revived 
said cedarssinai medical center spokesman ronald wise 
she suffered a complete heart failure at 5 am and 47 minutes 
of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless wise said there was 
nothing to indicate this would happen wise said the heart 
itself apparently was not involved in miss balls sudden death 
in the 6hour surgery at cedarssinai doctors replaced her 
aorta and aortic valve although the replaced portion of miss 
balls aorta did not apparently fail the entire artery was in poor 
condition when she was operated upon said dr robert kass 
kass who performed the operation said at the time the tearing 
in miss balls aorta progressed all the way down into her 
abdomen 
miss ball with her fireengine red hair and siren wail was 
considered the queen of situation comedy and a pioneer of the 
sitcom format 
i and 100 million others will miss her said comedian george 
burns but we havent lost lucille ball because shes still with 
us on television and we can see her on and on 
lucille ball possessed the gift of laughter but she also 
embodied an even greater treasure the gift of love president 
bush said in a statement she appealed to the gentler impulses of 
the human spirit she was not merely an actress or comedienne she 
was lucy and she was loved 
her red hair her antics on the screen her timing and her 
zest for life made her an american institution former president 
and nancy reagan said in a statement just the mention of her 
name brings a smile we love lucy and will miss her deeply 
its a shock after working very closely with her and loving 
her for over 35 years said miss balls frequent sidekick gale 
gordon who was in edmonton alberta 
while in the hospital the comedian was deluged with thousands 
of cards letters flowers and phone calls from fans as far away as 
australia and europe 
miss ball and her late former husband desi arnaz starred in 
i love lucy from 1951 to 1957 and have been seen since in 
widely syndicated reruns the late vivian vance and william frawley 
played their neighbors fred and ethel mertz 
her splitsecond timing widemouthed wails and exaggerated 
pratfalls made the i love lucy show one of the most popular in 
television history 
bridge clubs and bowling teams changed their meeting nights to 
watch lucy and ethel cook up still another ridiculous scheme that 
would push their longsuffering husbands to exasperation 
miss balls real onscreen pregnancy marked a milestone in 
television and an estimated 44 million viewers more than for the 
inauguration of president eisenhower tuned in on jan 19 1953 
to watch lucy ricardo have little ricky the real birth occurred 
just four hours before the previouslyfilmed show was broadcast 
miss balls singularity as a comedian was matched by her talent 
as a showbusiness entrepreneur she and arnaz established one of 
tvs first major independent studios 
desilu as their production company was called made some of the 
top comedy shows of the 1950s and 60s including december 
bride our miss brooks and make room for daddy 
as testament to their value as primetime stars miss ball and 
arnaz signed an 8 million nocancellation twoyear contract with 
cbs in 1953 the largest in television history at the time and a

mikhail s gorbachev said in a speech released 
wednesday that shortages of housing food and consumer goods are 
growing despite his reforms he blamed runaway government spending 
and soviets who forgot how to work 
in one of his frankest admissions of the soviet unions 
problems he said citizens vented their anger march 26 when at 
least three dozen senior communist party candidates were defeated 
in parliamentary elections 
gorbachev said perestroika the program he launched four years 
ago to overhaul soviet economy and society remains the proper 
course but reforms are not being put into effect properly 
particularly at the local level 
his harsh criticism appeared to set the stage for even more 
radical measures 
the food problem is far from solved the president said 
the housing problem is acute there is a dearth of consumer goods 
in the shops the list of shortages is growing the states 
financial position is grave 
he also blamed top party leadership in an unusually pointed 
attack he singled out those responsible for particular failures 
such as importing millions of medical syringes with no needles 
the construction industry he said has been shoveling 
billions of rubles into the ground and is creating actual ruins 
he said building a factory to produce detergent is in its ninth 
year while people face daily shortages of soap and detergent 
individual workers share the blame he said 
many forgot how to work they got used to being paid often 
just for coming to work 
however he said people respond badly to shortages and to 
queues which take time and to put it frankly humiliate people 
he spoke in a closing address tuesday at a closeddoor meeting 
of the partys policymaking central committee but the news agency 
tass did not release the speech until wednesday 
the speech followed a housecleaning in which the central 
committee swept 110 senior officials from leadership many had 
already retired or been ousted from posts entitling them to seats 
on the committee or its financial arm 
gorbachev told the session the activity of a series of party 
committees and soviet organs in their attitudes in style and work 
methods in their understanding of the processes taking place did 
not keep pace with life this also relates to the partys 
central committee and to its politburo 
many leaders were caught in an inertia of old thinking he 
said 
retiring the socalled dead souls many of them holdovers 
from the era of the late leonid brezhnev and promoting nearly wo 
dozen nonvoting members named after gorbachev took power to full 
voting membership helped strengthen the presidents hand in 
pressing for further reform 
the 58yearold kremlin chief paid tribute to those stepping 
down calling their resignations a brave step that represented 
a shift to a new generation of party officials 
he said that in light of the voting in the soviet unions first 
competitive nationwide balloting all levels of party and 
government must review their work so their activity meets the 
scale of the tasks being tackled by the country 
he proposed that the central committee convene again before the 
first session of the parliament the congress of peoples deputies 
to review election results and set procedures for the new body 
gorbachev regularly complains about soviet problems which for 
decades were routinely ignored or denied but this time he went 
into considerable detail and said the 1986 chernobyl nuclear power 
plant disaster and falling price of oil the soviet unions main 
export cannot be cited as catchall excuses 
the explosion at chernobyl near kiev killed 31 people and sent 
a cloud of radioactive dust into the atmosphere 
gorbachev blamed poor agricultural production on the work 
level initiative and responsibility of local leaders 
he said the problem became especially acute after the central 
leadership began delegating some power and decisionmaking to the 
local level 
when people turn to local bureaucrats for help they encounter 
the old atmosphere where every visitor is looked down upon as 
being very nearly persona non grata an undesirable phenomenon 
he complained 
this causes special resentment he said 
he said in many areas the economy has deteriorated and 
shortages are increasing in part because economic reforms were not 
fully thought out before being implemented he said many problems 
can be traced to wasteful government spending 
economists project the budget deficit will amount to 162 
billion this year 
gorbachev also noted crime has risen as society has become more 
democratic especially in areas where nationalism is on the rise 
he pledged a thorough investigation of the bloody april 9 clash 
between troops and proindependence demonstrators in soviet georgia 
its already clear now that we should all use political 
methods and the force of law not to permit a repetition of anything 
similar gorbachev said in his first public remarks about the 
incident

a former senior federal housing official on 
wednesday denied violating any ethics or conflict of interest laws 
when she became a consultant on us commercial trade activity with 
the soviet union shortly after leaving her government post 
appearing before the house government operations subcommittee on 
employment and housing june koch former assistant secretary of 
housing and urban development described her contacts with her 
former colleagues at hud as distinctly and definitely 
informational 
she said her contacts with agency officials were not an attempt 
to influence their decisions concerning visits by soviets in 
connection with a cooperation agreement in the field of housing and 
other construction 
koch served as huds assistant secretary for policy development 
and research from july 1984 until she resigned in october 1987 
she was appointed in 1985 to direct commercial trade activities 
with the soviets in connection with the agreement making her 
responsible for organizing and managing an international trade show 
stroyindustriya 87 in moscow 
hud sponsored about 110 us companies at the event at a cost of 
16 million which the government operations panel last year called 
misguided mismanaged and misspent 
during the panels probe several companies complained of being 
misled and pressured to participate in the show and questions 
arose about the propriety of the former housing official allegedly 
trying to solicit them as clients after leaving hud 
after leaving the housing agency koch became president of 
construction marketing and trading inc a consulting firm 
providing assistance to us companies wanting to do business with 
the soviet union 
she also was hired as a hud consultant for six months an 
agreement the gao said was extended twice and terminated in january 
1989 koch contended that she worked for hud consulting all of 
five or six days 
this is not a case of a revolving door at hud rather it 
appears that the door at hud was never closed to june koch 
lantos said as he opened the hearing 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the subcommittee said 
wednesday that he asked the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress to investigate kochs actions and 
business activities after leaving the government 
koch said that while still a hud assistant secretary and a 
member of a hud delegation accompanying thenhousing secretary 
samuel pierce to moscow in early october 1987 she discussed with 
soviet officials her impending resignation 
she said the soviets wanted her to arrange meetings with us 
business representatives that could provide construction products 
and services 
gao determined that kochs contacts with hud were not 
informational but for the purpose of securing meetings and 
receptions on behalf of herself and her clients with members of the 
visiting soviet delegations said john ols a gao official 
gao criticized huds monitoring of kochs postgovernment 
activities and recommended the matter be referred to the justice 
department for further investigation lantos said would decide soon 
whether to follow the gao recommendation

crews worked wednesday to repair cracks in an 
aqueduct one day after it was damaged in an earthquake that killed 
one person and shook an area from the capital to the pacific coast 
resort of acapulco 
four people were injured in tuesdays quake which measured 68 
on the richter scale but little major damage was reported 
cracks appeared in buildings in mexico city and acapulco and 
telephone electrical and subway service in the capital were 
interrupted 
the tremor felled a power line just north of the city center 
that electrocuted a man of about 30 said maria cortina benitez a 
city police spokeswoman 
water was being trucked to neighborhoods in the southeastern 
part of the city that were left without service because of the 
aqueduct damage officials said said residents of affected areas 
should have clean water again by friday 
inspectors checked schools and some highrise office buildings 
for damage 
the movement set off landslides on a rural road near acapulco 
the excelsior news service said 
the epicenter of tuesdays quake was 40 miles east of acapulco 
about 200 miles south of mexico city said the us national 
earthquake information center in golden colo 
the tremor terrified people who recalled a 1985 quake that 
crumbled many buildings in the capital and killed at least 9500 
people 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated 
areas a quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake 
capable of widespread heavy damage in populated areas

syrian soldiers fired rockets at the 
coast north of beirut on wednesday sending a ship fleeing from 
port and blocking the only escape routes for thousands of 
beleaguered christians police said 
the sporadic bombardment coincided with renewed efforts by the 
arab league to halt the latest round in lebanons 14yearold civil 
war and arrange political reforms to give moslems an equal share of 
power with the christians 
police said the syrians and militiamen of druse warlord walid 
jumblatts progressive socialist party fired their multibarreled 
rocket launchers from hilltop positions around beirut overnight and 
during the day 
their fire targeted a 10mile coastal stretch between jounieh 
and byblos the main ports of the besieged 310squaremile 
christian enclave 
an unidentified commercial ship docked in amsheet harbor just 
north of byblos sailed quickly out to sea when shells fell around 
it police said 
army commander gen michel aouns mainly christian forces struck 
back with 155mm artillery fire at syrian and druse positions around 
moslem west beirut 
no casualties were reported on either side 
at least 272 people have been killed and 991 wounded by police 
count since the current round of civil war fighting broke out 
march 8 
two cypriotflagged ferry boats had been running the gantlet of 
syrian and druse shellfire in the past five weeks to evacuate more 
than 13000 christians from the blockaded enclave through jounieh 
but sailings by the larnaca rose and the baroness m were 
suspended monday in a shipping ban imposed by aoun so that a french 
navy tanker could unload 6000 tons of fuel needed to reactivate 
lebanons shuttered power plants 
power was restored in beirut on tuesday for two hours a day 
ending a 10day blackout caused by lack of fuel at the capitals

ceasefire must take effect before the countrys problems can be 
solved 
the ministers are discussing a peace plan for lebanon that would 
include sending a multinational observer force of at least 200 arab 
officers to monitor a ceasefire 
aoun has given tacit approval to the dispatch of an arab 
observer force as a first step toward ending the fighting but 
he said he still intends to end the syrian and israeli occupation 
of lebanese territory 
syria maintains 40000 troops in moslem areas under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league israel occupies a border

antiapartheid leaders 
wednesday called for a peace conference to end fighting between 
political factions in natal province that has killed more than 
1400 blacks since 1986 
representatives of the banned united democratic front and the 
congress of south african trade unions told a news conference that 
their affiliates in natal share a commitment with the zulu 
political organization inkatha to a mass movement for peace 
crowds supporting the two sides fought in the natal town of 
mpophomeni tuesday killing five people and injuring five police 
firing tear gas and birdshot broke up the battle and arrested 196 
people authorities said 
both sides agree the violence must stop but previous peace 
initiatives have failed to halt the beatings arson fires and 
revenge killings that occur almost daily in zulu townships and 
villages 
united democratic front spokesman murphy morobe who is not 
restricted from political activity even though his organization is 
banned said affiliated community groups in natal had approved the 
peace plan 
however morobe said he was wary of possible government 
interference 
it would seem to us that when we are on the verge of a major 
political initiative to break through the cycle of violence the 
apartheid state has moved systematically to undermine the political 
process we are engaged in he said in a statement 
he referred to a speech monday by law and order minister adriaan 
vlok that blamed front supporters for the violence vlok predicted 
the peace efforts would fail and said church officials organizing 
the initiative were naive 
the front is allied with the outlawed african national congress 
the anc criticizes inkathas opposition to boycotts sanctions and 
other confrontational methods of battling south africas policy of 
racial segregation

hungarian television ignored a protest 
from prague on wednesday and broadcast a second excerpt of a 
threehour interview with alexander dubcek leader of 
czechoslovakias 1968 prague spring reforms 
it was the first official soviet bloc interview with dubcek 
since he was ousted as czechoslovak communist party leader in april 
1969 
the 40minute excerpt showed dubcek making a spirited attack on 
leonid i brezhnev who was soviet president at the time brezhnev 
died in 1982 
it was brezhnevs dogmatism that endangered socialism 
dubcek said recalling a meeting three weeks before the sovietled 
warsaw pact invasion in august 1968 
dubcek said he rejected kremlin pressure to halt his reforms 
i could not become the gravedigger of our new policies he 
said i told the russians that we have the overwhelming support 
of the people 
i want to make it clear that there was no counterrevolutionary 
threat dubcek said contradicting the kremlins justification 
for the invasion yet they keep teaching this lie 
he was referring to czechoslovak history books still in use 
today 
czechoslovakias current president gustav husak and current 
party leader milos jakes were among those most active in crushing 
dubceks reforms 
many of the reforms initiated by dubcek are similar to those now 
under way in the soviet union hungary and poland 
while hungary is slowly rehabilitating the leaders of hungarys 
1956 anticommunist revolt jakes last week ruled out dubceks 
rehabilitation 
the first installment of the dubcek interview was shown on april 
17 
on wednesday czechoslovak media reported that pragues 
ambassador to hungary vlastimil ehrenberger formally protested 
the april 17 broadcast in which dubcek attacked former hungarian 
and polish leaders for not doing more to prevent the 1968 invasion 
dubcek spoke in slovak dubbed over in hungarian and translated 
into english by the associated press 
hungarian tv is widely received in southern slovakia home to 
about 700000 ethnic hungarians 
czechoslovakia was invaded by warsaw pact forces of the soviet 
union hungary poland bulgaria and east germany in august 1968 
wednesdays latenight broadcast also contained an interview 
with yugoslav dissident milovan djilas who was jailed in the 1950s 
and ousted from his senior communist party positions after 
challenging then yugoslav leader josip broz tito 
he spoke mostly on the ethnic tension in yugoslavia saying a 
system with competing political parties would not necessarily solve 
the conflicts and might even foster more nationalism

the federal communications commission on 
wednesday gave general telephone co of california permission to 
build a coaxial cable tv system and permission to test a 
stateoftheart fiberoptic system that will allow customers to 
order movies every 15 minutes by phone 
the ruling which was watched closely by cable tv operators who 
fear entry of huge telephone companies into their turf affirmed a 
preliminary decision last year to let general telephone build and 
operate the coaxial bundled copper wire cable system in the los 
angeles suburb of cerritos gte of california also provides phone 
service to cerritos 
the fcc said there had been no adequate bids submitted to the 
city of cerritos for cable service except from general telephone 
gte is leasing the system to apollo cablevision to provide 
programming 
a gte affiliate gte services corp will install a fiberoptic 
cable network to experiment with services such as nearvideo on 
demand which will allow customers to phone in orders for movies 
that will be running on 30 channels some movies will begin every 
15 minutes 
wednesdays decision was challenged immediately by the national 
cable television association which said it appears to violate 
federal rules generally barring telephone companies from the cable 
tv business 
current rules bar phone companies from generating cable 
programming in the same areas where they provide telephone service 
federal rules also bar the seven regional bell operating companies 
from owning cable services anywhere in the country but allow 
companies like gte to do so outside their service areas 
the fcc in july 1988 preliminarily voted to consider 
recommending to congress that telephone companies be allowed into 
cable tv in the regions they serve the fcc also suggested it would 
try to encourge telephone companies to enter cable tv even if 
congress fails to act by broadly defining good cause for 
waivers 
the fcc said it probably would grant waivers if telephone 
companies wire homes with fiber and allow competitors to use those 
wires to sell video programs too 
fcc chairman dennis patrick said wednesdays ruling did not 
presage any final fcc judgment on the cabletelephone company issue 
this grant of this very limited waiver may produce very 
valuable information that will be useful to the commssion and the 
congress in evaluating that more generic question he said the 
precedent that results is narrow

mikhail s gorbachevs purge of the communist 
partys hierarchy had been long expected but became more pressing 
with the partys poor electoral showing and his growing impatience 
with the pace of reform 
the central committee personnel changes he oversaw and his 
highly critical remarks at a committee meeting tuesday about poor 
management by leaders appeared to set the stage for even more 
radical reform in his program of perestroika or wholesale 
restructuring of the economy and society 
many senior party officials fared poorly in march 26 elections 
to the parliament the congress of peoples deputies when they 
faced opposition for the first time 
and when the congress meets may 25 party members may encounter 
true dissent for the first time in such a setting from the likes 
of human rights campaigner andrei d sakharov and historian roy a 
medvedev 
although the vast majority of the 2250 deputies are party 
members several such as ousted moscow party boss boris n 
yeltsin are outspoken mavericks 
in addition at least three dozen party chiefs from around the 
country including yuri solovyev a nonvoting member of the ruling 
politburo who is party boss in leningrad and the premiers of 
latvia and lithuania were defeated 
the presidents carefully orchestrated removal of 110 officials 
at the central committee meeting came exactly one month before the 
congress convenes to pick a smaller more powerful legislature 
it was not immediately clear whether any of the 110 ousted 
officials had run in the parliamentary elections but their 
departure allows gorbachev to put the partys house in order before 
the congress convenes and begins a new phase in political reform 
those purged included andrei a gromyko mikhail s solomentsev 
and other holdovers from the leonid i brezhnev era now denounced 
as the period of stagnation 
last summer at the partys first nationwide conference in 47 
years gromyko and solomentsev came under fire for conducting 
nowdiscredited brezhnev policies 
gromyko was retired as president and solomentsev lost his seat 
on the ruling politburo last fall in another shakeup 
the elections gave a clear signal to the party to move fast on 
perestroika 
the soviet people have pronounced themselves not just for 
perestroika but also for its further deepening for greater 
resolution in its implementation for a most rapid change for the 
better in all spheres of our life gorbachev said in a closing 
speech to the central committee 
all party bodies including the politburo he heads must realize 
that they did not keep pace with life said gorbachev also the 
partys general secretary 
after the meeting party ideology chief vadim a medvedev told a 
news conference that the party was reviewing election results to 
determine whether losing candidates should retain their posts 
last week leningrad party officials decided not to remove 
solovyev as their leader despite his embarrassing loss at the 
polls even without an opposing candidate 
gorbachev promoted younger more dynamic figures on the 
policymaking body trimming it to a more manageable size with a 
higher proportion of tested supporters the central committee 
which fell from 301 to 251 full members has not been so small 
since the days of nikita s khrushchev who ruled from 19531964 a 
western diplomat said 
among the new full members thought to be close to gorbachev are 
yevgeny p velikhov vice president of the academy of sciences and 
yevgeny m primakov director of the institute of world economics 
and international relations 
gorbachev said some officials had wanted to overhaul the central 
committee at last summers party conference but that action was 
postponed 
personal changes were required now he said because after the 
election the situation has changed considerably 
normally such changes would be made at a party congress but 
the next session isnt scheduled until 1991 and it appeared 
gorbachev couldnt wait that long to prune dead wood 
the senior officials offered gorbachev a tactful graceful way 
to remove them out without antagonizing their supporters in a 
letter they themselves offered to step aside 
this way they go with honor this would ensure they retain 
privileges of a pensioner the diplomat said on condition of 
anomymity

here are excerpts from soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs speech tuesday at the full meeting of the communist 
party central committee as translated and released wednesday by 
the tass news agency 
on recent elections to the new soviet parliament 
in this sense much food for thought has been offered by the past 
elections which became as we now say an effective referendum one 
in favor of perestroika restructuring the elections 
unequivocally said yes to perestroika 
on food shortages 
the food problem is far from solved it keeps us concerned and 
we dealt with all related issues at the last central committee 
plenum the housing problem is acute 
there is a dearth of consumer goods in the shops the list of 
shortages is growing the states financial position is grave 
people respond badly to shortages and to queues which take time 
and to put it frankly humiliate people people regard this 
situation as a gap between words and deeds as inconsistency 
between promises and real changes in life 
on nationalities 
further sharp issues have arisen from let us be blunt about it 
the longneglected need to perfect the soviet multinational 
federation and nationalist extremist and antisoviet elements are 
attempting to exploit this fact in a number of localities they are 
being joined in these attempts by people who are political failures 
or more frequently ordinary careerists 
on general discontent 
they people are displeased with the organization of the work 
of the trade and services sphere and city transport with the 
longneglected sanitary condition of the cities with the absence 
of resolute struggle against economic mismanagement violations of 
the rule of law with the ecological state of the cities and 
settlements with the attitude to cultural monuments 
on reaction to political reforms 
the fact is that some have already gone as far as saying that 
in a manner of speaking both democracy and openness are very 
nearly a disaster and the fact that the people have begun to act 
that they no longer wish to remain silent and insist on their 
claims is perceived as taking restructuring too far 
on causes of the economic crisis 
what happened of course there were things that could not be 
foreseen the chernobyl accident the decline of prices on the 
petroleum market and some other things but comrades this can 
hardly account for all that has taken place in the economy 
particularly on the consumer market 
military spending uncompleted construction managerial costs 
and expenditures on the realization of some hugescale projects and 
so on continued to grow 
the major economic principle the priority of the rise in labor 
productivity over the increase in wages and salaries was 
seriously undermined negative trends in this field go on gathering 
strength so far rather than fade out 
on economic mismanagement 
the outcome of mismanagement which repeated itself from year to 
year was that a whole system of parasitic elements developed 
the system which sows seeds of corruption economic and criminal 
offenses and antisocial morality around itself the system which 
defends the conditions of its parasitising and in many cases not 
without success 
people see all these ugliest facts of mismanagement and justly 
demand a strict punishment of the culprits not because of 
vengeance but to assert the realisation that it is inadmissible and 
impossible to throw the peoples resources to the winds 
i think comrades and this is opinion of the entire politburo 
that we can no longer put up with mismanagement which literally 
compromises perestroika and does a tremendous damage economic and 
moral to the whole of society 
on georgia 
the politburo gave instructions to painstakingly analyze 
everything that has happened there it is clear already now 
however that we must do everything using political methods and 
the force of the law in order to prevent a repetition of similar 
developments the deepening and broadening of the partys natural 
ties with the masses the working people their cohesion and unity 
are the guarantee of the success of societys renewal that has 
begun and of the success of restructuring 
on central committee members who were retired 
one generation of party members has naturally to replace 
another this process should be perceived as such its correct 
perception also presupposes the fact that each generation makes its 
contribution to the history of the country and the people and that 
a new stage in the development of our state our society and in 
achievement of new frontiers is connected with each generation

the birth of the second baby conceived in the 
united states by nonsurgical transfer of a fertilized egg into one 
of the mothers fallopian tubes was announced wednesday by a doctor 
in suburban fairfax va 
dr joseph d schulman director of the genetics amp ivf institute 
in fairfax said the 4pound 15ounce baby girl was born april 12 
by caesarian section 
although premature at 36 12 weeks the baby was pronounced 
healthy shortly after her birth dr schulman said 
another baby girl conceived through the same procedure was born 
april 9 by normal delivery at the university of california at 
irvine 
both babies were conceived by a process known as zygote 
intrafallopian transer or zift a zygote is fertilized egg 
this process and gamete intrafallopian transfer or gift are 
relatively new techniques that can be used when at least one of a 
womans fallopian tubes appears normal said a news release from 
the institute 
a gamete is a mature sex cell either sperm or egg 
in vitro fertilization has been accomplished by nonsurgical 
means for some time but the zift and gift procedures had until 
recently required placement of the zygotes or gametes into the 
fallopian tube by a surgical procedure the release said 
the babys parents who reside in the washington area were not 
identified the announcement said they were referred to dr 
schulman in may 1986 after failing to conceive as a result of more 
standard treatments 
the woman had three fertilized eggs placed nonsurgically in her 
right fallopian tube in august 1988 she was confirmed to be 
pregnant about 11 days later

the cargo door that blew off a united airlines 
boeing 747 in an accident that killed nine people went uninspected 
after major repairs violating a federal requirement a united 
executive testified wednesday 
robert doll a vice president for technical services told 
national transportation safety board investigators that the airline 
was unaware it had to inspect the locking mechanism after the dec 
23 repairs in chicago 
i cant explain why it was missed doll said in the second 
day of the hearing as investigators continued to press the airline 
for details on the maintenance and operation of the forward cargo 
door 
the door is a prime suspect in the accident in which nine 
passengers were hurled to their deaths feb 24 over the pacific 
ocean near hawaii the cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off 
united flight 811 at 23000 feet about 85 miles southwest of 
honolulu 
the plane was bound for sydney australia via auckland new 
zealand with 337 passengers and a crew of 18 
speculation has focused on a possible malfunction in the locking 
mechanism of the cargo door which remains on the bottom of the 
pacific ocean no decision has been made on whether to spend 
millions of dollars to retrieve the door 
the hearing is to gather information for the ntsb report which 
will be released months from now in washington dc 
during the highly technical testimony doll also admitted that 
some united ground crews had used power tools to operate cargo 
doors even though the boeing co has recommended against using such 
tools 
he said sworn documents from ground crews indicated power tools 
were not used on the cargo door of the illfated plane in the 
months prior to the accident 
dolls comments were made the same day united announced in 
chicago that it was ordering as much as 157 billion worth of new 
boeing jetliners 
since 1987 when a cargo door partially opened on a pan am 747 
flying out of london the faa has required that lock mechanisms of 
all 747s be visually inspected for signs of wear said united 
spokesman robert doughty 
the company inspected all 31 of its 747s and found no problems 
doughty said 
the rules also required that some older aluminum lock mechanisms 
be reinforced with steel he said united wanted to get a jump on 
the extensive reinforcing work on 21 of its older 747s and went 
ahead with it based on a preliminary document doughty said 
however the work had not been completed on the plane involved 
in the accident united officials have said 
united apparently did not see a later faa directive requiring 
new inspections of all cargo doors that had to be operated manually 
because of problems with the electrical closing systems doughty 
said 
the illfated plane had electrical closing system problems 
during flights over the pacific in december and the door was 
operated manually for more than a week before repairs were made in 
chicago the company said 
united failed to again inspect the locking mechanism and the 
plane made 130 successful flights before the accident occurred 
doughty said 
united officials discovered their error several weeks ago when 
they were going over paperwork to prepare for the ntsb hearing he 
said its really unclear what implication this had to the whole 
thing doughty said 
doll said the illfated plane did not have a history of unusual 
cargo door problems and that united recorded a total of 112 
problems with forward and aft cargo doors in its 747s between march 
1986 and february 1989 eight of those were on the illfated plane 
but other 747s reported more problems he said 
i would not call the cargo door a maintenance problem doll 
said 
doll also told investigators that the company had authorized use 
of some power tools with limited output because it found that it 
reduced damage to locking mechanisms during manual opening and 
closing of the cargo door 
boeing has recommended against such use

new yorks highest court waded into a 
dispute over what is a family wednesday as it heard a homosexual 
mans appeal to keep the rentcontrolled apartment he shared for a 
decade with his late lover 
the case being argued before the state court of appeals revolves 
around new york citys tight and pricy housing market and the 
question of whether people in nontraditional living arrangements 
homosexual couples and unmarried heterosexuals have the same 
protection as married couples and relatives 
when leslie blanchard died in 1986 his name was on the lease to 
the apartment he and miguel braschi shared on manhattans east side 
braschi says he deserves to keep the apartment with its 
governmentcontrolled rent because he and blanchard considered 
each other spouses their friends considered the apartment the home 
of any happily married couple according to court papers 
braschi 33 said the men exchanged bracelets in 1977 as a 
symbol of their commitment he now wears both blanchard was about 
10 years older than braschi 
blanchard who had hired braschi to run his successful manhattan 
beauty salon left his lover 5 million 
since blanchards death braschi has been fighting eviction the 
landlord stahl associates co maintains braschi wasnt a member 
of blanchards traditional family unit those related by 
blood marriage or adoption 
under new york citys rentcontrol law leases can pass from 
parent to child or spouse to spouse 
braschi has argued that as a family member he should have 
automatic rights to the apartment even though his name wasnt on 
the lease 
what were talking about is a family member william 
rubenstein an american civil liberties union lawyer representing 
braschi told new yorks top court what were asking for is no 
different from what any other family member would get 
but lawyers for the landlord said no provisions were in the rent 
control law to protect surviving gay life partners from 
eviction 
his braschis grievance is really with the law which 
prohibited him and mr blanchard from marrying dean yuzek 
stahls lawyer told the court 
if braschi were evicted stahl could raise the rent 
significantly for the apartment to fair market value 
braschi pays about 700 a month for the onebedroom apartment 
near the east river on east 54th street according to his lawyers 
actual market value in that section of manhattan could be hundreds 
of dollars higher 
braschis departure also would make it easier for the landlord 
to convert the building into more lucrative cooperatives 
were talking about the right to charge fair market rent for 
an apartment that is currently occupied by a person who has just 
inherited 5 million yuzek said after wednesdays court hearing 
if braschi is allowed to stay his rent increases would be 
restricted to 6 percent annually on a oneyear lease or 9 percent 
on a twoyear lease by the citys rentcontrol law 
stahls lawyers have accused braschi of trying to turn the case 
into a referendum on homosexual rights 
but aclu attorney nan hunter said the landlord wanted to create 
that impression to prejudice the atmosphere and that the case 
is simply about family rights 
new yorks lower courts have disagreed on the case a 
triallevel judge halted the eviction citing the time love and 
commitment given by braschi to blanchard but the judge was 
overturned on appeal 
braschi has been allowed to stay in the apartment while the case 
makes its way through the courts 
gay rights activists have called the case the most important in 
the nation dealing with nontraditional living arrangements 
the case is about individuals who live in families that vary 
from the ozzie and harriet mold said thomas stoddard executive 
director of the lambda legal defense fund a national gay rights 
organization 
stoddard said the court of appeals decision not expected 
until june could be applied to numerous other social areas where 
the term family is crucial such things as group health 
insurance hospital visitation and inheritances 
new yorks court of appeals ruled in 1984 that one member of a 
homosexual couple couldnt adopt the other to keep from being 
evicted from an apartment that only allowed family members to live 
together

away from land in an area without reefs and in water 600 feet deep 
with calm seas and mild winds coast guard andre billeaudeaux said

20 hours 
the singlehulled tanker was about nine miles off cape flattery

when a boiler tube failed about 830 am shutting down the 
propulsion system said joe tucker of exxon in valdez alaska the 
crew of 20 never was in danger tucker said

valdez ran aground march 24 near valdez dumping 112 million 
gallons of crude oil into prince william sound 
the philadelphia built in 1970 underwent a shipyard inspection 
one month ago tucker said

sunday for a nonexxon refinery in anacortes about 65 miles north 
of seattle said tucker and john ratterman of alyeska pipeline 
service co in anchorage

the soviet union and the united states 
traded charges of hypocrisy lies and bad faith wednesday in one of 
their most acrimonious public exchanges about afghanistan before 
the security council 
ambassador patricia byrne us representative to the council 
and soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov council president 
this month clashed over the issue of us and pakistani support to 
afghan rebels and soviet support to the kabul government 
each side accused the other of violating the unmediated 
geneva accords agreeing to noninterference in the affairs of 
afghanistan and pakistan the united states and the soviet union 
were coguarantors 
it is the height or depth of hypocrisy for the representative 
of the soviet union to claim that the regime in kabul and the 
ussr are fulfilling their obligations under the geneva accords 
and that the united states and pakistan have failed to do so 
ambassador byrne told the council 
belonogov responded as for the nonparliamentary response by 
the united states about lies and hypocrisy it seems to me that the 
world community has formed a very clear idea about who is 
hypocritical and who has been lying in this hall 
the council held its seventh meeting in more than two weeks to 
hear afghanistans complaint that pakistan is violating the 
agreements by arming and training afghan rebels sending their arms 
to afghanistan and deploying its own army intelligence services 
logistics units and militia to fight the afghan army 
pakistan denied the charges but ambassador s shah nawaz in a 
scathing speech would not say from where the arms came or how they 
were transported to afghanistan 
the united states is known to supply the rebels with stinger and 
blowpipe missiles and other arms the soviet union supplies the 
kabul government with scud missiles and other sophisticated weapons 
the meeting was adjourned without a date being set for another 
meeting no vote or statement was expected 
pakistan which openly aides the moslem antigovernment rebels 
says it is not directly involved in the conflict afghanistan and 
the soviet union have cited numerous alleged instances of pakistan 
sending armed men and weapons into afghanistan 
the afghan rebels were not party to the geneva accords and have 
rejected it the soviet union has called on the united states to 
agree to a joint cutoff in aid to their respective sides but 
washington has refused 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in 1979 to help the marxist 
government battle the moslem rebels more than 100000 soviet 
soldiers were in the country before the withdrawal began in may 
1988 the last soldiers left in february 
earlier pakistan responding to an afghan threat warned the 
security council it would retaliate against any afghan aggression 
and accused the soviet union and kabul of turning afghanistan into 
a new killing fields 
us ambassador herbert s okun the acting permanent un 
representative told the council the kabul regime is desperately 
clinging to power by force of arms through extensive and ongoing 
imports of foreign soviet arms against the will of the vast 
majority of its people 
he said the current debate has not furthered either the cause of 
peace or the selfdetermination of the afghan people 
it is ridiculous to expect the afghan people to accept as 
their freely chosen leader a former secret police chief najib who 
was installed by a foreign power okun said 
the kabul regime even with outside help will inevitably fail 
pakistan is not and never has been the aggressor

vice president dan quayle on thursday 
challenged the soviet union to move from rhetoric to reality by 
taking concrete steps to lessen military tensions in the pacific 
quayle in his first major address since arriving here less than 
24 hours ago said communism has failed and the worlds democracies 
must capitalize on this triumph 
we should because we are strong and prudent continue to ask 
hard questions such as when are the soviets going to move their 
troops out of the northern territories of japan quayle said in 
remarks prepared for delivery to the national press club 
when are the soviets going to stop providing more modern arms 
to north korea and when will the soviets actually decrease rather 
than increase their military aid to hanoi to promote peace in 
southeast asia quayle said 
quayles first trip to the pacific comes against a backdrop of 
the upcoming sinosoviet summit next month soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev travels to china for the first summit between the two 
countries in 20 years 
but quayle said we must challenge the soviets to move from 
rhetoric to reality from pledges about tension reduction to real 
tensionreducing measures 
on thursday quayle met with australian defense minister kim 
beazley and australias foreign affairs minister gareth evans 
earlier the vice president held a 90minute session with prime 
minister bob hawke at which the two discussed economic and defense 
issues and the common strains with new zealand 
in his speech quayle said any minor economic frictions should 
not be allowed to harm the strong alliance that has developed 
between the united states and australia 
the two discussed new zealands threat to withdraw from the 
anzus council as well as economic issues according to us and 
australian officials who briefed reporters but refused to be quoted 
by name 
quayles visit timed to coincide with australianamerican 
friendship week comes at a time when the relationship between the 
allies is in excellent shape the australian official said he 
categorized the discussions as very friendly indeed and said 
the two might try to hold additional talks before quayle leaves the 
city on thursday 
of concern to the leaders however was the threat by new 
zealand prime minister david lange to withdraw from the 
australiannew zealandus defense alliance known as anzus lange 
made his comments in the united states earlier this week 
new zealand has been excluded from the anzus council since lange 
announced in 1984 that his government would not allow nuclear ships 
to visit new zealand ports however that country has not formally 
withdrawn from the ministerial council 
quayle raised the issue of new zealand in an attempt to gauge 
the seriousness of new zealands threat but hawke was unable to 
tell him whether langes speech amounted to a fundamental shift in 
new zealand policy the us and australian officials said 
hawke also talked about initiatives for greater pacific regional 
cooperation on economic matters ones that quayle said the united 
states supported the officials said 
the vice president also told hawke that the us decision to 
subsidize grain exports was not designed to hurt australia the 
australians have complained that such subsidies hurt their wheat 
exports

military and federal police 
dragged about 50 eskimos from a runway at an air base wednesday to 
break up a protest against lowlevel nato flights a military 
spokesman said 
for the past seven months the eskimos have mounted a series of 
such protests at the goose bay air base which they say is built on 
their ancestral hunting grounds 
the innu eskimos got onto the base wednesday by cutting through 
a gate said lt col robert jodoin a canadian forces spokesman 
he said the men women and children then fanned out across a 
runway yelling we dont want nato 
they were herded into military buses and police cars the chief 
of the local innu daniel ashini was among those rounded up a 
spokesman for the protesters said on condition of anonymity 
the royal canadian mounted police could not say afterward how 
many demostrators were kept in custody 
those arrested will be charged under military regulations with 
trespassing jodoin said 
the demonstration followed last weeks acquittal by a provincial 
court of four eskimos who were charged with public mischief for 
protesting last fall at the base on this canadian island province 
in the atlantic ocean 
in his landmark ruling judge james igloliorte cleared the four 
on the basis that they honestly believe the ground where the base 
is located belongs to the eskimos 
the eskimos say the lowlevel flights are turning their 
ancestral hunting grounds into a war zone the north atlantic 
treaty organization flights are made by canada west germany 
britain and the netherlands 
the military says the eskimos are using the protests to pressure 
the government in longstanding territorial disputes

three senior members of the senate irancontra 
investigating committee asked wednesday for an congressional 
intelligence committee probe into why the panel did not receive 
crucial reagan administration documents that have come out at the 
trial of oliver north 
an initial review by senate staff members found that four 
documents introduced as evidence in norths trial never were turned 
over to congressional investigators in 1987 when they looked into 
the administrations iran arms deal and contra support initiatives 
two other documents in the committees files are similar to ones 
released at the trial but are missing important attachments or 
notations 
one document an april 25 1985 memo from thennational 
security adviser robert mcfarlane recommends that reagan telephone 
honduran president roberto suazo to reassure him of us backing 
for the contras missing from the congressional copy is the 
notation cc vice president apparently signaling that george 
bush was sent a copy of the memo 
these six documents are sufficient to raise questions about 
the procedures followed by the executive branch in providing 
documents to the irancontra committee and the completeness of its 
compliance with agreements on the provision of documents said a 
letter asking for the investigation 
the request was sent to sens david boren dokla and william 
cohen rmaine chairman and vice chairman of the senate 
intelligence committee and was signed by senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine and sens daniel inouye dhawaii and 
warren rudman rnh the chairman and vice chairman of the 
irancontra panel 
president bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters 
aboard air force one on wednesday we will cooperate in any way 
we can but otherwise we dont know much about it 
this doesnt involve us directly fitzwater said this is 
between the senators and the intelligence committee theyre 
looking into the last administrations procedures and it doesnt 
relate to us its an internal matter for the senate to look into 
white house counsel c boyden gray in a letter to mitchell 
said his office had contacted arthur b culvahouse jr who was 
reagans counsel during much of the time at issue and that 
culvahouse has offered to review the matter and informally brief 
the senators 
we have confidence that the last administration followed the 
agreed procedures for releasing the material and that its 
representatives will be able to address your concerns grays 
letter said we of course endeavor to be as helpful as we 
can 
boren in a statement promised to look at this matter 
expeditiously and in a businesslike nonpolitical manner 
the letter said some of the documents contain key evidence about 
the way us officials conducted policy in central america in 1985 
and raise questions regarding possible efforts to circumvent 
the provisions of the law which barred direct or indirect us 
aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
a similar request was made two weeks ago by rep lee hamilton 
dind who was chairman of the house irancontra committee an 
aide to hamilton said wednesday that he had not yet received a 
response to his request of white house counsel c boyden gray 
the congressional committees after an extensive investigation 
concluded that a cabal of zealots in the reagan 
administration seized control of policy in the affair which sent 
weapons to iran and profits from the sales to the nicaraguan rebels 
but documents and testimony during the north trial suggest that 
senior officials up to and including reagan and thenvice president 
george bush were more involved in the affair than the committees 
knew 
among documents which the congressional panels did not receive 
were a feb 19 1985 memo outlining a plan to step up us aid to 
honduras in return for that nations support of the contras and a 
memo dated the following day making it clear that the 
administration knew it was forbidden from providing aid under those 
circumstances 
also not turned over to congressional investigators was an oct 
30 1985 memo from north to mcfarlane about reconnaissance of 
nicaragua and mentioning the air drop of two recoilless rifles to 
the rebels 
mark belnick a new york attorney who was on the staff of the 
senate panel said the documents clearly should have been sent in 
response to congressional requests and would have been helpful in 
the investigation but he added if this is the sum and 
substance they wouldnt have materially changed any of the 
conclusions reached by investigators

let me have another child i think i should have the right to 
choose

us victoria lambert said in atlanta where about 800 
prochoice demonstrators marched at the georgia capitol 
the st louis clinic initiated the case of webster vs

education there is an awareness an edge today that i havent

stomachaches and stress are plaguing many 
alaska natives who live off the sea and have lost their traditional 
diet of fish and seal meat because of the exxon oil spill 
native people warned about contamination in prince william 
sound have had to turn to beef chicken and canned luncheon meat 
for protein 
it takes the body a while to adapt to eating that stuff 
gary kompkoff president of the village council in tatitlek said 
wednesday there are a lot of problems with it a lot of diarrhea 
and stomachaches 
tatitlek is 28 miles from valdez and eight miles from where the 
tanker exxon valdez ran aground march 24 
meantime a break in the weather sent crews back to cleaning up 
the oil on alaskas coastline and the governor urged congress to 
buy back oil leases in a rich fishing bay a federal judge also 
consolidated 27 civil cases already filed against exxon corp 
owner of the tanker that ran aground and caused the nations worst 
oil spill 
gov steve cowper noting the oil spills effects in prince 
william sound said that such an enviromental disaster in bristol 
bay which oil companies have paid the federal government 1147 
million for the right to explore is unthinkable 
it is time to cancel the sale and refund the bid money he 
said 
skimmers were deployed across the gulf of alaska coastline and 
around the southern tip of kenai peninsula to homer the giant 
soviet skimmer was deployed near seward 
exxon which is responsible for the estimated 112 million 
gallon oil spill has begun sending food shipments to tatitlek 
chenega bay port graham and english bay 
the alaska division of subsistence is working on ways to help 
people in those villages resume their traditional diets as oil from 
the nations worst spill continues to pollute sections of the south 
central alaska coast 
slackening weather enabled some crews to resume cleanup in the 
sound and the navy transport uss juneau left valdez with 200 
workers who will scrub oil off hardhit beaches on smith and 
eleanor islands 
however the disposal of 14000 pounds of waste accumulated in 
the cleanup still hasnt been resolved and the state is concerned 
the dispute points to more problems with an oil consortiums plans 
to clean future oil spills 
the state department of envirnomental conservation wants the 
waste burned at the consortiums incinerator in valdez 
however alyeska pipeline service co says its incinerator has 
been working around the clock and its facilities cant hold any 
more broken booms and oily absorbent pads 
it seems like alyeska doesnt want to be readily involved in 
this said jeff mach of the environmental agency 
this continues to be a matter of commitments that were made 
with regards to how the transalaska pipleine system was to be 
operated mach said 
the spill has disrupted normal operations all over the sound 
one possible exception is the salmon hatcheries which are 
releasing millions of fry this week as plankton a food source for 
the young fish reaches its peak bloom 
jack lamb vice president of the fishermens union cordova 
district fishermen united said salmon will be caught and tested 
for oil contamination before the scheduled may 15 opening of the 
copper river salmon harvest 
for the natives in tatitlek the spill has affected more than 
their diet 
it has cast their way of life into turmoil as seasonal routines 
associated with gathering and preserving food are thrown off 
council president kompkoff said 
weve been set in our ways for so many years theres a lot of 
stress a lot of worry about what the future holds for us he 
said 
robert wolfe research director for the state division of 
subsistence said this is a critical time for harvests 
this is the time of year when major food resources arrive and 
are put up for the year he said 
harvests of herring and herring roe already have been missed 
because of the spill and collection of shellfish such as clams 
also has been disrupted he said 
there are concerns the salmon harvest that begins in midmay and 
provides about onethird of the subsistence food supply will be 
affected as well 
no residents here have been able to harvest anything 
kompkoff said many of their boats have been hired by exxon to help 
with the cleanup 
an exxon contractor has sent two shipments of food to tatitlek 
and one each to chenega bay english bay and port graham since 
distributions began may 14 said judy meidinger rural affairs 
specialist for the oil company 
fish has been requested and likely will be provided in future 
shipments she said 
some people are uncomfortable with the idea of food being sent 
in kompkoff said 
we get this oil spill and exxon thinks it can replace our 
subsistence resources by sending food he said they cant 
meidinger said exxons program is intended to help people 
through difficult times while work to deal with effects of the oil 
spill is under way 
i think thats appropriate she said

rightwing military president augusto 
pinochet asked for the resignation of all 15 of his cabinet members 
wednesday to allow changes in some posts a government spokesman 
said 
the measure coincided with local media reports that gen 
pinochet had disagreements with his interior minister carlos 
caceres over proposed democratic reforms 
no official explanation was given for the shakeup however the 
government declined to say what portfolios would be changed 
it is customary in chile for all cabinet ministers to hand in 
letters of resignation even when only one or two changes are 
planned 
the government spokesman army gen jaime garcia told 
journalists at the government palace that the resignations were 
requested at a 70minute meeting of pinochet and his full cabinet 
late in the day 
he expressed his intention of making changes in the current 
cabinet garcia said he said pinochet is evaluating the 
current political situation and asked all government ministers to 
hand in their resignations so the president would have freedom of 
action 
garcia did not say when the changes would be announced there 
is no date yet for swearing in the new cabinet garcia said 
according to some local news reports pinochet and caceres have 
differed over proposed amendments to the countrys 1980 
constitution and other legal reforms 
according to the reports caceres wants to allow several 
democratic reforms sought by opposition political groups before 
scheduled dec 14 national elections to pick a successor to 
pinochet and a congress pinochet has said he will remain army 
commander after the elections 
pinochet who seized power in a violent 1973 coup was forced to 
call the elections when he lost a yesorno referendum last october 
on a proposal to extend his rule to 1997

players drove flew took the train and 
walked to the nearest pennsylvania lottery ticket counter up to the 
last minute wednesday before the winning north american record 
jackpot of more than 100 million was drawn 
the official winning numbers were 06 16 24 34 35 37 40 
41 45 60 71 a winning ticket must have seven of the 11 numbers 
drawn 
james scroggins the lotterys executive director said the 
prize would be something higher than 100 million when its all 
said and done 
how much higher wont be known until sometime thursday but 
unofficial estimates have put the jackpot at more than 110 million 
thursday also is the earliest it will will be known whether 
there is a jackpot winner said lottery spokesman george anderson 
and it wont be until friday when the number of winners if any is 
known officials have said 
we are now running the computer to go through all 87 million 
transactions in an attempt to identify if there are any winners 
anderson said referring to the 873 million worth of tickets sold 
since last thursday 
the huge jackpot set off a lottery mania players took planes 
and trains from around the country to join in the buying frenzy 
being frivolous it was worth it being conservative i 
couldve found better things to do with my money said irene 
tasca of philadelphia no one at work concentrated on work for 
the past two days 
at the pennohio drug store in sharon night supervisor debbie 
trinckes of hubbard ohio said there were 75 to 100 people in 
line trying to buy tickets when the machine closed for the drawing 
we kept going out and telling them they werent going to make 
it she said some left but some stayed most were from 
outoftown 
in an average week the state usually sells about 4 million or 5 
million tickets but on tuesday alone about 24 million tickets were 
sold said karl ross deputy revenue secretary from 6 am to 11 
am wednesday about 7 million tickets were sold players came 
from all over the country 
but lottery officials considered the nightmarish possibility 
that no one would win wednesday nights super 7 drawing 
the odds of any one ticket bearing seven winning numbers is one 
in 96 million with more than 74 million tickets sold in the last 
week and the jackpot rolled over because of no winner in six 
previous drawings ross said the odds are about 4000to1 against 
another rollover 
although a winner or winners could come forward lottery 
officials said that because of the high volume of sales they 
wouldnt know for certain until sometime friday if a winning ticket 
had been sold or how many had been sold they said the computer 
would give them a preliminary indication thursday afternoon but 
that it would take another day to complete backup reviews of ticket 
numbers 
if there is a rollover next weeks jackpot could approach 200 
million payable over 26 years and some lottery agents would run 
out of tickets 
we couldnt handle another week like this selling all these 
tickets without having spot shortages ross said in a telephone 
interview as a precaution he said the lottery was lining up 
vendors to do emergency printing runs if necessary 
were in a brave new world uncharted waters ross said if 
a rollover occurred and the jackpot soared beyond 150 million he 
added i think the atmosphere would be even weirder 
at least one vendor also hoped against another rollover 
ive already told my customers not to come in if there isnt a 
winner tonight said theresa donavich owner of theresas cards 
and news in burgettstown near the pennsylvaniawest virginiaohio 
border 
im locking the doors and im leaving town until after next 
thursday she joked vendors receive 5 cents for each 1 ticket 
they sell 
she said a constable and police officer were posted in the 
store in part to alleviate her fear of being robbed because of 
extra money from ticket sales 
ive been terrified to stay in my own home for fear of 
somebody breaking in and demanding money even though i dont keep 
it there 
but if state officials and vendors were wearing out players 
werent lines of a dozen people or more were reported at most 
establishments and ticket sales were still brisk 
the volume prompted the state to press into service about 100 
spare machines that are usually kept in reserve 
at rainbow entertainment in a shopping mall near the capitol 
only about six people waited in line including paulita vidot a 
harrisburg housewife who planned to buy one ticket she laughed 
guiltily when her husband spied her in line explaining this is 
my first time usually i give him a hard time for playing i 
just wanted to say i participated 
also in line was kathy bohensky a federal clerk who said she 
didnt believe in lotteries but was buying five tickets 
i dont feel one person should get 100 million she said 
these are for my grandfather hes hooked id like to see him 
win hes very very sick the jackpot could go towards his 
medical expenses 
even linda despot and donald woomer winners of the previous 
pennsylvania record jackpot of 46 million bought a piece of the 
action 
woomer of hollidaysburg said he bought 100 worth of tickets 
but mostly for fun and not really in hope of winning 
nobody would want to play anymore if we won again he said 
with a laugh

a soviet diplomat arrived here 
wednesday to discuss a troubled peace plan for namibia in what was 
the first official visit to south africa approved by moscow in 33 
years 
the soviet union broke relations with south africa in 1956 over 
its racial policies since then the two countries have had direct 
dealings only in a few international agencies and in cartels 
dealing with diamonds and gold 
security men taped a small cardboard soviet flag to the 
windshield of a limousine that carried soviet official vyacheslav 
ustinov away from df malan airport after he was greeted by neil 
van heerden directorgeneral of the south africa foreign affairs 
department 
he arrived on the same plane carrying the us delegation to the 
talks which also involve cuba angola and south africa the 
discussions are part of regularly scheduled meetings of the joint 
monitoring commission set up to monitor an agreement that provided 
for withdrawal of cuban and south african troops from angola and 
independence for the south africancontrolled territory of namibia 
the plan was disrupted on april 1 when hundreds of southwest 
africa peoples organization guerrillas crossed the border from 
angola into northern namibia instead of waiting to return in 
midmay unarmed as outlined in the agreement 
more than 300 men have been killed in the fighting and south 
african officials have said that un resolution 435 the 
independence plan for namibia might be in jeopardy if the swapo 
guerrillas do not leave the territory 
south africa has said its forces will be confined to their bases 
in northern namibia from wednesday evening through saturday morning 
to give the swapo guerrillas a chance to return to angola 
unhindered 
ustinov making his first trip to south africa ruled out the 
possibility of any talks with the south africans except on the 
subject of namibia and angola 
if you mean bilateral talks in the sense of having some 
political or other relations i have no intention of this at the 
present time he told a news conference 
the us delegation was led by chas w freeman jr acting us 
assistant secretary of state for african affairs

a man who officials say used bogus 
resumes and references to land government jobs across the country 
was ordered wednesday to serve 90 days in jail and pay 18000 in 
restitution to an alaska village 
carl keyser jr 34 was sentenced on a firstdegree theft 
charge stemming from his brief tenure as kake city administrator 
last year he pleaded no contest to the felony charge which 
alleged he took 28000 in salary benefits and expenses before he 
was fired in december 
superior court judge thomas schultz placed keyser on probation 
for seven years ordered him not to accept any government job 
during that time and gave him credit for 60 days of jail time 
already served 
schultz rejected keysers request to be freed without additional 
jail time and ordered him to write lettrs of apology to the towns 
of kake and pikeville ky as well as serve the final 30 days of 
the sentence 
this is pretty reprehensible conduct the judge said of 
keysers employment record 
district attorney mark ells said he will dismiss a 
theftbydeception charge filed against keyser by officials in 
pikeville where keyser was employed briefly as city manager in 
august keyser sent the city 707 in restitution tuesday and the 
pikeville prosecutor asked to drop the charge ells said 
the pikeville restitution represented expense money keyser was 
paid before he resigned amid allegations he faked his resume 
what i did here was wrong said keyser who is married and 
has four daughters i lied on my resume because i needed a job to 
feed my family and instead of doing it the right way i took 
too many shortcuts 
keyser said he would move once he finished serving his time in 
jail but was unsure where his lawyer mary treiber said keyser 
was considering a move to seattle 
schultz said keyser could move out of petersburg where he has 
been unable to find a job since posting bail but the judge 
expressed concern that keyser would try to get a government job 
again and ordered him to check monthly with his probation officer 
in alaska 
im not sure that mr keyser is going to be able to make the 
kind of money honestly that he made lying the judge said 
schultz did not order keyser to pay the 28000 in restitution 
the state requested saying kake did get some value from his work 
residents of kake a small fishing and timber town on the 
northern tip of kupreanof island in southeast alaska became 
suspicious of keyser shortly after he arrived to take the 
44000ayear administrators job 
he bought a luxurious 66000 double mobile home rifles and 
1000 rounds of ammunition with city money and refused to release 
his resume for public inspection 
a check of police records revealed the outstanding kentucky 
warrant in december and he was arrested 
interviews with prosecutors and city officials in several states 
revealed that at least 19 of keysers jobs since 1980 were with 
city or county governments records and the interviews showed 
keyser used false information to obtain at least 11 of the jobs 
law enforcement officials said keyser apparently earned a living 
by cashing as many salary and expense checks as he could before his 
bosses became suspicious and he either quit or was fired 
wednesdays sentence was the second time keyser has been 
convicted of a charge stemming from his false resumes 
keyser a native of huntington wva was placed on a years 
probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor perjury charge in 
oak hill fla the charge alleged he used false information to get 
hired as oak hill police chief he was fired after four months when 
the discrepancies in his resume were reported in the news media 
other states in which keyser allegedly applied or obtained jobs 
under false pretenses include idaho oregon south carolina texas 
west virginia and wyoming

exxon corp for oil spill damage to alaskas natural resources 
according to guidelines that already are under court challenge for 
allegedly being too easy on polluters 
the decision comes despite administration promises to seek 
complete restoration of losses from the exxon valdez tanker 
spill that has fouled alaskas wildliferich prince william sound 
interior department officials acknowledged in interviews tuesday 
that the government has agreed to use guidelines giving polluters 
the option of paying only the market value of resources they 
destroy rather than the cost of replacing them 
under the rules for example a seabird with little potential 
for commercial exploitation might be declared to be worth just a 
few dollars

the miniseries comes to mister rogers 
neighborhood next week and the shows cardiganclad creator 
promises a message as gentle and reassuring as ever 
the threepart musical titled josephine the shortneck 
giraffe tells the story of a young giraffe who yearns for a 
long graceful neck like all the other giraffes she eventually 
grows fred rogers confided not on the outside but on the 
important side 
its very much like the usual message of the neighborhood 
that you can be acceptable as you are he said smiling its 
not so much the outsides of us that are important 
a song sung by josephine and her friend hazel the elephant sums 
it up best according to rogers 
youre much more than a neck josephine and youre much more 
than a trunk hazel a chickens more than a peck and theres more 
than a smell to a skunk rogers quietly sang during an interview 
at pittsburghs wqedtv home to his childrens programs for the 
past 35 years 
the special week of new programs gets under way monday on public 
broadcasting service stations with a trip to the san diego wild 
animal park where viewers are introduced to reallife giraffes and 
elephants on tuesday rogers visits a film processing lab to have 
his animal photographs developed 
the miniseries which features a cast of 15 elaborate animal 
costumes and five sets runs wednesday through friday rogers 
gently guides his young audience from one day to the next 
summarizing the main events and hinting at what might lie ahead for 
josephine 
in the neighborhood of makebelieve where animals sing dance 
and play the trombone josephine is befriended by jr a shy 
giraffe who overcomes his problems by helping josephine conquer 
hers he accomplishes that with help from hazel the elephant who 
advises him to just let your heart speak 
there isnt a time that i see the scene in which jr talks 
and sings with josephine that i havent gotten chills up my 
spine rogers said tapping his right hand against his back 
and this is something ive worked with for years theres 
something so redemptive about someone who is trying so hard to help 
somebody else 
rogers 61 wrote josephine the shortneck giraffe for a 
french class assignment at floridas rollins college in 1950 he 
named jr the giraffe after fraternity brother john reardon who 
went on to sing with the metropolitan opera and was a frequent 
guest on mister rogers neighborhood reardon died a year ago 
and the miniseries is dedicated to him 
rogers set the story to music in the late 1950s and about 1000 
records were pressed writer barry head transformed josephine the 
shortneck giraffe into a poem for children in 1975 
for years rogers tried to have the musical produced on stage or 
as an animated film 
i still think it would be great for animation and a stage 
production he said but i thought unless we get it out on the 
air i dont think anybodys going to know about it 
the story rogers wrote 39 years ago is vastly different from the 
musical airing next week it is the neighborhoods 13th musical 
at the end of the original story when people are telling 
josephine that they like her just the way she is she raises her 
head to look at them because she hasnt really heard this message 
before and her neck starts to grow and it grows and grows and 
grows until her neck is as tall as everybody elses rogers said 
in the musical josephines neck remains short 
i think it shows how much weve grown rogers said you 
know you dont have to look like everybody else to be acceptable 
and to feel acceptable and wishes dont always come true 
because for a year and a day ive been wishing she sang that 
was one of her first songs her wish was for a longer neck she 
thought but really her wish was to have people like her exactly as 
she is so often what we say were wishing for isnt necessarily 
what is behind the wish this is very philosophical 
will preschoolers be able to grasp such a serious message even 
in such a lighthearted setting 
maybe not in words but let their hearts speak to them the way 
hazel said to jr just let your heart speak rogers said i 
think that thats the way an awful lot of communication takes 
place

corporate america rarely admits that its 
business decisions are swayed by demands of religious idealists 
but the churches keep trying and see evidence of results 
the effects often arent immediate and defeats are numerous 
but ministers priests and nuns stick to prodding the stockholder 
meetings and eventually company changes come by degrees 
its a cumulative impact said timothy smith executive 
director of the interfaith center on corporate responsibillity 
the churches also have become more sophisticated about it and are 
working with a broader network theyre having a more powerful 
influence on companies 
the religious persistence has loosed a stream of 166 
churchsponsored shareholder resolutions into scheduled meetings 
this year of 124 corporations pressing for various actions some 
of the requests are expected to be settled in advance through 
negotiation without coming up for a vote indicating the 
consideration given church proposals 
from a fourth to a third of the resolutions are withdrawn in 
negotiations through a meeting of minds smith said it has 
become standard wisdom for companies to be open to these talks 
altogether the 22 protestant denominations and agencies and 220 
roman catholic orders and dioceses working to influence corporate 
polices hold stock worth a total of 25 billion 
the religious community is challenging corporations to raise 
their standards and make accountability to society and community a 
part of their success formula smith said 
when the movement first began 18 years ago churches could 
seldom garner the 3 percent of the votes needed to keep an issue on 
the ballot for the next meeting but now they regularly win 10 
percent to 25 percent 
thats of pretty strong significance and cant just be 
ignored smith said 
the church clout has been strengthened by combining on many 
issues with various other institutional shareholders public and 
private bringing the total shareholder leverage to more than 260 
billion 
reflecting results of the efforts a total of 117 us companies 
in the last five years have sold their holdings in south africa 
repeatedly targeted by church resolutions because of its system of 
racial separation 
that still was a prime concern this year with 100 companies 
asked to end business ties with that country such as extended bank 
loans and trade or franchise arrangements even though many of the 
companies have quit direct operations there 
the business climate is changing in regard to south africa 
and companies are seeing its best to disengage said diane 
bratcher communications director of the interfaith coalition 
were no longer just little shareholder resolutions but 
selective buying and other profit forces are at work 
the center a unit of the national council of churches is 
coordinating resolutions on numerous other matters including 
asking 17 companies to halt nuclear weapons production and begin 
converting to peaceful alternatives 
us security is served more effectively through jobs and 
trade competitiveness and that is where expertise should be 
applied said sister valerie heinonen the centers program 
director on arms issues 
protestant and roman catholic shareholders also are asking 11 
companies for affirmative action on behalf of women and racial 
minority employes 
dara demmings director of the centers equality program said 
companies have become more open to suggestions from religious 
affiliated investors about their affirmativeaction programs 
religious investors also are questioning 21 us companies about 
equal employment practices in plants in northern ireland asking 
for stepped up efforts against religious discrimination blamed in 
the strife there 
smith a united methodist said that while many companies are 
reluctant to admit it theyre paying a great deal more attention 
to resolutions coming from the churches than before 
he said one corporate official described the churches concerns 
as an early social warning system pointing to problematical 
situations needing to be treated before they become severe

in backtoback appraisals vice president dan 
quayle and president bush issued their own report cards on their 
first 100 days not surprisingly the marks were excellent 
bush said his administration is off to a good start in 
confronting problems that demand urgent attention and decisive 
action and in setting a steady course for longterm progress 
quayle said the united states is disproving the socalled 
declininsts who see signs of national retreat the vice 
president said his message on a 12day mission to the pacific is 
one of optimism with alliances flourishing trade booming us 
political and economic principles ascendant 
there are other grading systems of course 
not all of them are quite so enthusiastic about the first 
semester of the new administration 
for example while bush boasted of a bipartisan budget agreement 
that kept my no new taxes pledge intact the deal does not 
deliver the decisive deficit curbs he also promised during the 1988 
campaign indeed some critics have called the deal a sham that 
simply puts off the day of budget reckoning until next year bush 
said it was a strong first step 
quayle then bush addressed members of the associated press in 
chicago on monday two hours apart the vice presidents speech 
was in his phrase a pretrip briefing on his trip to 
australia indonesia singapore and thailand that turned out to 
fit one of his 100day observations quayle said his biggest 
surprise was how much he enjoys foreign travel the bush script was 
an assessment of the first 100 days 
his staff also turned out a 17page background summary on 
accomplishments but skipped setbacks like senate rejection of john 
towers nomination to be secretary of defense 
the vice president answered questions from ap member publishers 
and said he senses a change in the way he is viewed and covered 
after a season of constant criticism 
now in the position of approaching the 100 days i think the 
people of america are going to judge me on my job performance and 
thats the way it should be he said and i believe thats the 
way the news media is and will continue to cover me as the vice 
president of the united states and i believe thats fair 
quayles account of what he has learned about that job and 
about himself since the inauguration sounded as though hed been 
taking a refresher course in political science 
i think what i have learned most about the job is what the 
true responsibilities of the office of vice president are and what 
the responsibilities of the office of president are he said i 
work every day in close contact with president bush and i see how 
he formulates his policies im there to give my opinions i see 
the inner workings of the office of the president so i have a much 
keener appreciation from a practical daytoday operation how the 
two offices work 
that plus a keener appreciation of traveling abroad on air force 
2 
quayle said that as a senator most of his travel was back and 
forth to indiana except for a couple trips to europe he said hes 
been surprised at how much i am enjoying myself in foreign policy 
travel to latin america and now to southeast asia he said his 
foreign missions have had a very positive impact 
the bush appraisal was a summary of proposals and plans 
designed to counter complaints that his administration has drifted 
without a clear agenda i think the work weve done these past 
three months demonstrates the value of tough principled 
negotiations between this administration and congress the 
president said 
he cited the budget agreement a deal for nonmilitary aid to 
the contras the savings and loan reform and bailout bill that has 
passed the senate his ethics reform bill the drive against drugs 
his education and child care proposals 
bush said thorough reviews of foreign and defense policy issues 
will be completed late in may pointing to strategies for a time of 
remarkable change in international affairs 
the president said theres a running debate now on what it takes 
to move the nation forward he said it takes principle 
performance ideology action and this administration 
understands that the american people expect all of these and 
something more 
they expect results 
results will be the final exam on each of issue those are the 
grades that really will count

the rules of the border rarely change 
despite the not welcome signs central american refugees 
keep coming despite the immigration services recent crackdown and 
new detention camps they stream by the thousand to the united 
states 
and despite criminal convictions waning interest around the 
country and little money southside presbyterian church home and 
heart of the sanctuary movement is still welcoming and 
transporting refugees who want to make america home 
this scraggly pale blue barrio church spawned an international 
underground railroad seven years ago by declaring itself a 
sanctuary for illegal aliens now southside is making another 
statement 
the church plans to break ground this summer on an addition that 
will double its size and for the first time provide bedrooms for 
aliens who have slept on the chapels floor over the past seven 
years 
the addition is a sign of the movements uneasy truce with 
federal authorities its survival despite eight members felony 
convictions and its struggle to cope with the recent wave of new 
business 
its a recognition that were in it for the long haul that 
were going through a transition from emergency assistance to 
institutionalizing this thing said southsides lanky 
bluejeaned minister john fife the sanctuary movements founder 
were still doing sanctuary and were doing so quite 
publicly 
fife who is currently free on five years probation and others 
here have continued to sneak refugees across the usmexico border 
about once a week sheltering immigrants in southside every night 
and helping move them along to other us cities or canada 
in the last six months church workers aiding aliens say they 
have seen a new wave of central americans heading north to escape 
war and economic troubles 
the new flood of aliens and a resulting border crackdown in 
south texas by the us immigration and naturalization service may 
well mean revival of the sanctuary movement which federal 
authorities have declared dead fife and others said 
in the last six months weve sent more individuals into 
sanctuary congregations than the previous two years combined 
fife said 
its really picked up since the first of the year agreed 
the rev gustau shultz head of the national sanctuary defense fund 
in tucson the sanctuary movement has chosen to ward off the ins 
by staying out in the open federal officials are notified of all 
actions even plans to construct a new building when there are 
mailings or notices the ins is sent a copy 
what we do on the border has become routine almost 
bureaucratic said jim corbett a quaker who helped found the 
movement with fife and who was one of three acquitted in the tucson 
trial sanctuary workers send letters informing the ins of each 
border crossing 
volunteers now fear stumbling into drug smugglers on the border 
more than border patrol agents 
indeed when the local jails or detention centers fill up even 
the authorities deliver aliens to southside where they know they 
will be housed and fed one night three tucson police squad cars 
delivered 16 guatemalans fife said 
the federal government which used informants and bugged bible 
study groups to build its case in tucson apparently pays the 
movement little attention now as the nationwide network of 
sanctuary churches has largely faded away 
today aliens prefer to slip into cities such as los angeles and 
miami or go on to canada most volunteers have gone on to other 
efforts 
were seeing a more contemporary manifestation of sanctuary 
said shultz its really turning much more to some direct 
services helping people find housing assisting with medical care 
education jobs 
shultz said he recently polled some of the 500 congregations 
that had publicly declared themselves part of sanctuary in the 
mid1980s about 25 percent were still assisting some refugees the 
others were asked if they were still willing 
some said yes some no id say more were willing than were 
not shultz said 
along the border in texas new mexico and arizona only a 
handful of sanctuary activists continue moving aliens on their own 
with help from established refugee shelters and a few churches 
most intimidated by the governments actions prefer to remain 
anonymous and secret 
what is done here in new mexico is done very quietly said 
glen remerthamert an albuquerque nm lutheran minister 
acquitted of smuggling charges last year on the basis of former 
gov toney anayas 1986 state sanctuary declaration 
albuquerque has only one declared sanctuary church and it 
houses no refugees a few people still secretly move refugees but 
most of the work focuses on direct social services said jane 
bergquist new mexicos sanctuary defense fund representative 
ins officials maintain those in tucson and albuquerque who faced 
charges were smugglers although ins district director bill 
johnston in tucson meets with corbett and others he warned if 
somebody from my office encountered illegal activity we would 
still today arrest them 
fife and corbett believe that since they have continued their 
activities and the ins has not acted they have established 
themselves as part of the quilt of us immigration 
i think what weve established simply by keeping on is de 
facto acceptance of the church voluntarily protecting refugees and 
functioning as a human rights organization on the border fife 
said 
as for the movements relationship with the government corbett 
doesnt think the ins will plant informants again 
theres no reason for them to infiltrate he said theyre 
on our mailing list

after a long spell of rising interest rates 
some financial advisers now contend that the time is at hand for a 
change in moneymanagement tactics 
the economy is slowing they say and interest rates are likely 
to start falling by midyear if not sooner 
if this is actually going to happen how can savers and 
investors make it work to their advantage 
first of all never forget that forecasting interest rates is a 
guessing game in which no one has all the answers 
you can consult your banker broker accountant or 
brotherinlaw for an informed opinion but experts or not none 
of these people can give you a surefire answer 
of course an awareness of this uncertainty doesnt obviate the 
need to make decisions based on your best guess about what the 
future holds 
savers with maturing certificates of deposit must pick a new 
place to put the proceeds many people buying houses face a choice 
between fixed or adjustablerate mortgages 
if you have a strong conviction that rates are headed 
substantially lower over an extended period of time an adjustable 
mortgage might look especially appealing 
no matter how hard it may be to practice it successfully the 
operative rule in managing your savings is simple 
if you think interest rates are going to decline you emphasize 
investments with longer maturities that enable you to lock in 
todays prevailing rates 
that might mean rolling over a maturing threemonth or sixmonth 
certificate of deposit into say one that runs for 18 months two 
years or even longer 
or it might mean switching some cash now sitting in a money 
market mutual fund into a fund that invests in intermediate or 
longterm bonds 
should rates decline yields on money market funds would follow 
them down longerterm funds by contrast would benefit from an 
increase in the market value of the bonds they own and those 
funds net asset values per share should rise 
right now extending maturities doesnt bring as much potential 
benefit as it traditionally does at this stage of the economic 
cycle it turns out that many bankers also are expecting interest 
rates to be lower six months or a year from now 
so at a typical institution you may find that the going rate 
on say a 14month cd is no higher or even slightly lower than 
what is offered on a sevenmonth cd 
still picking a longer maturity assures you of a known return 
for a greater period of time 
is all the time and trouble involved in this exercise worth it 
how much difference in dollars and cents does it make if you earn 
an extra fraction of a percentage point on your money for an 
additional year or two 
for some people who need every dollar of income they can squeeze 
out of their savings the effort may be a necessity for others it 
is a challenge with psychic as well as financial rewards 
if you would rather devote your time to other things however 
there is a strategy to cushion the impact of interestrate 
fluctuations on the return your savings earn 
you could simply divide your money into equal short 
intermediate and longterm piles whenever a cd or other investment 
matures you order it automatically rolled over into a new one of 
the same kind and maturity 
one nice thing about this sort of nobrain strategy it 
assures that you wont outsmart yourself

resting on a cushion of 2 billion in earnings 
from last year the steel industry hardly appears to be in need of 
protection but some industry leaders say appearances deceive 
while the domestic steel industry is again profitable said 
david m roderick this week it has not fully recovered from the 
depressed state of the 1982 to 1986 period 
roderick chairman of usx made his comment in announcing 
firstquarter earnings of 296 million an 89 percent increase over 
the similar period in 1988 aided partly by strong performances in 
areas other than steel 
at the same time bethlehem steel reported quarterly operating 
income of 137 million from basic steel operations an increase of 
40 percent from the 98 million profit earned in the first quarter 
of 1988 
figures such as these arent likely to contribute to a 
resolution of what has become a perennial debate in the past two 
decades does the american steel industry once the worlds most 
powerful need protection from imports 
the issue always a hot one could burn political and business 
hides this time around president bush indicated in his election 
campaign that he might consider continuing protection if foreign 
governments didnt end subsidies 
some of those who have been supporters however are among those 
who oppose protectionism they concede that steel jobs are at stake 
and that steel is an industry vital to american defense but they 
holler at the cost of protection 
a report by the center for the study of american business at 
washington university st louis indicates that current quota 
restrictions saved 17000 us steel industry jobs but destroyed 
54200 jobs in steelusing industries 
the heritage foundation influential in the reagan and bush 
administrations has issued a report exhorting the president to end 
quotas claiming that five years of steel quotas have added 18 
billion to the cost of us steel 
that figure from a 1985 office of management and budget 
estimate of the cost to the nation of four more years of socalled 
voluntary restraint agreements caused bryan johnson heritage 
researcher to observe trenchantly that vras have saved 17000 
jobs with salaries averaging 40000 annually at a yearly cost of 
200000 per job 
the issue crosses the usual political support lines it divides 
business too business people often lend support to each other on 
controversial matters but a spokesman for caterpillar inc 
recently denounced steel protectionism saying we and our workers 
are paying the price 
looking back some critics say protection never should have been 
granted and that it enabled a backward industry to loaf instead of 
putting its house in order but supporters say there would be no 
industry today without protection 
the origin of supports goes back to the late 1960s when more 
modern japanese and european producers increased their shipments to 
the united states allegedly with their governments help american 
producers yelled dumping 
in an effort to allow american producers time to modernize and 
otherwise become more competitive washington arranged voluntary 
restraint agreements limiting shipments by foreigners they were to 
be temporary 
during the 1970s steel production abroad grew while world demand 
fell in 1977 trigger price mechanisms were begun if steel 
shipments into the united states fell below a certain price 
antidumping cases were triggered 
when the tpms expired in 1982 the us government then put 
limits on steel from europe finally in 1984 the reagan 
administration went back to vras which will expire in september 
unless extended by bush 
years of training have enabled elected officials to juggle hot 
potatoes with ease and felicity but this ones something else 
less of a potato than a whitehot steel ingot and its being 
passed to george bush

fundamentalist moslem regime is turning to the soviet bloc 
increasingly for arms apparently paying for tanks artillery and 
other weapons with crude oil 
strengthening the islamic republics defense capabilities is 
one of the major tasks we face during the reconstruction period 
president ali khamenei told senior military commanders at a recent 
conference 
both belligerents have large forces along the ceasefire line 
and with peace talks deadlocked eight months after they began 
irans rapid buildup is causing concern among western officials 
its very worrisome theyre rebuilding much faster than we 
expected a senior official of the us defense department told 
the associated press on condition of anonymity 
iraq also is seeking new weapons to modernize its armed forces 
and both countries have been developing their own arms industries 
including missile production since the ceasefire aug 20 
earlier this month the tehran daily payam eenqelab said the 
missile firepower of the revolutionary guards corps will increase 
fivefold in the near future using domestically produced weapons 
with ranges of up to 100 miles 
the american source said of the iranian rearmament program it 
appears theyre talking in the range of 20 billion over the next 
45 years theyve got serious economic problems and yet theyre 
spending this kind of money on rebuilding their military the 
question is to what end 
us and other western officials said irans major arms 
suppliers in the latter stages of the gulf war china and north 
korea still are its main sources 
diplomatic sources in the persian gulf region reported recently 
that the chinese are helping iran build a plant to produce 
surfacetosurface missiles 
alittihad a daily in abu dhabi quoted military sources last 
month as saying china would provide 40 new silkworm antiship 
missiles a reconnaissance satellite and batteries of hq2j 
surfacetoair missiles the chinese version of the soviet sam2 
evidence increases however that iran also is turning to 
eastern europe for sovietdesigned weapons us sources said most 
of the equipment is tanks trucks artillery and small arms rather 
than hightechnology weapons 
gulf newspapers have said romania would supply nearly 500 tanks 
armored vehicles and tank transporters help build a naval base on 
qeshm island in the strait of hormuz and convert a tractor factory 
arak to produce armored vehicles 
czechoslovakia will supply iran with 180 t54 and t55 tanks and 
help build a plant to make antitank weapons the papers have 
reported 
no independent confirmation of the reports was available but 
iran has made trade agreements with several soviet bloc states 
including romania czechoslovakia and east germany providing for 
payment in crude oil 
it has a similar pact with brazil now the worlds sixth largest 
arms exporter 
irans official media monitored in nicosia said only that the 
deals involve products and services but analysts believe arms 
are involved 
the east bloc will be swimming with t54s and t55s because of 
eastwest force reductions and it makes a lot of sense that iran 
would be getting a lot of hardware from this quarter said 
hansheino kopietz a middle east specialist with the international 
institute for strategic studies in london 
in the us sources view arms deals with the soviet bloc 
have obvious advantages including allland transportation 
through russia irans northern neighbor 
tehran also has strengthened military links with its eastern 
neighbor pakistan a moslem nation the pakistanis are developing 
their own arms industry and are advanced in the production of 
missiles and some other hightech weapons 
both brig gen mansour sattari the air force commander and 
ali shamkhani the revolutionary guards corps minister visited 
islamabad in recent weeks to meet with senior pakistani military 
officials 
well soon see the fruits of these talks which have defense 
and other objectives shamkhani said without elaboration 
official iranian media have reported a defense allocation 
equivalent to 585 billion in this years budget described as 
about half last years total 
reselat a tehran daily said parliament also approved a secret 
budget bill in which defense spending was considerably higher 
exiled opponents of the regime claimed to have a copy of the 
secret budget they said it included 49 billion for the defense 
ministry and 36 billion for revolutionary guards 
the mujahedeen khalq based in iraq also told the associated 
press those figures did not represent irans entire planned 
military spending 
analysts have estimated that on the basis of such needs as 
combat jets tanks radars and missiles iran would spend about 5 
billion a year on new weapons

a close aide to prime minister noboru takeshita 
committed suicide wednesday a day after takeshita announced he 
would resign because of the financial scandal embroiling his 
government 
the aide ihei aoki was involved in financial dealings that 
linked takeshita personally to the scandal 
takeshita condemned in public opinion polls for the huge stock 
and bribery scandal had announced tuesday that he was resigning 
to restore the peoples trust in government 
japan broadcasting corp said aoki who had served as 
takeshitas personal secretary for three decades took his life by 
cutting his wrists with a razor and hanging himself at his home it 
quoted police as saying an ambulance crew responding to an 
emergency call at 1004 am found aoki dead 
officials at the tokyo metropolitan police headquarters 
confirmed the account that aoki 58 had slashed his wrists to kill 
himself 
as takeshitas personal secretary aoki handled political 
donations stock transactions and loans including those from 
recruit co the company at the center of the scandal that linked 
the prime minister to some of the deals 
last weekend it was disclosed that aoki had accepted a 384000 
loan from the recruit conglomerate in 1987 for use in takeshitas 
campaign to succeed yasuhiro nakasone as prime minister the money 
was later paid back 
recruit is accused of seeking influence and favors by selling 
prelisted shares in a subsidiary at bargain prices to politicians 
bureaucrats business leaders and media executives 
takeshita through aoki and a relative was a recipient of such 
shares that soared in value after they went on sale to the public 
in late 1986 profits from selling the shares reportedly went into 
political funds 
aoki received 2000 of the shares which yielded a profit of the 
equivalent of 30000 
takeshita spend most of tuesday meeting with other leaders of 
the governing liberal democratic party to select a successor but no 
clear choice emerged 
whoever the party chooses as its new leader is assured of 
becoming prime minister because of the partys majority in 
parliament 
japanese news reports said former foreign minister masayoshi 
ito now one of the partys three key leaders was approached about 
acting as an interim prime minister 
ito 75 is chairman of the partys executive council and 
untainted by money or stock questions but he is diabetic and said 
tuesday that a younger leader should take over 
japans news media reported wednesday that ito is the probable 
successor 
the yomiuri shimbun daily said takeshita and other party leaders 
virtually agreed tuesday night that ito should be selected another 
major newspaper the asahi shimbun said a majority of party 
members considered ito the only appropriate candidate 
the question of timing also was unclear takeshita 65 said he 
would resign after parliament passes the budget for the 1989 fiscal 
year that began april 1 but the budget has been delayed by an 
opposition boycott of parliament over the stocktrading scandal 
takeshita said he would go ahead with a planned nineday trip to 
five southeast asian nations beginning saturday indicating he 
hoped parliament would pass the budget in early may 
other potential successors to takeshita include former prime 
minister takeo fukuda 84 exdeputy prime minister shin kanemaru 
74 masaharu gotoda 74 who served as a key aide to nakasone and 
michita sakata 72 speaker of the house of representatives 
liberal democratic party secretary general shintaro abe and 
kiichi miyazawa both leading candidates when takeshita was chosen 
party leader in november 1987 are considered out of the running 
now because of their own ties to the scandal 
miyazawa was one of three cabinet ministers who resigned because 
of links to the scandal involving japans giant recruit co an 
information services conglomerate in addition prosecutors 
arrested 14 people including two former vice ministers on bribery 
or securities law violation 
the recruit scandal broke last summer with revelations the 
company had sold cutprice shares in a real estate subsidiary to 
more than 150 politicians bureaucrats business leaders and media 
executives 
the shares often bought with money lent by another recruit 
subsidiary yielded fat profits when sold after the subsidiary went 
public in 1986 
prosecutors are investigating politicians and aides who bought 
such shares from recruit which allegedly sought to influence 
government policy 
takeshita acknowledged this month receiving more than 1 million 
in political donations from recruit but said they were legal his 
decision to resign came after his further admission during the 
weekend that aoki had borrowed 384000 from recruit 
i could feel distrust among my constituents when i visited my 
home district said motoharu moriyama a liberal democratic party 
lawmaker 
adding to takeshitas unpopularity was a 3 percent consumption 
tax takeshita had pushed the tax through parliament as tax reform 
package that also included income tax cuts 
japans political opposition said takeshitas resignation was 
not enough 
the only reasonable path is complete political reform said 
takako doi chairwoman of the japan socialist party the cabinet 
must resign en masse nakasone must be brought to testify about 
the recruit scandal under oath in parliament and new 
parliamentary elections must be called 
elections are scheduled this summer for half the seats in 
parliaments upper house but the government does not need to call 
elections for the more powerful lower house until next year 
the stock market also reacted calmly and positively to the news 
rising 439 points or 134 percent its thirdlargest gain this 
year traders said takeshitas announcement did away with some 
political and economic uncertainty

an influential group of computer makers and 
users has announced a seal that will certify computers that 
interconnect easily with other makes 
big computer buyers led by general motors corp and the federal 
government demanded such a program because of dissatisfaction with 
the existing cacophony in communications between computers the 
seal is called the cos mark 
the seal was unveiled tuesday by the mclean vabased 
corporation for open systems international or cos the 
organization touted the program as a step toward making computers 
interoperable that is as easy to connect as telephones 
the interoperability of computers while helpful does not solve 
the problem that programs for one computer still may not run on 
another but it does help with things like sharing electronic mail 
and data files 
while some basic communications standards have been set 
highlevel standards that cover things like how information appears 
on the screen and plugs into programs are still in flux 
general motors plagued by incompatible computers in its 
factories has demanded that computer makers comply with the 
maptop interconnection standard gm developed that standard which 
has since been adopted by other users 
the worlds biggest computer user the us government has its 
own interconnection standard which will be imposed on all wouldbe 
suppliers to federal agencies starting aug 15 1990 
the cos mark seal of approval complies with both those 
standards the organization said at a washington news conference 
the organization will have a testing program to decide whether 
computers and communication devices deserve its seal of approval 
it said 
there is no doubt that todays unveiling of the cos mark 
program is one of the most important milestones not only in cos 
history but in the history of the information services industry as 
well lincoln d faurer the groups president and chief 
executive said in a written statement 
what theyre trying to do is very ambitious its hard to set 
and implement a standard among competitors said mary modahl an 
analyst of network strategy at forrest research inc in cambridge 
mass 
achieving interoperability is so difficult that engineers from 
competing companies may have to sit down together in some cases and 
work out problems identified by the cos mark certifiers she said 
products from three companies hewlettpackard co motorola 
inc and concord communications inc were the first to receive 
the cos mark under a trial certification program 
statements of support for the cos mark program were issued by 
other companies including data general corp ncr corp northern 
telecom inc unisys corp xerox corp and american telephone amp 
telegraph co 
also backing the program were such users as gm and the defense 
communications agency 
easy interoperability is a threat to the worlds two biggest 
computer makers international business machines corp and digital 
equipment corp which traditionally locked customers into their 
own software and communication systems but even those companies 
have been forced to adopt industrywide standards because of their 
customers demands 
representatives of ibm and digital said tuesday their companies 
are active members of the corporation for open systems and support 
the cos mark program

florida has filed suit against touche 
ross amp co for more than 100 million in damages as the 
courtappointed receiver for nowinsolvent international medical 
centers inc 
the lawsuit seeks to recover damages due to alleged gross 
negligence breach of fiduciary duty and negligent 
misrepresentations by the auditor according to a news release 
tuesday by the florida department of insurance 
imc once floridas largest health maintenance organization was 
declared insolvent and placed in receivership may 14 1987 
as a regulator we rely upon companies to submit audited 
financial information that is accurate state treasurer and 
insurance commissioner tom gallagher said if it is not we cant 
do our job and carry out the law 
robert w mannix associate general counsel for touche ross at 
the companys headquarters in new york said the big eight 
accounting firm had conducted imc audits thoroughly and 
professionally 
mannix also said that floridas insurance department had been 
conducting its own examinations and was fully informed of events 
and developments at imc before taking over the hmo 
this phenomenon of regulators suing big eight accounting firms 
in an effort to blame the accounting profession for the regulators 
own failings has become quite familiar lately mannix said 
miguel recarey jr former president of imc fled the country in 
1987 in the face of indictments on federal charges including 
wiretapping bribery and embezzlement in the wake of the collapse 
of imc 
the insurance department also sued touche ross in april 1988 
claiming that the firm should have informed the state that imc was 
due a 22 million federal income tax refund the refund paid to 
recarey enterprises eventually went to miguel recarey just before 
he fled

eastern airlines has been given two weeks to 
reach an accord with travel agents on a new policy for 
ticketholders seeking refunds due to the 7weekold strike against 
the carrier 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland who is overseeing 
easterns chapter 11 reorganization held a brief hearing tuesday 
on the matter he then adjourned the session for two weeks 
zack clement an attorney representing miamibased eastern said 
the airline will try to reach an accord with the american society 
of travel agents and plans to propose a new refund plan to the 
court in a few weeks 
asta has petitioned the court to require eastern to pay refunds 
on unused tickets to travel agents who would pass the refunds on 
to their customers 
the airline has said its debts include about 165 million in 
unused tickets issued before its march 9 bankruptcy filing in the 
new york court eastern estimates it sells 75 percent of its 
tickets through travel agents 
under easterns current policy consumers holding unused tickets 
purchased before the chapter 11 filing have several options but 
must apply for any refunds directly from eastern 
the customers can use the tickets to fly their original 
itineraries on existing eastern flights where available the 
carrier has been operating only about 10 percent of its prestrike 
schedule or on sister carrier continental airlines if seats are 
available 
alternatively consumers can apply for refunds from credit card 
companies for tickets they charged on the cards or can apply to the 
bankruptcy court as unsecured creditors 
although airlines generally honor each others tickets charging 
a fee for the service competitors stopped honoring eastern tickets 
after it filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors 
theres a lot of hardship for eastern ticketholders james 
flug an attorney representing consumers union told lifland the 
situation breeds illwill toward the airline flug said 
consumers union the nonprofit consumer advocacy group that 
publishes consumer reports magazine has joined the travel agents 
petition seeking to broaden it to include passengers who purchased 
tickets individually rather than through agents the group has 
asked the court to require eastern to reimburse those passengers 
before the company pays off other creditors 
the consumers union request clearly requires the payment of 
more than the company can afford to pay clement told lifland 
at an earlier hearing tuesday brian bradford easterns 
director of cash management and credit said the airline has about 
183 million in cash on hand that reserve is expected to drop to 
about 107 million by the end of may excluding proceeds from any 
asset sales made before then he said 
eastern a unit of texas air corp of houston told its major 
creditors monday that it intends to sell its northeast shuttle 
service and its philadelphia hub as part of a plan to rebuild as a 
smaller carrier those two sales which must be approved by 
creditors and the bankruptcy court would give eastern a cash 
balance of just under 500 million bradford said 
clayton glasgow the airlines director of financial performance 
analysis told the hearing that eastern is losing about 1 million 
a day 
in a statement tuesday the air line pilots association 
criticized easterns downsizing plan as unrealistic 
the union which represents eastern pilots most of whom have 
walked off the job said the plan cannot be realized because the 
company wont be able to hire and train the 1700 pilots it says it 
needs the union also questioned the carriers belief that the plan 
would lead to profitability since the airline still would be 
saddled with high fixed costs

venerable smith barney harris upham amp co is 
buying about half of drexel burnham lambert incs retail brokerage 
business in a deal drexel hopes will help it shed the stigma of the 
wall street insider trading scandal 
the sale announced tuesday came a week after the 157yearold 
firm a leading purveyor of debt securities called junk bonds 
disclosed restructuring plans that included the sale of the retail 
network and a 33 percent cut in staff 
the restructuring was prompted partly by bad publicity due to an 
intensive federal fraud probe of drexel and the historic settlement 
of securities fraud charges stemming from the scandal that surfaced 
more than two years ago the settlement raised the prospect that 
drexel could lose its broker license in some states 
smith barney would get 19 drexel offices including some of its 
largest retail branches and about 500 of drexels 
biggestproducing account executives 
neither firm disclosed a sale price but wall street brokerage 
experts have said the entire division was worth 50 million to 200 
million 
drexel said it would sell the remainder of its 43office 
brokerage network piecemeal and will be working with our branch 
people to assure the orderly transition of those offices 
spokesman steven anreder declined to say whether any sales were 
under negotiation or to elaborate on the fate of the 600 other 
account executives in the unsold offices 
for smith barney a 115yearold firm with a stodgy image 
symbolized by television ads that its brokers make money the old 
fashioned way they earn it the addition of drexel offices and 
people would mark a major step in its effort to become a more 
powerful force in the brokerage business 
smith barney is a unit of primerica corp a diversified 
financial services company based in greenwich conn the brokerage 
has said it wants to become bigger more specialized and more 
profitable 
primerica stock fell 25 cents tuesday to close at 2087 a 
share in consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
drexel said the offices to be sold to smith barney include 
branches in manhattan boca raton miami beach and miami fla 
baton rouge and new orleans la boston denver encino and palo 
alto calif houston paramus nj providence ri rockville 
md st louis mo scottsdale ariz washington dc and white 
plains ny 
smith barney will get the leases furniture and fixtures in all 
branches as part of the deal 
drexel was the biggest target of a federal investigation that 
grew out of revelations provided by stock speculator ivan boesky 
the inside trader serving a threeyear prison term 
as part of an agreement to settle criminal and civil fraud 
charges drexel agreed to pay 650 million in fines plead guilty 
to six felonies and subject itself to unprecedented federal 
scrutiny of the way it does business 
drexel is privately owned and does not disclose earnings or 
revenue figures although it is considered one of wall streets 
biggest and most profitable firms drexel has said the brokerage 
unit accounts for only about 10 percent of overall business and 
that its primary moneymaker is the firms leading role in the 175 
billion junk bond market 
the sale to smith barney came a day after three drexel workers 
affected by the restructuring filed a classaction suit accusing 
the firms top managers with breach of contract and violations of 
their duties 
the suit filed in new york state supreme court in manhattan 
contends that the sale of the unit will cost the brokers millions 
of dollars because they will be forced to sell their drexel stock 
for far below its true value drexel officials have declined to 
comment on the suit

ncnb corp may have lost its bid to take over 
citizens amp southern corp of atlanta but chairman hugh mccoll says 
the north carolinabased bank plans to continue its growth from 
baltimore to miami 
its a fact were becoming a national company mccoll said 
tuesday its a fact that were growing instead of dying he 
added that ncnb has no plans to expand outside the southeast and 
texas 
mccoll predicted that largescale mergers soon will become a 
necessity in the banking industry 
we plan to become a major banking company in the us 
mccoll said there will be far fewer players who are much larger 
we will survive 
mccoll said ncnb has no intention of resubmitting an offer for 
camps calling his withdrawal of the 24 billion bid monday the 
end of the saga 
we have put this chapter behind us he told reporters at a 
news conference at ncnbs charlotte headquarters 
the camps takeover would have been the largest bank merger in us 
history combining the assets of the biggest banks in north 
carolina and georgia with 76 billion in assets the new bank 
would have been the nations sixthlargest on march 30 ncnb 
which has more than 50 billion in assets shocked the banking 
industry by launching the stock bid for the atlanta bank when it 
appeared the takeover attempt was about to turn nasty mccoll 
dropped a bombshell on monday by abruptly withdrawing the bid 
we always wanted it to be a friendly deal he said we 
never said wed do a hostile deal when we couldnt pull it off we 
decided to withdraw 
the withdrawal marked the second time that ncnb failed to gain a 
foothold in the lucrative atlanta banking market the bank lost out 
to rival wachovia corp of winstonsalem for first atlanta corp in 
1985 
meanwhile ncnb took out fullpage ads tuesday in newspapers in 
charlotte and atlanta and several other large north carolina cities 
in an apparent effort to explain its side of the takeover battle 
if all you know about ncnb is what youve been reading in the 
business section youre missing a big big part of what were all 
about the advertisement said 
for example we at ncnb see a day when southerners wont have 
to go outside the region to secure the capital they need the ad 
said weve already made loans that a few years ago no southern 
bank could make 
the way we look at it being big isnt a goal it said 
its a result of doing the absolute best we can for employees 
customers communities and shareholders 
mccoll deferred questions about the purpose of the ads 
just four months ago ncnb effectively doubled its size when it 
was selected by the federal deposit insurance corp to acquire the 
largest bank in texas first republicbank corp 
since 1982 ncnb has expanded aggressively into new markets in 
florida south carolina georgia and tennessee the first 
republicbank move was the biggest until the camps offer

a former drexel burnham lambert inc bond trader 
has pleaded innocent to federal racketeering and fraud charges in 
two major wall street securities cases 
also tuesday a federal judge tentatively set the trial of 
former drexel junk bond financier michael milken for june 30 but 
also scheduled a more likely march 1990 date 
the former bond trader bruce lee newberg 32 denied all 
charges made against him in a march 29 indictment that also 
targeted milken and charges in an august 1988 indictment of the 
defunct securities firm princetonnewport partners lp 
the two cases are considered the most prominent pending trials 
in the threeyear government investigation of stock crimes 
developed from information provided by by jailed inside trader ivan 
boesky 
newberg already has agreed to set aside 16 million in assets 
equal to his 1987 salary to guarantee forfeitures he might have 
to make if convicted in the milken case under the racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act 
last year newberg posted 25 million with the government in 
connection with the rico forefeiture provisions in the 
princetonnewport case which also charged five partners of the new 
jersey securities firm 
no bail was set in connection with the milken indictment because 
newberg already remains free on 250000 bond in the 
princetonnewport case his attorneys actually entered an innocent 
plea for him in that case in august but he made a personal plea on 
tuesday 
both pleas on tuesday were entered before us district judge 
kimba wood 
lawyers have called the dual rico indictment of newberg a 
rarity defense attorneys have indicated they plan to seek 
dismissal of all counts against newberg based on the constitutional 
prohibition of double jeopardy which bars citizens from being 
tried twice on the same charges 
the charges in the 98count milken indictment and the 35count 
princetonnewport case parallel each other they focus on a series 
of alleged stock manipulations and socalled stock parking 
schemes involving princetonnewport drexel milken and boesky 
defense attorneys claim newberg was charged in both indictments 
in an attempt to pressure him into cooperating with prosecutors 
the princetonnewport trial is to begin june 5 at a hearing 
tuesday wood set the june 30 trial date for newberg milken and 
milkens brother lowell because of federal criminal law procedures 
but the additional march 1 1990 date was considered more 
realistic because of the complexity of the case 
milken and his brother have pleaded innocent to the charges as 
have the five other princetonnewport defendants 
newberg did not attend the original april 7 arraignment in the 
milken case because he was injured in a skiing accident 
newberg who reported directly to milken at drexels highyield 
bond division in beverly hills calif was present for the 
arraignment at manhattan federal court he made no remarks other 
than to plead not guilty to the judge

westinghouse electric corp says it will pay 
to clean up polluted drinking water for 9000 suburban pittsburgh 
residents whose supplies have been tainted for the past year 
state officials found westinghouses vanport factory to be the 
source of the chemical pollution although the company has not 
admitted specifically that it is to blame for the spread of 
trichloroethylene in the water table 
the chemical known as tce is a degreasing compound believed to 
cause cancer if ingested in large amounts over a long period of 
time 
the chemical was discovered a year ago in wells near the ohio 
river operated by the vanport municipal authority in beaver county 
the concentration in the water has since soared 
pittsburghbased westinghouse agreed tuesday to supply water to 
authority customers while purifying facilities are built 
the cleanup could cost westinghouse as much as 2 million at the 
outset but the company has not yet set a figure since it has 
agreed to pay for permanent operation of facilities to remove the 
chemical as long as it continues to seep into the deep wells from 
which the water is drawn

mistrials in the wall street corruption case scheduled the 
november date tuesday after meeting with lawyers for both sides 
prosecutors and defense attorneys had agreed on a september

counts sherwin faces up to 40 years in prison and fines totaling 
2 million if convicted on all counts

trial because a prosecutor failed to disclose a report that 
concluded a major piece of evidence had been altered 
a second trial with a new jury began feb 1 but on march 23 
the second jury said it was deadlocked after 12 days of 
deliberations prompting lowe to declare a second mistrial

sc johnson amp co inc plans to spend 100 
million advertising its new major weapon in the battle for 
dominance in the bugkilling market 
the racinebased company popularly known as johnson wax 
unveiled raid max its first major new line of insecticides since 
it introduced raid in 1956 
the company promised the new product would zap cockroaches not 
only on the prowl but in their nests and do the same to ants fleas 
and other pests 
johnson is no 1 in the 500 million us householdinsecticide 
business with a roughly 47 percent share of the market but in 
recent years it has seen its share threatened by competitors 
among them american cyanamid cos shulton subsidiary 
shulton hopped into the roach market with combat a poison 
contained in small adhesivebacked containers that prevents roaches 
from digesting food since 1985 combat has taken 12 percent of the 
market according to trade publications 
johnson wax however thinks it has an answer 
weve gone to the top chemical companies in the world and got 
stateoftheart technology thats the reason were saying that 
these are superior beth pritchard vice president of the 
insectcontrol division of johnson wax said tuesday 
this is a new generation of insecticides the formulations are 
unique these formulas have been specifically put together for 
heavy infestations 
the raid max line is positioned as a premium product with 
prices from 299 to 499 about 1 to 150 more than raid 
products the new line has four products a roachandant spray 
killer a fogger a roach bait and an ant bait 
pritchard said consumer tests in three southern states showed 
that the products worked better than anything else available 
some analysts however were skeptical 
they havent brought out anything to date as good as combat 
said harvey sober a dean witter reynolds inc anaylst he noted 
combat had 20 million in sales the first year on the market 
it took johnson wax six years to develop raid max and the 
company is banking on it to stabilize its insecticide sales 
raymond farley president and chief executive officer acknowledged 
earlier this year that sales were off about 8 percent in 1988 
because of drought in several parts of the country 
johnson wax with annual sales of about 2 billion is a 
worldwide manufacturer of personal and homecare products

gold prices were lower

news that the west german government plans to repeal a 10 percent 
witholding tax on interest income 
dealers added that the market was quiet ahead of todays 
announcement of firstquarter us gross national product figures 
if the figures indicate a slowing of the american economy as 
expected the dollar will probably fall they said 
the dollar is still wellbid although i dont really see 
why said a dealer at a european bank in frankfurt based on 
the fundamentals the dollar should go weaker

the tokyo stock exchanges key index overcoming a 
setback in early trading shot up to a record high today while the

13117yen close it opened at 13138 yen and fluctuated between 
13130 yen and 13153 yen the dollar had slipped 111 yen over the

the dollar gradually rose against the yen in connection with 
dollarbuying against the west german mark said a trader with the

to await the release later today of the us gross national product 
figure for 1989s first three months he added

points or 057 percent closing today at 3343493 a new high 
profittaking following tuesdays gain sent the index down 5139 
points in morning trading but it rebounded as institutional 
investors began buying up shares that had declined in the morning 
analysts said 
of course prime minister norobu takeshitas remarks on his 
resignation yesterday wouldnt remedy the whole thing but 
investors expect that it at least will clear up some of the 
uncertainties said yoshio shimoyama with nikko securities in 
tokyo 
amid growing public distrust in his government tainted by a 
stockprofiteering and bribery scandal that surfaced last summer 
takeshita announced tuesday he would step down as soon as 
parliament passes the fiscal 1989 budget 
investors reacted positively to this indication that the budget 
would be put through shimoyama said 
some may think it strange that share prices started rising 
following the prime ministers announcement he would resign soon

the big incentive packages introduced recently 
helped boost car and light truck sales by 54 percent in midapril 
but one analyst said automakers might have to cut production 
further to pare excess inventories 
the eight companies making cars and light trucks in north 
america said tuesday that they sold vehicles at an average of 
41380 a day during the april 1120 period this year compared with 
a 39257 vehicleaday rate in midapril last year 
car sales were up 37 percent and truck sales rose 86 percent 
im breathing easier today said analyst doug laughlin of 
bear stearns amp co of new york city the selling rate is up and 
up against a good number a year ago and its part of what we need 
to get the inventories back in line 
on tuesday ford motor co and general motors corp said they 
had trimmed their secondquarter and early thirdquarter production 
schedules 
the strategy is to combine sales inflated by incentives and 
production cuts to reduce inventories before the companies change 
manufacturing to the 1990 models later this year 
it looks like theyve made both of the necessary 
adjustments laughlin said it should put them in better 
inventory shape when the model year rolls around 
but analyst david healy of drexel burnham lambert inc in new 
york wasnt so sure 
i dont think the production cuts that have been made or 20 
days of improved sales are going to be enough to solve the 
inventory problem he said adding that the cuts may have to go 
deeper and the incentives may have to be sweetened 
i think the incentives are working said analyst charles 
brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york i would have been 
surprised if it would have been anything else 
the midapril sales increase wasnt evenly spread across the 
major makers fords car sales soared 145 percent compared with a 
15 percent decline for gm and a 103 percent drop for chrysler 
corp 
what you have here is the strength of fords product 
momentum laughlin said when youve got roughly comparable 
incentives this is what happens 
chrysler thats a lot tougher one to look at youve got a 
lot of models which arent in production right now and are 
sitting on dealer lots he added 
automakers were looking for rising sales rates this month when 
they put on the newest incentive packages in late march and early 
april march and april traditionally are strong vehicle buying 
periods but last month proved to be weaker than expected 
that prompted the big three to put on the new incentive 
packages a bit of a gamble since the costs of lowinterest 
financing and cash rebates come out of manufacturers profits 
for 1989 car and truck sales by the eight makers are running 
39 percent behind the pace of last year the secondbest in 
industry history car sales are off 6 percent light truck sales 
are nearly even

northwest airlines gained some ground on 
two fronts in its battle with hostile suitor marvin davis as a 
delaware judge turned down davis effort to void some of 
northwests defenses and the minnesota commerce commissioner 
ordered the oilman to provide more information on his plans 
chancellor william p allen of delaware chancery court in 
wilmington rejected tuesday davis request for an injunction that 
would have barred nwa inc northwests parent from issuing 
poison pill stock rights to shareholders before nwas annual 
meeting may 15 
but the judge left the door open to another legal challenge of 
the poison pill which makes it more difficult and costly for a 
group to take over a company allen indicated he would make a final 
determination on the legality of the pill within 45 days of the 
companys annual meeting 
allen ordered nwa to inform its shareholders that the pill might 
be invalidated later 
davis is offering to buy northwest for 27 billion or 90 a 
share the nwa board has rejected the offer as inadequate 
a spokeman for davis said the oilmans investor group would have 
preferred an injunction but nonetheless was pleased by the judges 
order that shareholders be notified that the pill could be ruled 
illegal 
the decision means davis could still succeed in acquiring the 
nations fourthlargest airline if he can win control of nwas 
board of directors 
tom ryan a northwest spokesman said he had not fully reviewed 
the ruling and could not comment on it in detail but its fair 
to say were pleased with it 
davis got another blow tuesday night from commerce commissioner 
michael hatch who gave davis lawyers a wednesday noon cdt 
deadline to give further details on the takeover bid 
the financial statements given to the bank the lenders i 
think ought to be made available to the shareholders so at least 
the offering becomes believable in terms of the ability of the 
acquirer to operate an ongoing airline hatch said 
under a 1984 state law the registration of the davis offer must 
be reviewed by the commerce commissioner if hatch decides that 
davis has not made a sufficient explanation of his plans the 
commissioner can order the offer be suspended 
davis attorney george a vandeman said after the hearing he 
would try to convince hatch that the disclosures of davis 
financial plan for the eaganbased airline are adequate and 
accurate 
hatch said he would issue a ruling by 6 pm wednesday if one is 
needed if he issues a suspension order davis would have a chance 
to appeal it at a thursday night hearing at the state department of 
commerce hatch said 
vandeman said a suspension would not delay davis effort to 
acquire northwest 
the nwa board of directors on monday unanimously rejected davis 
bid charging that the offer is unfinanced and in part illegal 
under securities laws but the board said it is willing to 
negotiate with davis and other qualified bidders 
in other developments the nwa board decided at least 
temporarily against a planned 16 billion order for new planes 
instead it authorized its planeleasing subsidiary to buy 10 used 
dc10s and 14 used dc9s to lease to northwest and other carriers

down and 529 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 2239 million shares as of 10 
am on wall street 
the commerce department reported this morning that the nations 
gross national product rose at a 55 percent annual rate after 
adjustment for inflation in the first quarter of the year 
without the effects of last years drought however the agency 
said the growth rate would have been just 3 percent 
so analysts concluded that the figures provided support for the 
belief that economic growth lately has been losing momentum as the 
federal reserve has sought to restrain inflation 
but the inflation figures that accompanied the gnp report were 
not so encouraging brokers said indicating that prices were still 
rising at a 5 percent to 55 percent annual rate

the us economy surpassing the 5 trillion 
mark for the first time expanded at a robust annual rate of 55 
percent in the first three months of 1989 the fastest pace in more 
than a year the government reported today 
the commerce department said that almost half of the increase in 
the gross national product came from a statistical catchup from 
last years drought 
but even discounting this bookkeeping factor the gnp 
representing the countrys total output of goods and services 
advanced at a 3 percent annual rate down only slightly from a 35 
percent nonfarm growth rate in the final three months of 1988 
the dollar fell against most major currencies in domestic 
trading after the release of todays report while bond prices were 
mostly lower 
the bush administration hailed the gnp report as good news that 
the economy is continuing to expand at a healthy rate 
officials noted in particular the fact that the trade deficit 
which had been widening for two consecutive quarters showed 
improvement again in the first three months of the year while 
business investments rose at the fastest pace since last spring 
there is nothing to indicate a recession in 1989 from these 
numbers j antonio villamil the commerce departments chief 
economist said at a news briefing we are getting solid 
moderate growth with the kind of mix we need at this stage of the 
expansion 
the nonfarm growth was slightly better than economists had been 
expecting most analysts believe the us economy will slow 
substantially this year under the weight of higher interest rates 
for the past year the federal reserve has been pushing rates 
higher in an effort to fight rising inflationary pressures 
however the report contained information that inflation is 
rising a gnp price index which measures a fixed marketbasket of 
goods and services rose at an annual rate of 5 percent in the first 
quarter up from a fourthquarter rate of 42 percent 
half of the increase came from a pay raise for federal 
employees with rising food and home costs accounting for much of 
the rest of the increase 
the 55 percent overall increase in the gnp was more than double 
the 24 percent advance in the octoberdecember quarter the last 
period in which output was held back because of the lingering 
effects of last summers drought 
with the start of the new year the government returned its 
estimate of farm output to normal levels thus accounting for 25 
percentage points of the 55 percent increase in the first quarter 
economists expect growth for the remainder of the year to slow 
dramatically as the economy adjusts to the yearlong credit 
tightening done by the fed 
the bush administration and some private economists have begun 
to express fears that the central bank could overdo its 
antiinflation battle and risk pushing the country into another 
recession 
however other analysts believe the fed will be able to engineer 
the tricky soft landing in which interest rates rise enough to 
dampen inflaionary pressures but not enough to choke off the 
sixyearold recovery the longest in peacetime history 
todays gnp report showed that the countrys total output 
climbed to 5117 trillion the first time in history it topped the 
5 trillion mark 
this figure is before inflation is taken into account after 
adjusting for inflation the gnp rose 548 billion in the first 
quarter to 4088 trillion this figure is expressed in 1982 
dollars 
the 55 percent gnp increase was the largest advance since a 61 
percent jump in the fourth quarter of 1987 
for all of 1988 the gnp rose 39 percent the best performance 
in four years the bush administration counting on continued 
strong growth to help reduce the federal budget deficit is 
forecasting that growth in 1989 will dip only slightly to 32 
percent 
however many private economists believe that forecast is far 
too optimistic and total growth for the year will be 27 percent or 
less a sluggish rate which would not be enough to keep 
unemployment from rising 
the first quarter gnp report provided some evidence that the 
economy was slowing 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of all economic 
activity rose at a rate of just 13 percent the slowest advance 
in more than a year purchases of durable goods such as autos 
actually fell by 32 percent in the first quarter while purchses of

housing construction another key consumer sector dropped at an 
annual rate of 36 percent in the first quarter the first decline 
in a year as the housing industry suffered under the impact of 
rising mortgage rates 
while these two key sectors were flashing signals of a slowdown

through march 
the countrys intractable trade deficit which had actually been 
rising for two consecutive quarters posted a modest improvement in 
the first quarter as a 106 percent rise in exports was enough to

the stock market edged upward today in a tepid 
response to the latest data on the state of the economy 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 715 to 239406 by 
11 am on wall street 
gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of new 
york stock exchangelisted issues with 618 up 560 down and 571 
unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 4968 million shares at 
midmorning 
the commerce department reported this morning that the nations 
gross national product rose at a 55 percent annual rate after 
adjustment for inflation in the first quarter of the year 
without the effects of last years drought however the agency 
said the growth rate would have been just 3 percent 
so analysts concluded that the figures provided support for the 
belief that economic growth lately has been losing momentum as the 
federal reserve has sought to restrain inflation 
but the inflation figures that accompanied the gnp report were 
not so encouraging brokers said indicating that prices were still 
rising at a 5 percent to 55 percent annual rate

researchers told congress today that they are 
taking measures to resolve the controversy and skepticism 
surrounding their coldfusion experiment by having government 
investigators observe in their laboratory 
stanley pons a university of utah chemist who announced the 
coldfusion process to produce energy last month said his 
laboratory has arranged experiments duplicating the process and 
have invited scientists from the los alamos national laboratories 
to observe 
we have 19 experiments being set up now including a 
demonstratiion for los alamos pons told the house committee on 
science space and technology 
pons said that once the experiment is operating satisfactorily 
the los alamos scientists will take it back with them to the 
federal laboratory for a detailed analysis 
pons and his collaborator martin fleischmann of the university 
of southampton in england announced at a news conference march 23 
that they had achieved fusion at room temperature by using simple 
laboratory equipment 
the utah researchers said they placed electrodes of platinum and 
palladium in a flask of deuterium oxide or heavy water and then 
applied an electrical current to the electrodes they said the 
setup split the heavy water into atoms of deuterium and oxygen and 
forced deuterium nuclei into the crystal lattice structure of the 
palladium metal 
after operating for a number of hours the researchers said the 
experiment caused deuterium to become so compressed within the 
metal that the nuclei fused this reaction they said produced 
heat energy equal to about four times the amount of energy used to 
cause the fusion 
the announcement stunned the international physics community 
which has spent millions of dollars over the last 25 years 
attempting to achieve fusion using massive multimilliondollar 
machines filled with plasmas heated to temperatures of up to 100 
million degrees 
pons and fleischman appeared before the house committee today in 
a room packed with spectators journalists and representatives of 
other laboratories 
the two defended their work before sharp questioning by 
committee members who probed not only the findings of the 
experiment but the manner in which the researchers announced their 
work 
fleischmann said followup articles detailing how the experiment 
is being conducted will be published in scientific journals 
pons said part of the controversy revolves around the different 
way in which chemists and physicists announce the results of their 
work the utah experiments have come under heavy criticism from 
fusion experts because the precise details needed for duplication 
of the work have not been released 
pons said that typically physicists will circulate a 
prepublication copy of their research to colleagues who will 
informally review it 
for chemists it is done in a different way he said the 
review is left up to the journal 
fleischmann said that in one experiment researchers have been 
able to cause water to reach the boiling point he added however 
there was still much work yet to be done to develop a way of 
harvesting useful energy from this process 
the utah researchers said they built their initial experiment 
for about 100000 but fleischmann said production of a scaleup 
device will cost about 10 times that and that the next phase 
where useful energy was actually developed would cost millions 
the researchers also said it could take years to turn the 
coldfusion process into a useful energy source we think it is 
feasible but it will require a very high effort fleischmann said 
one of the elements to be investigated said fleischmann is the 
metal that can be used in cold fusion the palladium used by the 
utak researchers is an expensive metal that is available in only a 
few places on earth 
fleischmann said other experiments are under way to find if 
other metals can be used palladium may be the best choice but 
there may be also other possible choices he said 
the university of utah was planning to use todays hearing to 
request 25 million from the federal government toward a 100 
million institute devoted to commercializing the process the new 
york times reported today 
while such lobbying for funds is not new it is highly unusual 
for researchers to seek congressional support before their findings 
have been confirmed the newspaper said 
the daylong hearing was to include at least three nuclear 
physicists who have reported that they have been unable to 
duplicate the utah experiments 
in testimony released to the committee scientists from the oak 
ridge national laboratory princeton university and massachusetts 
institute of technology all expressed strong and sharp skepticism 
and doubt about the utah experiments actually achieving nuclear 
fusion 
researchers in texas california and washington have reported 
what may be fusion reactions but many other laboratories have 
reported failed efforts scientists in the soviet union and hungary 
reported experiments with reactions that may be fusion 
many experts believe fusion to be the ultimate energy source 
the nuclear process is the opposite of the fission reaction that 
now powers atomic generating plants fission occurs by splitting 
atoms and the process leaves behind highly radioactive spent fuel 
fusion derives its energy by forcing atoms of deuterium or 
hydrogen together the reaction produces an atom of helium a burst 
of energy and a neutron experts believe fusion energy would 
produce a much smaller amount of radioactive waste and that fusion 
power plants could be operated with deuterium oxide or heavy 
water a chemical that can easily be extracted from seawater 
natural fusion energy is the power that causes the sun and the 
stars to shine stellar fusion is created when the massive force of 
gravity in stars forces hydrogen atoms to fuse giving off heat 
light and helium most hot fusion research is an attempt to 
duplicate the pressure and heat process seen on the sun

the house grappled today with a 47 billion 
domestic spending bill and a democratic plan to pay for it with 
savings from defense and other programs drew a veto threat from the 
bush administration 
the measure would provide money for this year for antidrug 
programs veterans and college students and was defended by 
democrats as a way to provide badly needed money for important 
priorities 
republicans said the bill was loaded down with unnecessary 
spending that could wait until next year 
but it was a plan by the chambers majority democrats for saving 
money that drew the most fire 
the democrats proposed saving 14 billion by cutting most 
federal programs acrosstheboard by 057 percent the plan would 
pare 1 billion from defense 353 million from domestic and 43 
million from foreign aid this year according to house 
appropriations committee estimates 
richard darman the white house budget director said he would 
urge president bush to veto the measure if defense spending was cut 
and if the fiscally irresponsible overall bill was not reduced 
in size 
and in a letter to house minority leader robert michel rill 
defense secretary dick cheney said the military cuts would do 
enormous damage to the pentagons personnel operations and 
maintenance and research programs 
republicans planned to propose a moneysaving amendment of their 
own which would reduce portions of the bill and cut many domestic 
programs but would leave defense spending alone 
with democrats controlling the house speaker jim wright 
dtexas predicted i anticipate that the leadership amendment 
prevails 
critics have complained that without reductions the spending 
bill would push this years deficit beyond its projected total of 
163 billion the fiscal year ends sept 30 
only 14 billion of the bills total spending would occur this 
year the rest would not actually be spent until future years 
excluded from cuts under the democratic plan would be domestic 
programs in which spending is required by law such as benefits 
paid to poor people or to the elderly 
the senate has yet to consider the spending measure 
meanwhile members of the house budget committee held a 
closeddoor session tuesday to work on a budget resolution for the 
1990 fiscal year 
the spending plan which the panel expects to complete thursday 
is expected to resemble closely the 12 trillion document the 
senate budget committee adopted last week it will also reflect the 
savings and spending totals set in the budget deal worked out 
earlier this month between president bush and congressional leaders 
according to documents provided by a participant in tuesdays 
meeting the house plan is likely to increase senate spending 
levels for education health and community development programs 
while reducing expenditures for energy agriculture and law 
enforcement

turner broadcasting system inc said today it 
is planning to launch a daily commercialfree news program for 
schools in august challenging one containing advertising that was 
recently tested by whittle communications lp 
turner chairman ted turner told a news conference that his cable 
news network would begin offering the daily 15minute program for 
schools cnn newsroom starting aug 14 
whittle is evaluating the results of the test of its news 
service channel one in hopes of expanding it nationally in the 
fall of 1990 
turner said he decided at the last minute against including any 
advertising because of some educators objections 
he said he had planned to allow corporate sponsors to buy time 
to deliver public service messages such as ones encouraging 
literacy and discouraging school dropouts and drug abuse but 
changed his mind today after discussions with education officials 
turner said the company was profitable and would absorb the 
multimilliondollar expense of the program 
helping students learn to cope with an increasingly complex 
and sometimes threatening world through daily news and information 
programming is a natural next step for us he said in a written 
statement 
representatives of cable operators telecommunications inc 
continental cablevision inc and jones intercable which serve 50 
million households said they would provide the turner service free 
of charge to schools in their areas 
in contrast to the whittle service turners does not envision 
major donations of video equipment and televisions to schools 
the program will be broadcast by cnn in the earlymorning hours 
recorded by the schools and shown to students during the day 
at the press conference cable networks arts amp entertainment 
cspan and the discovery channel said they planned to expand their 
own educational programming and see that cable operators provided 
it free to schools 
the knoxville tennbased whittle launched channel one a daily 
12minute news show with two minutes of paid advertising in six 
test schools march 6 the schools were each given about 50000 in 
video equipment tv monitors and satellite dishes in exchange for 
agreeing to run the program every school day 
some education groups have complained about the advertising on 
channel one saying students should not be subjected to paid 
pitches for candy bars jeans or anything else while they are in 
the classroom 
but many of the teachers and students involved in the test have 
said they considered the advertising a reasonable price to pay for 
the equipment and the topical programming 
turner has been involved for two years in a venture called 
news access that has made cnns the week in review program 
available to schools along with a detailed classroom guide with 
suggestions on how to use portions of the show in class 
cspan the discovery channel and arts amp entertainment each have 
previously made separate arrangements for sharing programs with 
schools 
but none of those efforts has drawn the attention that whittles 
channel one test did 
whittle is reviewing the results of the sevenweek test ended 
last week and hopes to decide by midsummer whether to make the 
program available nationally in as many as 10000 schools in the 
fall of 1990

a federal appeals court today refused to remove 
a roadblock to the final settlement of civil securities fraud 
charges against drexel burnham lambert inc 
the settlement drexel reached with the securities and exchange 
commission earlier this month has been blocked from final approval 
because of a legal challenge to the district judge presiding over 
the case 
the sec and drexel asked the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
to modify its stay of all proceedings before judge milton pollack 
in the drexel civil case to allow another judge to consider and 
possibly approve the settlement 
but the 2nd circuit said that decision does not rest with us 
and refused to intervene 
the decision means that the landmark settlement of civil 
securities fraud charges against the wall street investment giant 
remains in limbo 
resolution of the sec pact also is needed before drexel can 
formally plead guilty to six felonies and pay 650 million to 
settle criminal charges brought by the manhattan us attorneys 
office 
the appeals court declined to reconsider or clarify its ruling 
pending a possible us supreme court ruling on whether pollack 
should be removed from the case on grounds that he has a conflict 
of interest 
the 2nd circuit has issued a stay on all proceeding before 
pollack pending a decision by the supreme court which has not yet 
decided whether it will hear the appeal 
last week the sec and drexel sought to sidestep the stay by 
asking the 2nd circuit to let another judge handle the settlement 
but the 2nd circuit held that a decision to assign the case 
or any part of the of it to another judge rests with judge pollack 
or with those responsible for the assignment of cases at the 
district court level in new york 
indicted former drexel bond financier michael milken and his 
brother lowell sought to bar pollack because his wife had an 
interest in a company involved in a drexel transaction 
judge pollack is entitled to remain in this case absent a 
supreme court ruling to the contrary or new facts which would 
warrant his removal the appeals court said 
the milkens who were not included in the sec settlement also 
have appealed the criminal settlement alleging it illegally forces 
drexel to withhold their multimilliondollar 1988 salaries and 
dismiss them 
the twopage appeals court ruling appeared to put new pressure 
on pollack who refused drexels attempts to disqualify him to 
step aside 
so long as judge pollack remains assigned to this case we 
must accept his position as part of the status quo said the 2nd 
circuit 
it was in this context that we ruled earlier that the milken 
group has a right to have the supreme court determine whether judge 
pollack should remain in the case before he is allowed to consider 
a proposed settlement which may affect the interests of the milken 
group the threejudge panel said 
as part of its settlements with both the sec and the us 
attorneys office in manhattan drexel is required to fire michael 
milken and suspend his brother and not engage in business dealings 
with either brother

a 400 million blend of bigleague 
filming and hollywood stargazing debuts monday when floridas top 
entertainment resort opens the disneymgm studios theme park a 
135acre playground with diversions that range from doityourself 
music videos to a 1950s sitcom set 
the complex at walt disney world combines working movietv sound 
studios with backstage tours for the public a mixedmedia 
ridethrough show and other special effects adventures 
it is a theatrical environment that is very close to the 
original conception by walt disney michael eisner walt disney 
co chairman said in an interview its been on the shelf since 
the 1940s and is the culmination of a company dream this 
attraction is unlike anything else we have 
its all themed to the golden age of hollywood in the 1930s and 
1940s when tyrannical cigarchomping moguls ran studios and art 
deco dominated the building scape 
mom dad and the kids can walk through recreations of 
palmlined hollywood boulevard and grummans chinese theater peek 
at movies under production take a role in a television show make 
their own music videos get a screen test and rub elbows with the 
stars at the brown derby restaurant 
movie and tv production began last summer with the superboy 
syndicated tv series and parts of several largescreen films while 
construction continued on the tourist portion 
the event was preceded by glitzy parties and previews that 
included a television special a parade of famous hollywood actors 
and actresses on the boulevard and live tapings of a mew mickey 
mouse club tv series 
dick nunis president of walt disney attractions said he 
believes bringing a bit of hollywood to florida will reinvigorate 
the resort already visited annually by an estimated 25 million 
people that reportedly pump about 2 billion into the areas 
economy 
we talked of doing a studio tour when walt was alive said 
nunis weve wanted to do this for a long long time its a 
dream come true 
disney will get a years jump on some formidable competition in 
the highstakes family entertainment business in which the company 
founded by the late cartoonist has emerged as one of the undisputed 
leaders universal studios florida is building a rival 500 million 
complex to be finished next may 
just a few miles away universal is billed as the nations 
largest working studio outside of hollywood movie and tv 
production already is under way at the 440acre facility owned by 
mca inc and rank organization plc of london 
universal will feature what it calls a total experience of 
hollywoodstyle filmmaking to the public making the visitor a 
participant in the action it expects to attract up to 6 million 
visitors a year 
despite their wellpublicized rivalry disney and mca officials 
insist the competition is good for each other as well as florida 
where familyoriented entertainment has become one of the dominant 
industries 
weve always had competition from sea world busch gardens 
cape canaveral boardwalk and baseball and many others eisner 
said we welcome competition its good for central florida 
disney does things in its own way and we feel comfortable that we 
will have our niche in the community 
the disneymgm theme park is the centerpiece of a 1 
billionplus renaissance of the 27400acre resort in the pine 
woods and citrus groves of central florida once populated largely 
by alligators and armadillos before it opened 18 years ago 
not that a rebirth is needed 
were having a phenomenal year in both hotel occupancy and 
theme park attendance said disney world publicist charlie 
ridgway 
after achieving a record 34 billion in revenues and 522 
million in profits in fiscal 1988 disney has on tap a number of 
openings at its florida resort this year besides the studios 
on schedule to open this fall is part of what it calls the 
largest conventionhotel complex in the southeast making their 
debut this summer will be typhoon lagoon the worlds largest 
water park and the pleasure island nighttime entertainment 
district 
built for the teenage crowd nunis says typhoon lagoon will 
make all other water attractions as obsolete as disneyland made 
amusement parks in 1955 
were finally going to be able to make waves says nunis 
surfing a 100foot mountain a saltwater snorkling reef 
including sharks and other live critters in an enclosed area i 
can hardly wait to put on my bathing suit 
pleasure island is for those who still have energy left at the 
end of an exhausting day at the disneymgm studios park epcot 
center or the magic kingdom the complex of restaurants shops and 
nightclubs is built on a sixacre island at the disney village 
opening this fall is the 770room swan hotel which along with 
the larger dolphin hotel will form the lodging side of the 
conventionhotel complex near epcot center the 1500room dolphin 
is to open in july 1990 
the more modestly priced caribbean beach resort hotel opens an 
additional 800 rooms this summer for a total of 2112 the 907room 
grand floridian beach resort a luxury victorianstyle hotel 
opened last summer 
also set for completion this fall will be a new epcot pavilion 
the wonders of life featuring a simulated ride through the human 
bloodstream and a movie that takes a viewer from conception through 
birth 
all disneys doings are coming together during a busy start for 
florida tourism this year more than 34 million tourists visited 
the state in january an 186 percent increase over the first month 
of 1988 the florida department of commerce says 
state tourism officials predict the number of visitors will 
increase 6 percent this year that means the state would host 387 
million tourists vs 366 million in 1988 
disneys ridgway attributes the improved season to a generally 
strong us economy and a larger number of foreign tourists 
for local floridians disney worlds building spree is one of 
the main economic engines providing jobs 
one of disneys mostpopular spots is the employment office 
currently hiring 2500 new workers at a minimum pay of 5 an hour 
to help staff new attractions that will swell the disney complexs 
workforce to about 28000 nearly twice the level of eight years 
ago 
the new attractions also have prompted a 1 increase in oneday 
admission prices at the magic kingdom and epcot center and the 
introduction of a new fourday passport good at any of the three 
theme parks effective monday 
the new ticket will cost 94 for adults and 77 for children 3 
to 9 years old it provides unlimited admission to the three parks 
for four days new singleday admission prices for any one park 
will be 29 for adults and 23 for children

everbodys dressed in camouflage therere hundreds of people 
standing there clapping and cheering at the miners in the buses 
said a woman in the county clerks office who would not give her 
name youd never know this many people lived in dickenson 
county 
the escalation in the unions 3weekold strike against pittston 
has resulted in hundreds of arrests and a walkout by about 150 high 
school students since monday 
state police said at least 200 miners and relatives were 
arrested tuesday for sitting in the entrance and blocking traffic 
to and from a coal preparation plant union officials estimated the 
number at 380 
state police made several trips with at least four buses and 
several vans before they could remove the protesters and reopen the 
truck entrance to the plant some pickets were dragged across the 
road to the waiting buses 
about 200 miners were arrested monday during a sitdown at 
pittstons mcclure mine touching off a daylong rally at the 
dickenson county courthouse by the miners friends and relatives 
that closed downtown clintwood 
on tuesday about 150 students walked out of class at high 
schools in dickenson and wise counties to join the rally many of 
the youngsters wore camouflage the strike uniform worn by the 
miners and waved signs at passing cars and trucks 
despite the threat of suspension kim childers a senior at 
clintwood high school said she expects the protest to continue 
about 1700 umw members have been on strike at pittston mines in 
virginia and west virginia since april 5

calm the markets fears of an imminent rise in interest rates 
the trade report propelled the key financial timesstock 
exchange 100stock index briefly above the 2100point level the 
top of the recent trading range and an important level both 
psychologically and for those charting the markets progress

volume was relatively high with 5677 million shares changing 
hands compared with 5777 million shares on tuesday 
the government reported that britain had a current account 
deficit in march of 119 billion pounds or 2 billion this was 
considerably lower than februarys deficit of 17 billion pounds

some time noting that inflationary pressures in the economy could 
still force official interest rates higher at a later point

blimpie is going skimpy on calories 
the fastfood restaurant known for submarines heaped with meats 
and mayo said wednesday it is expanding the menu to include 
lowcalorie sandwiches and salads in an attempt to woo 
calorieconscious consumers who might otherwise be avoiding fast 
food 
industry analysts and nutritionists say the additions which 
include seafood turkey chicken and lowcalorie mayonnaise is a 
response to increased public interest in healthier food even 
though such traditional fastfoods as hamburgers and french fries 
remain king 
but experts also said past attempts at healthier fast food have 
produced mixed results even though most chains now offer salads or 
other light items 
we feel theres a mounting hunger for variety among the 
public said tony conza chairman of new yorkbased astor 
restaurant group inc blimpies parent 
the blimpie lites appeal to those customers we feel have 
abandoned fast food because of the calories conza said 
conza and other astor executives were in atlanta to unveil the 
new menu to georgia franchise operators the blimpie lite menu will 
be test marketed in georgia beginning in june and will be 
introduced in the chains 14 other states later in the year 
blimpies regular menu including 12 sandwiches as well as 
salads will remain in effect at the chains 350 outlets 
the new items developed with the bostonbased diet workshop 
chain of weightcontrol facilities each have less than 300 
calories they include tuna seafood and crab chicken turkey and 
tova fish stuffed into whole wheat pita bread or spread on a salad 
the sandwiches will have lowcalorie mayonnaise and the salads will 
have vinegar dressing 
it fits in with the whole movement in the food industry not 
just fast food to offer goodtasting lowcalorie lowfat 
items said jay freedman who follows the industry for the 
investment firm kidder peabody 
freedman said introduction of such items in fast food outlets 
has produced mixed results with a major flop being dlites a 
norcross gabased nutritious fast food chain that filed for 
bankruptcy in 1986 
people think about eating healthy but they do little about 
it he said clearly there hasnt been an acrosstheboard 
rampup of people buying only lowcalorie healthy foods 
my guess is the demographics of the average blimpie customer 
wont fit into someone who is calorie or fatconscious 
chris rosenbloom associate professor in the department of 
nutrition and dietetics at georgia state university said consumer 
demand has forced the fast food industry to offer alternatives to 
its basic menu items 
mrs rosenbloom also credited consumer groups such as the 
center for science in the public interest for alerting people to 
the content of fast food and noted many chains such as mcdonalds 
now have registered dietitians at the corporate level

a travel boom in the asiapacific region has 
touched off a scramble among us and asian airlines for business 
in a market growing at twice the pace elsewhere 
theres a competitive atmosphere in which government policy and 
underlying trade friction can have as much to do with an airlines 
bottom line as the allure of singapore airlines romantic 
advertising or the upgraded japanesespeaking service touted by 
united airlines 
some asian airlines complain at what they call unfair advantages 
enjoyed by united and northwest but they want equal privileges in 
the us market rather than to retaliate against the farflung 
networks of the big us carriers 
we dont fear the size of these big us carriers but were 
worried about the frequency of their stops in the southeast asia 
and pacific region said nares hovatanakul of thai airways 
international in bangkok we would like to see reciprocity not 
retaliation because that would not be fair business 
the thai spokesman said us government negotiators refused to 
permit more than five weekly flights by the thai carrier to seattle 
via tokyos narita international airport they wont lift this 
restriction and we feel that fair competition is halted he said 
everyone wants more landing rights especially in the united 
states and japan the japanus routes are the most lucrative 
heavily used by business travelers as well as by the fastgrowing 
number of japanese tourists 
us airlines meanwhile complain in varying degrees about poor 
japanese facilities and hindrances by the japanese government 
narita is the most congested airport in the world said 
clyde mcavoy continental airlines vice president for the far 
east he said narita only 10 years old and a new airport under 
construction at osaka were structured as very sophisticated 
nontariff barriers 
by pleading a lack of facilities japan in effect is in a 
position to curtail competition he said 
continentals tactic is to use the island of guam as a hub 
rather than narita to avoid naritas crowded checkin area the 
airline will pick up first and businessclass passengers at their 
tokyo hotels and drive them to narita in luxury vans checking them 
in during the ride 
such competitive wrinkles united offers a concierge to 
shepherd business and firstclass passengers reflect the 
scramble for wellheeled japanese travelers they are a wonderful 
consumer to do business with once you earn their loyalty said 
mcavoy 
statistics from 1987 the most recent year obtainable show 125 
million people arriving and departing japan on routes to the us 
mainland hawaii micronesia and southeast asia including hong 
kong the number of japanese travelers to the united states totaled 
17 million in 1986 and 24 million in the first 11 months of 1988 
an economic boom that extends to southeast asia is behind the 
increase in travel and its fueled by decisions in south korea and 
taiwan to permit their citizens to travel abroad more freely 
we see overall pacific travel growing 10 to 12 percent a 
year said bill speicher uniteds senior vice president for 
pacific operations and we believe it will continue indefinitely 
in the future while air traffic in the rest of the world is 
forecast to grow about 5 percent a year 
united has aggressively sought permission to fly the 
chicagotokyo route nonstop but was recently turned down by the 
us transportation department the issue will come up in 
usjapan talks on air rights scheduled for midmay 
what will japans attitude be norifumi ide deputy director for 
international air transport in japans ministry of transport said 
the two countries airlines are now balanced on the route japan 
air lines and northwest each can fly chicagotokyo nonstop 
ide hinted japan will reject uniteds request though there 
might be some flexibility if washington permits japanese cargo 
flights on the chicago route 
us companies flying tigers and northwest have enjoyed a 
monopoly for many years in that important cargo market ide said 
we always table it in usjapan negotiations it is a symbol 
of the imbalanced relationship in favor of the us 
uniteds speicher speaking in a telephone interview from 
hawaii implied a willingness to see more competition than the us 
government now permits 
we will have to find ways in negotiations to accommodate both 
sides speicher said 
japan air lines which carried 12 million transpacific 
passengers in the first half of fiscal 1988 a 103 percent 
increase over the comparable period a year earlier urges that 
competition not be unleashed as happened in the deregulated us 
aviation market 
the industry would be dragged into the chaos of price wars and 
oversupply jal board member yoshiyasu mayumi warned in a recent 
speech 
the transport ministry has a chart showing us airlines with 
all the advantages 19 us gateway cities to 11 permitted to 
japanese carriers five points in japan to three used by japanese 
transpacific flights nine beyond points in asia for us 
carriers but only one rio de janeiro permitted to japanese 
airlines flying to the united states seven us airlines compared 
with three japanese 380 us flights in and out of japan each week 
to 210 for japanese airlines 
one transport ministry official asking not to be named 
criticized what he called predatory american carriers coming in 
and ripping off our backyard 
the americans disagree northwests tokyo spokesman doug 
killian said that japan air lines also uses narita for a hub to 
southeast asia and other points so there is a similar route 
pattern to the us airlines we dont feel like everything is 
balanced in favor of the us carriers 
northwest is embarking on what it calls its most aggressive 
singleyear route expansion in the 42 years it has operated in 
the pacific launching six new pacific routes it was the first to 
bring the new boeing 747400 jumbo to tokyo where it was blessed 
by a shinto priest

the haggard wraith at changi international 
airport didnt have to speak his gray unshaven face and rumpled 
clothes signaled bad news for my attempt to fly to london without a 
confirmed reservation 
ive been here three days he said as we hung around the 
transfer desk with dozens of people begging for seats out of 
singapore to london frankfurt bombay tokyo and elsewhere 
days later when i was close to resolving my problem a 
singapore airlines agent advised dont pay for a ticket unless 
you get a confirmed reservation 
but what if plans change i had a confirmed reservation to 
london earlier but stayed in thailand a few days longer than 
expected now i was waylaid in an airport with the same name as the 
famed japanese pow camp of world war ii 
my unshaven companion a west german said he had suffered a 
minor injury while vacationing in thailand i decided it was best 
to go home right away he said he reached singapore easily but 
got stuck trying for a seat to frankfurt 
what do you do here for three days 
no clothes no shave just wait he said 
an hour later came news that i and 27 other standbys wouldnt be 
flying to london that night on singapore airlines the plane was 
full like nine of 11 flights i took in four weeks of travel on 
asian airlines starting from tokyo up and down southeast asia on 
to london and back to tokyo via singapore 
statistics show travel in asia on a steep up curve and i can 
vouch for that airports were jammed tourism in the region may be 
held back only by a shortage of planes and airport gates 
when my thai airways international airbus landed on the tropical 
paradise island of phuket the first big rush was not to the 
sparkling beaches but to the airport desk to reconfirm your seat 
out essential if you want peace of mind while watching the sunset 
over the andaman sea 
back to changi i decided not to be a prisoner of the airport 
though i started to wonder when my first five choices of hotel were 
all full finally a room was available and i spent two days 
exploring singapore before i got a standby seat to london 
why are the planes so full i asked during a visit to a 
singapore airlines ticket office 
people want to have a good time now now they have money 
the agent replied as if tomorrow the bubble would burst

minorco sa said wednesday enough shareholders have 
accepted its hostile 6 billion bid for consolidated gold fields 
plc to give the south africancontrolled bidder a majority stake 
and another three weeks to proceed with the offer 
if it hadnt won the majority stake minorcos offer the 
equivalent of 35 billion pounds would have expired at 1 pm 
wednesday 
we are naturally pleased at the markets judgement and will 
now consider very carefully what action to take said chairman 
sir michael edwardes said 
gold fields chairman rudolph agnew responded we dont believe 
that it is in the interests of gold fields and its shareholders for 
minorco to gain control we dont intend to be swayed from our 
responsibilities by the bullyboy tactics of minorco 
the takeover of the british gold mining giant would be britains 
largest corporate acquisition ever the battle has been a 
protracted and expensive one 
minorco the luxembourgbased investment arm of the south 
african oppenheimer familys gold and diamond mining interests 
said it had counted acceptances from holders of 5321 million gold 
fields shares representing 249 percent of all gold fields stock 
together with the nearly 30 percent already owned by minorco 
the acceptances bring its stake to 5484 percent or 11716 million 
shares 
that means that under british takeover regulations minorco now 
has 21 days to clear up any other outstanding conditions on the bid 
principal among these is the lifting of a preliminary injunction 
issued by a us court that bars minorco from purchasing more than 
30 percent of gold fields shares 
on monday the us court refused to lift the injunction which 
arose from an antitrust suit 
the us antitrust litigation will proceed to a full 
trial agnew said wednesday 
minorco has twice sweetened its offer since it first launched it 
in september it currently is offering half a minorco share and 
1175 pounds in cash for every gold fields share 
gold fields has fought the offer vigorously offering its 
shareholders a special dividend if it doesnt meet it own earnings 
targets it has raised concerns about the concentration of control 
over the worlds gold supplies and potential harmful effects to 
gold fields from being owned by a south africancontrolled company 
minorco is 60 percent owned by anglo american corp and de beers 
consolidated mines ltd the oppenheimers gold and diamond mining 
giants

xerox corp chose national secretarys day to 
unveil what it calls the worlds quietest ribbon typewriter a 
machine nearly as quiet as a computer keyboard 
the typewriters introduced wednesday use a patented technology 
that gives the printer heads the vibrational characteristics of a 
hammer weighing nearly 35 pounds xerox said that makes them 
vibrate at a pitch nearly six octaves lower than usual almost 
inaudible to the human ear 
the quiet typewriters could help xerox take some business from 
international business machines corp the market leader in 
topoftheline typewriters for fortune 1000 companies said julie 
voss a consultant at venture development corp in natick mass 
the big question is whether customers will pay the extra 300 
xerox is asking for the feature said anthony polifrone a vice 
president of buyers laboratory in hackensack nj 
theres no doubt that the machine is incredibly quiet he 
said 
xerox is the traditional no 2 in the bigbusiness market 
although it fell to third in 1988 because of a big federal 
government order to an importer of japanesemade typewriters 
the xerox 62 series typewriters have six patents and five more 
pending which should make it impossible for competitors to copy 
the noisereducing characteristics said andrew gabor the inventor 
gabor is the coinventor of the daisywheel printer system which 
was brought to market in 1972 when he was at diablo systems his 
company was acquired by xerox a short time later he is a senior 
research fellow at xeroxs palo alto research center in silicon 
valley 
gabor at a news conference wednesday demonstrated a 1960sera 
ibm selectric with a golf balltype head noisy two earlier 
models of xerox memorywriters with daisywheels quieter and the 
new 62 series soft clacking 
thermal printing typewriters in which marks are burned onto the 
page are even quieter than the new xerox models but they have 
drawbacks such as the inability to handle carbons and multipart 
forms xerox said its research found 65 percent of all secretarial 
typing involves multipart forms 
the 6225 model is 1995 and the 6240 model which includes a 
disk drive for memory storage is 2595 xerox said those prices 
are about 300 above corresponding models that are noisier 
xerox said the 62 series produces 52 decibels at 20 characters 
per second which it said is 15 decibels less than other designs 
ms voss using different decibel numbers said the xerox models 
would displace canons ap 800 as the quiet champion 
the lower vibrational pitch is achieved by rigidly connecting 
the print tip to several heavy elements inside the typewriter 
including a connecting rod and print bail the greater mass 
produces a lower tone much as a thick long piano wire produces a 
lower tone than a thin short one 
gabor said patent examiners were so incredulous about the 
achievement that they demanded a demonstration which gabor and 
others gave in a hotel conference room in washington

the president of koito manufacturing co demanded 
wednesday that us takeover specialist t boone pickens jr 
disclose whether he is the real owner of the shares he is using to 
claim management rights as koitos largest shareholder 
three weeks ago pickens bought 202 percent of the shares of 
koito an auto parts manufacturer closely linked with toyota motor 
in a highly publicized visit to tokyo last week he demanded 
management rights as a shareholder in a direct challenge to deeply 
entrenched japanese business convention which generally abhors 
anything that smacks of a hostile takeover 
in a letter to pickens koito president takao matsuura said 
substantial questions have been raised concerning the nature of 
boone cos ownership of koito shares questions which you have 
pointedly declined to answer in your recent statements to the 
press 
matsuura noted that speculation concerning whether boone co 
is in fact the real owner of these shares subject to the full 
economic risk of its investment 
in the letter matsuura declined to answer pickens earlier 
written request for three seats on koitos board of directors until 
pickens disclosed whether he had an option repurchase or security 
agreement with a japanese shareholder 
the japanese press has speculated pickens may have an agreement 
to sell back the block of shares he bought from kitaro watanabes 
azabu motors co to bring profits both to himself and the company 
such an agreement would allow watanabe to use pickens 
internationally known name to up the ante in a greenmail bid 
against toyota motor which owns 191 percent of koito the press 
reports suggested 
an agreement for azabu motors to buy back the shares at a fixed 
price would protect pickens from a loss 
in corporate greenmail an investor aqcuires a large block of a 
companys shares threatening to take it over the greenmailer then 
profits when a friendly company saves the target company by buying 
the shares at a higher price 
pickens has denied any greenmail effort in the koito share 
purchase 
analysts say the negative reaction of the tokyo markets to 
pickens action is reflected in the share price of koito which 
closed wednesday at 4350 yen or 3321 down from a 5470 yen 
high the week before pickens purchase and below the 4830 yen 
price shortly after the purchase was announced 
in the united states share prices usually rise when there is a 
greenmail attempt

the board of goodman fielder wattie 
ltd said wednesday it had rejected as inadequate a 24 billion 
takeover offer from ranks hovis mcdougall plc of britain 
the directors said in a statement the bid doesnt reflect the 
underlying value of the company 
they also said a takeover by ranks hovis would result in the 
loss of effective australasian control over vital elements of the 
local food industry goodman fielder wattie is the biggest food 
processor in australia and new zealand 
the board also called the offer highly conditional and 
criticized the fact it is denominated in british pounds and would 
expose shareholders to exchangerate movements 
the directors also said ranks hovis has not clarified its 
intentions about possible asset sales and the future of goodman 
fielder watties 20000 employees 
ranks hovis said wednesday it had raised its stake in goodman 
fielder wattie to 149 percent through purchases on stock markets 
in australia and london 
the british companys offer to buy goodman fielder wattie is 
worth 31 million australian dollars 
ranks hovis said it would offer stock valued at 307 australian 
dollars per share for goodman fielder the offer is four new ranks 
hovis shares for every 11 goodman fielder shares and a cash 
alternative of 271 australian dollars a share on the full bid 
ranks hovis offer was conditioned on it gaining acceptance for 
at least 50 percent of goodman fielder shares and australian 
government approval

jefferies has given the government information for several 
indictments in exchange for leniency in his sentencing on two 
felonies he was the main witness in the gaf corp stock 
manipulation case which has twice ended in a mistrial a major 
setback for the government 
if they go after a second major case and lose it theyve got a 
real problem said harvey j goldschmid a securities law 
professor at columbia university law school 
bilzerian is accused of conspiring with jefferies who ran a los 
angeles brokerage bearing his name to violate securities laws in 
the attempted takeovers of cluett peabody amp co hammermill paper 
co and hh robertson co and a stock sale in armco inc in 
1985 and 1986 
the deals all included stock arrangements that have been chased 
by the securities and exchange commission for years but gained 
prominence during the scandals that engulfed the business world in 
the mid1980s 
stock parking refers to the sale or transfer of securities to 
conceal true ownership and avoid federal disclosure or tax laws 
under a typical parking arrangement someone buys stock with the 
secret understanding that the real owner will repurchase it at a 
set later date 
while parking itself is not defined anywhere as a crime any 
willful violation of the 1934 securities and exchange act can 
be prosecuted criminally 
i might give stock to you if i was going to antarctica for 
two years and i wanted it safely kept said sam scott miller a 
new york securities lawyer theres no crime if were not trying 
to evade disclosure or tax requirements 
the parking charges in the bilzerian case allege the tampa 
fla investor sought to conceal his level of ownership to mask 
possible takeover bids sec laws require public disclosure when 5 
percent of a company is acquired 
other cases including plea deals made by jefferies and 
imprisoned inside trader ivan boesky have charged violators with 
temporarily swapping stock for cash to allow them to take positions 
larger than their capital base would permit 
but defense lawyers maintain the government is attempting to 
criminalize highly technical securities regulations a tactic one 
attorney equated with trying to shoot a butterly with a cannon 
they say such violations should be dealt with by the sec which 
has the power to levy huge fines and ban brokerdealers from the 
securities business for life 
its against the law but people had never thought of that as 
something that should be prosecuted as a crime as opposed to 
something that should be dealt with by regulators said gandolfo 
v diblasi a new york securities litigator 
added arthur f mathews bilzerians lawyer the government is 
trying to stretch and make criminal something that has never been 
prosecuted before criminally 
parking activities have been included in the secs case against 
drexel burnham lambert inc the manhattan us attorneys office 
indictment of drexel financier michael milken as well as the boesky 
and jefferies cases 
it will have a high courtroom profile in the bilzerian case and 
the racketeering and fraud cases against defunct princetonnewport 
partners lp and milken which charge overlapping parking schemes 
the line between civil and criminal law is wavy in this 
area said columbias goldschmid 
fundamentally if something nasty is being done in terms of the 
parking it seems legitimate to criminalize the area he said 
the problem is that too extensive a use of the criminal law may 
trivialize enforcement 
bilzerians january 1988 takeover of stamford connbased 
singer is not mentioned in the indictment he has denied all 
charges and faces a maximum five years in jail and 250000 fine on 
each count 
since becoming chairman of singer blizerian has gradually 
dismantled the defense contractor selling off its 12 operating 
units and making an estimated 100 million above his acquisition 
costs

bausch amp lomb inc the worlds leading 
maker of contact lenses has decided that its not a good idea to 
wear extendedwear soft contact lenses continuously for more than a 
week without removing and cleaning them 
wednesdays announcement may be the first indication that the 
end is near for the soft contact lens that can be worn for long 
periods of time 
i think youll see the fda come out with a similar policy very 
soon said dr michael lemp professor and chairman of the center 
for sight at georgetown medical school in washington 
extendedwear lenses first introduced in 1984 are currently 
approved by the federal drug administration for continuous wear of 
up to 30 days there are about 46 million americans who wear 
extendedwear lenses 
lemp said a recent as yet unpublished study conducted at the 
massachusetts eye and ear infirmary in boston has indicated that 
the longer lenses are worn continuously the greater the risk to 
the eyeballs outer coating the cornea 
my own impression is that people have been shying away from 
extendedwear lenses for a long time because of safety concerns 
lemp said wednesday this announcement says that seven days is an 
acceptable time period 
a spokeswoman at the fda in rockville md said the agency was 
reviewing its policy about extendedwear lenses and would probably 
issue a statement next week 
but carol herman a spokeswoman in an fda office that is 
concerned with the safe use of medical devices said the agency is 
drafting a letter urging the nations eight major contact lens 
makers to voluntarily change their labels and packaging to reflect 
a sevenday instead of a 30day maximum 
the question of the safety of extendedwear lenses has been 
hotly debated in the eye care industry for the past five years 
our review of the research tells us that the risk of 
complication increases at longerwearing periods said hal 
johnson president of the professional products division at bausch 
amp lomb 
the company sent a telegram to 30000 ophthalmologists and 
optometrists around the country monday recommending that 
extendedwear lenses only be prescribed for seven days continuous 
use rather than 30 days 
we believe that successful wear is most easily achieved within 
the sevenday window were saying at or before seven days the 
lenses should be removed cleaned and disinfected said johnson 
the muchtalked about boston study which examined both 
dailywear and extendedwear soft contact lenses has been 
completed but is being examined by statisticians to ensure 
accuracy said regina kilfoyle a spokesman the eye and ear 
infirmary a hospital affiliated with harvard medical school 
results from the study have been made available to contact lens 
makers and some eye doctors but they have not been published and 
are still being confirmed she said

the stock market drifted in a narrow range today 
in an inconclusive response to the latest data on the state of the 
economy 
the commerce department reported this morning that the nations 
gross national product rose at a 55 percent annual rate after 
adjustment for inflation in the first quarter of the year 
without the effects of last years drought however the agency 
said the growth rate would have been just 3 percent 
so analysts concluded that the figures provided support for the 
belief that economic growth lately has been losing momentum as the 
federal reserve has sought to restrain inflation 
but the inflation figures that accompanied the gnp report were 
not so encouraging brokers said indicating that prices were still 
rising at a 5 percent to 55 percent annual rate

to pittstons lambert fork mine near dante said lt jd willis of 
the virginia state police 
we took them away in buses and tried to disembark them for 
processing at several places in dickenson county but were turned 
away because of crowd control problems willis said 
miners also blocked both entrances to pittstons moss no 3

leaving space for passenger cars but not coal trucks state police 
sealed off the road and called two tow trucks whose drivers 
refused to tow away the cars

disobedience tactics largely blocking roads and mine entrances 
went into effect monday

a claim pittston denies 
the umw was joined monday by 750 westmoreland coal co workers 
the union called off the job for three of the 10 memorial days 
or personal days permitted under their contract 
the union also has called selective strikes monday at three 
nonpittston operations in west virginia about 100 miners are 
striking gilbert imported hardwoods inc and lynn land co in mingo 
county and belva coal co in logan county

in the 1988 fourth quarter 
robert ryan senior trader for irving trust co said the

union carbide corp shareholders on wednesday 
soundly rejected a proposal that the company provide humanitarian 
relief to bhopal india where a 1984 gas leak from a company plant 
killed more than 3000 people 
that should be the last of the direct financial effects of the 
bhopal tragedy robert d kennedy chairman and chief executive 
officer of union carbide said after an orderly twohour meeting 
in their first meeting since the company reached a 470 million 
damage settlement with the indian government in february 
shareholders also approved formation of a holding company and 
establishment of its domestic and plastics business as a 
whollyowned subsidiary 
but most of the focus wednesday was on the settlement which 
protesters decried as inadequate 
the dec 23 1984 leak of poisonous methyl isocyanate gas from 
a union carbide chemical plant in bhopal left an estimated 20000 
people injured according to government statistics activist groups 
cite figures of 4000 dead and 200000 injured 
the supreme court of india on feb 14 directed the danbury 
connbased company to pay 470 million in full settlement of all 
claims rights and liabilities related to and arising out of the 
bhopal gas disaster 
minority shareholders including churchaffiliated groups had 
introduced a resolution urging that the company take additional 
steps to provide immediate humanitarian relief to india but it was 
rejected by 93 percent of the voting shareholders 
shareholders also rejected a resolution to sell union carbides 
south african holdings 
kennedy said the company had attempted to provide additional 
direct aid to the people of bhopal but the government rejected the 
effort protesters including three bhopal victims touring the 
country to draw support for their cause said the settlement amount 
was inadequate 
about a dozen protesters displayed banners and distributed 
information outside before the meeting and several shareholders 
called for additional company aid during the meeting 
we are here to tell that this settlement has been rejected by 
the people of bhopal said satinath sarangi who later was 
arrested along with three others for trying to enter the hyatt 
regency hotel and distribute contradictory reports on the accident 
they do not accept it because they know that this amount is 
insufficient to meet the health care requirements of victims 
sarangi said to accept such a settlement is to accept certain 
death and they are not prepared to accept it 
the settlement is on appeal and its distribution is being 
withheld by the government union carbide said 
kennedy said the company was securing the protesters release 
from jail and was not involved in their arrests he apologized for 
the incident and offered to meet with them later 
the end of litigation does not mean that bhopal is 
forgotten kennedy said although we have evidence to prove 
that a bhopal employee of union carbide india ltd sabotaged the 
plant we know the tragedy will always be linked in peoples minds 
with union carbide corp 
the shareholderapproved restructuring designed for more 
efficient use of union carbides multinational operations creates 
a subsidiary to be called union carbide chemicals and plastics 
company inc it joins two other core subsidiaries created in 
january union carbide industrial gases inc and ucar carbon 
company inc 
the change was approved by more than 85 percent of the voting 
shares 
kennedy said the restructuring would give management at each 
subsidiary more flexibility and authority to respond to changing 
markets

holdout in south africa may have bowed to political and financial 
pressure to disinvest its holdings at firesale prices after 90 
years of doing business in that country published reports said 
wednesday 
business day of johannesburg quoted banking and other sources as 
confirming the sale by mobil of about 400 million in assets for 
150 million to trek the largest privately owned oil company in 
south africa 
the local financial daily also said the mobil properties would 
be sold in separate deals over a period of time 
mobil representatives in south africa and the united states 
remained silent about the reports jack lord spokesman for mobil 
at its new york headquarters said wednesday the company had no 
comment 
wed heard rumors theyd been doing contingency plans for 
withdrawal said diane bratcher a spokeswoman for the interfaith 
center on corporate responsibility a new yorkbased church group 
that pressures american companies to leave south africa it sort 
of flies in the face of everything theyve been saying 
news of the possible sale sent trek shares soaring 153 percent 
from monday to tuesday on the johannesburg stock exchange trek is 
a subsidiary of general mining union corp a south africa mining 
conglomerate 
mobil employs almost 2800 people in south africa and has been a 
symbol of foreign business reluctance to leave the country despite 
widespread condemnation of the whiteminority governments 
suppression of the black majority in the system known as apartheid 
partly because of south africas race policies more than 170 
american companies have withdrawn over the last four years most 
have sold their operations at low prices to south 
africancontrolled business 
since exxon corp the largest us oil concern pulled out of 
south africa in 1986 mobil had insisted it would not bow to 
pressure to disinvest despite pressure on the company by 
antiapartheid groups in the united states 
at least two shareholder resolutions exhorting mobil to vacate 
south africa are on the agenda at the companys annual meeting 
scheduled for may 11 
the star of johannesburg the nations largest daily reported 
that industry sources confirmed mobil was selling its south 
african assets for an estimated 500 million rand roughly 125 
million 
the citizen another johannesburg daily quoted local and 
overseas sources as saying that mobil was considering 
disinvesting the paper said mobil is the largest nonsouth african 
controlled employer in the country with 1000 gasoline stations a

the federal communications commission on 
wednesday granted media magnate rupert murdochs request to 
transfer his boston televison station to a trust to comply with 
crossownership rules 
the fcc in a 30 vote said murdochs twentieth holdings corp 
could turn over uhf station wfxt in boston where murdochs news 
america publishing owns the boston herald to trustees edward w 
brooke the former us senator from massachusetts and hugh l 
carey the former new york governor 
but the commission said that to assure the station was properly 
insulated from murdoch and his affiliate companies which 
include the 20th century fox film and tv operations twentieth 
holdings could not have approval of any possible sale of the 
station 
the commission also said the station could not use programming 
from the fox tv network of stations or be an affiliate of that 
network 
the commission said its no communications standard for broadcast 
trusts was well established when twentieth bought the station in 
1986 and that any communication between the trustees and any 
twentieth affiliate no matter how limited is prohibitedng 
contracts expire 
fox has 60 days to comply it also could ask the fcc to 
reconsider appeal to the courts or ask for a commission hearing on 
the conditions or it could divest the property 
attorneys for murdoch did not immediately return a call seeking 
comment 
under terms of the transfer murdoch will relinquish control but 
still receive profits the trust will expire if wfxt shares are 
sold if the station stops operations or if the boston herald is 
sold the trustees also must use their best efforts to sell the 
shares to one buyer and the price must exceed 35 million 
the station has been valued at between 30 million and 50 
million 
murdoch engaged in a bitter battle with congress in 1987 over 
his ownership of the two boston media outlets as well as his 
ownership of the new york post and wnywtv in new york 
sens ernest hollings dsc and edward kennedy dmass had 
pushed a measure through congress in the waning hours of 1987 
prohibiting the fcc from eliminating or modifying the 
crossownership rules and barring it from extending any waivers to 
the rules 
the herald at the time which had been editorializing against 
kennedy called his congressional action a vendetta 
the fcc had given murdoch a waiver allowing him to own both 
boston outlets until june 30 1988 
a federal appeals court overturned the congressional action but 
murdoch decided to seek fcc permission to transfer the station to 
the trust the fcc gave him another extension while it considered 
the request 
murdoch through his australianbased news corp owns extensive 
newspaper holdings in europe north america and australasia

airport congestion deteriorating service 
rising fares and concern about safety have intensified pressure on 
the federal government to reregulate the us airline industry 
economist alfred e kahn said wednesday 
kahn widely regarded as the primary architect of the 
governments october 1987 deregulation of airline fares and routes 
also said there could be a partial reregulation of the industry 
kahn said the publics appraisal of the industry was a mixed 
bag while deregulation has brought cheaper fares and opened air 
travel to larger numbers of americans it also has created 
congestion and delays he said 
clearly we have been delinquent in failing to expand 
supply kahn told a luncheon organized by new york universitys 
cv starr center for applied economics 
more airport capacity and better air traffic control are needed 
but deregulation actually has been accompanied by a decline in the 
number of federal flight inspectors he said 
kahn said it was difficult to know whether strikebound eastern 
airlines would be able to compete rebuilt as a smaller carrier as 
its managers recently proposed 
eastern has been operating a drastically reduced schedule since 
a march 4 strike by its machinists joined by its pilots and flight 
attendants unions several buyout offers have been made but none 
have been acceptable to parent texas air corp which has indicated 
it would reorganize the airline into a roughly onethird smaller 
carrier 
it is possible for small compact airlines to find niches 
he said in response to a question but he said it was difficult to 
see what easterns niche could be and how it could compete such 
against expanding rivals as delta air lines and american airlines 
the race seems to be going to the big airlines said kahn a 
former chairman of the civil aeronautics board 
unlike the airlines other deregulated industries such as 
telecommunications and financial markets appear unlikely targets of 
reregulation kahn suggested 
i dont see any possibility of putting the technological genie 
back in the bottle the faith in the market continues 
unabated he said however if there were a deep economic 
depression all bets are off he said

trading wednesday with gasoline prices continuing to rise amid 
uncertainty over summer supplies

7812 cents a gallon on the new york mercantile exchange other

heating oil contracts also declined with may down 110 cents to

bullish news for the market the report showed that gasoline 
inventories fell by more than 2 million barrels in the week ending

general electric co has been awarded a 
750 million contract to build a power plant in japan that will 
become the worlds largest combinedcycle power plant the 
companys top executive announced wednesday 
this is the largest fossil generation order ever for ge ge 
chairman john f welch jr told shareholders during the companys 
annual stockholders meeting here 
tokyo electric power co a privately owned utility awarded the 
contract to ge once in operation the combinedcycle power plant 
will be capable of generating 2600 megawatts of power 600 
megawatts more than the worlds largest combinedcycle plant 
currently in operation welch said 
combinedcycle power plants use the exhaust heat from a gas 
turbine to generate steam which in turn drives a steam turbine 
thus generating power from energy that would have been wasted 
the power plant is scheduled to begin commercial service in the 
tokyo area in the mid1990s 
all eight of the proposed power plants gas turbines will be 
manufactured in ges greenville plant and the eight steam turbines 
and hydrogencooled generators will be manufactured in ges 
facilities in schenectady ny 
the order from toyko electric comes on the heels on a 250 
million order from duke power co in march 
during the shareholders meeting held amid heavy security and 
marked with often heated exchanges among ge executives and 
shareholderactivists welch said the company would try to become 
simpler faster and more selfconfident during the 1990s 
ge which employs about 298000 workers worldwide reported 
sales of 50 billion in 1988 profits for the year were 39 
billion slightly less than the gross national product of costa 
rica 
ge is one of the best corporations to direct the attack on 
nuclear weapons because its one of the largest manufacturers of 
nuclear weapons said bill stuart whistler a former ge employee 
now with an organization called infact 
the bostonbased group initiated a boycott against nestle foods 
corp several years ago and is now promoting a boycott against ges 
involvement in the manufacture of nuclear weapons 
at the shareholders meeting infact requested that ges board of 
directors play an active role to ensure that the company conduct 
itself more ethically 
the group asked ges board to provide information to the public 
on ges activities that dramatically impact on our health and 
lives and participate in public forums to address those issues

the government reported wednesday the us 
economy topped the 5 trillion mark for the first time last 
quarter powered by a strong 55 percent growth rate that caused 
some analysts to express concern about rising inflation 
even discounting for a statistical bounceback from the 1988 
drought a major factor in the overall increase the gross national 
product grew at a solid 3 percent annual rate during the 
januarymarch period the commerce department reported 
the stock markets response was inconclusive with stock values 
drifting in a narrow range the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
edged up 220 to 2388911 
j antonio villamil chief economist for the commerce 
department said the economys performance in the first quarter 
appears to be consistent with moderate sustainable growth for 
the balance of the year and contains no threat of a recession 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said the growth pattern in 
which the pace of consumer spending slowed while exports and 
business investment rose was a desirable one for the 
sustainability of the economic expansion 
private analysts cautioned however that the report offered 
some troubling indications that inflation was accelerating 
a gnp index that measures prices for a fixed marketbasket of 
goods and services rose at an annual rate of 5 percent in the first 
quarter up from 42 percent during the previous three months 
while half of the increase was linked to a pay raise for 
government employees certainly it suggests were in a period of 
accelerating inflation said economist david jones of aubrey g 
lanston amp co in new york 
robert g dederick chief economist for northern trust co in 
chicago said the economys strong growth in the first quarter was 
too much of a good thing 
the report suggested that the economy was still growing at a 
rate too fast for comfort and the manifestation of this was in the 
inflation figure dederick said no matter what you look at 
the inflation worry is there 
villamil said that discounting the effects of the pay raise and 
recent food and energy price increases the underlying inflation 
rate seems to be holding at a stable lower level of about 4 or 4 
percent 
the nations total output reached an annual rate of 5117 
trillion last quarter before adjusting for inflation the first 
time it had exceeded 5 trillion after adjusting for price 
increases the gnp rose at an annual rate of 4088 trillion last 
quarter up 548 billion from the previous quarter 
the 55 percent annual rate of growth was the highest since a 
61 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1987 
it reflected an improvement in the trade deficit after two 
negative quarters as exports rose 106 percent while imports 
advanced just 23 percent and a strong 96 percent increase in 
business investment 
some signs of a softening in economic growth were evident as 
well in a 36 percent decline in housing construction and a slim 
13 percent increase in consumer spending the slowest growth in a 
year 
the droughtdiscounted figure for the overall economy a growth 
rate of 3 percent was down only slightly from the 35 percent 
pace at which the nonfarm economy grew during the final three 
months of 1988 when the droughts effects are added in the 
countrys total output of goods and services grew at a 24 percent 
pace during the fourth quarter 
richard rahn chief economist for the us chamber of commerce 
said the spending patterns were of just the right mix to prolong 
the economic expansion without causing prices to surge 
clearly 3 percent economic growth is sustainable and does not 
add to inflationary pressures he said 
while the overall gnp figure for the first quarter was a strong 
one a series of government reports that chronicle monthly economic 
activity suggest that growth began to slow as the threemonth 
period progressed 
most analysts expect the economy to cool further as the year 
continues in response to a yearlong campaign by the federal reserve 
board to restrain inflation by driving up interest rates and 
dampening demand 
within the quarter the economys growth apparently slowed 
dramatically dederick said unless the economy begins to get 
some new fuel in the second quarter the growth is likely to be a 
lot slower 
some analysts worry that the feds antiinflation campaign may 
prove so potent that it unintentionally pushes the country into a 
recession late this year or early in 1989 but others are 
optimistic the central bank will be able to restrain growth just 
enough to control prices without halting the expansion 
many analysts expect growth for the year overall to be around 
27 percent down significantly from the 39 percent recorded in 
1988 and also below the bush administrations forecast of 32 
percent

pollutioncontrol devices which account for a third of the metals 
use worldwide

ncnb corp chairman hugh mccoll said wednesday 
that his bank may bid for 20 troubled banks formerly owned by 
dallasbased mcorp two days after dropping its unsolicited offer 
for citizens and southern corp 
at a news conference following ncnbs annual shareholders 
meeting mccoll said the company had been invited by the federal 
deposit insurance corp to enter the bidding for the troubled texas 
banks which were placed in federal receivership last month 
following heavy real estate and energy losses mcorp itself still 
operates five banks in texas 
we dont think we have an edge but we already have 1100 
people running a bank for the fdic mccoll said we feel we 
could do the same for some of their other asset problems 
just four months ago ncnb effectively doubled its size when it 
was selected by the fdic to acquire the largest bank in texas 
first republicbank corp also of dallas it renamed the bank ncnb 
texas national bank 
francis buddy kemp chairman of ncnb texas national bank 
said acquiring the former mcorp banks was one of several 
possibilities for ncnb to expand into new markets in texas 
there are several markets in which we would like to build on 
our strength he said houston and san antonio are areas where 
wed like to have more strength 
tim hartman a vice chairman of ncnb texas said ncnb remained 
several weeks away from making a bid for the former mcorp banks 
ncnb is north carolinas largest bank with more than 50 billion 
in assets 
if the deal with citizens and southern had gone through it 
would have been the largest bank merger in us history and created 
a bank with more than 70 billion in assets 
ncnb launched its 24 billion stockswap bid for citizens and 
southern on march 30 but it withdrew the offer monday after 
running into a solid wall of resistance from the atlanta banks 
board of directors 
they rejected our offer for reasons im sure were entirely 
clear to them mccoll told shareholders although theyre not 
entirely clear to me

business operations during the pending bankruptcy case 
malcolm l sherman chairman of regina said the companys 
primary secured lenders have agreed to interim financing as a

democrats on the house banking committee 
overrode objections from the bush administration and voted 
wednesday to force the troubled savings and loan indusry to 
subsidize home buying by poor people 
with four democrats joining 20 republicans in opposition the 
panel voted 2724 to require the 12 regional federal home loan 
banks to set aside 5 percent of their profits to provide 
lowinterest loans for housing the working poor 
the amendment sponsored by the committee chairman rep henry 
b gonzalez dtexas would provide about 75 million a year for 
four years and more per year after that consumer groups said 
thats enough to give 500000 home buyers a 2 percentage point 
break on their mortgages 
the regional banks although created by the federal government 
are owned by the sampl industry and pass their profits on to 
individual sampls republicans argued that the regional banks are 
already being tapped to pay for part of the industrys bailout and 
that further demands will only hurt the chances for restoring the 
ailing industry to health 
to play social games with this legislation at this point in 
time i think would jeopardize confidence in the system said 
rep jim leach riowa 
democrats however said the gonzalez amendment amounted to a 
modest subsidy to the poor in a bill that was providing more than 
100 billion to protect sampl depositors and said without it there 
was little reason for a separate savings industry 
if we dont subsidize lowincome housing theyre going to be 
the only people who dont get subsidized in this bill said rep 
barney frank dmass 
the four democrats siding with the gop were reps frank annunzio 
of illinois stephen l neal of north carolina carroll hubbard jr 
of kentucky and doug barnard jr of georgia 
earlier committee members prayed for gods help to rise above 
narrow selfinterest and then began exempting individual 
institutions from reform provisions of bushs plan 
the panel started what is expected to be at least two days of 
work on the sampl bill by exempting an institution in gonzalez 
district from provisions that would make each bank or sampl in a 
holding company liable when another commonly controlled institution 
fails 
the amendment passed by 3711 vote is designed to help only 
the frost national bank of san antonio 
in a subsequent 442 vote the panel adopted an amendment by 
reps elizabeth j patterson dsc thomas r carper ddel and 
steve bartlett rtexas that carves out another exception for 
chemical bank of new york and first interstate bancorp of los 
angeles 
by voice vote lawmakers exempted two institutions in nebraska 
from the provision at the request of rep peter hoagland dneb 
the federal deposit insurance corp is seeking to broaden the 
financial responsibility of holding companies in bank and sampl 
failures as a way of limiting losses to the government insurance 
fund and to taxpayers 
the 51member committee had begun the session with bowed heads 
as walter fauntroy the district of columbias nonvoting delegate 
and a baptist minister prayed help each of us to rise above our 
own narrow selfinterest 
fauntroy a democrat said that in 19 years in congress he had 
never felt compelled to begin a committee session with prayer but 
was moved to offer one because of the extraordinary importance and 
expense of the savings and loan legislation described as the 
biggest taxpayer bailout ever 
bushs bill which passed the senate last week provides at 
least 157 billion over 10 years the bulk of it from taxpayers to 
pay for closing or merging more than 500 failed thrift institutions 
it also contains a number of reforms designed to prevent the 
problem from recurring chief amog them a requirement that sampl 
owners back their lending with more of their own capital 
some of the committee members objecting to the exemption for the 
bank in gonzalez district including annunzio and rep mary rose 
oakar dohio are opposing the chairmans effort to stiffen 
capital requirements as passed earlier this month by annunzios 
subcommittee on financial institutions 
the subcommittee version would require sampl owners to risk 150 
in real money or tangible capital for every 100 in 
lending the same standard adopted by the senate 
gonzalez with an amendment that his opponents privately 
conceded was likely to pass would boost that to 225 he is 
supported by rep chalmers wylie of ohio the panels senior 
republican 
annunzio argued that overly tough capital rules would force 
hundreds of otherwise healthy institutions out of business 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady in a letter to wylie 
repeated his threat to recommend that bush veto any bill with weak 
capital standards brady is seeking a 3 percent minimum for 
tangible capital but said gonzalezs 225 percent standard shows 
a marked and welcomed improvment 
in an attachment to his letter brady promised thrifts with 
low capital and a reasonable chance of survival will not be 
summarily liquidated 
however he said they should not be allowed to grow and should 
be under the supervision of the regulator 
on another matter the committee voted 3210 to adopt an 
amendment by rep david dreier rcalif aimed at prohibiting 
banks from running advertisements disparaging the condition of the 
sampl deposit insurance funds backers argued that such ads 
needlessly cause drains from sampls since both banks and sampls are 
backed by the federal government opponents said the amendment 
violated constitutional guarantees of free speech

accelerate a planned restructuring laying off employees faster and 
cutting the pay of its top executives as it struggles to return to 
profitability 
the lowellbased computer maker announced earlier this month 
that it would trim its work force from 30200 to 28500 or less by 
june 1990 the company said wednesday it would reach that goal nine 
months earlier by sept 1989 
the company also announced 20 percent pay cuts for an wang its 
chairman and chief executive and his son frederick a wang its 
president and chief operating officer

the 500 largest american companies with revenues of 307 billion 
during the fiscal year ended june 30 1988 
after building its reputation on office word processors in the 
1970s the company faltered in recent years as sales of its 
midrange computer systems have been eaten away by powerful 
personal computers and workstations 
in addition wang has suffered from heavy discounting of its 
mainstay vs line of minicomputers and competition from 
international business machine corps as400 minicomputer 
in an effort to revive the companys fortunes founder an wang 
has begun to take a more active role in daytoday operations the 
company also has moved to cut costs and revise its product lines 
over the last three months it has cut its work force by 880 
mainly through attrition 
wang is now betting heavily on the success of its freestyle 
personal computing and imaging system introduced in november 
which allows computershy office workers to alter electronic 
documents with their voices and handwriting as well as with a

holly farms corp renewed its resistence 
to a 115 billion takeover bid wednesday and told shareholders an 
overall refinancing of the company is being considered 
holly farms has opposed a takeover by rival poultry processor 
tyson foods inc since october holly shareholders voted last week 
to reject a managementbacked move to merge their company with 
conagra inc of omaha neb 
in a statement announcing a quarterly dividend of 38 cents a 
share holly managers said a leveraged recapitalization is 
under consideration 
such a refinancing would involve mortgaging company assets to 
pay dividends to stockholders said ted bailey a holly farms vice 
president 
it would just get some current value out to our shareholders 
it doesnt have anything to do with blocking tyson bailey said 
bailey said he did not know how many company assets or which 
ones might be mortgaged 
napoleon overton an analyst with morgan keegan amp co in 
memphis said holly farms is in good financial shape and the 
recapitalization could be a way to keep shareholders loyal to holly 
managers 
holly farms management believes that a leveraged 
recapitalization is now a viable alternative to either a merger 
with conagra or an acquisition by tyson foods overton said 
the recapitalization would greatly increase holly farms debt 
he said a debt increase often is used as a tool to fight off an 
unwanted suitor 
jim blair general counsel for tyson foods of springdale ark 
said holly managers should consider their shareholders vote on the 
conagra deal as a call to sell to tyson 
it looks to me a little like theyre in the process again of 
telling their shareholders whats best for them rather than 
listening to their shareholders blair said 
tyson is offering holly stockholders 6350 a share in cash 
while the proposed merger with conagra was worth about 60 a share 
in a stock swap 
holly farms stock closed wednesday at 6075 a share down 25 
cents in consolidated new york stock exchange trading

oil mogul marvin davis on wednesday began his 
proxy campaign to unseat the board of nwa inc mailing letters 
seeking shareholder support for replacing the board with nominees 
who would sell the airline company to davis 
we believe that a failure to elect our nominees will give the 
nwa board an excuse to continue to pursue alternatives which do not 
result in a prompt sale of the company the letters read 
nwa parent of eaganbased northwest airlines has rejected 
davis 90 a share tender offer valued at 27 billion but has 
pledged to explore alternatives to maximize shareholder value 
davis who owns about 28 percent of nwas 291 million shares 
wrote in his letter that he is skeptical of the claim 
he cited the companys refusal to withdraw its poison pill 
takeover defense plan and a requirement that northwest suitors sign 
a restrictive confidentiality agreement 
ask yourself whether nwa is truly seeking the best price for 
you when they insist that we the only announced bidder sign an 
agreement calling for us to consent to a standstill abandon this 
proxy contest abandon our tender offer and abide by whatever 
course or alternative the nwa board unilaterally approves davis 
wrote 
northwest closed down 25 cents at 100 a share wednesday on the 
new york stock exchange 
eleven board members are up for election at nwas annual meeting 
may 15 
a group of dissident shareholders are attempting to change the 
record date for the vote which now is limited to shareholders of 
record as of march 17 
hennepin county district judge delila pierce said wednesday that 
the request deserves a hearing next week and denied a request by 
nwa to refuse the change 
karl cambronne an attorney for the shareholders said more than 
65 percent of northwest stock has changed hands since march 17 
rivard said new owners of northwest stock probably are takeover 
speculators and would be more likely to vote for davis slate of 
nominees 
lawyers for northwest also asked pierce to suspend the rest of 
the minnesota shareholders lawsuit saying jurisdiction in 
shareholder matters belongs in the courts of delaware where 
northwest is incorporated 
pierce took that request under advisement without saying when 
she would rule 
nwas poison pill would prevent davis proposed board from 
selling the company for six months after getting control a 
delaware judge on tuesday denied davis request to invalidate the 
provision 
also wednesday minnesota commercer commissioner michael hatch 
said davis must make supplemental disclosures to minnesota 
shareholders by 2 pm cdt thursday to explain how he would operate 
the airline in light of the large amount of money he proposes to 
borrow to complete the purchase 
if the objective facts are not supplied by the deadline the 
tender offer in minnesota will be suspended hatch said but the 
commissioner also left open the possibility of another hearing on 
the matter for thursday night if davis requests it 
there was no immediate comment from davis said his spokeswoman 
mary conway

the terminal which a spokesman for the scottish sector of british 
gas plc said handled about a third of britains north sea gas 
supplies british gas is the monopoly company responsible for gas 
supplies to homes and industry throughout britain

a delaware judge on tuesday denied oil 
billionaire marvin davis effort to void parts of a measure 
designed to thwart a hostile takeover by davis or other unwanted 
suitors of northwest airlines parent company 
chancellor william p allen of delaware chancery court in 
wilmington rejected davis request for an injunction that would 
have barred nwa inc from issuing poison pill stock rights to 
shareholders before nwas annual meeting may 15 
a poison pill makes it more difficult and costly for a group to 
take over a company 
the stockrights plan include a provision that bars any newly 
elected nwa board from dropping the poison pill until 180 days 
after the board is in place 
davis said the plan would put him at a competitive disadvantage 
in his bid to take over the nations fourthlargest air carrier 
because it would effectively block a new board of directors from 
selling northwest for 180 days 
davis attorney gilchrist sparks argued monday that the prospect 
of a long delay would discourage shareholders from supporting davis 
in the proxy fight davis planned at nwas annual meeting 
davis attorneys did not argue against the poison pill saying 
they would favor such a plan if davis group gained control of nwa 
but they challenged the 180day umbrella 
allen wrote that he was rather unimpressed by davis 
argument that the delay in canceling the poison pill will be a 
material factor to those nwa shareholders who might otherwise be 
for the davis slate 
allen ordered nwa to notify shareholders that his ruling is not 
a final decision on the validity of the delayed redemption 
provision however he said davis may return 45 days after nwas 
annual meeting to seek a ruling on the plans validity 
in a statement a davis spokeman said while we would of 
course have preferred that the court grant the relief specifically 
requested in our motion we are most gratified that its is 
requiring nwa as a condition to the issuance of the rights to 
give stockholders notice that the provision may be invalidated and 
that the court is committed to deciding the merits of the issue 
soon after the annual meeting 
tom ryan a northwest spokesman said he had just received the 
ruling and could not comment on it in detail 
its fair to say were pleased with it he said 
the nwa board of directors on monday unanimously rejected davis 
27 billion 90ashare bid alleging that the offer is 
unfinanced and in part illegal under securities laws but the board 
said it is willing to negotiate with davis and other qualified 
bidders 
nwas stock closed at 10050 tuesday down 225 on the new 
york stock exchange 
minnesota commerce commissioner michael hatch has threatened to 
suspend davis acquisition incs registration statement in which 
davis offers to purchase all of nwas outstanding shares hatch 
said monday the statement is deficient in several areas 
at a hearing tuesday night lawyers for davis reacted coolly to 
hatchs request that they submit more information about davis bid 
los angeles attorney george a vandeman said after the hearing 
that he would try to convince hatch that the disclosures already 
made of davis financial plan are adequate 
hatch requested that more information be submitted by noon 
wednesday if he decides that davis has not made a sufficient 
explanation of his plans he can order that the offer be suspended 
in the state 
in a development monday the nwa board decided at least 
temporarily against a planned 16 billion order for new planes 
instead it authorized its planeleasing subsidiary to buy 10 used 
dc10s and 14 used dc9s to lease to northwest and other carriers
