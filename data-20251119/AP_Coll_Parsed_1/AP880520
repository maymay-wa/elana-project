the yellow police tape surrounding the 
sprawling onestory brick school provided a jarring note on the 
quiet treelined sunny street with its comfortable homes 
but the tranquility of this affluent north shore community had 
already been shattered by a shooting rampage that left an 
8yearold boy dead and five other children and an adult critically 
wounded 
the children were shot at hubbard woods elementary school in a 
15minute assault by a woman friday morning in a school restroom 
and in a secondgrade classroom

dead by police later in the day police said she shot herself once 
in the head with a 32caliber pistol

i just heard police surrounding the house calling lori 
lets get it over with i didnt hear any response then i heard a 
shot a blast i would say said hildegard oberstoetter a 
housekeeper at the home next door

ms dann had been found dead in the house 
village residents talked of little else teenagers sitting on 
cars in a local gas station were discussing the events and a man 
sat in his garage listening to developments on a police radio 
the boys death was only the third slaying in his community 
since 1957 timm said 
we never have a drill for something like this but we do have 
fire and tornado drills so the kids were on the floor in the other

arizonas attorney general took initial 
steps friday toward investigating gov rose moffords expenditures 
of thousands of dollars in state funds on gifts and decorations 
when she was secretary of state 
some of the spending appears to have lacked legislative 
authorization according to records and interviews with officials 
although the governor and a close aide said the legislature had 
approved the funds 
mrs moffords office issued a statement saying she stands 
behind all the expenditures press aide vada manager said the 
governor would not hold a news conference on the issue because i 
dont think theres anything serious enough to have a press 
conference over 
the governor in a brief interview with radio station kfyi said 
i never misspent a penny it was appropriated for vip gifts and i 
used it for that type of purpose i never used anything for 
personal gain 
mrs mofford 65 became governor april 4 when evan mecham was 
removed from office upon being convicted in a senate impeachment 
trial of misusing state funds and obstructing justice 
records examined by the associated press showed that mrs 
moffords gift expenditures totaled at least 50000 for her last 
five years as secretary of state 
mrs mofford used state funds to pay for such things as a 
jokewriting service and diet food as well as paintings watches 
indian kachina dolls clocks flags and knickknacks typically 
charging them to other operating expenses or supplies 
house speaker joe lane said he would wait to hear from attorney 
general bob corbin and maricopa county attorney tom collins before 
deciding whether to launch an impeachment probe 
since corbin is next in line to succeed mrs mofford he already 
had turned over to collins an investigation of her financial 
disclosure practices that investigation stemmed from an ap report 
that while secretary of state she had failed to include a number of 
her business dealings in the staterequired reports 
corbin said friday that collins had agreed to investigate the 
gift expenditures as well he added that whether any criminal or 
civil action will be taken will depend on what collins finds 
mrs mofford did not respond to ap queries about the gifts and 
spoke only briefly to kfyi 
earlier this month she had said that when faced with the need 
to present gifts to important visitors as secretary of state she 
took care of it myself 
ive paid for a lot of my dinners and all those artifacts and 
things that are there mrs mofford continued only gifts we 
have a fund for vip gifts that we are permitted to use that was 
appropriated by the legislature other than that i pay for it out 
of my own pocket 
karen osborne assistant secretary of state said the 
expenditures had been authorized by the legislature as early as 
1980 when mrs mofford requested permission to spend 5000 to make 
some kind of presentation to visiting dignitaries on behalf of 
the state 
the legislatures official records show 2400 in unspecified 
other expenses was approved that year and 2500 in 1981 more 
recently the legislature has provided lumpsum allocations for the 
secretary of states office with little direction as to how the 
funds are divided the budget this year is 19 million 
laurie drobny the joint legislative budget committees staff 
analyst for the secretary of states office in 1980 said she 
didnt believe the 2400 was for gifts but that she could not 
recall what it was for 
lane also said he didnt know the money was for gifts he added 
that he could understand some of the purchases but that buying a 
joke service or diet food blows my mind 
the state constitution bars the state from giving anything of 
value to an individual without public benefit and state law makes 
unauthorized expenditures of public funds a felony 
mrs osborne said she considered that gifts mrs mofford gave as 
secretary of state did result in a public benefit because they 
were aimed at pleasing someone who could bring business to the 
state were in recognition of service to the state or were aimed at 
motivating future conduct 
records for use of state funds the past five years ago show that 
as secretary of state mrs mofford spent about 9000 on pens and 
other novelties with her name on them about 6400 on 30 watches 
bearing the state seal and about 5700 on kachina and other dolls 
and their display cases 
the total also included about 11000 for flags mostly state 
and national some of which were bought from unauthorized vendors 
at higher prices than those paid to authorized vendors for similar 
flags 
other expenditures included 20370 for a weightreduction 
product shipped to a friend and business partner of mrs mofford 
and 306 for the five years annual renewal of a joke service that 
promises to supply speakers with 120 to 140 new jokes and stories a 
month 
mrs osborne called that probably the greatest tool in the 
world since nobody wants to hear a dull totally dry speech 
as for the diet food mrs osborne said she didnt know anything 
about it 
a 1978 protocolfund statute allows the governor house speaker 
and senate president to make gifts that promote state interests and 
encourage public service it does not include the secretary of 
state 
after she became governor mrs mofford said she wanted mechams 
privately raised protocol fund money he was convicted by the 
senate of misusing placed in the state general fund that comes 
from tax revenues 
i would not have a protocol fund period she said i 
dont want one

a whole class of fourthgraders whose teacher 
failed to make the grade must go to summer school before they can 
be promoted says their principal one of four who tried 
unsuccessfully to fire the teacher 
it is really a joke that the system allows this to happen 
said dyanne dandridgealexander principal of spencer elementary 
school where grace currin teaches those children deserve a 
better teacher a better education 
currin has not handed in a lesson plan all year 
dandridgealexander said and when you ask her about it she says 
i left it at home 
the noise level in the class is unbelievable kids are 
fighting children are rolling around on the floor they are 
throwing chairs across the room one day i walked into her 
classroom and said did you see that chair fly across the room 
and she said i told them not to do that 
the citys schools are saddled with too many students and too 
little money and the result too often is chaos the chicago 
tribune concluded after a sevenmonth examination of a system that 
secretary of education william bennett has called the worst in the 
nation 
in addition a lenient administration a powerful teachers union 
and a misguided state law have created an environment that protects 
incompetent teachers and ignores the children the teachers are 
supposed to educate the tribune said thursday in its weeklong 
series on the system 
the newspaper found that of 139 teachers who over the last five 
years were so lacking in attendance discipline teaching ability 
or relationships with their students that their principals moved to 
fire them 99 are still in the classroom 
i am part of the problem but remember you cant expect 
miracles when you have low achievers said currin 56 who has 
taught for 30 years 
there always will be discipline problems in that class said 
currin whose most recent assignment is at spencer in an 
impoverished neighborhood on the citys near northwest side its 
the kind of children i teach 
during her career currin has received at least 12 excellent 
ratings and five superior ratings but she also has received 
four unsatisfactory ratings since the 198384 school year the last 
this march from dandridgealexander the newspaper reported 
since a new state law took effect in january an unsatisfactory 
rating is the first step in the termination procedure which could 
take a year or longer the newspaper reported three of currins 
principals attempted to have her fired under previous guidelines 
currin told the tribune her career goal now is retiring at 
full pension 
she did not return phone messages left for her at the school 
thursday 
incompetent teachers are a disservice to everyone especially 
the teaching profession chicago teachers union spokesman chuck 
burdeen said thursday any principal who says he cant get rid of 
an obviously bad teacher is either lazy or must think assassination 
is the only answer 
secondly those who are critical of urban school systems are 
usually the ones like bennett and the reagan administration who 
are taking away the very same resources needed to meet the 
tremendous needs of these kids he said 
dandridgealexander said she isnt concerned as much with blame 
as she is with correcting the problem last month she called 
parents in to monitor currins classes and they are at a point 
where they think it is hopeless she said 
because of the new state law giving teachers rated 
unsatisfactory a years work before they can be dismissed currin 
will be able to continue teaching until at least march 1989 
the new law was part of a 1985 state school reform package its 
intent to give school management better tools to weed out weak 
teachers but lobbying by teachers unions made the law into yet 
another measure making it even more difficult to fire teachers 
according to the tribune 
its a terrible shame said dandridgealexander those 
children have suffered because they have a totally inept teacher 
that no one has been able to fire

with a little financial help from abroad 
and a lot of enthusiasm from 200000 volunteers opponents of 
chiles military government have launched a campaign they say will 
keep fraud out of this years presidential election 
ten opposition parties from left to right have united in the 
campaign of doortodoor voter education pollwatching on election 
day and independent vote counting afterward 
leaders of the national election command for democracy maintain 
that the system is necessary because they believe fraud tipped a 
1980 plebiscite to approve a governmentdrafted constitution 
genaro arriagada secretary general of the command said the 
1980 plebiscite in which the government received 67 percent of the 
vote lacked the minimal conditions necessary to guarantee any 
honest election 
that vote took place without voter registries because the old 
ones had been destroyed by the military shortly after they seized 
power in 1973 polling stations were manned only by 
governmentappointed officials without any opposition or 
independent supervision 
arriagada said a national census taken two years after the vote 
showed that in several cities the number of people who voted in the 
plebiscite was higher than the number of residents in the cities 
the government has denied accusations of fraud 
the upcoming presidential plebiscite will be very different 
arriagada said he said voter registries now have reopened and 
this time we have the capacity to guarantee a clean vote 
in the plebiscite scheduled for an unspecified date later this 
year chileans will be able to vote yes or no on a single 
militaryappointed candidate for the 198997 presidential term if 
the candidate is rejected by voters a competitive election will 
take place a year later 
president augusto pinochet the 73yearold army commander who 
has ruled since 1973 is considered the most likely candidate 
ricardo lagos leader of the socialist party and a key member of 
the national election command said 700 specialists are training 
the 200000 volunteers throughout the country to work as 
pollwatchers on election day 
he added in an interview that the opposition will be able to 
have three to five monitors at each of the 20000 or so voting 
places 
we can guarantee to every citizen that his vote will be 
properly accounted for and that it will remain secret lagos 
said 
some volunteers have already visited hundreds of thousands of 
voters in the doortodoor campaign to explain to them that this 
time the vote will be totally clean he said 
lagos added that part of the financing for the campaign has come 
from groups abroad interested in the restoration of democracy in 
chile 
he said the cost is relatively low however he estimated his 
socialist party will spend the equivalent of around 100000 
lagos did no identify the foreign groups sending money but the 
national endowment for democracy of the united states and several 
west european foundations especially in west germany italy and 
sweden have been officially reported in the past as granting 
financial aid to chilean democratic dissident groups 
the national election command also has organized a nationwide 
computerized votecounting system to operate independently of the 
government system 
eduardo arriagada an engineer in charge of the vote counting 
center said we will be able to quickly deliver a projection of 
the vote and complete returns 
eric campana a leading electoral expert of the christian 
democratic party the largest in the opposition said the system 
we are implementing fully guarantees a clean vote there will be no 
fraud this time chileans can rest assured of that 
campana said volunteers trained as pollmonitors show an 
enormous enthusiasm 
many of them are paying for their travel and other expenses 
connected with the campaign out of their own pockets 
juan gabriel valdes who works at the vote counting center 
said however old legislation granting the government emergency 
powers could still be invoked 
that legislation for example would allow the government to 
prevent us from announcing the returns we will be gathering 
valdes said 
that said lagos is the only fraud possibility that remains 
open

this weeks riots make clear that the 
militant political opposition remains strong despite substantial 
democratic reforms 
thousands of students and dissidents opposed to president roh 
taewoos government battled police in the streets protest leaders 
claimed south korea is not a democracy as they had during the 
authoritarian regime of rohs predecessor and ally chun doohwan 
protesters chanted down with the military dictatorship and 
destroy the murder regime they hurled firebombs and rocks at 
riot police during the most violent unrest in months 
the scale was much smaller than the huge protests of last summer 
but the scenes and slogans were the same demonstrating that south 
korean politics remain turbulent despite the professed desire of 
all parties to build a stable democratic system 
antiamerican sentiment always present in political protests 
seemed particularly evident this time 
yankee go home was shouted along with execute roh 
taewoo protesters burned a homemade american flag and attacked 
a us cultural center opposition groups especially radical 
students remain eager to take their causes into the streets the 
government still limits some political activity and is quick to use 
riot police to break up protests 
many south koreans still distrust roh because he helped chun 
seize power in 1980 when both were army generals and played a 
prominent role in chuns regime serving as chairman of the 
government democratic justice party 
that wariness was reflected in rohs slender victory in the 
december presidential election over a divided opposition and the 
government partys loss of its majority in parliamentary elections 
last month 
opposition groups demand an investigation of his role in 
suppression of the 1980 kwangju uprising in which at least 191 
people were killed this weeks protests marked the eighth 
anniversary on wednesday of the revolt in the southern city 
in addition to being far smaller than those that forced chun to 
hold elections the latest protests have attracted little public 
support and there is little sign that they will become a threat to 
the government 
the 1987 protests mushroomed into mass demonstrations almost 
overnight however and political observers avoid firm predictions 
about south korean politics when roh replaced chun as president in 
february it was the first peaceful transfer of power in the 
nations 40year history 
all indications are that both the government and the main 
opposition parties want to avoid major political unrest before the 
olympic games are held here in september south koreans see the 
games as a national triumph that will give the nation a place on 
the world stage 
roh has worked hard to build public confidence he promised to 
introduce full democracy while ensuring political stability and 
has made significant changes 
many curbs on politics imposed by chun have been removed 
creating a sharp contrast to 1987 when riot police took harsh 
action to disperse even minor peaceful demonstrations 
roh tries to project himself as a common man and has 
discarded much of the presidencys aloofness press curbs have been 
removed most forms of selfexpression are allowed and opposition 
parties operate freely 
some political controls still apply however street protests 
against the government still are likely to be broken up and scores 
of dissidents remain in jail serving long sentences for political 
activity 
many south koreans feel real democracy is not possible until 
control by the military government bureaucracy big business and 
other powerful factions is ended 
people in the streets complain that roh has yet to deliver on 
election promises of major social and economic reforms including 
doubling pay for industrial workers and the poor 
a more fundamental problem lies in the traditional south korean 
belief that compromise is the greatest sign of weakness political 
factions believe only one point of view is right and all others 
must be defeated or even destroyed 
political leaders on all sides agree such an outlook blocks the 
road to democracy but seem unable to change it

the surrender of sikh extremists in 
their sacred golden temple did not end the war of terror through 
which they hope to create a nation called khalistan the land of 
the pure 
during the 10 days sikh gunmen and their sympathizers spent 
inside the temple complex surrounded by about 2800 policemen and 
soldiers their comrades killed 133 people in the holy city of 
amritsar and other parts of punjab state 
twentyfive more people were reported killed thursday the day 
after the surrender at the temple in amritsar they included two 
hindu priests and a sikh holy man 
it is from punjab a rich northern agricultural state that the 
radicals would create khalistan it is the only state where sikhs 
who make up only 2 percent of indias 800 million people are in 
the majority 
julio f ribeiro former police chief of punjab and now security 
adviser to the state government was asked if the surrender 
indicated an end to terrorism he replied no far from it 
bomb disposal squads searched for hidden explosives thursday in 
the 400yearold golden temple the holiest shrine of sikhism 
police said four more bodies were found inside bringing the death 
toll of the siege to 46 
a committee of sikh elders that manages the temple conferred 
about preparations to reopen the golddomed shrine 
sikh extremists began fighting for a separate homeland six years 
ago accusing the hindudominated federal government of 
discrimination and of hampering economic development in punjab 
thousands of people have been killed since then 
prime minister rajiv gandhi signed a peace agreement with 
moderate sikhs in 1985 but it fell apart within a year 
the sikh extremists initially blamed for scattered killings 
have attacked loaded buses sleeping villagers and congested 
markets in recent years at least 1088 people have been killed in 
punjab so far this year compared to 1032 for all 1987 
most victims are hindus but an increasing number of sikh 
moderates are being slain 
police estimate the radicals have more than 3000 men under 
arms with increasingly sophisticated weapons 
the greatest fear of gandhis government is that the separatist 
movement will become a fullscale civil war and encourage 
insurgencies among other minorities 
so far the terrorists are a small section of the 
population one official said privately we want to keep it 
that way 
support for the extremists within the sikh community may be 
waning after an army raid on the golden temple complex in 1984 
angry sikhs held rallies 
but hardly any sikhs objected publicly to the siege of the 
temple that ended wednesday and a gathering of sikh temple 
managers in new delhi passed a resolution wednesday praising the 
governments rescue of the shrine 
prime minister indira gandhi ordered the 1984 raid to drive out 
extremists taking shelter in the temple about 1200 people were 
killed two of mrs gandhis sikh guards assassinated her five 
months later 
prominent sikhs generally believe the violence will continue 
until the government of rajiv gandhi indiras son and successor 
reaches a political compromise with the militants 
kushwant singh a respected sikh writer urged the government 
recently to abandon its practice of searching for a single moderate 
sikh to lead peace efforts 
what we have to find is not a person or persons to lead the 
punjab but a way to set out principles of conduct and stick to 
them no matter what the immediate consequences he wrote in the 
hindustan times newspaper 
he advocated release of hundreds of sikhs detained without 
trial prosecution of hindu politicians and others accused of 
instigating the antisikh riots in 1984 and new investment to 
stimulate punjabs faltering economy 
gandhis 1985 accord with moderates called for settlement of 
land and water disputes between punjab and neighboring haryana 
state investigation of the 1984 riots and speedy handling of 
arrest and detention cases 
he put punjab under federal rule in may 1987 after the 
agreement had failed but in march of this year returned to a 
softer approach and ordered the release from prison of militant 
sikh high priest jasbir singh rode 
rode was arrested last week trying to march on the temple to end 
the police siege

like the one that got away the great 
anglers strike of 88 is assured of an honorable place in the 
folklore of irish fishing 
it is a tale of defiance anger and of farce tinged with menace 
it invokes the memory of irelands freedom wars reflects rural 
resentment against bigcity bureaucrats and climaxes with an 
11thhour truce mediated by an archbishop 
and all because of a fishing license 
the trouble began on new years day when a law took effect 
requiring anglers for the first time to buy licenses 
at 15 pounds 2650 for a years trout fishing and 10 pounds 
1560 for other fish the permits arent exorbitant or unusual 
for europe but the anglers were outraged 
they threatened to shut down angling and deal a severe blow to 
western irelands multimillion dollar tourism industry unless the 
license law was withdrawn the government refused and in midapril 
the strike began 
signs popped up along roads and at fishing venues saying no 
rod license and licensed anglers not welcome here angling 
clubs declared their waters offlimits to fishers hotels told 
guests with bookings to stay away fishing stores refused to sell 
the licenses 
dark tales circulated of anglers car tires being slashed and a 
fishing boat being sawed in half true or not they had the desired 
effect 
by midmay as the lakes and rivers swarmed with trout feasting 
on the newly hatched mayflies not an angler was in sight and all 
angling competitions were canceled 
dick willis head of the munster trout fly anglers association 
says its not the money but the principle 
we believe we have a godgiven right to fish said the 
54yearold pub owner smacking the dashboard of his car 
i want to hand down to my children and grandchildren what my 
forefathers gave to me the right to fish over these waters for 
free 
in the tiny county cork village of kildorrery willis friend 
peter collins harked back 70 years to irelands war for 
independence from britain 
my father and dicks father put their lives on the line 
fighting for our freedom and freedom includes the right to fish 
he said 
its a battle for control willis said we anglers have 
developed these waters cleaned up pollution restocked them 
without one penny in government aid and we want to keep it that 
way 
commented lawmaker enda kenny in the land of capt charles 
boycott attitudes have become deeply entrenched a reference to 
the 19thcentury land agent who lost his crops to a peasants 
boycott and gave his name to the english language 
the debtridden economy urgently needs cash and the government 
sees nothing wrong with the angling licenses but its attitude is 
under attack 
it is government by diktat rather than by any sort of 
consensus charged the cork examiner this whole matter has 
been handled in a very nonsensical manner 
indeed the law passed so quickly and with so little fanfare 
that the government tourism agency didnt have time to alter its 
latest promotional literature which still says irish waters are 
licensefree 
meanwhile the 60 million annual tourism industry in western 
ireland says hotels catering to anglers have been hit hard by 
cancellations 
we are facing ruin at the moment said june hodgson who 
runs a classy anglers hotel on lake corrib in county galway 
its devastating heartbreaking to look out over an empty lake 
and see no boats she said tuesday 
unbeknownst to her however higher powers were working to get 
the anglers and the government off the hook 
late wednesday the archbishop of tuam dr joseph cassidy 
announced he had secretly negotiated a deal whereby the licensing 
law would not be implemented until further discussion 
tommy tuck of the antirodlicensing campaign saw this as a 
facesaving compromise and said the boats would return to corrib 
later but willis remained suspicious 
i dont see any government commitment to repeal the law so 
for the time being our strike is still on he said 
this is a tax on our sport he said if they get away with 
this next year itll be the tennis racket then the golf club 
then the hurling stick you know governments once they get one leg 
in its all over next year theyll double it then treble it

carlos lehder rivas armed with 
colombian contacts and a new york street education turned a prison 
cell fantasy into the worlds first hightech cocainesmuggling 
ring authorities say 
at the height of his power in the early 1980s lehder was a key 
figure in the medellin cartel the colombian drugtrafficking ring 
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine brought into this 
country according to us indictments he was convicted thursday 
on all 11 counts of smuggling lodged against him 
lehder was one of the four managers for the 
multibilliondollar cartel said jack hook spokesman for the 
federal drug enforcement administration in miami he had hundreds 
of millions of dollars pass through his bank accounts in a short 
period of time 
lehder owned an island in the bahamas gave television 
interviews from a colombian jungle hideaway showed a fondness for 
adolf hitler and john lennon and even organized his own political 
party to fight us imperialism 
in a 1985 interview from the jungle where he was a fugitive 
lehder called his nations stimulants the achilles heel of 
imperialism 
if coke coal or marijuana or gold or diamonds or coffee or 
whatever we have is going to provide a cornerstone for us to 
remove imperialism from colombia and latin america well then so 
be it he said 
us authorities kept pressing the colombian government and on 
feb 4 1987 lehder was captured for extradition by the colombian 
government after a short firefight outside a medellin mansion he 
wound up in jacksonville facing a federal jury 
trial testimony drug agents and prosecutors painted lehder as a 
pioneer in drug trafficking with a grand design to traffic tons of 
cocaine through the bahamas 
son of a german father and colombian mother lehder grew up in 
colombias coffeegrowing region of armenia then moved to new york 
at age 15 
his brushes with the law began a few years later in 1974 he 
was sentenced to the federal correctional insitution in danbury 
conn for auto theft and marijuana possession 
lehder and a prison mate talked about cocaine as the wave of the 
future and pored over an atlas to find a small island they could 
buy as a waystation authorities said 
after he was deported to colombia in 1975 lehder allegedly 
began smuggling cocaine into the united states in small amounts 
concealing it in the lining of suitcases 
soon he was hiring other mules and graduated to using 
large longrange planes to fly several hundred kilograms at a time 
out of colombia 
lehder established his base on normans cay a small bahamian 
island that us attorney robert merkle characterized as an 
aircraft carrier of cocaine his occupation of the island was 
allegedly blessed by bahamian prime minister lynden o pindling 
after a series of bribes according to trial testimony pindling 
has denied the allegation and has not been charged 
defense attorneys edward r shohat and jose quinon contended 
lehder was a businessman who wanted to develop the bahamian island 
as a resort for wealthy europeans and south americans they 
introduced into evidence a promotional film made by lehder which 
extolled the islands virtues 
but according to trial testimony lehder soon was flying 
shipments from normans cay to small airstrips in florida and 
georgia 
carlos lehder and henry ford had a lot in common merkle 
said in his closing arguments carlos lehder was the pioneer of 
the mass transportation of cocaine for the american consumer 
like many pioneers money was not lehders only objective 
merkle charged that lehder also viewed cocaine as a revolutionary 
tool 
steve yakovac who met lehder in 1976 said lehder wanted to 
build a kingdom based on cocaine he pretty much thought he was 
going to take on the world 
outside lehders bavarianstyle resort of posada alemana stands 
a symbolically bulletpocked nude statue of his hero slain former 
beatle john lennon 
at his trial several witnesses testified that lehder also 
idolized hitler and kept swastikas the symbol of hitlers nazi 
germany in his home 
by 1982 lehder was spending most of his free time back in 
armenia developing a resort buying ranches starting a newspaper 
and forming a political party he railed against the uscolombian 
extradition treaty since voided by that nations supreme court 
calling it an example of us imperialism 
dea agents say lehder was active in the drugrelated violence 
that swept colombia working with guerrilla forces to arrange the 
assassination of government officials who opposed the drug trade 
lehders operation began to unravel when bahamian forces and the 
dea began to focus on normans cay with the help of marijuana 
smuggler ed ward who had joined forces with lehder in 1978 after 
meeting him on the island

the former president of a maryland cocacola 
bottler and the chairman of the company that once owned a rival 
pepsicola bottling operation have been convicted of price fixing 
by a federal jury 
sentencing for james j harford former president of 
midatlantic cocacola bottling co of silver spring md and 
morton m lapides chairman of the board of allegheny beverage 
corp of cheverly md has not been set the two face a maximum of 
three years in prison 
they were convicted thursday of conspiring to set the wholesale 
price of their products between february 1983 and the fall of 1985 
allegheny beverage was the parent company of allegheny pepsicola 
bottling co 
in the sixweek trial prosecutors sought to show that both 
companies enjoyed higher profits because of the artifical inflation 
of their wholesale prices they provided no estimate of cost to the 
consumer 
they didnt want a price war and gave a green light to 
pricefixing said assistant us attorney david jordan of the 
defendants 
a third executive indicted odis r allen vice president of 
midatlantic pleaded guilty march 22 to one count of price fixing 
prosecutors said allen met numerous times with other softdrink 
executives to scheme about boosting wholesale prices of both coke 
and pepsi 
the defense contended that harford and lapides were unaware of 
what was happening and were hostile competitors who had fought 
each other in court and in the marketplace 
the indictments came out of a wideranging justice department 
probe of the soft drink industry 
in march allegheny and midatlantic agreed to refund 45000 to 
state and local governments for cola bought by school districts 
during the time of the alleged price fixing

a white former police officer acquitted of 
state charges in the 1983 shooting death of a black man was 
indicted thursday by a federal grand jury for civil rights 
violations in the same shooting 
us attorney john volz said the indictment charges stephen 
michael rosiere with shooting gerard glover 18 in the back on 
aug 31 1983 the federal charges accuse rosiere of violating 
glovers civil rights 
the maximum penalty in the federal case would be life in prison 
rosieres attorney arthur lemann iii said he would try to get the 
indictment dismissed on the grounds that it subjects rosiere to 
double jeopardy 
volz would not say whether any new evidence was uncovered in the 
federal investigation 
asked why it took so long to bring the federal charges volz 
would say only that prosecutors had been watching posttrial 
developments and felt the time finally had come to move on the case 
he said federal officials were interested in the case because 
the boy was shot in the back riding on the back of a motorcycle 
fleeing from what was at worst a traffic arrest 
also rosiere and his partner admitted that they planted a gun 
near the scene to make it appear that the shooting was in 
selfdefense he said 
glover the son of a policewoman was a passenger behind the 
driver of a speeding motocycle that rosiere and his partner were 
chasing 
rosiere testified during the trial that he thought he was being 
fired upon and that his own gun went off when the police car 
accelerated his partner who testified in exchange for immunity 
said no one fired from the cycle 
rosiere a nineyear officer was suspended from the police 
force after the shooting and was fired three months later he was 
charged in state court and convicted of seconddegree murder in 
1984 
the verdict was overturned by the louisiana supreme court in 
1985 and rosiere was aquitted in a second trial in 1986 he works 
as a carpenter in new orleans

republican george bush basked on thursday in 
the praise of president reagan who called him an important part 
of everything we have achieved in this socalled revolution 
the vice president also received a dispensation of sorts from 
the white house to disagree with the presidents policies 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters thursday 
he has his ideas on how hes going to want to do things and 
thats fine 
meanwhile the washington post quoting sources reported in 
fridays editions that bush urged at a highlevel meeting of 
administration policymakers that negotiations with panamanian 
leader manuel antonio noriega be ended bush campaign spokesman 
peter teeley said thursday night he had no knowledge of any such 
recommendation by the vice president 
bush met held a private evening meeting with civil rights 
leaders at his official residence the vice presidents chief of 
staff told reporters that bush asked the black leaders to share 
open discussion with him 
bush called it a very good session 
benjamin hooks head of the naacp and one of the participants 
said a wide range of issues was discussed but hooks said at 
this point id say the vice president has a long way to go if he 
actually expects to get a substantial black vote 
john e jacob president of the national urban league who also 
attended the meeting said the fact that the meeting had taken 
place was in itself important 
this is the first meeting of this type in some eight years 
and that is significant he said 
jacob told a recent news conference that the group was trying to 
set up a similar session with democrat michael dukakis 
jacob a supporter of democrat jesse jackson said any 
candidate who wins will have to come to get the black votes 
neither bush nor dukakis has demonstrated that he has the 
capacity to get black voters 
reagan who officially endorsed his vice president two weeks 
ago made his comments in an interview with foreign broadcasters 
i have to say that the vice president has been an important 
part of everything that we have achieved in this socalled 
revolution in these seven years or so he said 
i have always believed that vice presidents in our system of 
government were relegated to a kind of just standing and waiting 
position and i think thats a waste of talent i have always 
believed that your vice president should be like a vice president 
in a private corporation he should be an executive with duties and 
functions 
reagan cited bushs work at the helm of task forces one on 
reducing regulations and another on drugs 
reagans spokesman took pains to make clear that bush was his 
own man and was free to differ from administration policy 
fitzwater spoke a day after comments by bush and his aides 
suggested a break with reagan on the question of dismissing 
drugtrafficking indictments against noriega 
i wont bargain with terrorists and i wont bargain with drug 
dealers either whether they are on us or foreign soil bush 
said wednesday 
im saying that he has his ideas on how hes going to want to 
do things and thats fine fitzwater said 
as we go through this campaign i would expect to see the vice 
president speaking out on a number of issues in terms of what he 
would do he said i expect a number of them will be different 
than existing policies and we will not criticize them in any way 
if you want to drive a wedge between the white house and the vice 
president forget it 
in the interview with foreign broadcasters reagan was asked 
about bushs apparent effort to distance himself from white house 
policy on noriega 
i can see why the vice president said what he said reagan 
said in the interview because the impression has been given 
based not on information from us but based on rumors and news 
leaks and so forth that we are in negotiations over with a 
participant in the drug trade and all and i think he was making 
himself plain that you dont negotiate with people of that kind 
the president said his talks with noriega were not about his 
involvement in the drug trade 
our goal what were trying to achieve is the restoration of 
democracy in panama he said

nasa still hopes to launch the first 
postchallenger space shuttle in august but the agency is 
uncertain whether it can meet a goal of nine flights next year the 
head of the shuttle program says 
the reason for the doubt is the explosion that destroyed the 
pacific engineering and production co plant in henderson nev on 
may 4 the explosion eliminated the source of half the nations 
supply of a chemical used for the shuttle boosters and some other 
rockets 
a second plant in henderson owned by kerrmcgee has shut down 
for inspections to see that it is safe pacific engineering and 
kerrmcgee were the only american companies manufacturing ammonium 
perchlorate an oxidizer the oxidizer makes sure the solid rocket 
fuel burns evenly 
richard truly associate administrator for space flight of the 
national aeronautics and space administration said thursday that 
rocketmaker morton thiokol has enough ammonium perchlorate on hand 
for four flights and there is enough on hand for a fifth rocket 
set the titan 4 also uses ammonium perchlorate 
the chemical in the form of white crystals is taken by rail 
car to morton thiokols plant in utah mixed there and poured into 
the segments that make the booster rockets 
the issue will first come up in 1989 but were not certain 
there is going to be an impact in 1989 until we get together with 
the dod department of defense to match requirements and 
availability truly said 
he said nasa and the air force will have to decide how to divide 
up the output of kerrmcgee 
he said the first postchallenger flight still is on schedule 
for launch in late august he insisted the agency had not set a 
firm date but is working toward a target of aug 22 
pacific engineering said the explosion which killed two people 
and injured 326 was caused by a natural gas leak pacific 
engineering and kerrmcgee each produced 30 million pounds per year 
of ammonium perchlorate 
morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab said the company hasnt 
ruled out buying ammonium perchlorate from foreign firms but added 
the rest of the world supply is pretty meager ive seen 
estimates of worldwide production of nine million pounds a year 
a pair of shuttle booster rockets uses 15 million pounds of 
ammonium perchlorate per flight

president reagans spokesman says the 
administration is wary of giving military personnel 
drugtrafficking arrest powers because you cross an enormous 
bridge when you move them to an enforcement role 
spokesman marlin fitzwater on thursday did not directly oppose a 
bill passed overwhelmingly by the senate to allow the navy to make 
arrests on the high seas but he said the administration is very 
cautious in that area 
i think the american people would want us to be cautious 
fitzwater said but that does not diminish the idea that there 
are expanded roles for the military 
defense secretary frank c carlucci and adm william crowe 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff oppose attempts by congress 
to substantially change a military role which now consists 
primarily of surveillance 
fitzwater was asked about a change reagan made in a speech 
wednesday on the subject the prepared remarks had called for 
reagan to say he had directed carlucci to search for creative 
solutions on how we can better use military resources and 
technologies to detect and interdict drugs coming into this 
country 
but when he actually delivered the speech reagan changed that 
line to say he wanted carlucci to find better ways for the military 
to detect drugs and support civil law enforcement agencies in 
interdiction 
asked about the significance of the change fitzwater said 
there is a very great concern about what it means to make law 
enforcement officers out of the military 
you cross an enormous bridge when you move them from providing 
military support and surveillance and physical interdiction efforts 
to making arrests and legal judgments and so forth he said 
as i think it was dan pentagon spokesman dan howard the 
other day said the first time an f15 shoots down a dentist 
because his airplane radio doesnt work you begin to understand 
the dimensions of the problem 
the chamber last friday voted 836 for an amendment outlining a 
wideranging antidrug role for the military 
the proposal calls for more surveillance by air force and navy 
planes increased antidrug activity by the national guard and more 
pentagon helicopters for the coast guard and customs service 
the most controversial provision would require navy vessels to 
track suspected drug boats and would allow navy officers to arrest 
suspected drug traffickers in international waters the officers 
would be temporarily deputized by coast guard officers who 
would be aboard for that purpose 
fitzwater however likened the drug trade to a 30foot tidal 
wave hitting a 25foot wall and said the fact is that 
interdiction is never going to solve the problem without cutting 
the demand

president reagan says he considers soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev a friend as well as an adversary and 
says the west should applaud whatever reforms gorbachev can achieve 
reagan also says he believes it is evident gorbachev is 
encountering opposition from forces who want to cling to what are 
more the stalinist policies of yesteryear 
providing a rare insight to the private talks the two have had 
in recent years reagan told foreign broadcasters thursday that 
strains in superpower relations have not harmed their personal 
relationship 
asked if he considered gorbachev a friend reagan replied 
well i cant help but say yes to that yes we can debate 
and we disagree but there is never a sense of personal animus when 
the arguments are over 
while reagan has challenged gorbachev to prove that his 
glasnost campaign of openness is genuine he said the west 
should encourage the move toward change in the soviet union 
if theres any way that outside nations could be helpful in 
this they should he said because many of the reforms that he 
has undertaken are aimed at the things that we have always 
criticized in the soviet union 
and if there is a way to be helpful in that certainly to at 
least acknowledge our approval of what he is doing that we should 
do that 
reagans obliging tone came on a day in which the president 
continued to receive briefings in preparation for his may 29june 2 
summit with gorbachev in moscow 
the president also made these points in a wideranging interview 
i believe there is a desire in the middle east to settle once 
and for all what is still technically a state of war between the 
arab nations and israel 
he said the purpose of an international peace conference would 
be to aid the parties but not to dictate a settlement and said 
any soviet role in such a conference would likely have to be 
preceded by a kremlin decision to resume relations with israel 
he hopes that gorbachev has heard some of the things that i 
have been saying about former white house chief of staff donald 
t regans accusation that astrology played a role in official 
business saying that no decision was ever made by me on the 
basis of astrology 
clandestine sales of us arms to elements in iran during parts 
of 1985 and 1986 were aimed at bringing about the release of 
hostages held in lebanon by proiranian extremists but he claimed 
that they did not amount to an armsforhostages deal 
ive labored under the misapprehension here well worldwide 
i guess about the socalled irancontra affair he said 
ive likened it to if i had a child that was kidnapped i 
dont think that you should pay ransom but if i found there was 
another individual that could get that child back for me in return 
for my doing something for him that would be all right 
on superpower relations and arms control reagan said he thinks 
it is possible that a longrange missile treaty can be negotiated 
before he leaves office because gorbachev might not want to wait 
for a new administration 
while acknowledging that none of us really think such a 
strategic missile deal could be completed at the coming summit in 
moscow he said he did not think gorbachev necessarily wants to 
take his time 
he said were working as hard as we can and its a far more 
complex treaty than the inf intermediaterange nuclear forces 
treaty signed by reagan and gorbachev last december 
but i think that it is possible that we could have that yes 
while this administration is still here 
the president said he thinks the atmosphere for arms control has 
improved in recent years in part because of the nuclear reactor 
accident at chernobyl in the ukraine 
possibly in the soviet union it was their tragic experience 
with chernobyl and to see that how an area was made unlivable for 
the people that had lived all their lives there he said and 
when you stop and think that that explosion was less than the 
power of one single warhead

just a few weeks ago gen manuel antonio 
noriega seemed to be another hapless dictator teetering on the 
brink about to suffer the same fate as haitis jean claude 
duvalier and the philippines ferdinand marcos 
but not only has the panamanian strongman survived he also has 
been an unsettling presence on the us political scene causing 
george bush to break with established policy and producing a degree 
of interagency turmoil which is unusual even by this 
administrations contentious standards 
at times administration bureaucrats seem angrier with each 
other than with noriega 
ideas aired within the administration and the congress on how to 
deal with noriega have gone from one extreme to the other 
why not kidnap him how about a trade embargo against panama 
let noriega think the united states will invade maybe that will 
scare him into exile since noriega is not inclined to listen to 
the united states perhaps other latin american governments can 
talk him into stepping down 
almost nothing has gone right the state department after being 
accused of winking at noriegas alleged drug smuggling activities 
for years found itself on the defensive when its efforts to remove 
him came up short 
noriega even has bush turning on the administration these days 
bush said wednesday that if elected he would not bargain with 
drug dealers whether they are on us or foreign soil an 
implied criticism of government attempts to use dismissal of drug 
smuggling indictments to get noriega out of power 
bush seems intent on not allowing the democrats to outflank him 
on the drug issue his comment followed polls showing him trailing 
democratic frontrunner michael dukakis and a senate vote that 
reflected strong opposition to lettin indicted drug smugglers off 
the hook 
meanwhile state department officials are angry with justice 
department counterparts who leaked details of the secret 
negotiations with noriega last week and pentagon officials accuse 
the state department of coming up with harebrained schemes for 
an antinoriega plot that included use of us military forces 
when white house spokesman marlin fitzwater outlined a portion 
of the state department negotiating position two weeks ago 
department officials exploded venting their anger not so much at 
the spokesman but at whoever authorized him to go public 
this has not been an easy time for the administration but rep 
henry hyde rill says the critics should withhold their fire 
until they can come up with some workable ideas of their own for 
dealing with noriega 
almost everyone agrees the administration erred last february in 
leaving the impression that noriega would soon leave as far back 
as seven weeks ago assistant secretary of state elliott abrams was 
saying that noriega was clinging to power by his fingernails 
yet noriega survives forcing the administration to make one 
concession after another in negotiations with him 
initially the administration was determined to try to force him 
out without promising not to extradite him once he left panama 
dismissing the indictments was out of the question 
as the weeks passed the administration retreated steadily 
first assuring noriega he would not be extradited then offering to 
drop the indictments then reportedly offering to let him return 
to panama after a postresignation period in exile 
all this has been a blow to the administrations prestige 
partially erasing the memory of its 1986 successes in haiti and the 
philippines when duvalier and marcos fled under us pressure 
some including a pentagon expert on latin america nestor 
sanchez had warned that noriega could not be toppled so easily 
after all unlike duvalier and marcos noriega was commander of his 
countrys defense forces as long as they remained loyal he 
stayed even if panamas economy collapsed sanchez correctly 
argued 
but the conventional wisdom in the administration last february 
was quite different the combination of us pressure and the 
strong antinoriega sentiment in panama was certain to topple him 
or so it was thought 
there was another seemingly favorable portent what appeared to 
be the most serious blow against noriega the abortive bid by 
president eric arturo delvalle to fire him occurred on feb 25 
the second anniversary of ferdinand marcos escape to exile from 
the philippines 
but while marcos languishes in gloomy exile in hawaii noriega 
continues to call the shots in panama protected by his 
ustrained military backers

the governor of the 
central bank has resigned in the face of mounting economic 
pressures in this caribbean nation where inflation has soared to 
50 percent 
robert saladin gave no explanation for his action thursday the 
economist appeared briefly at the national palace the seat of 
government to deliver a letter of resignation to the government of 
president joaquin balaguer 
saladin 50 has disagreed with some of balaguers solutions for 
stimulating the economy in this nation of 65 million people 
unfortunately i am not a politician and i cannot be in these 
political fights saladin said in a brief interview at the 
national palace 
by late afternoon the government had made no comment nor named 
a replacement 
saladin is the second central bank governor to resign since 
balaguer was elected in may 1986 luis julian perez quit in 
november after suggesting that repayments on the dominican 
republics 4 billion debt be limited to 10 percent of export 
earnings 
last year debt repayments amounted 750 million or more than 
the value of total exports 
saladin has chafed at balaguers policy to stimulate the economy 
by pumping 600 million into public works about 210000 jobs have 
been created and economic growth is projected at 8 percent this 
year but there have been unwelcome sideeffects 
inflation has soared to 50 percent private economists estimate 
the foreign exchange value of the peso has dropped by about 20 
percent to 19 cents since late last year 
residents of the capital santo domingo clashed in february with 
police during demonstrations to protest increases in the cost of 
living and the scarcity of basic goods like milk and cement public

a college business group says 50 of the 
wealthiest american universities lost 131 percent of their 
endowments in the last quarter of 1987 as a result of the stock 
market crash 
by comparison common stocks overall dropped 226 percent during 
the final three months of 1987 as measured by the standard and 
poors 500 the national association of college and university 
business officers said thursday 
the group which has tracked endowments since 1974 said the 
downturn came after an excellent year for the campus funds 
including a gain of nearly 25 percent in the stock market during 
the 12 months that ended on june 30 1987 
the typical campus had little more than half its endowment 
invested in stocks the overall return on their holdings in the 
198687 academic year was 139 percent the business officers said 
in arriving at the 139 percent figure the association used 
data supplied by 296 colleges and universities with endowments 
ranging from 15 million for indiana university of pennsylvania to 
4 billion for harvard 
the market value of the endowments of all 296 institutions was 
479 billion at midyear the report did not provide a cumulative 
figure for after the crash 
there are more than 3000 colleges and universities in the 
united states the association study covers most of those with 
endowments of 1 million or more 
while the group normally reports trends from july of one year 
through june of the next it commissioned a special analysis by 
cambridge associates on the impact of the oct 19 stock market 
crash when the dow jones industrial average of 30 industrial 
stocks fell 508 points 
the october 1987 stock market tumble caused 50 college and 
university endowments of 100 million or more to fall an average of 
131 percent in the fourth quarter of the calendar year said the 
study reported in the may issue of business officer an 
association magazine 
after the market meltdown those 50 universities engaged in 
a modest repositioning it said the 50 were not named and no 
figures were given on where their endowments stood after the tumble 
between sept 30 and dec 31 their asset allocations went from 
63 percent to 57 percent stocks from 27 percent to 32 percent 
bonds and from 10 percent to 11 percent cash 
at midyear among all 296 colleges and universities the 
average investment pool was composed of 542 percent stocks 294 
percent bonds 127 percent cash and equivalents 19 percent real 
estate and 18 percent other assets 
ten endowments were worth 1 billion or more last summer they 
were harvard 402 billion university of texas system 28 
billion princeton 23 billion yale 21 billion stanford 
17 billion columbia 14 billion texas aampm university system

sheep producers have fared better the last 
year or so but an agriculture department report says lamb chops 
are still a long way from being at the top of the menu 
lamb consumption may edge up in 1988 after declining over the 
last 20 years but dont trade for a sheep ranch just yet 
in the first place the slight increase in prospective 
consumption from 13 pounds per capita to 14 does not mean that 
producers can look forward to any sustained recovery in consumer 
demand the report said 
by comparison 1988 per capita consumption of beef is expected 
to be 721 pounds retail weight pork 627 pounds and veal 15 
pounds the usdas forecast for poultry consumption this year is 
829 pounds per capita 
the report largely the work of richard stillman of the 
departments economic research service was prepared for the june 
issue of farmline magazine which is published each month by the 
agency 
while retailers will find buyers for the additional 
quantities selling prices are likely to fall reducing incentives 
for a major rebuilding of the nations sheep herd the report 
said the buying habits of consumers and the abundance of other 
red meats and poultry will probably exert some downward pressure on 
prices and so keep lamb production and consumption from rising 
substantially 
lamb is a staple in the middle east parts of europe australia 
and new zealand but has never been one of the more popular meats 
for americans 
eating habits are established early in life and those who 
dont grow up eating lamb are less likely to develop a taste for it 
later the report said 
americans each consumed an average of 42 pounds of lamb in 
1960 but the per capita rate has declined by twothirds 
reflecting the downward thrust of the us sheep industry at the 
turn of the century the us sheep herd was around 48 million 
head now its fewer than 11 million 
even so the departments jan 1 inventory report showed 4 
percent gain from a year earlier a response to the improved prices 
of recent years 
stillman said that with production catching up lamb market 
prices are unlikely to rebound to the peaks of 1986 or last years 
average of 78 per 100 pounds continued high production levels and 
supplies of other red meats and poultry will also dampen gains in 
the lamb market 
the average price of lamb may be in the range of 74 and 77 per 
hundredweight this year although lower that would still be high 
enough to ensure producers a healthy return he said 
in 1987 for example with lambs averaging 78 per 
hundredweight producers made about 42 per ewe according to 
agency estimates stillman said 
one of the problems for producers is a scarcity of plants that 
slaughter and process lambs most facilities that kill more than 
100000 lambs a year are in the midwest and west while a high 
percentage of the nations sheep are in those areas producers in 
other regions must absorb transportation costs when their lambs go 
to slaughter 
two years ago a large poultry firm which also processes lamb 
opened a plant in harrisonburg va in an attempt to fill the 
needs of the east coast restaurant trade 
but the firm stopped slaughtering last year because farms in 
the region could not provide enough lambs and animals had to be 
shipped in from the west stillman said 
predators including coyotes and wild or roaming dogs also have 
helped keep down lamb production in many areas he said

the agriculture department says farmers have 
signed up to take 542 million acres of cropland from production in 
1988 down 10 percent from 599 million acres idled in 1987 
despite the decline from last year the prospective 1988 idled 
acreage would represent an area larger than the state of kansas or 
nebraska 
to be eligible for federal price supports and related benefits 
farmers are required to take a percentage of their base from crop 
production and put the land into conservation uses that help 
protect the soil 
the idled or diverted acres signed up for in 1988 under the 
commodity programs included corn 209 million acres down from 23 
million acres last year sorghum 41 million up from 4 million 
barley 29 million unchanged oats 300000 down from 800000 
and total feed grains 282 million acres down from 307 million 
in 1987 
wheat farmers signed up to idle 228 million acres this year 
down from 238 million in 1987 cotton 21 million acres down 
from 38 million and rice 11 million acres down from 16 
million 
the usda report said thursday that farmers enrolled 1878 
million acres of feed grain wheat cotton and rice in the 1988 
acreage program which represented 834 percent of the 2252 
million base acres in the program crops last years enrollment 
made up 865 percent of the 1987 base of 2264 million acres

more women than men say they are very 
concerned about eating the right foods and old people are more 
concerned than any other age group a survey on american shoppers 
reports 
the annual survey of shoppers by the food marketing institute a 
nonprofit association representing the food industry found 
dynamic increases in customer awareness of health issues such 
as fat salt and sugar content 
in the survey in january of 1019 shoppers 58 percent of the 
women said they were very concerned about nutrition compared with 
48 percent of men 
some 59 percent of people without children said they were very 
concerned about nutrition compared with 52 percent of those who 
had children at home 
the share who said they were very concerned about nutrition was 
largest among senior citizens at 72 percent of people aged 65 and 
over those aged 18 to 24 showed the least interest 33 percent 
being very concerned 
the share very concerned about nutrition peaked in the south at 
60 percent followed by 56 percent in the west 54 percent in the 
east and 52 percent in the midwest 
people are remarkably knowledgeable and sophisticated about 
health and nutrition issues tim hammonds a vice president of 
the food marketing institute said thursday they are adjusting 
their diets doing less frying and more broiling of foods seeking 
more fresh fruits he said 
some 27 percent of supermarket shoppers said they are concerned 
about fat in their foods up from 16 percent just a year ago and 9 
percent in 1983 the institute said 
and worry about cholesterol jumped eight points from 14 percent 
to 22 percent in the past year the institute said it rated 5 
percent in 1983 
i think the important thing is that the numbers are 
increasing it shows more and more people are learning that 
fatty foods can contribute to heart disease obesity and possibly 
colon and breast cancer said bonnie f liebman nutrition 
director for the center for science in the public interest a 
consumeroriented health advocacy group 
more and more people have gotten the message that they should 
cut back on fat but people need help translating principles 
into breakfast lunch and dinner she said 
liebman urged food manufacturers to provide clearer labeling 
with guidance such as high low or medium fat in addition to 
the actual measurement 
however consumer concern doesnt necessarily translate into 
action 
just last week prevention magazines annual health study 
disclosed that 54 percent of people polled said they were trying to 
reduce the fat in their diets a decline from 56 percent a year 
earlier 
even so hammonds stressed that the food industry is responding 
to consumer concerns 
in recent years farmers have begun raising leaner hogs than in 
the past markets are trimming more of the fat from meats and 
offering leaner meat cuts and the government has changed grading 
standards to make leaner meats more attractive he pointed out 
indeed a coalition of more than a dozen consumer health groups 
is expected to release a study shortly praising major food 
manufacturers and restaurant chains for reducing their use of 
saturated fats 
while more than onequarter of shoppers expressed concern about 
fat the institute found that as many as half said they turned to 
labels for information on these and other ingredients 
some 46 percent of shoppers said they looked on food labels for 
fat and protein content of foods 
other topics gaining attention of consumers included freshness 
and purity up 7 points from last year to 15 percent saying they 
are concerned 
salt and sugar each gained 4 percentage points to 26 percent 
and 20 percent respectively worry about preservatives was up 2 
points to 16 percent and chemical additives rose 1 point to 14 
percent 
concern about vitamin content was unchanged at 21 percent as 
was the 14 percent rating for calories 
the findings were reported in the institutes 1988 edition of 
trends consumer attitudes amp the supermarket the margin of 
error for the sample generally ranges between 2 and 3 percentage 
points

george bush is looking to a powerful ally on 
pennsylvania avenue for help in seeing that his most valuable 
campaign asset the current 65month economic recovery will last 
at least until election day 
the ally is not president reagan but a political supporter who 
occupies the building next door treasury secretary james a baker 
iii and some economists contend baker may be giving the vice 
president more than just advice 
treasury officials wont comment on the speculation but some 
economists point to recent activity in international markets as 
evidence that baker has been leaning hard on major us trading 
partners to help elect bush and other republicans 
these actions include recent intervention in currency markets by 
other central banks and heavy foreign purchases of us treasury 
securities particularly by japanese investors measures that can 
help stabilize the shaky dollar minimize inflation and help keep 
the economy on an even keel 
a leading proponent of such a view is david hale chief 
economist of kemper financial services in chicago he cites the 
spending of huge sums by japan and other countries to stabilize the 
dollar at prices higher than investors are willing to pay as a 
form of political insurance for bush 
foreign allies dont want to see a big discontinuity in us 
economic policies its not so much that theyre against dukakis 
and for bush they just want stability in the united states in an 
election year hale said in an interview 
two years ago washington wanted a lower dollar now 
washington wants a strong dollar at least until the election 
because baker is fearful that a dollar decline could lead to 
another stock market crash hale said 
although a weak dollar can help ease the trade deficit by making 
us goods more competitive it can also reignite inflation and 
drive foreign investors away from treasury securities and other 
dollarbased investments threatening the financing of the 
governments huge budget deficit 
foreignexchange reserves held by the worlds central banks last 
year grew to 790 billion from 559 billion and hale estimates 
that twothirds of this increase comes from efforts by central 
banks to support the dollar 
the bank of japan reportedly has earmarked another 60 billion 
to spend this year to help prop up the dollar against the yen 
after expanding its foreignexchange holdings by 40 billion in 
1987 
at the same time foreign investors have become the single 
largest buyer of treasury securities this helps underwrite the 
us budget deficit since selling treasury bonds and bills is the 
governments primary way of financing its red ink spending 
analysts estimate that japanese investors alone bought as much 
as half of last weeks sale of 85 billion in new 30year treasury 
bonds analysts have speculated that the government of japan 
persuaded them to do so perhaps as a favor to baker 
if japanese and other foreign investors were to withdraw their 
stake in treasury securities interest rates would be forced up 
sharply possibly triggering a recession 
an economic downturn at this point could spell disaster for 
bushs presidential efforts 
and while most economists dont see a recession likely in the 
months ahead many forecasters are expressing new fears about an 
escalation in both inflation and interest rates 
bush has been wielding the recovery a peacetime record as a 
major campaign weapon while he scoffed at reagans policies as 
voodoo economics in 1980 he now regularly extols them on 
campaign stops as the american miracle 
the similarity in phrasing to the massachusetts miracle 
trumpeted by democratic frontrunner michael dukakis is no 
coincidence 
bush strategists claim the vice president will launch a major 
assault on dukakis claim after the party conventions this summer 
seeking to demonstrate that the jobcreation claimed by dukakis as 
governor is merely an outgrowth of reaganbush economic policies 
however for the strategy to work the economy must continue to 
perform vigorously in the months to come 
last weeks report that the us trade deficit shrank by 4 
billion between february and march provided some needed 
marketdriven stimulus to the ailing dollar however stock and bond 
markets slumped as investors worried that rising us exports 
without an accompanying reduction in imports could fan inflation 
baker is an early bush supporter and is expected at some point 
to assume a key role in managing bushs general election campaign 
baker said thursday for now im staying at the treasury 
department 
bush lieutenants have suggested that at least for the time 
being baker may be more useful to bush there 
it may be more prudent to seek his advice as a cabinet 
member rather than bringing him into the campaign said bushs 
staff chief craig fuller 
treasury officials refused to comment on allegations that baker 
was using his influence to try to persuade japanese west german 
and other governments to take steps that would promote an economic 
environment conducive to a bush victory 
but one official who demanded anonymity said that trying to 
keep the united states out of a recession does not exactly run 
contrary to bakers role as treasury secretary regardless of 
which candidate it might help

key admissions to congress by former national 
security adviser john poindexter and oliver l north about the 
irancontra affair could be used against them in court despite 
immunity grants prosecutors say 
the prosecutors contend that hundreds of statements by 
poindexter fired national security council aide north and arms 
dealer albert hakim during last years hearings are not covered by 
the limited grants of immunity they received from the congressional 
irancontra committees 
these statements include poindexters admission that he approved 
norths idea to help finance the nicaraguan rebels with profits 
from the usiran arms sales and didnt tell president reagan in 
order to give him some future deniability if the operation were 
exposed 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh contended in a court 
filing thursday that he could also use statements by north and 
poindexter that they destroyed documents during the november 1986 
investigation that attorney general edwin meese iii conducted after 
the armsforhostage deals became public 
walsh made the legal claim in a filing in us district court on 
the issue of whether his investigation was tainted by exposure of 
prosecutors and grand jurors to the immunized testimony of the 
three defendants 
the three are accused of conspiring with retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord to defraud the government by diverting 
armssale profits to the contras and obstructing inquiries by 
congress and meese about the operation 
the indictment includes charges that poindexter and north made 
false statements to congress by denying their involvement in the 
private network supplying the contras and destroyed evidence during 
meeses probe 
secord who was hakims business partner testified on capitol 
hill without an immunity grant 
the socalled use immunity bars walsh from using an 
individual defendants compelled congressional testimony as 
evidence against that person 
but in a brief filed by special counsel herbert j stern the 
independent counsel contended that many answers by the three 
defendants fell outside the immunity grant because they were 
volunteered 
volunteered testimony by defendants in their congresional 
testimony is not immunized and may be directly introduced at trial 
against them said stern who was retained to handle the immunity 
issues 
walsh offered to forgo the use of congressional testimony as 
direct evidence against the defendants if the court would dispose 
of the immunity issue 
but the prosecution cited hundreds of examples of congressional 
testimony it contends could be used as evidence against the 
defendants 
the transcripts reveal that the defendants intended to answer 
questions that were not asked to volunteer information that they 
wished to disclose and to go beyond any fair reading of many of 
the questions that were asked the brief said 
supreme court decisions clearly demonstrate that defendants 
may not turn an immunity grant into a license to volunteer 
information to bar prosecution the independent counsel said 
the defense in a separate filing called the claim simply 
absurd 
each defendant claimed his privilege at the very outset and 
never relinquished it lawyers for north poindexter and hakim 
said in a joint filing the court should flatly reject the ics 
independent counsels attempt to circumvent the immunity 
statute 
defense lawyers also urged the judge to dismiss the indictment 
on the ground that walsh took insufficient steps to isolate his 
staff from the defendants immunized testimony which has seeped 
into every corner of this case 
but the independent counsel defended his procedures arguing 
that the defense had failed to show that the investigation had 
illegally relied on immunized testimony 
walsh urged us district judge gerhard a gesell to set a trial 
date arguing that the defense request for further proceedings on 
the immunity issue amounted to a transparent attempt at delay

but there was no assurance that borders will break his silence 
on the case borders previously has refused to testify against 
hastings his close friend and never testified at his or hastings 
trials 
the subcommittee which will meet again on tuesday is eager to 
ask borders the critical question of whether hastings was ever 
aware that his friend was arranging a 150000 bribe for him 
hastings was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring with borders to 
solicit the bribe from the two convicted racketeers frank and tom 
romano in exchange for a promise of lenient sentences 
the subcommittee is investigating charges by a special 
fivejudge panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta that hastings actually took part in the bribery scheme and 
tried to conceal his involvement by lying under oath and 
fabricating evidence at his trial 
when fbi agents arrested borders in his car outside a suburban 
arlington va hotel in october 1981 hours before an evening 
boating party to have been held by fellow lawyers in borders honor 
they found a garment bag stuffed with 125000 in cash on the 
front seat 
the money had just been delivered to borders as the final bribe 
payment by an undercover fbi agent who sat in the car posing as 
frank romano 
another hastings friend hemphill pride testified thursday that 
when he told the judge of borders arrest later that day he was 
shocked he looked like his mouth went dry he couldnt believe it 
happened 
hastings then hurriedly left washington to return to florida 
the judicial investigative panel concluded that hastings fled 
because he knew he was criminally involved with borders in the 
romano bribery scheme 
his fellow judges in a 381page report on the affair said 
hastings boarded a flight from an airport near baltimore instead of 
washington because he wanted to avoid being interviewed by the 
fbi 
the results of the 3year judicial investigation were outlined 
by new york lawyer john doar a former assistant us attorney 
general and special counsel to the house judiciary committee during 
the watergate impeachment proceedings against president nixon in 
1974 
doar said the appellate panel had uncovered evidence not 
available to the trial jury that hastings had given false testimony 
about a series of telephone calls and had drafted phony letters 
intended to obscure his alleged involvement in the bribery 
conspiracy 
under questioning by house investigators doar said he had found 
no evidence of any racial motivation behind hastings prosecution 
or the subsequent inquiry by the judicial panel 
if the subcommittee recommends impeachment and the full 
judiciary committee concurs the house must vote whether to impeach 
hastings then the senate would conduct a trial a twothirds 
majority vote of the senate is required for conviction and removal 
from office

a new coalition of preservationists says 
national parks across the country face threats from commercial 
development similar to a plan by a virginia company to build a 
shopping mall next to the manassas national battlefield 
at 175 parks the threat is so significant that the reason the 
park was established may be lost paul pritchard one of the 
founders of the national heritage coalition said thursday 
pritchard said other endangered parks include richmond and 
fredericksburgspotsylvania in virginia gettysburg pa the 
everglades national park in florida and olympic national park in 
washington 
at a press conference pritchard and other opponents of the 
manassas shopping mall announced their intention to stop it and any 
other project that endangers a historic site 
president carters former press secretary jody powell is 
helping the group free of charge with public relations and 
organized the gathering 
the coalition sponsored by the national trust for historic 
preservation and the national parks and conservation association 
is calling for congress to enact legislation giving the federal 
government power to halt development temporarily so that 
negotiation compromise or federal acquisition of disputed property 
can take place 
as part of its project to protect the manassas battlefield the 
coalition is working for passage of a bill recently introduced by 
reps michael andrews dtexas and robert mrazek dny that 
directs the interior secretary to acquire the land now owned by 
developers 
meanwhile bulldozing is under way to prepare for townhouses and 
detached homes that will accompany the shopping mall bob kelly 
spokesman for the developer hazelpeterson co said nothing can 
stop construction short of an act of congress 
the acreage in question includes the site where confederate gen 
robert e lee directed troops for the second battle of manassas and 
includes land used for hospital space and as a burial ground for 
some of the war dead 
though the land has been part of a master plan for expanding the 
4500acre park since 1935 it never was acquired by the federal 
government and hazelpeterson bought it about three years ago for 
10 million 
the interior department is promoting a compromise in which the 
developer would move the mall so it is not visible from the park 
the plan is acceptable to hazelpeterson but not the 
preservationists who say even the mall still will generate so much 
traffic that visitors wont be able to get to the park without 
massive traffic jams 
fifteen organizations including the american association of 
museums the american association of state and local history the 
council on americas military past the national center for 
preservation law the society of civil war historians and the 
wilderness society are included in the national heritage coalition

the reagan administration has approved 10 
million to monitor compliance with the nicaraguan peace process 
drawing congressional criticism for taking so long to decide how to 
use the money 
the money was part of a 48 million package approved by congress 
in late march a week after nicaraguas leftist government and the 
contra rebels signed a temporary truce at sapoa nicaragua 
that agreement called for the creation of a verification 
commission to monitor compliance with the accord 
of the funds 8 million will go for activities of joao baena 
soares secretary general of the organization of american states 
and 2 million for cardinal miguel obando y bravo leader of the 
nicaraguan roman catholic church 
the allocations are based on a budget submitted by the 
commission to which the two men belong 
shortly after the grant was announced house speaker jim wright 
dtexas criticized the administration for taking six weeks to 
determine how to spend the funds other democrats have made the 
same criticism 
money for the verification commission had been held up because 
the state department and the oas were unable to agree on a proposal 
that met us goverment accounting requirements 
this drew an angry reaction from rep tony coelho dcalif who 
said that us officials were demanding an elaborate accounting 
system from the oas on the one hand while on the other they were 
giving money to the contras and letting it simply disappear into 
the jungle 
in announcing the grant the administration launched a harsh 
attack on the sandinista government 
the administrator of the agency for international development 
alan woods charged that nicaragua had engaged in a campaign of 
harassment and intimidation and menacing militarism in 
apparent violation of agreements signed by sandinista authorities 
alan woods said in letters to baena soares and obando y bravo 
anyone who shares our interest in peace democracy and 
reconciliation in nicaragua must be greatly alarmed by the recent 
crackdown on human rights and civil liberties by the sandinista 
government 
this barrage of harassment and intimidation makes it clear 
that the verification commission must fully monitor the very 
fundamental issues of democracy civil liberties and human rights 
woods told the commission members that a series of incidents in 
recent weeks has undermined the process of reconciliation to 
which the nicaraguan government committed itself 
he said the process is being further scuttled by the nicaraguan 
governments menacing militarism he cited a statement by 
nicaraguan defense minister humberto ortega in which he threatened 
the contras with actions on a scale never before seen in this 
war 
woods also said nicaraguan authorities have placed severe 
limitations on press freedom and that more than 30 persons 
supporting construction workers conducting a hunger strike were 
arrested 
the sandinistas and the contras are attempting to negotiate a 
permanent settlement but have made little progress the deadline 
for reaching an agreement is june 1

the global economy is changing too rapidly for 
governments to successfully impose major changes in the way they 
manage exchange rates us treasury secretary james a baker iii 
said today 
baker said he favors gradual stepbystep efforts to improve 
coordination of monetary policy among the major industrialized 
countries 
he cited as an example a possible broadening of coordination on 
national tax reform and deregulation of financial and labor 
markets the united states also could work more closely with its 
major trading partners in monitoring the performance of their 
economies he said 
but in remarks prepared for delivery to the council on foreign 
relations baker ruled out any sweeping revolutionary changes in 
the system 
his appearance before the council was closed to the news media 
copies of his speech were made available in advance 
baker met on wednesday and thursday in paris with trade and 
finance ministers from the 24 members of the organization for 
economic cooperation and development 
an attempt to make an abrupt or major change in the structure 
of the system by imposing a detailed set of formal constraints 
might well be viewed by the markets as overly ambitious and 
unsustainable baker said 
the global economy is too dynamic and the forces of change 
too strong to be able to look ahead with great certainty and 
envision a highly defined international monetary structure that 
will fit the world economy of 1995 as well as that of 2005 he 
added 
baker told reporters after the oecd meeting thursday that the 
seven largest industrial countries were pleased with the relative 
stability of exchange rates since last december when they jointly 
bought massive amounts of dollars in the open market in order to 
halt its steep decline 
we see no reason to believe that that wont continue baker 
said 
in his speech to the foreign relations group baker said the 
major economic powers efforts since 1985 to improve monetary 
coordination had been a remarkable although incomplete success 
i strongly suspect the world economy is better off today than 
we would have been had we not followed this course he said 
some government officials and private experts have said the 
world monetary system should undergo more radical reforms than 
suggested by baker 
a study published earlier this month by the institute for 
international economics in washington said existing international 
agreements on ways of keeping exchange rates stable were 
agonizingly fragile 
the issue of reforms to the world monetary system is expected to 
be discussed at a june 1921 summit meeting in tornoto of leaders 
from the united states canada britain france west germany 
italy and japan

the house is expected to act quickly on 
legislation requiring lenders to make full disclosure of what one 
of the sponsors calls the potential pitfalls of home equity 
loans 
rep charles schumer dny a major sponsor of the bill said 
he expected it to become law rapidly after clearing the house 
banking committee on thursday by a unanimous voice vote he noted 
the senate has already approved a similar but less stringent 
measure 
home equity loans can be like a loaded pistol said schumer 
consumers need to beware or they can blow up in their face 
the legislation requires lenders to make full disclosure on home 
equity loan accounts so that new applicants can know exactly what 
it is they are applying for 
lenders would have to provide information on the annual interest 
percentage rate any fees associated with the loan a series of 
warnings about the risks involved and a description of repayment 
options 
with the passage of the bill the committee is taking the 
mystery out of the home equity loans and hopefully providing 
consumers with a guide to the potential pitfalls of home equity 
loans he said 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the house banking 
consumer affairs subcommittee which handled the bill echoed the 
sentiments of schumer and other proponents of the legislation 
this legislation enables consumers to know that home equity 
loans have risks as well as benefits annunzio said this 
legislation will assure that they receive at the time of 
application all the information necessary to make an informed 
decision whether to apply for such a loan 
in addition it will strictly limit areas which were 
susceptible to abuse by the unilateral action of creditors 
the bill also provides for other consumer protections 
a prohibition on a creditor unilaterally changing the terms of 
the loan contract 
requiring the use of publicly available indexes outside the 
control of the lender when the rate of interest varies 
restrictions on the lender from calling in the loan before the 
term of the loan 
a right to obtain a refund of application fees if the lender 
changes the terms after an application is submitted but before the 
account is opened 
the committees action was lauded by consumer organizations but 
the american bankers association said the disclosure and 
advertising provisions are impractical they will result in an 
unnecessary overload of information for consumers and they will 
severely limit the creditors ability to design informative 
advertisements 
home equity loans a line of credit available to borrowers who 
provide their homes as collateral have grown more popular in 
recent years especially since interest on them is tax deductible 
in most cases 
consumer groups report that home equity lending doubled between 
1986 and 1987 from 40 billion to 80 billion

the teamsters union accepted a new trucking 
industry contract that was overwhelmingly rejected in rankandfile 
balloting with a teamsters official saying members who didnt vote 
probably favored it 
the union said thursday that 64101 truckers voted to turn down 
the proposed threeyear national master freight agreement while 
36782 supported the new proposal 
the 635 percent opposition vote fell short of the twothirds 
voting majority needed under teamster bylaws to reject a contract 
and authorize a strike under the unions constitution 6666 
percent of those voting have to turn down a proposed contract or it 
goes into effect automatically 
since the constitution requires that the final offer be 
accepted as a result of failure to reject by twothirds vote any 
strike or work stoppage will be a violation of the agreement and 
have serious consequences jack yager chairman of the union 
negotiating committee said in a statement 
yager said over 57 percent of the ballots mailed out were not 
returned he maintained that it was likely the 80000 members who 
did not return ballots were satisfied with the final offer 
if not they would have cast ballots rejecting the contract 
he said 
the new contract provides annual 35centsanhour wage gains 
over the next three years to some 200000 workers 
the contract raises the base rate for truck drivers from the 
current 1471 an hour to 1506 an hour retroactive to april 1 
this would be followed by similar 35cent hourly raises in 1989 and 
1990 
the contract proved unpopular with union truck drivers because 
of certain changes in work rules 
locals were upset over a provision of the agreement that would 
require all teamsters members at a trucking company that is losing 
money to give back 15 percent of their pay in exchange for a 
promised share of any future profits if 75 percent of the union 
members vote to do so 
another provision could force drivers to pay for loss of freight 
or for truck damage if their company proves gross negligence

women with early stage breast cancer would 
benefit from treatment in addition to initial surgery or radiation 
therapy the national cancer institute says citing three studies 
that have yet to be published 
such additional treatment chemotherapy or hormonal therapy or 
both has been the institutions formal recommendation for the 
past two years in cases involving more advanced breast cancer 
the nci announcement thursday shows the institute views the new 
findings significant enough to publicize before they are formally 
published in a medical journal or presented at a scientific meeting 
women with early stage breast cancer before it has spread to 
lymph nodes under the arm have been regarded as having a 
relatively favorable prognosis after primary treatment but it is 
now recognized that up to 30 percent have recurrences of their 
cancer the nci said 
the richness of the clinical evidence from a variety of trials 
now shows that this outlook can be improved upon nci director 
dr vincent t devita jr said 
the data that prompted the ncis statement were presented to the 
national cancer advisory board on may 9 and a special clinical 
alert was mailed monday to 13000 cancer specialists and cancer 
organizations 
each year more than 60000 women in this country are diagnosed 
with nodenegative breast cancer and we cannot delay informing 
them and their physicians that additional treatment beyond surgery 
andor radiotherapy may be beneficial devita said 
dr michael friedman an nci researcher said future us 
studies will focus on which forms of additional treatment are best 
rather than whether there is a benefit from any such treatment 
it is estimated that 135000 american women will get breast 
cancer this year and that 42000 will die from it one in 10 women 
will develop breast cancer in her lifetime 
the emerging information from the three american studies is 
consistent with a more mature body of information from european 
investigators the nci announcement said 
one us study of 679 patients found 80 percent of those given 
additional treatment were cancerfree after four years compared 
with 71 percent who were not given additional treatment 
the other study involved 2644 patients in which 82 percent of 
those given additional treatment were cancerfree after four years 
compared with 77 percent of those receiving a placebo 
the third involved about 350 patients and found 84 percent of 
those given additional treatment cancerfree after three years 
compared with 67 percent of those given a placebo

the house has been given a 143 billion 
foreign aid bill that represents a 2 percent increase over last 
years level and largely continues current programs 
on a voice vote thursday the house appropriations committee 
approved without amendment the bill passed earlier this month by 
its foreign operations subcommittee the bill covers the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 
there was little debate on the measure because congress has 
little flexibility in dealing with appropriations as a result of 
budgetcutting agreements reached late last year 
israel again would receive more than any other country under the 
bill some 18 billion in military aid and 12 billion in 
economic assistance 
egypt which is favored for making peace with israel receives 
the secondlargest amount 13 billion in military assistance and 
815 million in economic aid 
pakistan which has been regarded as a frontline country 
because of the soviet occupation of neighboring afghanistan would 
receive 220 million in economic aid and 240 million in forgiven 
loans for purchase of military goods 
the philippines would receive 124 million in economic aid and 
125 million in military aid 
some 90 million in economic support and 655 million in 
economic development money would be used for african countries 
in central america honduras would get 85 million in economic 
aid costa rica 90 million el salvador 185 million and guatemala 
80 million military aid for those and other countries was not 
earmarked but would come out of separate military aid and credit 
accounts 
the bill also would give economic aid of 40 million to 
portugal 20 million to morocco 10 million to tunisia 15 
million to cyprus between 10 million and 35 million for ireland 
and 2 million for polands solidarity trade union 
some 34 million would be set aside for middle east development 
projects of which 11 million is for projects in jordan and 23 
million for those in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
the bill would allocate 150 million to the peace corps 101 
million for international narcotics control 362 million for 
migration and refugee assistance 35 million for the prevention of 
aids worldwide and 254 million to pay pastdue debts of 
international financial institutions 
it would send 217 million to support a long list of united 
nations organizations and stipulate that the money for unicef must 
be obligated within 30 days of passage of the bill or the 
administration would suffer an automatic cut of 50 million in 
money for military aid 
it is up to the state department to decide how to divide up the 
balance of funds for nations not specifically mentioned in the 
bill about 100 countries receive us aid directly

pope john paul ii created a public 
forum for debate during his latest latin american tour shedding 
light on political conflict poverty and drug trafficking 
paraguay was the last and most sensitive stop on the pontiffs 
12day visit with local roman catholic church members criticizing 
the 34year authoritarian rule of president gen alfredo stroessner 
during his fournation visit the pope shared the stage with an 
impoverished bolivian miner heard pleas by perus president to 
help end terrorism and attended a gathering in paraguay that turned 
into a political protest rally 
the tour that began in uruguay may 7 and ended with his return 
to rome on thursday was john pauls ninth to latin america since 
becoming pope in 1978 
when the pope and stroessner met at the ornate 19th century 
presidential palace an announcer on the staterun television broke 
in to alert viewers that the leader of their country was about to 
speak 
paraguayans say an emotionless john paul often looked down at 
his hands during the encounter they also heard the pontiff preach 
to stroessner on human rights and political freedoms 
it was more remarkable the following day when the tv carried a 
speech by actress heddy gonzalez frutos denouncing political 
repression during a meeting with the pontiff that the government 
initially had canceled 
the society in which we live is marked by a profound sense of 
death and violence which are an affront to the rights and dignity 
of the children of god she told john paul 
an hour later during a stop in paraguays chaco region it was 
the turn of an indian leader to denounce whites for stealing their 
land 
john paul heard other messages as he journeyed high in the andes 
mountains and nearly to the amazon river 
a miner in oruro bolivia describing the plight of workers hit 
hard by the governments austerity program told the pope in 
emotional tones that they were out of work and hungry 
president alan garcia of peru his democratically elected 
government battling a deep economic crisis and a guerrilla 
insurgency denounced the interest rates his country is charged on 
loans from foreign banks and appealed to the pope to do what he 
could to halt the terrorist violence 
for his part john paul offered some fresh if general 
prescriptions for a region he called the continent of hope and 
which the vatican estimates will contain half the worlds 900 
million catholics by the turn of the century there now are about 
860 million catholics worldwide 
living a christian life does not mean simply accepting with 
resignation the difficulties that you encounter 
but he emphasized that latin americans must help themselves 
work hard and not expect outside aid will solve all their problems 
he told an audience in bolivia a major cocaineproducer that 
they needed to wage an urgent battle against drugtrafficking 
because corruption was destroying their society 
john paul heard stroessner call his government democratic and 
extol its lawandorder policies for keeping paraguay free of 
terrorism hunger and drugs 
but the following day the pope drew long applause for declaring 
that the broad participation of the public was a requisite for 
democracy 
stroessner the longestruling head of state in the western 
hemisphere has been criticized for failing to allow a genuine 
political opposition the pope endorsed the efforts of his local 
bishops to develop a pluralistic society

us negotiators should agree to seek 25 
billion over five years to keep military bases in the philippines 
on the condition that president corazon aquino move to allow the 
bases beyond 1991 says a report today from a conservative think 
tank 
the report by heritage foundation policy analyst richard d 
fisher also advocates the sale of modern jet fighters and naval 
warships to the philippine military and a review of the entire 
range of us actions to keep manila from expelling us forces 
a review of the bases agreement which lapses in 1991 is under 
way in manila with compensation for the bases a major issue 
neither side in the talks has indicated how much might be asked 
for or paid but suggestions by philippine officials have ranged to 
more than 1 billion a year over the current 180 million annual 
aid attached to us use of clark air base and subic naval base 
during the expiring fiveyear period 
actual military aid to the philippines during the five years 
will total about 17 billion says fisher in his report a 
strategy for keeping the us bases in the philippines 
the heritage foundation is a privately funded think tank which 
generally espouses conservative views often paralleling those of 
the reagan administration 
aid tied to the bases is one of three major financial packages 
being considered for the financially troubled philippines which is 
more than 28 billion in debt the administration according to 
sources is preparing to back a multinational effort to collect 10 
billion over five years in aid trade concessions and debt relief 
it has also asked congress to appropriate 257 million in aid for 
fiscal 1989 down 90 million from what congress appropriated last 
year 
us officials have suggested all the aid might be tied 
together but mrs aquino has said she supports the multinational 
aid idea only if it is not linked to what the philippines views as 
rent for the us bases 
fisher in his analysis calls the us military facilities in 
the philippines the american gibraltar in southeast asia 
saying that if the united states abandons them the soviet union 
will move in 
were the united states to withdraw from the bases moscow 
surely would be emboldened to give direct assistance to the cpp 
the communist party of the philippines he said philippine 
officials estimate that up to 25000 communist rebels are fighting 
the government and fisher says the communists now control 20 
percent of the countryside 
fisher criticizes philippine foreign secretary raul manglapus 
who lived in us exile during eight years of martial law under 
expresident ferdinand e marcos the report describes manglapus as 
a staunch nationalist apparently obsessed with the us colonial 
past 
manglapus has said the bases do not protect the philippines and 
if the united states cant increase the rent it should get out 
the heritage foundation analyst also scores mrs aquino for not 
taking a stand on the bases 
she has said only that she is keeping her options open until the 
current agreement is renegotiated sometime before 1991 
her vagueness tends to strengthen the hand of manglapus the 
report says 
a probases view is being expressed by philippine defense 
minister fidel v ramos who was in new york today after five days 
of meetings in washington 
ramos according to filipino sources close to the former chief 
military commander assured us officials that he believes the 
bases aid both philippine and regional security 
fisher said aquinos view will be crucial if the philippine 
senate decides to hold a referendum on the future of the bases 
fisher notes that while the philippine constitution proclaims 
a policy of freedom from nuclear weapons in its territory it 
also contains a loophole which might allow them because it says the 
policy must be consistent with the national interest 
philippine officials traveling with ramos say a bill to 
eliminate the loophole has strong support in the nations senate 
but has less chance in what they describe as the more proamerican 
house of representatives

michael dukakis making only passing 
references to the upcoming democratic presidential primary in 
california was placing his emphasis squarely on the fall campaign 
against republican george bush 
the democratic frontrunner who expects to lock up his partys 
presidential nomination with another windfall of delegates in the 
closing primaries on june 7 scheduled appearances today in los 
angeles sacramento and san francisco 
he flew into the state thursday and told a rally in los angeles 
that in the fall election voters would have a choice between two 
fundamentally different sets of values between two different sets 
of beliefs about how we build a strong economy about how we build 
the best america 
despite heckling by protesters claiming he was not doing or 
saying enough about aids dukakis drew repeated cheers from the 
crowd as he delivered a speech that belied his reputation as a dull 
speaker 
hecklers in the auditorium of the musicians hall on the west 
side of los angeles held up signs saying bush dukakis more 
aids deaths 
we need a president whos not afraid to talk about aids 
hecklers shouted 
when dukakis came to a section of his speech in which he 
referred to changing research priorities from the military to 
health care he referred to acquired immune deficiency syndrome as 
a disease that must be conquered and said massachusetts was 
spending more per case for aids than any other state in america 
homosexuals in massachusetts accused the governor of 
discriminating against them when he supported giving heterosexual 
couples preference in adopting foster children 
the only references dukakis made to his democratic primary rival 
jesse jackson were tributes to the fact the democratic race had 
come down to choice between the son of greek immigrants and a black 
man born in poverty in the south 
he hardly mentioned the june 7 primary instead referring 
several times to the importance of california in the fall election 
the election this fall will be the most important and closest 
since 1960 he said and it may well be decided right here in 
california 
he sounded his familiar themes of the need to attract more 
people to teaching of the need for a broader health care system 
for child care and for a war on drugs 
one of the loudest cheers came when he said on january 20 
1989 were going to have an attorney general no matter who she 
or he is that will put the word justice back in the 
department of justice

a quotation that former press secretary larry 
speakes fabricated closely resembles something president reagan 
recalls telling soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev reagan says 
speakes confession of fabricated quotes drew harsh 
condemnations from the white house when his book speaking out 
was released early last month 
but reagan told foreign broadcasters thursday that actually i 
have to say he was not too far wrong with some of the things that 
were said at our his and gorbachevs earlier summit meetings 
in his book speakes said that during reagans first summit with 
gorbachev in geneva in november 1985 he manufactured a quote in 
the presidents name speakes quoted reagan as telling gorbachev 
privately that there is much that divides us but i believe the 
world breathes easier because we are talking here together 
on thursday reagan when asked to assess the impact of the 
speakes revelations on the presidents dealings with gorbachev

presidential candidate carlos salinas 
de gortari said mexico will not pay its foreign debt if the burden 
of its loan obligations keeps the countrys economy from growing 
salinas de gortari also pledged to open mexico to foreign 
investment loosen state restrictions on the economy and guide the 
nation into the battle for international markets 
the nominee of the governing institutional revolutionary party 
and the man virtually certain to succeed president miguel de la 
madrid chose this conservative industrial city to outline his 
economic policy 
the pri as the governing party is known by its spanish 
initials has not lost a presidential or gubernatorial election 
since it was founded in 1929 
in a speech thursday night salinas de gortari told businessmen 
in this northeastern city near his family home that mexicos 
limping economy will grow again 
he promised a policy of cooperation with foreign creditors 
instead of irresponsible formulas of confrontation 
mexicos foreign debt is about 100 billion the second highest 
in the developing world after brazil mexico has been meeting 
payments on its foreign loans and has built up a record amount of 
foreign reserves 
it has negotiated with its creditors for easier terms on the 
foreign debt and is seeking more ways to ease the payment burden 
but economic growth will have priority over payments on the 
foreign debt salinas de gortari said if we fail to grow because 
of the burden of the debt we will not pay he added 
the candidate was cheered as he spoke of curtailing government 
controls reducing budget deficits and letting private business 
invest in such areas as telecommunications petrochemicals and 
other fields that have been reserved for state investments 
previous administations have favored a more centralized economy 
and tight economic controls 
we will consolidate the opening of our markets and we will 
promote foreign investment salinas de gortari told the gathering 
the opening of our economy to the foreign competition is an 
irreversible fact he said foreign investments must play a 
more positive role contributing to the creation of jobs to 
technological modernization and the opening of foreign markets 
he stressed the need to eliminate subsidies and exercise 
financial discipline to make economic growth possible 
salinas de gortari said the time was past in mexico when the 
state was the only instrument for the solution of each and every 
problem of the economy and society 
in this new strategy to develop exports you will have to take 
chances he told the businessmen 
mexicos economy has been seriously affected in the past six 
years by rocketing inflation that reached a record 1592 percent in 
1987 
the government this year has managed to reduce the inflation 
rate by persuading labor unions and private businesses to sign a 
solidarity pact that has put a lid on prices and wages in 
recent months 
we have no option salinas de gortari said either we 
succeed in making the economy work or the adverse social impacts 
will magnify 
presidential elections are scheduled for july 6 with the winner 
sworn in on dec 1 for a sixyear term in office

if the 100 dogs at nabisco brands testing 
center are any indication the cracker company may have a winner on 
its hands with its new doggie breath fresheners meant to improve 
fidos social skills 
the dogs on fulltime staff at the sherburne ny testing 
center have sampled the new version of milkbone dog biscuits and 
are begging for more nabisco spokesman mark gutsche said thursday 
theyve given it their fivepaw rating he said 
the new product combines dog biscuits with breath mints the 
biscuits which will debut nationwide by the end of the month are 
designed to clean teeth like regular milkbones but also improve a 
dogs breath 
there is a problem with halitosis among dogs gutsche said 
this delivers the regular benefits plus the added benefits of 
mint 
others were skeptical 
milkbone is a good product but i dont think anything will 
work on a dogs breath except activated charcoal which absorbs 
odors said 45year veteran veterinarian harold s smith of milford 
a dogs diet which consists primarily of meat lends itself to 
bad breath said smith a past president of the new jersey state 
veterinarians association 
they dont exactly have the best breath in the world he 
said theres no such thing as babys breath for a dog

the tattered object was pink 
an unusual color for alan mcfarland to spot in his iowa farm field 
so he stopped to look 
what he found was a broken balloon with an invitation attached 
to visit surrey mcfarlands first question was where the sam 
hill is surrey 
its 1340 miles northwest of whiting iowa as the balloon 
flies 
mcfarland said he was planting soybeans monday when he found the 
invitation to visit surrey bc canada 
if it hadnt been pink i dont think i would have even 
stopped but thats an unusual color to come across out there in 
the dirt he said in a telephone interview wednesday with the 
vancouver sun surrey is a vancouver suburb 
mcfarland 52 called the surrey chamber of commerce and learned 
his discovery was one of 2000 helium balloons released saturday to 
kick off tourism week each carried a chance to win a trip to 
surrey 
the trip will be awarded to the person farthest from surrey who 
finds a balloon and contacts the chamber of commerce before may 31 
dianne rempel of the chamber of commerce said wednesday that two 
balloons recovered in montana were the only others found outside 
british columbia to date 
meanwhile a man in shawnee okla said thursday he hasnt had 
the same luck tracking down the origins of a balloon he found a few 
weeks ago 
bob james doesnt have any idea just how far the balloon 
traveled before he snared it behind the factory where he works 
inside it contained a message from whitmore elementary but 
didnt include the name of the town 
the oklahoma education department checked its records but could 
find no whitmore elementary in the state 
james said he and a coworker spotted the white balloon may 4 as 
it drifted to the ground they noticed something inside and joked 
about splitting the contents 
but it contained no promise of a free trip only a note about 
eating plenty of fruit and getting eight hours of sleep a night

faddish oneshot strategies for quitting 
smoking such as sensory deprivation and injections usually wont 
hack it alone says a survey that concludes the best course is 
getting a doctors advice and support from others 
the us preventive services task force reviewed 39 studies of 
stopsmoking techniques they ranged from the oneshot 
strategies to combinations of techniques like physician counseling 
nicotine gum and behavioral therapy 
success was not associated with novel or unusual 
interventions the research team reports in todays journal of 
the american medical association 
rather than quick fixes the best way to stop smoking is through 
direct counseling from physicians and other experts as well as the 
use of stopsmoking groups booklets and selfhelp tapes says a 
coauthor of the report dr thomas e kottke of the mayo clinic in 
rochester minn 
i would tell the patient to avoid some of the very 
highcost programs that offer some kind of magical approach he 
said in a telephone interview thursday they arent worth the 
money and rarely work 
kottke said he advises physicians to find out what kind of 
program a smoker would feel most comfortable with and make a 
selection on that basis 
acupuncture or hypnotism by themselves dont seem to work 
for long he said but there are cases where the patient has 
good rapport with the hypnotherapist or acupuncturist and gets lots 
of prolonged contact with them then they can work 
kottke cautioned in the report there is no single 
intervention method clearly more effective for all people than the 
other methods 
instead success in quitting was found to be the product of 
personalized smokingcessation advice and assistance repeated in 
different forms by several sources over the longest feasible 
period said the survey by the governmentcoordinated research 
group 
nicotine gum was helpful but it is available only through 
prescription and not everyone can use it kottke said in the 
interview 
he found the rate of smokers taking up the habit again is 
amazingly high 
about a quarter of the people who try to quit relapse within 
two days and half do in a week he said 
kottke said researchers found the recidivism rate was 
closely related to the length of time the smoker underwent 
counseling without repeated and prolonged contact in person 
by telephone or by letter the best techniques can fail 
a related report in the journal said a bloodpressure drug 
called clonidine has been shown effective in reducing the craving 
to smoke and helping people quit 
that study focused on 71 heavy smokers who had tried 
unsuccessfully to quit thirtythree took clonidine and 38 took a 
placebo with neither group knowing which it was taking all 
subjects underwent behavioral therapy 
six months after discontinuing medication 27 percent of the 
clonidine subjects reported they were still not smoking compared 
with 5 percent of those who took the placebo the researchers said 
clonidine also marketed as catapres inhibits some of the 
action of the nervous system 
its success in helping people quit smoking is similar to that 
reported with nicotine gum but clonidine may eventually prove 
superior because it doesnt perpetuate nicotine dependence the 
study suggested

attorneys for evan mecham planned to spend 
the weekend weeding out obviously biased candidates for the jury in 
the former governors criminal trial on charges he concealed a 
campaign loan 
the trial began thursday when 100 prospective jurors were sworn 
in and filled out long questionnaires aimed in part at eliminating 
people who may have been influenced by the publicity surrounding 
the case 
there goes my weekend said mechams defense lawyer michael 
scott noting that attorneys on both sides hope to analyze the 
forms before meeting again monday 
mecham 64 and his brother willard are charged with 
concealing the 350000 campaign loan by failing to report it on 
the former governors campaign or personal finance statements 
mecham a republican is charged with six felony counts of 
perjury willful concealment and filing false documents willard 
mecham his brothers 1986 campaign treasurer faces three similar 
counts 
mecham was removed from office last month when the state senate 
convicted him on impeachment charges he could face up to 22 years 
in prison if convicted of all six counts in the trial while his 
brother could be sentenced to up to 9 years if convicted on the 
three counts he faces 
neither attended thursdays initial session in maricopa county 
superior court scott said mecham probably will attend court next 
week after the questioning of potential jurors begins 
the questionnaire was worked out by the prosecution defense and 
trial judge michael ryan 
among the 99 questions were whether the panelists know anyone 
involved in the case whether they signed or circulated petitions 
for or against mecham while he was governor and whether they belong 
to the john birch society 
also they were asked whether they knew anyone on a long list of 
people associated with mecham or his criminal case 
the former governor has refused to predict whether he will fare 
better in court than at his impeachment trial the senate removed 
mecham on april 4 15 months into his first term by convicting him 
of trying to thwart a death threat investigation and of misusing 
80000 from the governors protocol fund by loaning the money to 
his auto dealership 
mecham was also impeached on charges of concealing the 350000 
loan but the senate decided not to consider that charge for fear 
of prejudicing mechams criminal trial 
prosecutors said the mechams failed to report the loan from 
tempe developer barry wolfson until after a newspaper reported it 
in october 1987 
on wednesday a state supreme court justice refused a defense 
request to delay the trial until the high court considers a defense 
motion to return the charges to the grand jury the arizona supreme 
court is to hear arguments on that issue june 1 
the defense filed two new motions released thursday one asks 
the judge to dismiss the charges based on a claim that the campaign 
and personal finance reporting laws are unconstitutionally vague 
ambiguous imprecise and overbroad 
the other asks that the charges be remanded to the grand jury 
for a new finding of whether probable cause exists that motion 
argued that grand jury materials were improperly turned over to the 
prosecutors in mechams impeachment trial 
ryan did not schedule arguments on the motions

morale among prosecutors and drug agents battling 
narcotics trafficking could be undermined if drug charges are 
dropped against panamanian strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
say those involved in the case 
why are we prosecuting all these people asked us attorney 
leon kellner why are we investigating all these people who do 
drugs when people who sit outside this country and allow their own 
countries to be used for drug trafficking can make deals without 
even our input 
jack hook spokesman for the us drug enforcement 
administration in miami said the handling of the noriega case 
sends one signal to the law enforcement community and sends a 
totally opposite signal to the drug traffickers in south america 
are we just wasting our time he asked 
kellner whose office brought the indictment against noriega 
was in washington last week to try to block any deal for dropping 
the charges he criticized his exclusion from the reagan 
administrations negotiations with noriega 
i have not had a single phone call from anybody he said 
wednesday im upset apparently i guess im going to find out 
whats going to happen to our cases at the same time as everybody 
else does 
not long before the reports of the negotiations with noriega 
surfaced kellner announced late last month he would be leaving the 
us attorneys post to rejoin his old law firm he said he was 
leaving for personal reasons 
chief assistant us attorney richard gregorie said the 
possibility of a political defeat in the noriega case has crushed 
his spirit and that of other prosecutors and agents in miami who 
worked on the case 
weve spent a lot of time and effort making this case he 
said the assistants who worked on the case in this office and 
myself would certainly be most disappointed if the case is not 
allowed to go forward 
other prosecutors however had mixed reactions to the noriega 
negotiations 
assistant us attorney charles senatore a prosecutor in the 
public corruption section said he differentiates between any 
political decisions that go on in washington and my job of 
fighting crime here in this district 
noriega was indicted in february in miami and tampa on drug and 
racketeering charges the reagan administration is conducting 
negotiations to drop the charges in exchange for noriegas 
agreement to step aside as leader of the troubled nation

lawyers for detained palestinians claimed the 
israeli military justice system has buckled under a flood of arab 
inmates but army sources said prisons will be centralized and 
computerized for efficiency 
many of the thousands of palestinians imprisoned during the 
5monthold uprising in the occupied lands are held incommunicado 
for weeks or miss court appearances because authorities cant 
locate them their lawyers said thursday 
its a big mess israeli lawyer lea tsemel told the 
associated press the army is completely inefficient 
also thursday leftwing israeli legislator dedi zucker issued 
new figures on detentions he said 1900 arabs one in every 200 
men over 18 are being held in jail for six months without trial 
another 8100 palestinians are in prison awaiting trial or 
serving sentences for specific charges zucker said 
similar figures were released by law in the service of man a 
human rights monitoring group founded by west bank lawyers the 
organization said between 7000 and 9000 palestinians are in 
jails in addition to about 2000 administrative detainees held 
without trial 
since the uprising started dec 8 17000 palestinians 4 
percent of the male population over 14 have been detained said 
jonathan kuttab a lawyer and member of the human rights group 
army officials refused comment saying they had to check their 
detention figures 
israel radio today quoted the army legal adviser in the west 
bank lt col dudu yahav a saying 1800 palestinians were being 
held without trial in administrative detention 
most are leaders of the outlawed youth group shabibe which is 
linked to the palestine liberation organizations mainstream fatah 
faction yahav was quoted as saying 
he said most detainees were being held without trial because 
there was insufficient evidence to bring them to court 
a military prosecutor said last week that 5000 palestinians 
were being held including 1700 in administrative detention 
according to un figures 191 palestinians have been killed 
since antioccupation protests began in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip two israelis also have died israel seized the lands 
from egypt and jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
the army has built five detention centers in israel and the 
occupied lands to accommodate those detained during the unrest and 
has housed some detainees in 17 other prisons 
a military source said thursday that the army is adopting 
several measures to make the west bank prison system more efficient 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said the army 
plans to appoint a highranking officer to oversee all prisons in 
the west bank install a computer in each facility to keep track of 
prisoners and close smaller detention centers 
and a senior officer in the west banks central command 
identified only as lt col shuki was quoted as saying that 
detainees with the same legal status will be housed in the same 
prison 
all administrative detainees will be moved to a prison camp in 
israels southern negev desert the domestic itim news agency 
quoted shuki as saying 
lawyers for palestinian prisoners were skeptical about the plans 
we have filed many complaints and now they say they are going 
to organize everything said ms tsemel weve been hearing 
this for two months 
ms tsemel said she and several colleagues sent a letter to the 
army on wednesday saying the lawyers strike if the situation does 
not improve 
lawyer felicia langer who has represented more than 100 
palestinians said she often searched for clients two or three 
weeks before prison authorities located them 
even those who are charged are sometimes not brought to court 
on the date of their trial ms langer added 
the only thing that will improve the situation is to release 
people and not to treat them as animals dehumanize them she 
added 
israeli officials have denied allegations of mistreatment and 
inefficiency 
shuki was quoted by israel radio today as saying that three 
soldiers were investigated recently on charges they mistreated 
prisoners and three detainees were released after a probe showed 
they were being held without justification 
in another development thursday the west banks military 
government permitted reunification of 40 palestinian families as a 
goodwill gesture 
the government applies stringent standards in issuing residency 
permits often granting only temporary tourist visas to 
foreignborn spouses of west bank residents as a result hundreds 
of palestinian families are separated

convention 
richard austin secretary of state for the past 17 years and 
consistently the highest votegetter among candidates for statewide 
office has decided to stay in michigan instead of joining fellow 
democrats in atlanta 
he will become michigans acting governor while gov james 
blanchard is in atlanta 
im going to be minding the store austin said thursday 
the governor has informed me that he has some things that he 
feels might develop 
if austin hadnt agreed to stay behind there would have been a 
dramatic though brief philosophical change in the control of 
state government 
all four of the top elected officials in the state are 
democrats blanchard lt gov martha griffiths austin who is 
third in line of succession and attorney general frank kelley 
kelley blanchard and lt gov martha griffiths are going to be 
convention delegates 
if austin joined the other top elected democrats in crossing the 
state line at the same time michigan would get a republican as 
substitute governor senate pro tempore nick smith of addison who 
has been fifth in line of succession for 17 months and has yet to 
get a shot at the top

rebel leaders are refusing to hold the 
next round of peace talks in managua unless the leftist government 
lifts restrictions on the media and allows the contras to move 
freely in the capital city 
the contras as the rebels are known also disagreed on thursday 
with a sandinista government statement that a third round of peace 
talks has been scheduled the government reported wednesday that 
negotiators would meet may 2528 
contra leaders said they would prefer the talks resume today in 
the dominican republic costa rica guatemala or mexico 
the government statement said the site of the talks was 
undecided but that the sandinistas proposed that they take place 
in managua where two rounds of negotiations have been held 
the usbacked contras complained that during the previous 
sessions the government forced them to remain in a hotel near the 
international airport and prevented them from meeting with internal 
opposition leaders 
in their statement thursday the contras said they would return 
to managua only if the government agreed to suspend all 
censorship of communications media and end the threats and 
mistreatment by sandinista officials against independent 
broadcasters 
the statement read to the associated press by telephone from 
miami said the contras should be allowed to meet local opposition 
leaders and make their case on radio and television 
the government said wednesday it would allow the rebels to meet 
with the main opposition group the nicaraguan democratic 
coordinate at the hotel where they stayed before the rebels want 
to stay at a more centrally located site 
negotiations are aimed at reaching a permanent truce in the 
civil war which began in november 1981 the two sides signed an 
agreement on march 23 for a 60day ceasefire that expires may 30 
negotiators have been unable to work out details for a permanent 
truce although they have agreed on seven zones where the rebels 
are to gather during a ceasefire 
the two sides remain far apart on such issues as democratic 
reforms and what role contra leaders will play in nicaraguas 
political future 
in another development the reagan administration on thursday 
announced approval of a 10 million grant to monitor compliance 
with the nicaraguan peace process 
in san jose costa rica contra rebel leader alfredo cesar said 
a recent split in contra ranks over the military leadership of col 
enrique bermudez has been resolved 
cesar a director of the contra umbrella group the miamibased 
nicaraguan resistance said the internal military conflict 
provoked by several commanders now has been overcome and col 
bermudez was confirmed in his job as supreme military chief of our 
forces 
there were reports late last week that up to 4000 contra 
guerrillas gathered around a base camp in yamales 20 miles north 
of the honduran border to protest bermudez command 
sources had said some rebels charged bermudez with corruption 
and inefficiency 
cesar said there were only about 200 dissidents at the base camp 
i can guarantee 100 percent that our troops are now unified 
again and support the directorship of the nicaraguan resistance in 
the negotations that we have with the sandinista government said 
cesar

the proposals are gargantuan a 400mile grand 
canal from the icy rivers of northern canada to the great lakes or 
an irrigation trench through the rocky mountains to the parched 
american west 
could the uscanada free trade agreement now in the process 
of ratification make such massive diversions of fresh water a 
reality 
the subject was debated thursday when two canadian experts 
disclosed that the trade agreement treats water like newsprint 
computers and other goods now subject to tariffs 
the treaty will eliminate those tariffs and offer the united 
states national treatment when it comes to canadian water said 
former trade negotiator mel clark and don gamble of the rawson 
academy of aquatic science in ottawa 
the discovery they said contradicts claims by the conservative 
government of prime minister brian mulroney that water was not part 
of the trade deal 
when questioned in parliament trade minister john crosbie 
indirectly confirmed that water exports are possible under the 
treaty 
but crosbie told opponents that canada cannot be forced to sell 
water or any other natural resource 
we are not obliged to sell one thimbleful of water to the 
united states he said citing a federal announcement last 
november that largescale water diversions will not be contemplated 
frank quinn of the governments inland waters directorate told 
the associated press that canada wanted water exempted from the 
trade deal but abandoned the demand in final compromises with us 
negotiators 
in the 11th hour we didnt get all the changes we wanted 
he said 
quinn said the world general agreement on tariffs and trade 
which both countries recognize allows a member to ban exports of 
natural resources on grounds of conservation and environmental 
protection 
on that basis he said canada will not permit diversions of 
fresh water 
quinn said canadas pledge under the free trade agreement to 
share energy resources in times of crisis only covers items 
currently exported such as gas and oil 
were not now exporting water only dribs and drabs he said 
border towns in alberta manitoba and new brunswick export small 
quantities to local water systems in montana north dakota and 
maine and there are proposals to export water by tanker from 
british columbia and quebec 
in any case quinn said even the thirstiest us states are no 
longer considering longdistance diversions because of the cost 
instead they are focusing on a transition from agricultural to 
municipal use of local water 
should the united states run dry canada does seem a handy 
solution 
with 7 percent of the worlds land area canada has 9 percent of 
its renewable fresh water supply and only 1 percent of its 
population eight percent of the country is covered by lakes 
the problem is that 60 percent of the water flows north toward 
the arctic and is inaccessible to most canadians who live huddled 
near the us border 
thus the grand schemes 
newfoundland engineer tom kierans has spent 30 years promoting 
his dream of turning arizona desert into lush farmland with water 
diverted from the rivers of northern quebec and ontario now 
flowing north into james bay 
pumping stations would propel the water into a grand canal 
across the canadian shield to the ottawa river and on to lake 
huron from the great lakes it would be pumped to the prairies and 
desert the estimated cost of construction alone 100 billion 
the same pricetag was put on a 1964 idea proposed by ralph m 
parsons ltd california engineers to divert the yukon and 
mckenzie rivers through the rocky mountain trench of western canada 
into the united states 
a comprehensive canadian study in 1985 advised a cautious 
approach to such projects but called it imprudent to reject all 
exports out of hand 
the author of that report professor peter pearse of the 
university of british columbia told the ap the grand canal was 
not in anybodys interest on ecological or economic grounds 
he said it would cost 2000 per thousand cubic meters simply to 
get the water to the us southwest 
environmentalists oppose transferring water from one basin to 
another because of the ecological impact and disruption to indians 
and inuit dependent on fishing and hunting 
its always been a fear that this is on somebodys agenda 
said julia langer canadian director of the friends of the earth 
we havent paid enough attention to real water conservation to be 
even considering these kinds of megaprojects

a vietnamera law that has been the focus of a 
longrunning fight between the white house and congress may be 
overhauled by a proposal introduced in the senate 
our goal is to make the statute more workable said senate 
majority leader robert byrd dwva a sponsor of the measure to 
reform the war powers act 
frankly if i were president i would thumb my nose at this 
legislation the war powers act has never really worked said 
byrd thursday about the existing legislation 
the law enacted in 1973 requires a report from the president 
when us military personnel are sent to situations of imminent 
hostilities under some circumstances those troops must be 
withdrawn after 60 days or 90 days unless congress specifically 
votes to authorize them to remain 
thenpresident nixon vetoed the legislation arguing that it was 
an unconstitutional restriction on his authority a position taken 
by all three subsequent presidents 
the new proposal would let the troops remain for an unspecified 
length of time unless congress votes to remove them it also 
creates a group of 18 senior congressional leaders who would 
regularly meet with the president to discuss national security 
matters 
congress most recently threatened to invoke the war powers act 
when president reagan instituted his persian gulf policy of 
reflagging 11 kuwaitiowned tankers and protecting them with navy 
warships

and commerce subcommittee on telecommunications is a bipartisan 
compromise

with some reservation president reagan has 
signed federal legislation approving the appalachian states 
lowlevel radioactive waste compact 
in a statement announcing his signature reagan thursday hailed 
the more than three quarters of the states that have now entered 
compacts on lowlevel radioactive waste but he warned the 
appalachian commission against attempting to enforce federal laws 
he said the compacts underscore this nations commitment to 
take those actions needed to ensure the future availability of 
nuclear power as an energy supply option for this country 
reagan objected however to a provision of the bill giving the 
commission federal law enforcement responsibility without requiring 
that commissioners be appointed according to the appointments 
clause of the constitution 
any effort by the commission to enforce federal regulations 
would contravene the constitution the president said 
under the compact which includes pennsylvania west virginia 
delaware and maryland the four states are required to ensure that 
there is a regional facility sufficient to dispose of the regions 
lowlevel waste and that each state has equal access to it

a selfdescribed racist indicted on a charge of 
threatening to kill black presidential candidate jesse jackson says 
hes innocent and authorities cant railroad him for his 
beliefs 
my views shouldnt persecute me actions should londell 
williams said thursday after a federal grand jury returned the 
indictment i havent done anything i havent taken any actions 
towards mr jackson my views havent pointed a gun at anyone 
they cant railroad me just because of what i believe he 
told the belleville ill newsdemocrat in an interview from the 
federal detention facility at the st clair county jail in 
belleville 
williams 30 of washington mo was named in all four counts 
of the indictment his wife tammy 27 was named in three of the 
counts but she was not accused of being involved in the threat on 
jacksons life 
federal agents initially said williams claimed he belonged to 
two violent whitesupremacist groups the covenant the sword and 
the arm of the lord otherwise known as csa and the order 
but tom den ouden who heads the springfield mo fbi office 
said he had found no evidence williams or his wife belonged to the 
groups and leaders of the groups said they never heard of williams 
its possible that there are people who say theyre in the 
order said order leader bruce carroll pierce 34 in a telephone 
interview from the us penitentiary in leavenworth kan but 
theyre not writing me letters telling me what theyre planning 
pierce is one of two men convicted in the slaying of denver 
radio personality alan berg in 1984 
ollie ellison one of two wives of imprisoned csa leader james 
ellison said thursday she never heard of williams ms ellison 
who is in hiding answered questions for the rocky mountain news of 
denver through a third party 
both of the williamses have denied any links to organized white 
supremacist groups and the secret service said londell williams 
passed a lie detector test on the subject 
the indictment differs from the initial arrest charges which 
accused the couple of being part of a conspiracy to kill jackson 
it does not appear to be a large overall plot as was first 
reported said secret service agent rich adams 
the indictment said that on or about may 10 williams 
knowingly and willfully did threaten to kill and inflict bodily 
harm upon jesse jackson 
it charges both of the williamses with possessing an ar15 
assault rifle that had been altered to make it fire like a machine 
gun the gun was to be used in a plot to kill jackson the 
government said 
the pair also were charged with two counts of threatening to 
harm a government informant in retaliation 
prosecutors and the couples attorneys met for several hours 
after the indictments were issued but declined comment afterward 
cynthia short mrs williams lawyer would say only that they 
the williamses are scared 
williams a construction worker faces a maximum penalty of 
three years in prison and 250000 in fines on the first count on 
each of the other three counts the williamses could be sentenced 
to 10 years in prison and fined 250000 
us district judge edward l filippine set arraignment for 
monday 
the williamses who live in rural eastern missouri with their 
three daughters have been held without bond since federal agents 
arrested them friday at their apartment the arrests were announced 
tuesday 
franklin county mo sheriff paul j bruns said an informer 
told investigators that williams not only possessed the rifle but 
that he was part of a plot to kill jackson on june 21 or july 4 
the sheriff said the informer led officers to a wooded area 
where they found the rifle 
a secret service agent testified tuesday that agents taped a 
conversation in which williams told the informer that the covenant 
wanted the rifle back and was planning jacksons assassination

thursdays close of 12880 yen after opening at 12485 yen the 
dollar moved in a narrow range of 12480 to 12490 yen

consecutive days of decline 
the computer system at the tokyo stock exchange shut down 
shortly after 900 am 0000 gmt during a bullish period in the 
market traders said 
the computer problem may have had some effects on the market 
in the sense that it could discourage investors from taking a 
position said a trader at a major securities firm but it is 
also true that there are other elements of concern such as 
inflation and rising interest rates 
yoshio hirano of the tse said they were forced to shut down the 
entire computer system briefly to swith the main system to a 
reserve system 
the computer that controlled the trading of mitsubishi steel 
manufacturing co shares one of the most popular shares in recent 
trading became inoperable he said 
hirano denied speculation that excess orders for the shares 
caused the computer to break down investigations were continuing 
into the system failure he said 
the volume traded today was 800 million shares

striking scriptwriters and representatives of 
the television and movie industry will have another goround with a 
federal mediator even though two previous sessions produced little 
progress 
the chief negotiators have been exploring a possible solution 
to the impasse and feel a meeting at this time is in order both 
parties said in a joint statement thursday 
the meeting scheduled for monday will be the third such 
mediated session since the strike began 11 weeks ago the last 
ended after only 20 minutes on april 18 and a meeting march 14 
also failed to bring results 
the 9000member writers guild of america struck the alliance of 
motion picture and television producers on march 7 over 
disagreements on residual payments for reruns works distributed in 
foreign countries and creative control 
the strike has hobbled the movie and tv industry forcing many 
tv shows into early reruns and stalling movie production 
federal mediator leonard farrell scheduled the meeting for 
monday afternoon at the alliances sherman oaks headquarters 
the meeting comes at a time when guild negotiating committees 
are believed to be on the verge of signing at least 20 contracts 
with independent production companies desperate to resume work 
another 60 such companies also are negotiating with the guild 
while the producers face the possibility of some companies 
resuming work while others remain idle the writers sent letters 
wednesday to 11 production companies including the walt disney and 
paramount studios and several soap opera producers asking for the 
names and addresses of replacement scriptwriters they are using 
the wga letters appear to be the first major acknowledgement by 
the guild that substantial numbers of replacement writers are being 
hired to foil their strike 
your company apparently has employed one or more persons to 
perform wgacovered writing services since the strike began says 
the letter signed by wga executive director brian walton the 
wga is entitled under federal labor law to the name and address of 
each of these persons 
we are asking for this information fo the purpose of policing 
our contract said guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden 
on thursday the alliance announced it would file an unfair 
labor practice charge against the guild 
the unions decision to publicize its letter attempted to 
coerce writers and the exercise of their legally protected right to 
work which is protected under the national labor relations act 
said alliance spokesman herb steinberg

an error by an inexperienced cable car 
operator who nevertheless managed to warn his passengers of danger 
caused a crash this week that injured 36 people a federal 
investigator said 
gerald bolden who had been a cable car gripman less than a 
month did not properly tighten the cars grip on the underground 
cable said mark garcia an investigator for the national 
transportation safety board 
a lever operated by gripmen clamps metal dies against the cable 
preventing the car from moving faster than 9 mph the speed of the 
cable 
the operators error monday allowed the car to slip down hyde 
street two blocks above fishermans wharf and to slam into a 
truck at a red light sending some of the 40 tourists and other 
passengers flying into the intersection 
garcia recommended gripmen be given more training and that 
automobiles be banned from the tracks on the twoblock stretch 
where the accident occurred 
garcia said several factors contributed to the accident 
including rainsoaked tracks on the steep hill the cable cars 
outmoded braking system and the fact that cars and trucks also 
drive on the tracks 
he praised the gripman however for yelling to passengers 
moments before the crash hold on 
garcia also contradicted reports by witnesses that the car sped 
up to 25 mph the car was traveling no faster than 15 to 18 mph 
when it hit the truck he said 
william stead manager of the citys municipal railway which 
operates the cable cars had no comment on the report bolden also 
declined to talk to a reporter 
meanwhile a 2 million claim was filed thursday against the 
city on behalf of a couple injured in the crash the claim filed 
by attorney melvin belli for harry and lillian shuttenberg was the 
first stemming from the accident to be submitted to the city 
attorney

party jackosn said

earlier in the day jackson took his campaign to californias 
farmland telling students to give life a chance without drugs and 
agricultural workers to preserve their fields from dangerous 
chemicals 
jackson gave several scheduled interviews thursday morning 
before embarking on a full day of appearances in bakersfield and in 
fresno stressing agricultural themes such as keeping farms in the 
family 
a private fundraiser netted 50000 for the democratic 
presidential hopeful who faces a tough battle in the states 
primary against dukakis the democratic frontrunner

the civic auditorium in this san joaquin valley city 120 miles 
north of los angeles 
at a noon rally before a mostly white crowd of 4000 kern county 
high school students jackson blew a kiss and gave a thumbsup sign 
as multicolored balloons were released into the sky 
i can sense the joy in the air the sense of hope the

those who knew of friends who either tried drugs or attempted 
suicide to stand 
thats why my heart is heavy and you bring tears to my eyes

make a big decision today you have to give life a chance you have

a former prosoviet polish leader who helped 
crush the solidarity movement later followed the woman he loves to 
the united states and lives a quiet middleclass life here the 
new york times reported today 
its almost as if al haig or caspar weinberger or someone like 
that turned up in a dacha outside moscow janusz glowacki a 
polish playwright now living in new york told the newspaper 
stefan olszowski 57 came to the united states in august 1986 
because of his love for zofia skowron a polish international civil 
servant the times reported they were married last month and live 
in queens 
when he left his wife for ms skowron the scandal shook the 
polish communist party and contributed to his ouster as foreign 
minister and politburo member in 1985 
ms skowron was transferred to the united nations office in new 
york where she is a liaison officer with unesco and olszowski 
accompanied her the couple have a 4yearold son nicholas 
his move to the united states has astounded us polish experts 
as well as emigres many of whom left poland after solidarity was 
suppressed by martial law in december 1981 
its a remarkable example of moral cynicism and ideological 
hypocrisy zbigniew brzezinski a national security adviser in 
the carter administration told the times this is a man who 
back home is a stalwart doctrinarian who favored the bloody use of 
force to crush solidarity 
olszowski in an interview with the times insisted that he was 
here just for personal reasons 
i am just a private person he said 
olszowski was twice almost installed as the leader of the 
communist party in place of stansilaw kania during the 16 months 
solidarity was a legal union and poland was reeling through a 
period of liberalization and crisis 
despite his ouster in 1985 he appears to maintain ties to 
polands top leadership meeting with visiting officials at the 
united nations according to the times

a progovernment newspaper published 
photographs of us embassy employees and their families so that 
panamanians will know the gringos who are starving us to death 
the supplement in the newspaper critica a propaganda organ of 
the government said the americans think the walls of their 
embassy are impregnable 
us embassy spokesmen said it was a significant escalation of 
what they called a harassment campaign by gen manuel antonio 
noriega who is chief of the 15000member panamanian defense 
forces and controls the civilian government 
we take this seriously embassy spokesman terence kneebone 
said in a telephone interview thursday 
saying panamanians these are your enemies and putting it 
in a very shrill way in front of a public in which there are known 
paramilitary groups is not a very wholesome thing to do combined 
with the rhetoric it is cause for concern kneebone added 
noriega has been indicted on drugtrafficking charges in the 
united states and the reagan administration has imposed severe 
economic sanctions on panama in an effort to make him resign 
a 10foothigh fence of iron bars surrounds the us embassy 
grounds on seaside balboa avenue the embassy building is about 25 
yards from the fence within easy reach of projectiles from the 
street 
the embassys physical barriers are almost identical to those of 
the us consulate in tegucigalpa honduras which antiamerican 
protesters burned and sacked in april 
the front page of the 36page supplement published by critica on 
thursday shows photos of the embassy building us ambassador 
arthur davis and john maisto deputy chief of mission it says in 
bold print panamanian know the gringos who are starving us to 
death 
a preface to the list of embassy personnel said these are the 
ones who think the walls of their embassy are impregnable that 
their computers are infallible 
these are the ones who carry out the strategy of elliott 
abrams who wants to kill thousands of panamanians in order to 
impose a docile government that would hand the country over to 
washington 
abrams assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
has been a central figure in the reagan administrations panama 
policy 
criticas list of embassy employees includes the names of 85 
diplomats and and 64 dependents most of them spouses following 
the list are pages of photocopies of identity documents issued to 
embassy personnel by the panamanian government 
these include photographs but most are of such poor quality as 
to be unrecognizable in newsprint reproduction 
in all the documents of 363 embassy personnel and dependents 
including children are reproduced but many are outdated 
according to critica the source of the list and documents was 
the committee for panamanian dignity and sovereignty it was the 
first known public mention of the committee 
the newspaper which includes ranking military officers on its 
board said the committee obtained the information from an 
intelligence branch that had the cooperation of patriotic 
panamanians and north american friends 
it said it would provide addresses and telephone numbers of the 
americans in coming days which kneebone said would make the matter 
that much more serious

sinhalese extremists with automatic 
weapons fatally wounded a senior official of the governing united 
national party as he left his colombo home today police said 
two men opened fire with chinesemade ak47 rifles as nandalal 
fernando was being driven to his office said police inspector g 
kalupahana he said the gunmen and a third suspect escaped on a 
motorcyle 
fernando was shot in the stomach and hand and died three hours 
later at a hospital police officials said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
they said the attack was carried out by the peoples liberation 
front a group of ultranationalist sinhalese who have vowed to kill 
anyone who supports president junius r jayewardenes efforts to 
make peace with the tamil minority 
fernando held the fourthhighest post in jayewardenes party as 
secretary general the partys chairman was assassinated last 
december 
the government has blamed the peoples liberation front for the 
killings of about 260 government officials and supporters since 
july 29 when sri lanka and india signed a peace accord to end the 
tamil insurgency 
fernando like jayewardene belongs to the sinhalese ethnic 
group that controls the government and comprises 75 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people tamils who account for 18 percent say 
they are discriminated against in jobs and education 
tamil militants have been waging a guerrilla war against the 
government and sinhalese civilians for nearly five years the 
rebels rejected the peace accord which provides greater autonomy 
in tamilpopulated areas if the guerrillas surrender their weapons 
sinhalese militants also reject the accord saying it gives too 
much to the tamils 
to enforce the accord india has sent more than 50000 soldiers 
to sri lanka an island off its southern coast but tamil militants 
are now fighting the indian troops 
on may 10 the government lifted a fiveyear ban on the peoples 
liberation fronts political activities after announcing it had 
signed a peace agreement with the sinhalese radicals 
the group denied reaching such an agreement and has continued 
attacks on sinhalese politicians

a judge has ordered a hospital to eliminate a 
waiting list for azt the only federally approved aids drug and to 
begin offering an experimental treatment to indigent patients 
state district judge john m marshall signed a temporary 
restraining order thursday against parkland memorial hospital after 
the dallas gay alliance and five parkland patients filed a lawsuit 
claiming the hospital failed to provide adequate treatment for aids 
patients 
the lawsuit also listed seven john doe plaintiffs who 
parkland officials say died in recent months while waiting to 
receive azt 
marshall ordered a trial within 30 days to determine whether a 
special master should be named to monitor parklands handling of 
aids patients 
to whom must the victim turn marshall said in a strongly 
worded statement obviously the public must intervene or else 
adopt a policy that says let them die because we cant afford 
them such a result is not tolerable in a society that for over 
200 years has prided itself on placing human values first 
william waybourn president of the gay alliance said he is 
gratified that the judge has ruled in favor of life and added 
its unfortunate that parkland did not listen to us before now 
dr ron anderson parklands chief executive officer said in a 
statement after the ruling that the countys only public hospital 
must balance the needs of aids patients against increasing numbers 
of other indigent patients including pregnant women elderly 
people and trauma victims 
aids patients are very ill at times and require compassionate 
humane care that we are doing our best to deliver anderson said 
the patients receive treatment at a clinic that parkland jointly 
runs with the university of texas southwestern medical center the 
clinic is providing treatment for 679 patients suffering from aids 
aidsrelated complex a lessserious form of the disease or the 
virus that causes the disease 
tom cox chief legal counsel for parkland said the hospital 
intended to comply with marshalls order however he indicated 
that aids patients still may have a difficult time seeing a doctor 
at the clinic 
i can say we will eliminate the azt waiting list but when 
they aids patients can get an appointment to the clinic and when 
they can see a doctor is another issue entirely cox said 
the suit accused parkland of violating state and federal laws by 
not providing enough doctors to handle the number of aids patients 
and by withholding some treatments that are readily available to 
patients at other hospitals 
parkland officials said they have been unable to find physicians 
interested in working at the aids clinic 
there are 20 patients with aidsrelated complex on the waiting 
list to receive azt said parkland spokeswoman esther bauer it was 
not known how soon those patients would be given the drug which 
has been shown to prolong the lives of some aids victims she said 
parkland also must begin offering an experimental drug 
pentamidine isethionate to aids patients marshall ruled

a protective cage like those required on 
newer buses would not have prevented the fuel tank of a church bus 
from being punctured in a fiery crash that claimed 27 lives the 
state fire marshal says 
fire marshal bill martin said the location of a threeinch gash 
on the front of the 60gallon tank and pictures of the metal cages 
required in newer buses had convinced him that whatever pierced the 
tank probably would have passed between the bars of a cage 
in this situation the way this accident occurred that cage 
would have had little or no effect martin said in an interview 
thursday 
the converted school bus owned by the radcliff first assembly of 
god church burst into flames after being hit headon by a pickup 
truck traveling the wrong way on interstate 71 near carrollton on 
saturday night 
twentyseven of the 67 people on board died of smoke inhalation 
in one of the nations deadliest bus crashes the driver who was 
allegedly drunk has been charged with 27 counts of murder 
jean fasone head of the national transportation safety board 
team investigating the crash said martins findings could prove 
true the ntsb team will continue trying to determine whether a 
cage would have minimized damage to the fuel tank 
although his report will not be complete for several weeks 
martin said the fuel tank probably was punctured by another piece 
of the bus 
in addition to the gash ntsb investigators reported this week 
that the fuel tank had been pushed back 26 inches and off one of 
the two straps that fastened it to the bus 
a protective cage might have held the tank in place resulting 
in an even larger hole martin said

a research vessel that was part of the titanic 
exploration seized under the governments zerotolerance 
policy after a small amount of marijuana was found will probably 
be returned to its owners officials say 
atlantis ii was seized here wednesday after a routine inspection 
turned up traces of marijuana and two pipes in the shaving kit of 
one of the ships 25 crew members a us customs service spokesman 
said thursday 
spokesman mike fleming said it was clear the 210foot vessels 
owners the woods hole oceanographic institution in woods hole 
mass were innocent parties theyve been extremely cooperative 
in this matter 
crew member richard morris 27 of buzzards bay mass pleaded 
guilty thursday to a misdemeanor charge of drug possession said 
fleming morris was sentenced to a year of probation and fined 100 
the vessels owners are forwarding a letter to customs 
supporting the antidrug effort and assuring officials they intend 
to tighten security aboard the ship fleming said 
once we receive their agreement and their letter outlining the 
procedures they will take then we fully intend to return the 
atlantis ii to the woods hole oceanographic institution he said 
atlantis ii and its contents including a threeperson research 
submarine named alvin are worth 80 million fleming said 
atlantis ii arrived in san diego wednesday from guatemala where 
it had stopped for supplies after geological and biological 
research work near the galapagos islands said derek spencer the 
institutions director of research 
the seizure shocked the scientific community at woods hole 
where the ship is based said spencer 
construction of atlantis ii and alvin was substantially funded 
by federal research agencies spencer said he noted that the 
25foot alvin is owned by the navy 
scientists aboard atlantis ii used alvin in 1986 to explore and 
photograph the north atlantic site where the titanic lies 
the luxury liner went down 74 years ago after striking an

a man accused of attacking five women was 
convicted of rape after the victims identified him as their 
assailant by listening to his taperecorded voice 
scott carroll 27 a new york city factory worker was found 
guilty thursday of 31 charges in a 54count indictment including 
four rapes and one attempted rape 
the jury which deliberated for 10 days deadlocked on 21 
charges including one rape an attempted rape and robbery he was 
acquitted on two burglary charges 
carroll displayed no emotion when the verdict was announced 
his attorney eric naiburg conceded during the sixweek trial 
that one man committed all the crimes but contended that police had 
arrested the wrong man he said he would appeal the conviction 
in most of the incidents the assailant wore a mask or it was 
too dark to see his face the victims testified 
according to prosecutor michael ahearn carroll stalked his 
victims for days confronted them in their bedrooms as they slept 
and put a screwdriver to their throats usually the victims were 
blond and attractive ranging in age from 10 to 55 
the attacks at homes on long islands affluent south shore began 
in january 1983 and ended in february 1987 when carroll was 
arrested 
he faces a maximum of 25 years on each rape conviction and 
ahearn said he would request the maximum on each count to run 
consecutively suffolk county judge stuart namm set sentencing for 
june 22 
six victims four of rape and two of attempted rape picked 
carroll from a voice lineup by listening to recordings of his 
voice and other male voices and identifying his as that of the man 
who had attacked them 
mario puzo the author of the godfather also testified that 
his bay shore home was burglarized in 1986 and that several pieces 
of luggage were stolen luggage given to carrolls girlfriend was 
identified by puzo as belonging to him 
naiburg pointed to discrepancies in the descriptions victims 
gave of their assailants voice some said he spoke with a thick 
new york accent at least one recalled the voice of an educated man 
with no accent 
naiburg directed the bulk of his defense against the voice 
lineup calling it prejudicial and flawed

communist party leader janos kadar 
today said the party was responsible for hungarys economic crisis 
but criticized what he said were attempts to undermine the partys 
control of the country 
in a speech opening the first national party conference in 31 
years kadar acknowledged hungarys deep economic and social crisis 
and said party delegates should renew and rejuvenate the party 
leadership 
the conference delegates will consider changes in hungarys 
leadership including the possible replacement of kadar 
kadar 75 made no direct reference to speculation he will 
relinquish the party leadership he has held since 1956 he mounted 
a strong attack on reformers who want to see sweeping political and 
economic change 
the party condemns independent efforts even by 
wellintentioned people to weaken the party and youth movements 
kadar noted alluding to the formation last week of communist 
hungarys first independent trade union and recent efforts to set 
up an unofficial democratic youth group 
the party will not give way to hostile actions challenging the 
social order kadar said in his address which was carried by 
staterun media 
he said the partys task is to create socialism that involves 
more democracy but rejected what he called efforts to create a 
bourgeois democracy or anarchy 
kadar addressed the partys failure to straighten out the 
nations economic crisis 
no qualitative changes have taken place in our economy 
restructuring is sluggish and the internal and external financial 
balance has deteriorated he said 
as a consequence conditions are lacking for perceptibly 
raising the living standard and even for safeguarding it in all 
respects 
dissatisfaction has increased and more people are pessimistic 
about the future and confidence in the party and its leaders has 
declined kadar said 
last week the partys policymaking central committee said 
personnel changes would be high on the agenda of the national party 
conference fueling speculation kadars era might be coming to a 
close 
even premier karoly grosz a leading contender for the party 
chiefs post has suggested that the conference might replace kadar 
central comittee member janos barabas told reporters thursday 
that the conferences 990 delegates would have the opportunity to 
create a new leadership if they want to 
he said a personnel committee would be chosen today to make 
recommendations for possible changes in the 105member central 
committee 
barabas said any leadership changes would be announced on 
sunday without elaborating he said the central committee would 
vote on the post of party leader 
barabas said conference delegates also would discuss ways to 
speed and broaden economic reforms to every segment of the 
country 
kadar has been widely criticized for resisting political reforms 
needed to lift hungarys economy out of stagnation 
kadar has come to personify the mistakes that have been made 
in the past said a party official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity no real change can occur as long as he remains on 
top 
kadar pioneered reforms that made hungary relatively prosperous 
in the late 1960s and 1970s but a series of recent economic 
setbacks and austerity measures have angered many hungarians 
some party members say political reforms kadar has proposed 
including provisions for secret ballots limited terms of office 
for party officials and multicandidate elections do not go far 
enough 
a gross foreign debt of more than 17 billion and growing 
inflation led hungarys leaders this year to impose eastern 
europes first personal income and value added taxes 
meanwhile an opposition confederation called on the communist 
party to end its political monopoly reinstitute parliamentary rule 
and freedom of the press and lift state controls on the economy 
the recently formed network of free initiatives which comprises 
environmental political youth and other independent groups 
released its manifesto thursday at a news conference

the outlawed irish republican 
army today claimed responsibility for an explosion that ripped 
through a police recruitment stand at a packed agricultural fair 
injuring 14 people 
seven police officers were among those injured in the blast 
thursday evening at the balmoral show grounds where thousands of 
people were attending the annual royal ulster agricultural show 
one policeman remained hospitalized today with burns but the 
others including four children were released after treatment 
police said 
the explosion set off a fire in the police recruitment stand 
sending the crowds fleeing in fear 
in a statement to belfast news media the ira said the explosion 
was caused by a 7pound bomb placed under an office adjacent to the 
police stand 
initial press reports said police believed the explosion was 
caused not by a bomb but by a leak in a malfunctioning gas cylinder 
but a police spokesman inspector jim robinson said police were 
not ruling out the possibility of a bombing he said forensic 
experts were still examining debris 
the ira accused the royal ulster constabulary the provinces 
mainly protestant police force of attempting to cover their 
acute embarrassment over not detecting the bomb by releasing 
disinformation to the media about the cause of the explosion 
the ira said it carried out the attack because the agricultural 
fair the provinces biggest such attraction of the year is 
one of the jewels in the crown of britains normalization policy 
and is protected by a massive crown police force 
the provinces security forces are the main targets of the ira 
in its guerrilla campaign to oust the british from northern ireland 
and unite the protestantdominated province with the mainly roman 
catholic irish republic

cellular telephone companies are enjoying a 
fire sale boom because of a blaze at an illinois bell switching 
center that disrupted phone service for thousands of customers in 
chicagos western suburbs 
its been a hectic time but we did enjoy some pretty good 
business out of it said jerry greenberg president of leader 
communications inc of bellwood cellular telephones were a 
lifesaver for many people who were not content to sit dead in 
the water and had to have some communications 
greenberg estimated sales have doubled since the may 8 fire that 
ravaged a key illinois bell facility in hinsdale 
he said his company couldnt have operated without its own 
cellular phones and portable facsimile machines which were used to 
place equipment orders when regular longdistance service was 
interrupted 
an illinois bell spokesman said all 35000 customers in six 
western suburbs where customers phones went dead after the fire 
should have some local phone service by saturday but will still 
have difficulty calling outside their communities 
as of thursday bell workers had restored limited service to 
31000 of the subscribers said company spokesman tim bannon 
bell expects that regional and longdistance lines and special 
business lines transmitting computer data that were routed through 
the hinsdale center should be functioning almost normally by 
saturday bannon said 
john prescott sales manager for the cellular communications 
corp of naperville said cellular phone sales had tripled to 150 
per week and profits had doubled since the fire 
his customers included panicstricken business people as well as 
fencesitters who moved up plans to buy cellular portable or car 
phones 
we probably did three times the business in a week that we 
normally do and had to add on four workers prescott said 
pat graham marketing manager for ameritech mobile 
communications service in schaumburg said the phone outage boosted 
an already booming market for cellular phones 
sales are better now than theyve ever been in the companys 
fouryear history said ms graham so far sales over the first 
two weeks of may in the chicago area have already exceeded the 
companys forecast for the entire month she said

the government said today that the 
political situation remains unstable in vanuatu and put two 
warships on standby near the island nation of to evacuate 
australians if necessary 
one person was killed and nine injured this week in rioting over 
land reform in the south pacific taxhaven nation and offshore 
banking center 
the foreign ministry advised tourists not to visit vanuatu and 
the defense ministry ordered the warships stalwart and jervis bay 
to extend training exercises in the area and be prepared for a 
possible evacuation 
prime minister bob hawke repeated his statement that libya was 
linked to mondays rioting in the vanuatu capital port vila but 
offered no proof libya denied involvement 
news reports said about 750 australians residents and visitors 
were in vanuatu formerly the anglofrench new hebrides the mainly 
melanesian island nation of 130000 people is roughly 1400 miles 
northeast of sydney 
mondays demonstration turned violent when a mob marched on 
prime minister walter linis office demonstrators looted shops and 
smashed office windows causing an estimated 1 million in damage 
radio vanuatu reported today 
the radio said villagers involved in the demonstration had begun 
surrendering to police it gave no details one demonstrator was 
killed when a police vehicle ran over him police arrested 30 
people 
within hours of the trouble australia and new zealand flew 
supplies of riot control gear to vanuatu at linis request 
australias foreign ministry said today that there was a 
possibility of a confrontation this weekend between lini and the 
general secretary of his governing vanuuka parti 
australian media reports said the general secretary barak sope 
was behind mondays demonstration and hawke said a number of people 
around sope have actually been trained in libya and that is a 
matter of concern 
sope last year tried unsuccessfully to gain leadership of 
vanuatu asserting lini was unfit for the job after suffering a 
debilitating stroke 
vanuatu rattled the nerves of generally prowestern south 
pacific nations with its 1986 decision to establish diplomatic ties 
with libya and the soviet union since then sopes supporters have 
visited libya for what diplomats here described as unspecified 
training 
on thursday libyas staterun jana news agency quoted an 
unidentified libyan foreign minitry official in tripoli as denying 
hawkes charges 
vanuatu was administered jointly by britain and france from 1906 
until 1980 when it achieved independence

the mainstream amal militia said today 
that it blocked an attempt by the rival proiranian hezbollah to 
swap a foreign hostage for weapons and ammunition from christian 
militias 
amal has thwarted an attempt by hezbollah to turn over a 
foreign hostage to the christian lebanese forces militia in 
return for ammunition and weapons for hezbollahs besieged base in 
hajjaj street said atif aoun a member of amals politburo 
aoun told about 10000 supporters of the syrianbacked shiite 
moslem amal militia in the southern town of zahrani that amal 
foiled the alleged swap after we found out about the contacts 
between hezbollah and the lebanese forces he did not elaborate 
groups affiliated with hezbollah or party of god are believed 
to hold most of the 18 foreign hostages including nine americans 
in lebanon 
aoun did not say whether one particular hostage or nationality 
was involved in the alleged deal 
hezbollahs base is in hajjaj street in south beiruts shiyah 
district 
positions of the lebanese forces christian militia are in the 
district of ein rummaneh east of hajjaj street 
the two districts have been separated by a 25yarddeep 
nomansland since the lebanese civil war broke out in 1975 
there was no way to verify the report independently and neither 
the lebanese forces nor hezbollah had any immediate comment 
aoun made the charge as amal arabic for hope and hezbollah 
battled for a 15th day in the slums of south beirut where the 
western hostages are believed held 
syrian forces massed around the disputed area since saturday 
were threatening to move in and stop the fighting 
a representative of a seattlebased human rights group arrived 
in lebanon to try to meet with a shiite moslem religious leader and 
deliver a petition that calls for the release of foreign hostages 
in addition the us ambassador to the united nations vernon 
walters arrived in the syrian capital of damascus today to try to 
secure the release of the american hostages 
walters speaking to reporters thursday in jerusalem said his 
middle east mission was prompted by concerns about the hostages 
safety in the face of the intense amalhezbollah fighting he 
refused to elaborate 
police said seven people were killed and 38 wounded in todays 
exchanges that raises the toll to at least 251 people killed and 
810 wounded since may 6 when the battles broke out 
on thursday amal leader nabih berri who is also lebanons 
justice minister announced a sweeping purge of the militias 
military command amal said in a statement that berri fired the 
militias top military commander akel hamieh and five senior 
aides 
the statement did not give a reason however a ranking amal 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the six were 
fired for conspiring with hezbollah in south beirut 
syria deployed 7500 troops and 500 tanks on the southern 
western and northern edges of south beirut over the weekend after 
hezbollah seized about 90 precent of the enclave from amal 
syrian officers have said they were delaying a decision to move 
into south beirut until diplomatic efforts have been exhausted 
clashes persisted despite efforts by irans acting foreign 
minister ali mohammed besharati to arrange a truce 
besharati on thursday softened his earlier opposition to syrian 
military intervention 
if the entry of the syrian forces to the suburbs guarantees 
security we will not object besharati told reporters after 
meeting with lebanese parliament speaker hussein husseini 
syria the main power broker in lebanon is irans principal 
arab ally in the persian gulf war against iraq however damascus 
has become increasingly alarmed by irans efforts to dominate 
lebanons 12 million shiites the largest single sect 
ray barnett a protestant clergyman from canada representing the 
seattlebased friends in the west a christian human rights group 
arrived in the port of jounieh today 
barnett said he hoped to meet with sheik mohammed hussein 
fadlallah spiritual guide of hezbollah to deliver a petition 
bearing 40000 signatures from the united states and britain 
in the united states former hostage david jacobsen said 
wednesday the petition was expected to be delivered this weekend 
jacobsen said the petition reads 
as believers in almighty god we have faith that prayer is more 
powerful than armies or contingents of diplomats because of this 
we respectfully ask you to pray with us and to do whatever you can 
to intercede on behalf of all these hostages and captives

nearly 1000 physicans in pennsylvania and 
new jersey received kickbacks as part of a medicare fraud scheme 
involving a medical laboratory company say federal officials 
it is believed to be the nations largest medicare fraud case in 
terms of the number of doctors involved said assistant us 
attorney james g sheehan 
the 987 doctors were paid a 50 kickback by medical diagnostic 
services inc for each patient referred to the company for a blood 
circulation test sheehan said 
the us attorneys office has mailed letters to 382 of the 
doctors over the last two days requesting they pay the government 
three times the amount they allegedly received in order to avoid 
civil action and expulsion from the medicare program sheehan said 
the 382 doctors received a total of 200000 in fees or an 
average of about 523 most of them were calling to offer to settle 
the claims sheehan said 
many of the remaining doctors received less than 150 and are 
not expected to be pursued in the case the philadelphia inquirer 
reported today citing unidentified federal sources fewer than 100 
physicians received more than 5000 apiece in fees and are 
expected to be prosecuted individually the newspaper said 
medical diagnostic services billed medicare 400 to 1000 per 
patient contending that it had performed a sophisticated test when 
in fact it had conducted only a simple routine test sheehan said 
this is a classic medicare ripoff one investigator 
familiar with the case which is being investigated by the 
inspector generals office of the department of health and human 
services the fbi and the us attorneys office in philadelphia 
told the inquirer 
between august 1982 and february 1985 medical diagnostic 
services operating under four different corporate names in new 
jersey and pennsylvania billed medicare for about 45 million 
the newspaper said 
in july 1987 the owners of medical diagnostic services richard 
p brill and bruno f cortese each pleaded guilty to one count of 
mail fraud in defrauding the medicare system and agreed to 
cooperate with federal prosecutors

out of israel without a required government permit 
uri dahari head of the archeological robbery prevention section 
at israels department of antiquities said on thursday that sofaer 
bought the artifacts from an underground dealer and took them out 
of the country without a special permit required from the israeli 
agency 
the education ministry said sofaer was being investigated but 
did not give further details 
a senior israeli official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said investigators would contact sofaer but as far as he knew the 
us official would not be prosecuted 
what is clear to us is that abraham sofaer violated the law 
dahari told israel army radio thursday 
the us state department said thursday night that the israeli 
government was not pursuing any investigation spokesman dennis 
harter said israel has announced there is nothing to the 
allegation which warrants any action 
sofaer could not be reached for comment a secretary in his 
washington office said 
dahari said his department would view the return of the 
artifacts as the end of the incident 
the israeli newspaper haaretz quoted an unidentified aide to 
sofaer as saying the us official purchased arifacts only from 
licensed dealers and was willing to return any artifacts found to 
have been removed illegally 
sofaer was in israel recently to help settle an israeliegyptian 
border dispute 
david matnai ministercounselor for political affairs at the 
israeli embassy in washington said the investigation was over and 
that the matter was blown out of proportion i think it was 
something minor

several people who were allegedly raiding archeological sites 
one of those under investigation claimed he sold coins and other 
artifacts to sofaer dahari said

an iranian leader today reiterated 
statements that his nation is at war with the united states and 
called for an arms buildup to confront america 
the americans have officially entered into a war with us 
said parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani we are really at war 
with the united states at the present time 
rafsanjani quoted by irans official islamic republic news 
agency made the remarks during a meeting with officials of the 
revolutionary guards corps the agency was monitored in nicosia 
later in the day he told moslem prayer worshipers that if the 
united states fought iran they must wait to receive lots of 
their youths dead bodies 
it was not the first time iranian leaders have made such 
statements they have said before that their country is at war with 
the united states especially after american military strikes 
against iranian offshore platforms in the persian gulf 
rafsanjani who is close to iranian revolutionary patriarch 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini also repeated previous accusations 
that the united states participated in a recent iraqi attack on 
irans larak island oil terminal 
us ships guided iraqi forces and caused trouble for our 
defensive forces he said 
iran and iraq have been at war since september 1980 
rafsanjani said the united states had been active in providing 
financial and propaganda support for iraq since the beginning of 
the war and is itself responsible for this crime the war 
he said iran was no longer just at war with iraq but also 
with global arrogance a common reference to the united states 
we too should increase our military strength in order to 
take more effective and important steps on the war fronts he 
said 
on april 18 a statement by the supreme war council which 
determines irans war strategy called on all iranians to fight the 
united states 
on the same day a foreign ministry statement warned the united 
states to expect a severe response from the people of iran 
alleging that american military helicopters fought on the iraqi 
side in iraqs recapture of the faw peninsula from iran 
in october 1987 irans united nations ambassador said 
rajaiekhorassani told reporters in new york we think we are at 
war we think we are being killed by the americans 
rafsanjani also complained today that some women in iran were 
not covering their bodies sufficiently and blamed the united 
states he appeared to be saying that women were not wearing the 
headtotoe covering called the chador 
america is influencing women not to cover themselves the 
way they should according to islam rafsanjani said on tehran 
radio but women who commit such crimes must beware that our 
nation will not tolerate them 
he did not spell out what punishment might await them but last 
week the supreme judicial council approved a law under which 
people who offend public morals will receive 74 lashes of the 
whip 
the offenses were not spelled out under irans islamic 
government even husbands and wives are forbidden to kiss or show 
physical affection in public and this is the kind of action usually 
referred to as offending public morality 
in 1963 rafsanjani organized riots against shah mohammad reza 
pahlavis plan to give new rights to women he and other clergymen 
who are now top iranian leaders have consistently opposed 
westernstyle rights for women

the prosecutor responsible for 
convicting reputed cocaine kingpin carlos lehder rivas says the 
powerful medellin cartels days are now numbered while a defense 
lawyer predicts the verdict will be overturned 
lehder was convicted thursday of smuggling more than three tons 
of cocaine into the united states authorities say the 38yearold 
colombian was a key figure in the cartel a violent drug ring 
responsible for about 80 percent of us cocaine imports 
the jury reconvened this morning today to decide whether ledher 
should forfeit his millions of dollars worth of real estate on 
normans cay and nassau in the bahamas to the us government 
the flamboyant lehder described by witnesses as a onetime new 
york city street hood was characterized by us attorney robert w 
merkle chief prosecutor in the case as the most important drug 
smuggler brought to trial in the united states 
the verdict capped a sevenmonth trial on an 11count federal 
indictment charging him with taking over the island of normans cay 
in the bahamas to smuggle cocaine into florida and georgia from 
1978 to 1980 
in the immortal words of james brown i feel good said a 
jubilant merkle this is truly a major victory in the war on 
drugs he added saying the verdict would put a crimp in the 
medellin cartels operations 
i would say they are looking over their shoulders he said 
i think their days are numbered 
however rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house 
narcotics committee said the conviction will by no means solve 
this countrys drug problem 
lehder is not the end of the kingpins of the cartel he said 
defense attorney edward r shohat who presented no witnesses on 
lehders behalf said we are of the view that mr lehder will be 
vindicated on appeal and that he will receive a new trial based 
only on the charges in the indictment 
the trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115 government 
witnesses along with mounds of documents lehder was extradited to 
the united states last year after a firefight and his arrest by the 
colombian army at a medellin mansion 
when the verdicts were read he looked down briefly then stared 
straight ahead two female jurors cried one sobbing into her 
hands as their seven days of deliberations ended lehders aunt in 
the audience also cried and slumped on a bench 
lehder faces a maximum sentence of life plus 150 years in prison 
and 350000 in fines for his convictions on all 11 counts ranging 
from possession of cocaine to running a continuing criminal 
enterprise merkle said he will recommend life in prison 
lehders codefendant jack carlton reed 57 of san pedro 
calif was convicted of one conspiracy count and faces a maximum 
15year sentence 
us district judge howell w melton scheduled sentencing for 
july 20 
according to internal revenue service figures the drug kingpin 
earned an estimated 250 million in the cocaine business 
merkle called lehder the henry ford of the cocaine trade 
the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern hightech 
operation using airdrops and speed boats prosecutors and 
government witnesses described lehder as an admirer of adolf hitler 
who put together a vast cocainesmuggling empire after he was 
deported to his homeland 
in bogota colombia attorney general horacio serpa uribe said 
everyone in colombia was hoping for a guilty verdict he 
declined further comment 
us attorney general edwin meese iii called it an excellent 
example of international cooperation against a major drug 
trafficker 
defense lawyer shohat who described lehder as a legitimate 
businessman victimized by drug investigators accused the 
government of creating hysteria convincing jurors their own 
security was threatened 
lehder did not in my opinion get a fair trial to which he 
was entitled shohat said 
jack hook a spokesman for the drug enforcement administration 
said the conviction sends a message to other cartel officials that 
you are not able to bribe intimidate or murder your way out of 
custody in the united states 
hook called the cartel the worlds largest drug trafficking 
ring by comparison authorities say the french connection drug 
ring smuggled in about 70 pounds of heroin from 1968 to 1971 
the principal prosecution witness was ed ward an exmarine 
pilot who ran his own marijuana smuggling operation from normans 
cay he teamed up with lehder but eventually fell out with reed 
he said 
after his arrest in 1981 ward began cooperating with the dea 
he is under federal protection and has been given a new identity 
lehder allegedly paid bahamian prime minister lynden o pindling 
to look the other way while his smuggling operation took over the 
small island of normans cay a short hop from florida 
pindling himself reportedly a target of a florida grand jury 
investigation based in part on trial testimony has called the 
allegations a fairy tale 
the medellin cartel has been blamed for a wave of violence 
across colombia including the assassination of a former justice 
minister and the slaying of a top us dea informant the trial was 
conducted under heavy security

secretary of state george p shultz said today 
that the united states and the soviet union plan to agree at the 
moscow summit on a program of notification of each others 
ballistic missile tests 
the agreement was to have been a minor part of an overall plan 
the superpowers had hoped to reach reducing strategic or 
longrange nuclear forces by up to 50 percent a socalled start 
pact 
though the two sides have failed to reach that sweeping 
agreement shultz said they have developed similar language on 
missiletesting notification a program designed to boost 
confidence that tests are not a prelude to war 
its something that conceivably could be lifted out of that 
the start agreement and signed separately and it would not be a 
big deal but an additional confidencebuilding measure shultz 
said in a satellite news conference with reporters in europe and 
canada 
in addition president reagan and soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev are likely to issue a statement outlining other areas of 
progress they have made toward the unrealized start agreement 
shultz said 
in moscow meanwhile a soviet spokesman said in an interview 
published today that the two sides will include landbased mobile 
missiles in their negotiations on a treaty to reduce strategic 
nuclear weapons 
we have every reason to believe that the problem of mobile 
missiles will be resolved col gen nikolai chervov soviet 
defense ministry spokesman told the washington post 
we are now coordinating positions on this in geneva where 
ussoviet arms talks are under way chervov said in an interview 
in moscow 
chervov said the united states appeared to be moving away from 
its demand for a ban on such missiles now that the pentagon plans 
to base mx missiles on railroad cars 
an american official in moscow said that there had been no 
change in us policy but that the united states has said it is 
willing to negotiate on ways to verify an agreement which would 
allow both sides to deploy mobile missiles 
the official was not named the reagan administration has 
rejected soviet proposals to include mobile missiles in a start 
accord because of verification problems 
chervov said us officials have presented ideas in geneva on 
how to verify limits on mobile missiles after earlier seeking a ban 
on such weapons when the united states thought its mx missile would 
be based in fixed silos and the soviets were developing mobile 
weapons 
chervov acknowledged that an agreement on reducing strategic 
weapons could not be reached in time for the ussoviet summit 
that begins may 29 in moscow as originally had been hoped 
however he said moscow would continue to negotiate in hopes of 
reaching an accord before president reagans term ends 
the problem now is to establish ourselves so we do not go back 
from the points we have already reached he said 
chervov also said differences over sealaunched cruise missiles 
could not be set aside temporarily or solved through unilateral 
declarations as has been formally suggested by us officials he 
said the other major sticking point on a strategic arms reduction 
treaty was disagreement over the us strategic defense initiative 
also known as star wars

the democratic partys national chairman blasted george bush 
today as a donothing vice president and a quintessential elitist 
establishment republican countryclubber bush himself sought 
black support by meeting with civil rights leaders 
democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis and rival 
candidate jesse jackson were both campaigning in california 
today in atlanta where the democrats will have their convention 
in july the chairman of the partys national committee paul kirk 
attacked bush in a glovesoff speech to the association of 
democratic state chairs 
kirk said bush has been applauding in the dark shadows of this 
republican administration as it turns thumbs down on public ethics 
thumbs down on the civil rights restoration act thumbs down on a 
simple 60days notice to working men and women who are about to 
lose their jobs 
bush the democratic official said is a quintessential 
elitist establishment republican countryclubber with no 
connection to ethnic america to minority america to workingclass 
america 
he said bush has neither the toughness to govern nor the 
compassion to care 
with its prize of 314 delegates the california contest on june 
7 overshadows the three other primaries the same day new jersey 
montana and new mexico which among them offer a total of 152 
democratic delegates 
dukakis hopes to clinch the delegates needed to nominate with 
that final round of primaries according to the latest ap delegate 
count dukakis has 1645 to jacksons 974 of the 2081 needed to 
nominate 
although jackson has little chance of overtaking the 
massachusetts governor now he would like to make california a 
staging ground for a final show of strength before the convention 
at a high school in bakersfield calif on thursday jackson 
spoke of the sense of hope the celebration of people coming 
together because we care 
dukakis arriving in california thursday night for two days of 
campaigning in the state faced hecklers at his first stop a rally 
in los angeles 
we need a president whos not afraid to talk about aids the 
hecklers shouted the massachusetts governor did talk about aids 
though calling it a disease that must be conquered 
earlier this month dukakis held a stormy meeting with gay 
activists in los angeles facing hostile questions about his 
opposition to allowing homosexual couples to be foster parents 
bush meanwhile described his meeting with about 20 civil 
rights leaders thursday night as a very good session 
but two participants who spoke with reporters afterward 
suggested bush will have to work hard to overcome his association 
with the administrations civil rights record 
the reagan administration record on civil rights is not a 
record that anybody can defend said benjamin hooks who heads 
the naacp at this point i would say the vice president has a 
long way to go if he actually expects to get a substantial black 
vote 
i came with a great deal of hope that wed find in mr bush a 
new level of sensitivity to the devastation in the black community 
thats escalated and intensified over the past seven years said 
joseph lowery president of the southern christian leadership 
conference that hope has not been fulfilled 
nonetheless lowery said he hoped to see bush out there 
fighting for the black vote 
putting some distance between bush and president reagan is 
becoming a key part of the vice presidents campaign strategy 
the remaining primaries are something of an afterthought for 
bush who already has the republican nomination wrapped up but a 
series of recent polls have suggested that bush is losing ground 
against dukakis the likely democratic nominee 
the vice president acknowledges that controversies over reagan 
administration actions such as dealings with panamas manuel 
antonio noriega have probably hurt him 
noriega is under indictment on drug trafficking charges but the 
administration is said to be ready to drop the charges in order to 
get him to step aside 
bush has been edging away from reagan on the noriega affair 
although he is carefully avoiding any criticism of his boss the 
white house in turn is going out of its way to publicly give the 
vice president free rein 
as we go through the campaign i would expect to see the vice 
president speaking out on a number of issues presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday i expect a number of 
them will be different than existing policies and we will not 
criticize them in any way 
the white house reassurance followed bushs statement this week 
that he would not bargain with drug dealers aides said the 
message was that as president bush would not make a deal with 
someone like noriega 
the washington post quoting sources said in todays editions 
that bush at a highlevel meeting had urged an end to 
negotiations with noriega campaign spokesman peter teeley said 
thursday night he had no knowledge of bushs recommendations 
concerning noriega 
however reagan suggested that bushs comment about not 
bargaining with drug dealers had only a limited application 
i think that he was making plain that you dont negotiate 
with people of that kind with regard to their activity in drugs 
the president told foreign broadcast journalists in an interview 
thursday

thieves smashed a window at the 
municipal museum today and made off with three 19thcentury 
paintings worth up to 52 million including works by vincent van 
gogh and paul cezanne 
museum officials said it was the largest art theft in modern 
dutch history 
stolen were carnations an 1888 work by van gogh the 
house of maitre billaud in nevers by dutch painter johan 
jongkind from 1874 and bottle with apples an 1894 still life 
by cezanne the french impressionist 
museum director wim beeren estimated their combined value at 52 
million but the christies auction firm in london set their worth 
at 11 million 
the theft at the downtown museum also known as the stedelijk 
museum was discovered after 5 am when someone broke a window in 
the building and triggered an alarm 
museum spokesman maarten bertheux said no one was inside at the 
time he said the museums estimated 3000 works are protected only 
by an electronic alarm system when the museum is closed 
roundtheclock surveillance by security personnel was abolished 
as an economy measure in 1975 beeren said this is a terrible 
loss of prestige for museum security he told reporters the 
stolen paintings were not insured 
the museum famed for its collection of works by 19th and 
20thcentury masters is a threestory building with large windows 
on the street level the thieves entered through one of those 
windows that faces a secluded treeshrouded area officials said 
they walked through five galleries before reaching the room 
where the stolen paintings were on display with two other van gogh 
works according to deputy director rini dippel 
ms dippel speculated that the thieves left the other two van 
gogh paintings the rocking chair and the diggers because 
they were substantially larger than carnations which measures 
184 by 15 inches 
there were conflicting accounts on how the theft was discovered 
police spokeswoman heleen van der weijden police arrived on the 
scene after the alarm sounded and entered the museum but failed to 
notice the theft she said the theft was discovered an hour later 
by a private security guard 
bertheux said museum staffers and police discovered the theft 
about 20 minutes after the alarm sounded 
recent tests of the alarm system showed it took only three 
minutes for police and guards to get there beeren said he could 
give no explanation for the delay 
mrs van der weijden said interpol and customs services around 
the world were alerted 
the municipal museum is next to the van gogh museum which has 
the worlds largest collection by the dutch master about 200 yards 
from the two museums is the rijksmuseum the nations largest 
repository of works by rembrandt 
according to christies the stolen van gogh is worth 16 
million to 21 million the cezanne 79 million and the 
jongkind 147000 ms dippel said those estimates were based on 
black and white photographs in a museum catalog 
beeren said he based his higher estimate on the fact that 
there is a van gogh involved and recent price developments for 
van goghs have been dramatic 
in march 1987 van goghs sunflowers drew 398 million at a 
london auction in november an unidentified collector paid 53 
million for the dutch painters irises in new york 
beeren speculated that the theft may have been commissioned by a 
private art collector since the paintings are too famous to be 
sold on the public market 
ive got the impression that they chose the paintings with a 
clear purpose in mind he said thisll go straight to 
somebodys room or home i guess

a sculptor says that opponents of a proposed 
statue in memory of 20 men and women executed 300 years ago as 
witches are just trying to foreget what happened 
yiannis stefanakis is trying to give the city a 14foothigh 
bronze to commemorate the witches but some residents say greed is 
behind the seventon sculpture they say will be a tourist 
attraction 
supporters say the critics want to forget what happened in 1692 
and the sculpture is a public apology to the 20 people executed 
then 
people like them are the same people who 300 years ago caused 
the death of these 20 people they are still doing it today its 
an injustice stefanakis told the boston globe in a story 
published today 
stefanakis who said he supports himself by making wax molds for 
a chocolate company was inspired to create the statue three years 
ago by three sovereigns for sarah a film about the salem 
witchcraft trials 
he said he raised 2500 in private financing and also got 
donations of transportation and a rentfree studio he said he 
hoped to present his work to the city as a gift 
most people want to forget about what happened in 1692 he 
said three hundred years have gone by and they have done 
nothing to commemorate those victims i decide to step in and make 
a statue and now they form a committee 
the salem witchcraft tercentenary ad hoc committee opposes the 
statue and is planning an official memorial said the rev john 
szala of the first salem church who heads the committee 
he said the committee believes planting trees or putting the 
names of the 20 victims on plaques with an eternal flame would be 
more appropriate 
and he said stefanakis is an outsider who has ignored local 
opinion and is using a tragic event to make a dollar 
no one knows how much it cost szala said to whom does 
this man answer who receives his financial reports 
stefanakis publicist eleanor parker said stefanakis may make 
40000 for his three years of work 
wayne higley jr a descendant of rebecca nurse one of the 
victims depicted in the sculpture supports the statue 
when the statue is unveiled in october people will see the 
expression of sarah cloyce another victim looking down at them 
he said the look on her face says look at what they have done 
dont let this happen

hundreds of seals in danish waters 
are dying of pneumonia and the mysterious epidemic could spread to 
marine mammals in the baltic sea a biologist said friday 
more than 200 harp seals are known to have died in recent weeks 
on the island of anholt in kattegat strait between denmark and 
sweden said biologist paul mortensen 
he said the areas entire 1988 generation of seals was lost 
because their sick mothers aborted 
dying or dead seals also have been found beached on the islands 
of laesoe hesseloe and as far south as the port city of 
helsingoer giving rise to fears that the infection might spead he 
said 
he said the virus spreads by direct contact between adult seals 
as they lie close together on land adding that it resembles an 
influenza that struck hundreds of seals on the canadian and us 
eastern coasts in 1980 
another expert knud pedersen of the state veterinary serum 
institute said he suspected a herpeslike virus similar to one 
blamed for seal deaths of seals off the netherlands a few years ago 
experts from several government agencies met in copenhagen to 
discuss the crisis they agreed that more seals will die in the 
next few months as the epidemic spreads 
the harp seal was near extinction in 1975 when it was declared 
a protected species an estimated 5000 of the mammals inhabit 
danish waters breeding 500 to 1000 pups a year

two kuwaiti men killed when their bombladen car 
blew up before reaching its intended target were pious moslems who 
were duped by criminals it was reported friday 
the newspaper alqabas also said that fighting terrorism should 
include immunizing citizens against falling easy prey to 
protagonists of crime and deepening sentiments of patriotism with 
the youth 
the paper warned that more terrrorism should be expected 
interior ministry officials said the two men were planning to 
park the car in front of the kuwait airways building in downtown 
kuwait on wednesday but the explosives apparently went off 
prematurely 
the blast was the third in this northern persian gulf country in 
less than a month in december 1983 a car bomb exploded at the 
us and french embassies and in 1985 an attempt was made on the 
life of the emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah 
last month a kuwait airways jetliner was hijacked for 16 days 
and two kuwaitis aboard were killed by the gunmen who have been 
described as proiranian shiite moslem fundamentalists 
we have to shoulder our historic responsibility because 
confining our attitude to condemation of crimes and counting 
casualties will be without avail if we want our country to live in 
peace and security alqabas said 
the two young kuwaitis who have been identified as nasser 
mohammed ali hassan ahmed 22 and walid abdelnabi mohammed mousa 
almousa 23 were killed when the car they were traveling in 
exploded near the airlines head office 
alqabas quoted a sister of ahmed as saying that her family was 
surprised to learn about the incident she described her brother as 
a fervent moslem who strictly performs his religious obligations 
and leads a normal life we did not discern anything abnormal in 
his daytoday behavior 
she said he was a teacher at an elementary school unmarried and 
owned the car that exploded her family did not know the companion 
killed with him she said 
alqabas said almousa was a geography student at kuwait 
university and was married with no children 
the paper quoted almousas brother adnan as saying his 
brother was a very committed moslem his brother recently 
traveled to turkey and greece he said

ten years after its opening narita airport 
is still surrounded by barbed wire and riot police bitter 
reminders of the often violent war between disaffected farmers and 
the government 
now an ambitious expansion plan threatens to bring more trouble 
since its conception 22 years ago farmers and demonstrators 
have clashed ferociously with riot police over plans to expropriate 
vast amounts of fertile farmland and polish it into a gleaming 
international gateway 
today the sprawling new tokyo international airport located 40 
miles from tokyo resembles a beseiged city patrolled day and 
night by 700 policeman 
departing passengers and guests are frisked with metal detectors 
at several security checkpoints and at times required to produce 
identification when entering the airport grounds 
six lives have been lost in bloody battles since the 1966 
government decision designated narita as the site for a new 
airport but koji kitahara leader of a group of airport opponents 
claims the figures mean nothing 
more lives will be taken in the fight he vows 
together with the chukakuha japans largest radical group 
antinarita protesters have sabotaged construction work and even 
managed several times to delay the airport inauguration originally 
scheduled for march 1971 
in one such clash a handful of leftists crept into naritas 
16thfloor control tower through a sewer tunnel and destroyed its 
radar weather and communications equipment outside about 6000 
demonstrators fought pitched battles with 13000 policemen 
the sabotage pushed back the opening for another two months and 
it was not until may 20 1978 that the first flight took off from 
the heavily guarded narita 
for 22 years we have fought the government for disrupting our 
lives and taking away our right to a normal livelihood said 
kitahara 66 
if we allow the completion of the secondphase construction 
project we will have no future he said in an interview at his 
home 500 yards from naritas only runway overhead a jet roared by 
kitahara who has been arrested three times in his fight against 
the airport said many of the displaced farmers have been reduced 
to working as day laborers on construction sites some wives have 
taken up parttime jobs and a few of the men even work as guards 
at the airport to make ends meet he added 
but many of them come to me now and say they wished they never 
sold their land kitahara said theyre no longer their own 
boss they have to take orders from someone else 
government plans call for narita to be doubled in size by march 
1991 with the construction of two runways measuring 8250 feet and 
10560 feet and a second terminal building to increase the current 
capacity of 11 million passengers annually to 23 million 
but like the first stage construction for the expansion has 
encountered strong opposition and plans originally targeted for 
completion in 1974 have only reached the groundbreaking stage 
a protest rally has been scheduled for sunday 
according to the new tokyo international airport authority 
eight families are thwarting the expansion by refusing to give up 
526acres of farmland 
we hope to come to terms with them through talks said 
masataka takemoto chief of public relations at the airport 
authority office he said about 325 families have been resettled in 
nearby farmlands since 1966 after agreeing to cede their properties 
takemoto claims about 200 members of the marxist chukakuha or 
middle core revolutionary group live around the airport and are 
threatening to harm the farmers if they sell their land they 
maintain the airport may be used for military purposes 
even if the farmers want to sell they cant because of fear 
of what the chukakuha will do he said 
known for violent tactics and using homemade projectiles and 
flamethrowers the radical group has spearheaded the antinarita 
movement it was blamed for forcing the temporary closure of narita 
for one hour in 1985 after firebombs were hurled on the runway 
the group has taken up the matter as just another way of 
rebelling against the government said masahiro gamo deputy 
chief of public relations of the airport authority as soon as 
they find some other antigovernment cause to support theyll 
latch onto it 
despite the protests initial work on the second runway has 
begun tightly cordoned off by coils of barbed wire and guarded 
closely by riot police 
should the farmers refuse to sell their holdings takemoto 
added we will take the land through legal means 
we will finish the airport takemoto said as a major 
power in the world we have an obligation to complete the 
construction

the senate today overwhelmingly rejected an 
attempt by conservative critics of the ussoviet missile treaty 
to link the pact to alleged soviet cheating on five other 
armscontrol agreements 
in a series of five votes the senate killed piece by piece 
the amendment proposed by steve symms ridaho 
symms amendment noted that reagan has told congress the soviets 
are violating the salt i and salt ii armslimitation treaties a 
1963 pact banning openair atomic tests a 1925 geneva protocol 
banning chemical weapons and the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
his proposal would have required that the administration certify 
the soviets are in compliance with all these pacts before the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty could have taken 
effect 
conservatives using senate rules insisted on five separate 
votes rather than a single roll call in the tallies the votes to 
kill symms proposal were 8511 8710 8611 8215 and 898 
the decision came after senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas called on his fellow republicans to speed up the action 
we need to start making real progress on the treaty itself 
dole said time is of the essence the president leaves next 
wednesday for his moscow summit with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
dole said republican senators have a special burden to 
assure that reagan does not go to moscow without ratification of 
the inf treaty 
sen ted stevens ralaska a member of the senate observer term 
which monitored the inf talks told the senate as one of them i 
can stand before the senate and say i have confidence in this 
treaty it need not be changed at all 
symms said his amendments simply mean that the treaty does not 
go into effect until the president can report the soviets are in 
compliance with existing arms treaties 
sen david durenberger rminn opposed the symms proposal 
because he said it is designed to kill the inf treaty not to 
produce soviet compliance 
sen james j exon dneb complaining of republican stalling 
referred to symms proposal as nonsense and extraneous 
i think this is a terrible situation exon said it would 
cripple the president as he represents the united states and the 
free world 
exon said reagan will be partly to blame if the treaty isnt 
approved before the summit the president could put his foot 
down he is the president he is the leader of the republican party 
without question i think he is contributing to his own problems 
as debate on the amendments opened thursday symms told the 
senate the soviets cheated in the past and i think we can expect 
theyre going to cheat in the future 
but sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign 
relations committee noted that the reagan administration says this 
treaty should be considered on its own merits 
to my mind the important thing is what does this treaty do 
does it help our security or harm it pell asked i dont think 
we ought to be in the position of cutting off our nose to spite our 
face 
sen richard lugar rind said the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty stands on its own merits its nonsensical to 
tie this to other treaties 
the inf treaty signed dec 8 by reagan and gorbachev calls for 
the elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 
300 to 3400 miles 
sen pete domenici rnm said reagan deserves an 
opportunity for this body before he goes to moscow to say yes 
or no to the pact the american people want this treaty 
ratified and they want this president to have the opportunity to 
maximize what may flow from it 
domenici said he would be surprised if more than 10 of the 100 
senators vote against the pact ratification requires 67 votes and 
domenicis estimate is similar to forecasts by senate leaders of 
both parties 
but the opponents could delay the final vote with parliamentary 
maneuvers and by introducing numerous amendments 
sen jesse helms rnc leader of the opponents objected 
thursday when majority leader robert byrd dwva sought approval 
to move from consideration of the treaty itself to the separate 
resolution of ratification 
under senate rules designed to protect the rights of the 
minority helms objection meant that the chamber couldnt move to 
the resolution both the treaty and the resolution will be 
considered in separate votes 
helms said he objected because three other senators whom he did 
not name planned to offer amendments to the text of the treaty 
sen malcolm wallop rwyo another critic of the pact 
responded to doles plea by saying for us to be hurried to suit 
the climate of a summit is just a wrong urging at this moment

archaeologists have unearthed the 14th century 
remains of king edward iis palace where he relaxed with his 
homosexual lover before being deposed by his wife and murdered as 
tradition has it with a red hot poker 
the archaeologists have also found on the same london site the 
remains of a house owned by sir john fastolf thought to have been 
the model for william shakespeares sir john falstaff 
falstaff the harddrinking knightturnedrobber is one of the 
great comic creations of english literature 
the london museum hailed the find of enormous historical 
importance but a member of its archaeological team michael 
hammerson said that under terms of an agreement with a 
construction company the museum must halt its work sometime this 
fall after that bulldozers will move in to clear the site 
the most important thing now is to record the exact details 
before the site is destroyed he said 
hammerson said that the developers st martins development 
corp had sponsored the archaeological work 
the remains of the palace and fastolfs house were discovered on 
a construction site at hayes wharf on the south bank of the river 
thames where st martins wants to build offices and apartments 
a large stone corner of the palace was unearthed last week but 
the archaeologists tried to keep the find quiet for fear of 
attracting treasure hunters said the the times of london which 
reported the find friday 
the times said st martins is also wary of publicity because 
its development plan is already the subject of an official public 
inquiry to decide whether or not it should go ahead 
the palace was a large moated building covering about 80 square 
yards known to historians as the rosary it was a retreat on 
the far side of the thames where the king could escape the cares of 
office 
the paper quoted historian dr colin lucas of oxford university 
as saying this was where edward enjoyed a reign of dissolution with 
his male lover piers gaveston before being deposed and murdered 
at berkeley castle in western england in 1327 
edward was born in 1284 the son of king edward i by his spanish 
first wife eleanor of castile his father trained the prince in 
warfare and statecraft but the son acquired habits of extravagance 
and frivolity which he retained throughout his life 
edward i attributed his sons attitude to the influence of his 
french friend gaveston a gascogny knight and drove the frenchman 
into exile but when edward i died in 1307 his sons first act on 
becoming king was to bring back to england the man he called his 
brother piers 
gaveston acted as regent in control of the realm when edward 
went to france to marry isabella daughter of the french king 
philip iv in 1308 she was to bear the king two sons and two 
daughters 
edwards barons grew indignant over gavestons influence and 
twice insisted on his banishment but on each occasion edward soon 
recalled his friend 
the barons finally went to war against the king and gaveston 
killing gaveston and forcing edward to stand aside while a baronial 
committee took over the government 
in 1327 isabella and her lover roger mortimer deposed edward 
he was imprisoned and one of his sons was chosen as king 
tradition has it edward was murdered with a red hot poker 
the palace is mentioned in the 19th century antiquarian study 
a history of the kings works and an illustration of the site 
appears in a map by the 16th century cartographer ralph agas 
shakespeare is believed to have modeled falstaff a rambunctious 
lover of life who appears in both the king henry iv plays and 
the merry wives of windsor on fastolf 
but the times said the discovery near the house of jetties and 
inlets suggested fastolf in fact was not much like the character 
the elizabethan playwright created 
there are far more docking installations than we had 
suspected the evidence suggests that he was an important 
merchant and therefore not a knight hammerson said 
the times said fastolf built the house in 1446 
it said the finds at the site of the house were known to include 
large amounts of leatherwork pewter ware and a tall felt hat

soviet world chess champion gary 
kasparov has taken the lead in a fourplayer spectacular that pits 
him against archrival anatoly karpov in their first meeting since 
the championship last year 
halfway through the tournament kasparov topped the standings 
thursday with four points for an unbeaten performance of two wins 
and four draws from the six rounds played so far in the event 
karpov also from the soviet union was running a close second 
lagging half a point behind the champion 
kasparov beat karpov in 1985 to become world champion and 
retained his title last year in seville spain 
in their first match since seville the two drew in the second 
match kasparov came out on top in a fantastic win 
that game in which kasparov played white against his arch 
enemys pet carokann defense was one of the wildest and most 
exciting in recent tournament play at the grandmaster level 
according to visiting british grandmaster tony miles 
after the great ks as they have become known drew their 
first encounter since last years world title match in seville 
spain experts were predicting the same result in wednesdays match 
but kasparov sprung a surprise on karpov and on the allknowing 
experts 
after just 16 moves he sacrificed a knight and followed up with 
an allout attack on the black kings side that grandmaster miles 
said was a perfect example of pure fighting chess 
experts in the press room were at a loss to explain kasparovs 
daring play and the onehundred strong audience in the tournament 
hall were standing on their seats to miss nothing of the 
hairraising duel 
karpov initially weathered the onslaught capturing a second 
piece and countering with a mating threat of his own 
but problems arose as he ran into time trouble 
on the 25th move he missed a chance to win in one move on the 
39th he exceeded the time limit where he was one move short of the 
control in a position that the experts afterwards said was probably 
a draw 
against hollands john van der wiel in thursdays sixth round 
karpov was his old self again coolly making the most of his slim 
advantage in a queens indian gradually increasing the pressure 
against blacks weakened center and clinching victory on the 39th 
move 
kasparovs encounter with dutchman jan timman ranked third on 
the world rating list was more of an anticlimax 
the world champion playing white refrained from taking the 
initiative against his theoretically weaker opponent 
visiting grandmaster miles hypothesized that kasparov was still 
somewhat dizzy from his victory over karpov 
early on timman had some trouble in stopping whites attack 
but eventually evened out around his 40th to sign the peace five 
moves later 
the tournament with a world chess federation category 17 and an 
average rating of 2674 points the strongest ever held will 
continue sunday with kasparov facing van der wiel and karpov 
playing timman in seventhround action 
after six rounds kasparov had 4 points karpov 3 timman 3 
and van der wiel 1

opposition leader kim daejung on 
friday proposed that south korea and north korea hold talks on 
being cohosts for the olympic games opening in seoul in september 
kim head of the largest opposition party for peace and 
democracy made the proposal at a meeting of 71 party members who 
were recently elected to the national assembly 
if possible we need to explore ways to cohost the olympics 
through talks between political parties of the two sides he said 
kim 62 said he believes north korea is less enthusiastic about 
taking part in the olympics but south korea should persuade them to 
attend 
the opposition leader said he would inform the government of his 
idea when he visits the seoul olympic organizing committee on 
saturday 
kim said if the issue of being cohosts is solved south korea 
would benefit by ensuring the security of the olympics and forcing 
north korea to open its closed society thereby promoting chances 
of national unification 
rohs governing democratic justice party denoucned kims 
statement as a irresponsible political maneuvering that may 
compound the olympic and other interkorea issues 
democratic justice party spokesman kim jungwee said although 
all south korean people are free to debate the olympics matter it 
is necessary that the government should serve as a unified 
channel of dialogue with north korea 
the nations two other opposition groups kim youngsams 
reunification democratic party and kim jongpils new democratic 
republican party reacted with skepticism to kim daejungs 
proposal 
reunification democratic party spokesman suh chungwon quoted 
his party leader kim youngsam as saying the proposal is 
impossible to be be put into practice 
new democratic spokesman cho yongjik said all 
unificationrelated debate should be open but it is desirable that 
dialogue with north korea should be conducted through concerned 
government authorities 
north korea has said it will boycott the olympics in seoul 
unless it is made a cohost despite its threat to organize a 
communistbloc boycott a record 161 nations including the soviet 
union and china have said they would send athletes to seoul 
the international olympic committee said any idea of having both 
nations serve as hosts would be a violation of the olympic charter

states and the philippines 
the president has pledged to allow the bases to remain here 
until their lease expires in 1991 but she has refused to say 
whether she would agree to an extension

before 1991 you must already give notice of your intention to 
terminate laurel said

proposal supplements earlier congressional bills outlawing the use 
of any part of the philippines for storage of nuclear weapons

territory to be used for assembly storage deployment transit or 
any other use of any futuristic weapons like laser beams laser 
rays and particle beam generators the bill said

country even components of such weapons violators could face 10 
years to life in prison

be deported after serving the full prison sentence

away from the balloons and the lights of 
politics a lawyer and a onetime bricklayer run a computerdriven 
operation pulling in the delegates michael dukakis needs to win the 
democratic presidential nomination 
until recently they have worked in obscurity but as dukakis 
has gotten closer to his goal theyve been getting more recognition 
my profile has gotten raised so much in the last week its 
frightening said tad devine the 32yearold lawyer who oversees 
delegate selection for the dukakis campaign 
while the candidate was on capitol hill meeting with 
congressional leaders during a recent trip to washington devine 
was across town having quiet discussions with labor union officials 
just kind of floating around is how he describes his 
activities that day the previous day he said he too had been 
up at the capitol and had floated around a little 
susan brophy the deputy director of delegate selection was 
back at campaign headquarters in boston minding the store 
more than 85 percent of the 1645 delegates dukakis has gained 
so far have been won in primaries and caucuses but the rest 
including party leaders politicians the uncommitted and delegates 
originally supporting other candidates have been won one at a time 
winning them has risen in importance as dukakis strives to nail 
down the total needed for nomination 2081 by the end of the 
primaries on june 7 
devine and ms brophy run a 15member staff whose mission is to 
softsell delegates on the idea of voting for the massachusetts 
governor at the democratic national convention although sell 
is a work neither of them likes to use 
i hate to think of a person running for president of the 
united states as a product devine says 
the job is about 70 percent science and 30 percent art devine 
says 
computers keep track of how many times a delegate has been 
contacted and by whom along with political and biographical 
information 
it goes through various stages ms brophy says at the 
initial stage its just sort of introductory then it goes more to 
the persuasion stage and then to the conversion stage 
the marching orders be persistent be helpful but dont be 
pushy 
the trainleavingthestation and other similar approaches are 
not effective devine says it causes resentment 
on occasion the staff lines up calls for dukakis himself to 
make to close the deal 
hes very good on the phone ms brophy says hes very 
persuasive on the phone 
the operation runs from around 9 am to nearly midnight and 
someone is working every day she says the pace will pick up in 
june when many states that started their processes months ago 
finally get around to picking their delegates 
devine gained experience in delegate tracking for walter mondale 
in 1984 and before that for jimmy carter dukakis was one of three 
presidential candidates who wanted to hire him for 1988 devine 
says he wont name the other two 
he and dukakis met one night as the candidate was being driven 
around new hampshire attending house parties for his longshot 
campaign 
the impression was strong enough that devine whose wife was 
pregnant at the time quit his job at the washington law firm of 
winston and strawn took a nearly 50 percent pay cut and moved to 
boston to work for dukakis 
ms brophy had known dukakis for 14 years having worked on his 
first gubernatorial campaign and later having been his student at 
the john f kennedy school of public affairs at harvard 
in the meantime she has been policy director for the democratic 
national committee has run a program to help women get jobs in the 
construction industry and has been a communications director for 
the bricklayers union 
she also learned how to lay bricks and says she can swing a 
hammer with skill 
the caution of a lawyer and the methodical approach of a 
bricklayer have met with success 
for example mary sue gutierrez a democratic national 
committeewoman from new mexico says she gets about two calls a 
week from the dukakis campaign and while shes still uncommitted 
shes leaning toward the massachusetts governor 
but for some phoneweary delegates the sale may be tough 
keron kerr of maine has an answering machine on her telephone 
that says hello this is keron kerr my delegate status is still 
uncommitted

government accounting practices and the 
deficitreduction drive prompted the pentagon on friday to stop 
buying office supplies ban overtime and limit civilian hiring for 
at least the next six weeks 
all new contracts for research and development work also have 
been put on hold temporarily as have purchases of everything from 
magazine and newspaper subcriptions to television sets library 
materials recreation equipment lawn mowers and furniture 
tools paint lumber air conditioners and forklifts also are on 
the prohibited list for the time being as are plans to lease cars 
office space or computer equipment 
the new restrictions ordered by deputy defense secretary 
william h taft iv will remain in place at least through june 30 
they were prompted by the terms of a deficitreduction 
compromise reached by president reagan and congress last november 
that compromise was crafted to control government outlays the 
amount of money actually spent during a fiscal year 
within the defense department however the number that counts 
is one known as budget authority the amount of money that can be 
obligated regardless of when it is going to be spent 
for example if congress authorizes 100 million for the navy to 
buy a new ship the navy has 100 million in multiyear budget 
authority but might pay out only 10 million for work performed the 
first year 
all that makes it difficult for the pentagon to project 
precisely how much it will pay out in a fiscal year a contractor 
might get more or less work done than originally expected 
taft said the pentagon now has to worry as well about the fiscal 
1988 outlay estimate contained in the deficitreduction agreement 
2773 billion 
one dollar of obligations almost always results in one dollar 
of outlays he told reporters 
whether it results in a dollar of outlays on sept 28 fiscal 
1988 as opposed to oct 2 fiscal 1989 certainly shouldnt be a 
large management concern and yet because of the focus on the 
deficit which is toted against outlays this is our problem 
based on spending reports received in march and april the 
defense department is paying out dollars at a rate that by the end 
of the year on sept 30 would put outlays some 25 billion above 
the 2773 billion total taft said 
while the outlay totals for those two months might be an 
aberration and spending will even out in future months the 
pentagon cant take any chances taft said so we are trying to 
get at discretionary spending that can be deferred for six weeks 
 
the spending hold will probably slow only about 500 million in 
outlays taft said but that will start attacking the problem while 
figures for may are compiled and officials see just how serious a 
problem they have 
one wild card in the projections involves the value of the 
dollar against foreign currencies taft said up to 1 billion of 
that 25 billion in fasterthanexpected outlays was needed to 
shore up allowances for soldiers overseas he said

misdemeanors punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of 
500 
nbc maintains the law violates its first amendment rights of 
free speech and commentary on the electoral process the ban 
interferes with the gathering and reporting of truthful and 
significant information about the political process on election 
day the network argued in federal court papers 
carried to its logical extreme two neighbors coming out of a 
polling place after voting could not ask how the other voted 
said billings attorney sid thomas who is representing nbc those 
who seek accurate legitimate information cannot do so 
the lawsuit filed thursday asks for preliminary and permanent 
injunctions to stop the state from enforcing the 200foot 
prohibition 
defendants in the suit are attorney general mike greely and 
commissioner of political practices dolores colburg 
both colburg and greely were out of their offices today and 
unavailable for comment 
the 1985 law was an outgrowth of the 1980 presidential election 
when the major tv networks declared ronald reagan the winner before 
polls had closed in the mountain and pacific time zones the 
restriction was sought so that voters in the west would not be 
discouraged from voting because the election was already declared 
over by the media

fourteenyearold niveen 
dahman does the housework for her family now that her mother is in 
jail she cooks and cleans and when clashes with israeli soldiers 
erupt she runs to the streets to help youngsters choking on tear 
gas 
i am doing the same as my mother its my duty said niveen 
sitting in her familys cement block house in the shati refugee 
camp in the next room was a box full of chickens that the family 
is raising to eat as the arab uprising persists bringing with it 
worsening economic conditions 
a new role for moslem children and women both held under strict 
rule in the traditional religious society is one of the changes 
spawned by the nearly sixmonth rebellion against israels 
occupation of the gaza strip and west bank 
according to un figures through april a quarter of the 4344 
palestinians in gaza injured in the revolt were under 16 
israeli authorities complain that their soldiers are 
increasingly facing women and children rioters 
now we are the leaders said 19yearold rafat sitting on 
the floor of another cement block house down the street from niveen 
dahmans home 
youth are leading burning tires stoning soldiers said 
rafat who would not give his last name women try to help the 
boys who are arrested or try to stop arrests they go to the kids 
when soldiers throw tear gas 
niveen dahmans mother widad was arrested this month as an 
inciter along with two other women in shati they were the 
first women to be jailed in the gaza strip under administrative 
detention laws where no trials or specific charges are required 
each was given six months in prison 
palestinian activitist mary khas says the arrests showed that 
israel has recognized the new power of women in the uprising 
women allowed out during curfew became messengers and lookouts 
she said 
women found their authority and strength and started 
organizing said ms khas who runs a kindergarten program 
throughout the gaza strip 
as for palestinian youth ms khas said they did what 
youngsters do try to change things it was a spontaneous mass 
revolt 
the palestine liberation organization and fundamentalist moslem 
groups are behind the rebellion but ms khas said it was the 
young the grassroots leadership that kept the uprising going 
she pointed out that israel had arrested many traditional 
leaders active in ploorganized committees of lawyers doctors and 
other professionals but still the revolt persists 
theyre all the time arresting what they call the leadership 
but they havent gotten the leaders she said 
riad al agha a former president of gaza islamic university 
said the stifling life of the refugee camps has spawned young 
leaders who do not have their parents fear of israeli soldiers 
the uprising right now is led by youth age 15 to 25 most live 
in the refugee camps around the strip and the west bank he said 
they will never listen to the older generation 
agha described the revolt this way most of the men go to work 
in israel and leave their sons at home to throw stones he said 
sons sometimes stop fathers from going to work but not forever 
agha who has a phd from the university of kansas said many 
of the youth in gaza have taken up the hardline ideas of the 
islamic jihad or holy war a radical fundamentalist group that 
wants an islamic state including all of what is now israel 
he said if the revolt persists with no israeli concessions 
youth will emerge as political leaders and replace socalled 
moderates who would be satisfied with a palestinian state alongside 
israel 
the young men on the streets think they are winning since they 
have faced israels might with only rocks and painted slogans 
one day last week a group of boys and young men set a tire 
ablaze at the entrance to gaza city they were waiting by the road 
with stones in hand 
hamad who said he was 15 but looked years younger said they 
wanted revenge for arabs beaten earlier and they hoped israeli 
soldiers would come by they also were targeting cars taking 
workers to israel he said 
i dont go to israel hamad said my work is here 
throwing stones

the reagan administrations plan to give cash 
to the contra rebels inside nicaragua is a last resort aimed at 
feeding the starving remnants of the guerrilla force the head of 
the us foreign aid program said friday 
there are people inside nicaragua who are desperate weve 
had reports of people eating tree roots alan woods 
administrator of the agency for international development told a 
senate subcommittee 
woods said aid plans to send cash at the rate of 1 per day per 
rebel but is still working out the details 
a march 23 agreement between the contras and nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government permits humanitarian aid to be sent to the 
rebels while the two sides hold peace talks 
but a dispute over how the aid should be delivered has meant no 
help has yet been sent and the state department came up with the 
cash plan as a substitute woods said 
we have taken this particular step as a last resort he 
said to keep the contras inside nicaragua while the peace talks 
are proceeding and thus keep the pressure on the sandinistas 
up to 3000 rebels have reportedly fled across the nicaraguan 
border into honduras to search for food in recent weeks 
we are seeing resistance fighters coming out of nicaragua at a 
high rate woods said 
details of the cash plan are still being worked out woods said 
but that at the rate of 1 per rebel per day for a 30day period 
the program will cost an estimated 450000 
the money in the nicaraguan currency of cordobas will sent by 
courier he said 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the senate foreign 
relations western hemisphere subcomittee was skeptical about the 
proposal 
this is a pretty weak accounting system dodd said adding 
that the plans raise serious questions about compliance with 
existing legislative restrictions 
congress specifically banned spending any of the aid money for 
weapons and woods said that will be difficult to do because 
cordobas are not generally accepted outside nicaragua 
he said we are concerned about accounting for the money but 
he told dodd on several occasions were doing the best we can 
under the circumstances 
woods won praise from two republicans on the subcommittee sens 
rudy boschwitz of minnesota and paul trible of virginia 
boschwitz said it really is a difficult situation while 
trible said its very easy to criticize but youre operating 
under very difficult circumstances 
the direct shipments of food have not begun because the two 
sides cannot agree on a neutral organization a requirement spelled 
out by congress in march when it voted 48 million in humanitarian 
aid 
woods said the international red cross has been rejected by the 
contras as a delivery agency but he didnt know why 
the simple bottom line is that if theyd reach agreement 
wed start delivering food he said 
aid will use any agency the two sides approve even the soviet 
airline aeroflot woods told the subcommiteee any mechanism the 
two sides approve is better than what were doing he said 
the contras and the sandinistas signed a temporary truce in 
sapoa nicaragua on march 23 they agreed to try to negotiate a 
permanent ceasefire during a 60day period starting april 1 
with the deadline for reaching agreement on formally ending 
their sixyear war just two weeks away there has been virtually no 
progress toward that objective

about 90 million in federal aid has been 
approved for the federal land bank of louisville ky the farm 
credit system assistance board announced friday 
eric p thor the boards chief executive officer said the 
louisville bank will receive assistance through the sale of up to 
90 million in preferred stock to the financial assistance corp 
which will raise funds for that investment by selling 15year bonds 
the board and corporation were created by last years 
agricultural credit act to help bail out the financially distressed 
farm credit system a network of cooperatively owned farm banks and 
associations 
thor said the louisville bank which serves borrowers in ohio 
indiana kentucky and tennessee applied to the board for financial 
help in february he said the board and the bank have reached 
agreement on a number of steps which will continue to strengthen 
the institutions financial management 
although the louisville bank had presented a wellthoughtout 
workable plan for financial recovery its stock had dropped to 65 
percent of par value and was unable to implement the plan without 
federal help he said 
the bank has made substantial progress in resolving its own 
financial problems over the past two years thor said 
programs included an assetliability management program in 1986 
to control interest rate risks and reduce costs and a marketbased 
loan pricing system in 1987 to provide competitive rates to 
borrowers also he said the bank reduced its nonperforming 
loans and inventory of acquired property by 30 percent and 
projects a similar reduction this year 
jeanne kling a spokewoman for the board said the 90 million 
for the louisville bank was the first fullblown assistance 
designated under the new law 
earlier this year the board approved 25 million in limited 
purpose assistance in shortterm funding to help the federal land 
bank of jackson miss stay in business and 205 million was 
provided to retire stock in six financially troubled production 
credit associations in the omaha neb and spokane wash 
districts 
but this is the first one that weve done under the general 
context of helping the bank in general ms kling said

will be broadcast in the soviet union on may 27 two days before he 
begins summit talks with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the session was similar to the television interview gorbachev 
gave nbctv anchorman tom brokaw last nov 28 before the start of 
the reagangorbachev summit in washington that interview lasted 
one hour 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan was 
questioned by valentin zorin and boris kalyagin from soviet 
television

moscow time a transcript is to be released at that hour to 
reporters accompanying reagan who then will be visiting helsinki

devastating earthquakes have occurred 
only every 200 to 400 years on the northern san andreas fault says 
a study that provides some comfort for san franciscans worried 
about a repeat of the deadly 1906 quake 
california institute of technology geologist carol s prentice 
who presented her study of earthquake frequency friday at the 
american geophysical unions spring meeting in baltimore said she 
found evidence of six great quakes in the last 2000 years along a 
260mile stretch of the fault the last was the 1906 shaker that 
killed at least 2500 people 
at this interval it would mean that the san francisco bay area 
is unlikely to have a devastating quake within the next 100 years 
and possiby much longer said prentices professor and coauthor 
geologist kerry sieh 
however sieh cautioned the study is preliminary so while one 
is tempted to conclude with certainty that a great earthquake is 
not likely in the near future in northern california that would be 
a premature conclusion at this point 
the study involved only the northern san andreas the hayward 
fault and other faults in northern california also pose a threat 
and the state office of emergency services says the probability of 
a damaging earthquake in the bay area in the next 30 years is about 
50 percent 
so people shouldnt get too complacent because of the new 
study prentice said thursday in a telephone interview from 
washington 
prentice made excavations across the san andreas near point 
arena about 160 miles north of san francisco and found evidence of 
at least six large quakes in the last 2000 years suggesting an 
occurrence of every 300 to 400 years 
however the study also found evidence the fault is building up 
strain at a rate that suggests the interval between large quakes 
might be only 200 years sieh said 
the 1906 quake ruptured a stretch of fault that starts just 
south of cape mendocino then runs south through point arena marin 
county and the san francisco peninsula to san juan bautista 
federal emergency officials have estimated a repeat of the quake 
would kill up to 11000 people seriously injure up to 44000 and 
cause 38 billion in damage 
for southern california forecasts of a great quakes advent are 
grimmer based on other studies including work by sieh the state 
office of emergency services says another major devastating quake 
in southern california is more than 50 percent likely within the 
next 25 years 
federal officials have projected that a great quake on the 
southern san andreas would kill up to 14000 people injure up to 
55000 and cause 17 billion in damage 
siehs research on the southern san andreas fault suggests great 
quakes occur an average of every 140 years on the section from 
tejon pass northwest of los angeles to cajon pass north of san 
bernardino the last such quake occurred in 1857 
he also found the next segment to the southeast from cajon pass 
through palm springs to the salton sea breaks in a great or major 
quake an average of every 200 to 250 years with the last such 
quake more than 300 years ago suggesting the segment is overdue 
for a big quake

a prostitute arrested on charges of 
attempted manslaughter for selling sex while carrying aids has been 
sent home because of her failing health 
elizabeth kay sherouse 24 was released from jail and placed 
under house arrest 
ms sherouse was arrested five months ago after investigators 
said she twice had sex with men knowing she carried the deadly 
virus the charges were later dismissed for lack of evidence but 
she remained in jail while the prosecution appealed the dismissal 
on thursday circuit judge michael cycmanick reduced her bail 
from 14000 to 1000 because of her declining health and a 
doctors prognosis that she had less than three years to live 
there is no way this girl will physically be able to get on 
the streets again her attorney william sheaffer said at the 
hearing i believe her last days should be spent with some degree 
of dignity we shouldnt allow her to die like we wouldnt allow 
some animals to die 
the aids virus triggered severe infections in most of her vital 
organs last month said her doctor phillip sanchez she had 
surgery a seizure and almost died twice of heart failure he said 
i feel real great about going home said ms sherouse frail 
but smiling as she left the orange county jail she was steadied by 
her attorney 
sanchez wrote the judge that he counseled ms sherouse about the 
possibilities of transmitting the acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome virus through sex but added the ability to understand 
the gravity of the situation was found to be uninterpretable by the 
patient 
prosecutor rick bogle argued that her release could endanger the 
public noting she had ignored previous counseling against having 
sex because she carried the aids virus 
her mother jeanette sherouse burst into tears when asked by 
sheaffer if her daughters grave condition would make her watch her 
daughter more closely mrs sherouse a nurses aide said she and 
her son would supervise her daughter

art thieves smashed a window in 
the municipal museum early friday and stole three masterpieces 
worth up to 52 million including works by vincent van gogh and 
paul cezanne it was the biggest art theft in dutch history 
the burglars broke a groundfloor window before dawn in the 
museums north wing which is relatively sheltered from public 
view said museum spokesman maarten bertheux the thieves then 
walked through five galleries to reach the room where the works 
were hanging he said 
stolen were carnations an 1888 work by the dutch painter 
van gogh bottle with apples a still life painted in 1894 by 
the french master cezanne and the house of maitre billaud in 
nevers an 1874 painting by dutch artist johan jongkind 
two other valuable van gogh paintings the diggers and the 
rocking chair were hanging in the same gallery but were not 
taken 
rini dippel the museums deputy director said they may have 
been left because they are substantially larger than the others 
museum director wim beeren said the stolen paintings are worth 
an estimated 52 million although experts from christies auction 
house in london estimated their worth at 11 million 
the municipal museum houses a collection of about 3000 works 
from the 19th and 20th centuries and is next door to the van gogh 
museum which has 220 paintings by the dutch master the worlds 
largest collection 
beeren and other art experts speculated that the theft was 
commissioned by a private art collector since the van gogh and the 
cezanne are too famous to be sold publicly and since the other van 
gogh works werent taken 
ive got the impression that they chose the paintings with a 
clear purpose in mind beeren said thisll go straight to 
somebodys room or home 
theres a very good reporting system on art thefts these 
days if theyre offered for sale at a bona fide art dealer or 
auction house thatll be known right away said fred leeman of 
the van gogh museum 
bertheux told the associated press that there was no one in the 
museum at the time of the burglary aroundtheclock surveillance 
by security personnel was abolished in 1975 to save money 
authorities were alerted when an alarm went off about 5 am 
but there were conflicting accounts on when the theft was 
discovered 
police spokesman joost van wijngaarden said police arrived at 
510 am entered the museum through the broken window and found 
nothing missing 
he said officers then left the museum and that private security 
guards discovered the theft about 90 minutes later 
but bertheux said museum officials discovered the theft almost 
immediately when they entered the buildings main lobby and ran 
past the targeted gallery on their way to investigate the broken 
window 
this is a terrible loss of prestige for museum security 
beeren told reporters at an impromptu news conference he appeared 
shaken and pale 
the paintings were not insured against theft 
beeren said he based his loss estimate on the fact that there 
is a van gogh involved and recent price developments for van 
goghs have been dramatic 
in march 1987 van goghs sunflowers fetched 398 million 
at a london auction in november an unidentified collector paid 
53 million for van goghs irises in new york 
ms dippel said experts from christies based their estimate on 
black and white photographs of the paintings in a museum catalog 
according to christies the van gogh is worth 16 million to 21 
million the cezanne is worth 79 million and the jongkind is 
worth 147000 
the nations last major art theft was in february 1987 when 
nine pieces including works by french painter jeanauguste renoir 
and dutch master pieter bruegel vanished from an art gallery in 
the southern city of maastricht 
the loss was estimated at 265 million the paintings were 
never recovered

merchant seamen who braved 
submarineinfested waters to keep weapons flowing to world war ii 
battlefields will sail again finally recognized as veterans of a 
war that ended four decades ago 
their voyage on saturday will last only a few hours but it will 
be aboard a ship sure to recall for many the hazardous days of 
their youth the fivehour cruise will be on the ss jeremiah 
obrien americas last liberty ship still in operating condition 
the obrien will go out the golden gate where wreaths will be 
cast on the sea in memory of the more than 5000 merchant seamen 
who died in the war they too veterans at last 
in january prodded by a federal judge the defense department 
recognized the civilian sailors who served on oceangoing merchant 
ships during world war ii as veterans a title it extended earlier 
to 13 other civilian groups including women who served as wartime 
telephone operators in europe 
the designation makes the former seamen eligible for certain 
veterans benefits including the right to be buried in a national 
cemetery 
george tuttle 72 who will be aboard the obrien on saturday 
said the delay in the granting of veteran status stemmed in part 
from jealousy 
there was a lot of animosity toward us from members of the 
other services said tuttle who was a captain on a ship that was 
sunk by a mine off italy we got a lot more money and our pay 
went up when we entered a combat zone some guys thought of us as 
draft dodgers 
but he noted that there were also benefits provided to members 
of the army navy and other services but not to merchant sailors 
for one thing our pay stopped if we were captured he said 
the merchant sailors are old now and few will use such benefits 
as the gi bill which helped educate so many former sailors and 
soldiers 
most are dead said tuttle there were about 250000 
members of the merchant marine but only about 80000 are still 
alive 
theres one benefit tuttle is particularly glad he is now 
entitled to 
therell be an american flag given to my relatives when i 
die he said with pride 
tuttle like many former merchant sailors living in the san 
francisco bay area spends time working as a volunteer on the 
441foot obrien the last unaltered example of 2751 liberty ships 
built between 1941 and 1945 
except for the annual cruise the ship stays docked near 
fishermans wharf where it is visited each year by thousands of 
tourists who want to see the type of ship that was part of 
americas bridge to victory 
another sailor veteran william krasnosky 76 recalls voyages 
during which the germans hit us with everything subs planes 
in one case his convoy was abandoned by the british destroyer 
that was escorting it and 23 out of 33 of the merchant ships were 
sunk by the germans 
but i never got sunk said krasnosky who plans to make the 
trip on the obrien i was lucky 
the guys at the union hiring hall would all want to know what 
ship i was going to sign on he said theyd want to sign too 
cause i was so lucky

because he had become an evil character in the fantasy game which 
involves medieval monsters

isolated from his parents and attorney during eight hours of 
questioning by state police

five yearstolife at the brookwood center a youth detention 
facility in claverack where he already has served 2 years

indiana censored it the fish head kazoo 
band played it and the state of washington rejected it but 
ignoring the threechord rock classic louie louie will be 
difficult in many cities this weekend 
not in indianapolis however 
the indiana city is one of 45 around the country holding 
louie louie parades this year to raise funds for the leukemia 
society of america 
but in indianapolis where a national movement to ban the song 
and its supposedly obscene lyrics began nearly 25 years ago the 
parade will be in late june or early july 
it cant be held this weekend because of scheduling conflicts 
associated with time trials for the indianapolis 500 auto race 
said deborah eschenbacher executive director of the groups local 
chapter 
the leukemia societys national headquarters recognizing the 
songs history even sent copies of the lyrics in its information 
packets 
they wanted to make sure that we as executive directors knew 
that they were all ok words something we could publish ms 
eschenbacher said 
thirty parades were scheduled this weekend in cities including 
washington philadelphia cincinnati columbus ohio and st 
louis mo 
the philadelphia parade in its fifth year has drawn 70000 
spectators and 50 floats brigades and marching bands the groups 
who play only louie louie include the bucks county fish head 
kazoo band and the future yuppies of america brigade 
the rhythmandblues ditty concerning a sailor telling a 
bartender about his girlfriend has come a long way since it was 
first recorded in 1956 by the pharaohs 
the 1963 version by the kingsmen a portland ore bar band 
reached no 2 in the charts and the controversy began early the 
following year when an indiana teenager wrote thengov matthew 
welsh 
if the song was played at a slow speed the boy said the lyrics 
sounded dirty welsh asked the states radio stations not to play 
the song 
the matter eventually was turned over to the marion county 
prosecutor the federal communications commission and the us 
justice department 
leroy k new chief trial deputy of the prosecutors office 
said he heard nothing obscene 
the record is an abomination of outoftune guitars an 
overbearing jungle rhythm and clanging cymbals he said 
the fcc meanwhile pronounced the recording unintelligible at 
any speed 
dick peterson an original member of the kingsmen said the song 
had become a theme of sorts in the northwest before his 
instrumental group decided to record it in hopes of landing a job 
on a cruise ship 
jack ely our original singer knew more words than anybody 
else so he yelled the majority of it peterson said in a 1986 
interview it was basically done to feature the drums and the 
guitar so jack just kind of yelled into the drum mike it turned 
out that you couldnt understand what was being said part of the 
beauty of the recording process 
the song was revived in the hit movie animal house and was 
selected by a wine cooler company to promote its product 
california coolers even put the kingsmen on the road for a series 
of free concerts a couple of years ago 
rhino records has issued a best of louie louie complete 
with versions of the song as done by the sandpipers the rice 
university marching band and others and there was a movement to 
have the tune proclaimed the washington state song three years ago 
which failed 
as for those controversial lyrics to louie louie which was 
written by richard berry in 1956

the us navy has decided to recover the 
wreckage of a helicopter gunship that went down in the persian 
gulf rather than blowing it up on the seabed a military official 
said friday 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the navy 
reversed its decision to better enable investigators to determine 
the cause of the crash specifically whether the marine corps 
ah1 cobra was lost to gunfire or missiles 
the helicopter vanished on a night reconnaissance mission april 
18 a few hours after us and iranian naval forces had fought a 
series of daylong clashes in the southern gulf 
it went down about 15 miles southeast of abu musa island where 
the iranians have a military base 
tehran later claimed that its forces shot down the helicopter 
the iranians said they had recovered the wreckage but offered no 
evidence 
us officials have said the cobras pilots reported in their 
last message that they were being tracked by hostile radar 
there were no reports or indications of weapons being fired in 
the area afterward the officials said 
the navy announced several days ago that the wreckage in 
several pieces about 130 feet deep off the united arab emirates 
coast would be destroyed in place by underwater demolition 
divers 
but fridays statement said that in order to facilitate 
further investigation given the condition of the wreckage the 
decision was made to recover the aircraft wreckage except for the 
ordnance the weapons would be destroyed separately it said 
the debris will be lifted by a seagoing crane that has been at 
the crash site for the past week with two salvage tugboats 
the us official also said the bodies of the two pilots 
recovered earlier will be flown to dover air base in dover del 
on friday 
the two marines capt kenneth hill 33 and capt stephen 
leslie 30 based at new river nc have been declared killed 
in action although the cause of the crash has yet to be 
estabished 
navy officers said that ruling could be made even if the 
aircraft was not actually shot down but crashed while trying to 
evade hostile fire 
the pilots were the only us casualties in the april 18 
clashes and raised to 46 the number of americans killed in 
military operations related to the gulf in the past year 
the biggest single casualty toll was 37 sailors killed aboard 
the us frigate stark may 17 last year when the warship came under 
a missile attack by an iraqi warplane 
baghdad said the pilot had mistaken the stark for an iranian 
warship

irans powerful parliament speaker on 
friday repeated his governments claim that tehran is at war with 
the united states and called for an arms buildup to fight the 
americans in the persian gulf 
the americans have officially entered into a war with us 
hashemi rafsanjani told revolutionary guards commanders he was 
quoted by the official islamic republic news agency which was 
monitored in nicosia 
we are really at war with the united states at the present 
time 
six newly arrived us warships took up station in the arabian 
sea and two others sailed into the gulf 
but there was no sign of hostilities as the us frigates 
pharris and elmer montgomery accompanied by the missile frigate 
john h sides passed through the strait of hormuz where iranian 
speedboats have attacked two commercial ships in recent days 
the pharris and elmer montgomery are part of an eightship 
battle group headed by the aircraft carrier forrestal that 
arrived in the arabian sea this week to provide air support for 
us convoy and patrol operations in the gulf 
rafsanjani also told moslem worshipers at a weekly prayer 
session in tehran university that if the united states fought iran 
they must wait to receive lots of their youths dead bodies 
iranian leaders have repeatedly said they consider that their 
country has been at war with the united states since the us navy 
buildup in the gulf in july to protect americanflagged ships from 
iranian attack 
irna quoted rafsanjani as saying should this war extend to 
new frontiers the americans will simply take delivery of the 
bodies of americans throughout the world 
tension heightened since the americans destroyed iranian 
offshore oil platforms and sank an iranian minelayer in the gulf 
last year 
us warships and aircraft sank or disabled six iranian vessels 
in a string of clashes april 18 in the most serious confrontation 
since the us intervention 
iranian anger mounted after a longrange raid by iraqi warplanes 
on the larak island oil terminal in the southern gulf may 14 in 
which five tankers were set ablaze 
iran claimed the americans jammed its radar and radio systems to 
help the iraqis us officials denied that 
rafsanjani reiterated that allegation friday and said us 
ships guided iraqi forces and caused trouble for our defensive 
forces iran reported 
despite the fiery rhetoric the iranians are clearly outgunned 
by the us navy in the gulf especially since two of their 
frigates were either sunk or crippled in last months naval clashes 
those two britishbuilt warships comprised half the major 
operational warships the iranians had 
the iranians still have several missile boats and a fleet of 
armed speedboats manned by revolutionary guards which have 
attacked two neutral merchant ships in the gulf this week after a 
threeweek lull 
following baghdads recapture last month of the faw peninsula in 
southern iraq seized by the iranians in february 1986 ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini dismissed the armed forces chief of staff brig 
gen ismael sohrabi 
unconfirmed reports from tehran noted that other senior officers 
have been replaced heightening the belief that khomeini seeks a 
more aggressive strategy to make up for the chain of recent defeats 
rafsanjani closely allied with the revolutionary guards corps 
is considered the most powerful figure in iran after khomeini and 
is the revolutionary patriarchs represenative on the supreme 
defense council 
the council determines irans military strategy in the 
7yearold war 
the supreme defense council called april 18 on iranians to fight 
the united states 
a foreign ministry statement on the same day warned the united 
states to expect a severe response from iran alleging that 
american military helicopters fought on the iraqi side in the 
recapture of faw

women prisoners in a soviet penal colony are 
driven to lesbianism and drugs by a demeaning life of ugly clothes 
and too many rules a newspaper reported friday in an unprecedented 
article about prison conditions 
the regime of the colony gives rise to a destructive process 
in a woman a prisoner identified only as kutsyenkova told the 
newspaper sovietskaya rossiya 
marching in formation ugly clothes banging of iron 
commands meatless diet this makes one insipid dull leads one 
to search for emotional relief at any price said the inmate a 
former college lecturer whose doctoral dissertation was about the 
family 
she told the newspaper that prisoners could fight off a 
breakdown for five years at the most but then the organism 
catastrophically weakens and prisoners seek solace in smoking 
lesbianism and narcotics 
kutsyenkova said the prisoner experiences an atrophy of will 
and initiative a growing of uncontrollable rage 
the article was one of the first about conditions in camps for 
women prisoners conditions at the countrys notorious penal 
colonies and labor camps for men described in the books of exile 
alexander solzhenitsyn were once taboo subjects for the soviet 
media but kremlin chief mikhail s gorbachevs policy of open 
discussion of the countrys problems has produced several reports 
exposing deficiencies in the criminal justice system 
the article described conditions at corrective labor womens 
colony no 6515 in kuybyshev 620 miles southeast of moscow on the 
volga river 
the man in charge of the prisons alexander v vlasov 
acknowledged in a commentary accompanying the article that 
improvements are needed 
quite a few problems have piled up in the system of corrective 
labor institutions wrote vlasov minister of internal affairs 
perestroika is needed also in this sphere in which the human 
factor should be made predominant too 
perestroika is gorbachevs term for his administrative and 
economic overhaul of soviet society 
the article said punishment of prisoners is often 
counterproductive causing them to get into more trouble rather 
than lead them to rehabilitation 
kutsyenkova said some inmates dont want to be freed because 
they have no families left outside after serving long prison terms 
two freed prisoners slept several nights outside the colony gate 
praying to be taken back into the colony because they couldnt 
live on their own the article said 
the article did not say why kutsyenkova had been jailed but said 
the colonys inmates had murdered husbands and children taken 
bribes or engaged in other forms of corruption among the inmates 
were a director of a large store senior lecturers at colleges a 
chief bookkeeper and an engineereconomist sovietskaya rossiya 
said 
prisoners are forced to work shifts as long as 1012 hours in 
sewing shops with poor ventilation the article said 
punishment of 1015 days in an isolation cell is meted out for 
such things as going out without a shawl loudly saying goodnight 
to cellmates and smoking in a prohibited area the newspaper said 
vlasov said his ministry is trying to improve the quality of its 
personnel at the colonies and labor camps new criminal and 
corrective labor codes are being drafted to make the punishment 
more appropriately fit a convicts crime and to provide for a 
reduction of sentences in some cases 
an experiment is planned in which prisoners will be released 
early for good work and good behavior 
he did not specifically address the problems of lesbianism and 
drug addiction among the women prisoners 
in may the tass news agency carried a report saying life in one 
camp outside moscow is hard but that prisoners are treated fairly 
and given free time and an opportunity to get an education 
soviet officials say the camps are designed to make inmates take 
a conscientious attitude toward work and teach them to abide by the 
law western organizations estimate the camps hold 1 million people

archbishop desmond tutu 
compared apartheid to nazism during an emotional ceremony friday in 
which he was installed as chancellor of the countrys most militant 
university 
the black anglican leader who returned thursday from a month in 
europe and the united states also defended his controversial 
appeals for tougher western sanctions against south africa 
the problem is not sanctions the problem is apartheid tutu 
told students and staff at the university of the western cape i 
want apartheid destroyed not reformed if it can be done away with 
without sanctions i will sing hallelujah 
tutus calls for punitive sanctions were covered extensively by 
the south african media during his trip his remarks have been 
denounced not only by the government but also by white and black 
moderates who contend that sanctions will increase black 
unemployment without inducing whites to accept reforms 
there are those who seek to generate hysteria tutu said of 
his critics the onus is on those who oppose sanctions to provide 
a viable nonviolent alternative 
tutu who won the 1984 nobel peace prize for his fight against 
apartheid was greeted by several hundred cheering students when he 
arrived at the universitys main hall before the ceremony 
his aides had to form a human wall around him as they ushered 
him through a crowd that chanted the archbishops name and waved 
placards with slogans like viva sanctions and viva tutu 
tutu said he accepted the chancellorship on behalf of detainees 
political exiles displaced blacks and other victims of this vile 
and obscene system of apartheid 
he said apartheid is so utterly evil immoral unbiblical and 
unchristian that it can only be compared with that equally evil 
system naziism 
as chancellor at university of the western cape tutu will be 
the honorary leader of a university that the government established 
for mixedrace students in 1960 as part of its segregated 
educational system 
he praised the university near cape town as south africas 
most potent academic institutional dissident 
in the past decade the university has increased its black 
enrollment from a handful to 13 percent of the 11500 students its 
students and staff have grown increasingly militant in their 
opposition to apartheid under which the nations black majority 
has no voice in national affairs 
the universitys chief administrator rector jakes gerwel says 
the campus will be an intellectual home for the left 
tutu has been the target of government wrath for years because 
of his support of sanctions recently the archbishop has drawn an 
unprecedented degree of criticism from white liberals 
business day a johannesburg newspaper often critical of the 
government said in a recent editorial that blacks should insist 
that tutu live in the same conditions as the poorest unemployed 
black squatter

demonstrators converged on the soviet supreme 
court building friday to demand that the trials of those charged in 
ethnic rioting that killed 32 people be opened to television 
cameras and armenian observers 
an armenian activist said in a telephone interview from the 
republics capital yerevan that the city was quiet after two 
large public gatherings earlier in the week 
the demonstration by about 30 armenians across the street from 
the downtown supreme court building indicated continuing skepticism 
about the prosecution of those suspected of involvement in three 
days of ethnic rioting that began feb 28 in the azerbaijani city 
of sumgait 
twentysix armenians and six azerbaijanis were killed in the 
violence which was touched off by a dispute between the two 
southern soviet republics over control of the mountainous 
nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan 
most residents of nagornokarabakh are ethnic armenians and 
they began agitating in february to be annexed to armenia that 
touched off large demonstrations in yerevan in support of their 
demand 
uniformed and plainclothes police lined the sidewalk in front of 
the sixstory supreme court but did not interfere with the protest 
armenian painter koryun nagapityan 60 said he would present a 
declaration to the supreme court from unions representing armenian 
artists writers and other creative workers calling for full 
openness in criminal proceedings against more than 80 people 
charged in the rioting 
nagapityan read the declaration demanding several armenians be 
allowed to attend the sumgait trials as observers that proceedings 
not be left in the hands of azerbaijan authorities that the names 
of the dead and missing in sumgait be published and that the 
trials be carried live on staterun tv 
demonstrators unrolled paper signs reading recognize the fact 
of armenian genocide in sumgait strictly punish the organizers 
of the sumgait slaughter and we know the names of 50 victims 
of the sumgait slaughter 
on monday an azerbaijani metalworker talekh salekh ogli 
ismailov was found guilty of premeditated murder in the rioting 
and given the maximum sentence of 15 years ismailov was the first 
person convicted for taking part in the unrest 
but armenian sources said about 150000 people gathered the next 
day in yerevan to stress that conviction of people involved in the 
rioting did not meet their demands for solving the regions 
problems 
they said several thousand people also gathered in stepanakert 
the main city of nagornokarabakh on tuesday and that the 
atmosphere in nagornokarabakh was tense 
armenian activist rafael popoyan said in a telephone 
conversation from yerevan on thursday that thousands more gathered 
that evening in a main city square 
contacted friday he said the thursday gathering apparently 
broke up after about four hours with nothing happening and that 
the city was quiet on friday 
demonstrators in moscow differed over the sentence given 
ismailov one armenian who refused to give his name said 15 
years is not the issue the issue is bringing those who organized 
the butchery to trial 
but nagapityan shouted why does the person who committed such 
a crime have the right to live 
one middleaged russian woman who said she was married to an 
azeri argued briefly with the demonstrators saying she disagreed 
with their version of the events in sumgait but she soon left 
the soviet government rejected the demand to change jurisdiction 
over nagornokarabakh opting instead for a long expensive program 
of social and economic development

one of londons leading bookmakers has stopped 
taking bets on the sex and name of the duchess of yorks unborn 
child because her husband prince andrew was quoted as saying it 
will be a girl called annabel 
the sun newspaper reported friday that andrew told a yorkshire 
cricket team about his prediction this week after the team offered 
him a childs cricket bat 
it wont be much use im sure we are having a girl the 
paper quoted andrew as saying it said the 28yearold prince a 
royal navy helicopter pilot told the guests the baby will be 
called annabel 
in britain cricket is primarily played by boys 
the former sarah ferguson who married queen elizabeth iis son 
in july 1986 is expecting their first child in august 
buckingham palace said the report that the 28yearold duchess 
was expecting a girl was just speculation 
certainly we are not in a position to talk about the private 
coversations of the duke of york its all speculation said a 
spokeswoman who by custom was not identified 
but graham sharpe a spokesman for bookmakers william hill 
said we decided that the reported remarks of the duke of york 
represented an ideal opportunity for us to close the book on the 
sex and name of the baby 
sharpe said if andrews quote had surfaced soon after the 
duchess become pregnant we might not have given it credence 
but now that shes six months along he said they must have a 
good idea of what they would call the baby be it male or female 
after six months if they want to know what the sex of the baby is 
its very easy to find out 
in recent weeks he said annabel went from a 201 to 31 
favorite 
the last time anything similar happened was when we had heavy 
backing for the name william to be chosen as the name of charles 
and dianas firstborn and of course we all know what happened 
there 
andrews older brother prince charles and his wife princess 
diana chose william as the name of their first son who was born 
in june 1982 william is second in line to the british throne 
behind his father 
sharpe said william hill had taken in about 56000 in bets on 
the name and sex of the baby 
its not as much as was bet on william but its more than on 
harry he said prince harry the second son of charles and 
diana was born in september 1984 
sharpe said punters with an appetite for things royal would 
still be able to bet on the weight of the duchess baby and its 
birth date were offering 71 against them being able to tell us 
the date on which the baby is born he said

the government friday backed 
down from previous threats to act against the cbs television 
network for a documentary about apartheid but it warned of a 
larger crackdown on the media 
home affairs minister stoffel botha told parliament he was 
considering the establishment of a government disciplinary body to 
monitor the press and criticized what he called media 
terrorists 
in december botha had said he might take unspecified actions 
against the cbs news bureau in johannesburg following the broadcast 
in the united states of the documentary children of apartheid 
the government had described the documentary narrated by walter 
cronkite as blatant distortion 
botha said friday that the president of cbs news howard 
stringer had issued a statement and that no action would be taken 
the program consisted largely of interviews with young people in 
south africa both black and white among those interviewed were 
the daughters of president pw botha and nelson mandela the 
jailed leader of the african national congress 
the government complained about the way the film was made as 
well as the content botha said cronkite and cbs producer brian 
ellis had misled the government about the project and had failed to 
obtain work permits 
on friday botha quoted cbs as saying that the circumstances 
surrounding the making of the program were such as to give grounds 
for objection by the south africa government and cbs regretted 
that it has not been meticulous in complying with south african 
procedures regarding foreign media 
a cbs spokesman in new york said the network acknowledged that 
south africa has complex procedures and requirements that must be 
followed 
were proud that the documentary was broadcast said the 
spokesman tom goodman 
botha also said that the media council an independent body 
established by newspapers in 1983 to monitor the news industry had 
failed to act against publications that allegedly promoted 
revolutionary causes 
freedom of expression in south africa will not be allowed to 
such an extent that it fosters chaos and revolt in the country 
botha said 
botha suggested that the government body would be aimed at 
media terrorists 
media terrorists are people who do not have the guts to be 
terrorists themselves botha said ive heard it said its an 
ego trip by dropouts from other fields of endeavor 
south africa already has extensive press restrictions state of 
emergency regulations in effect since june 1986 restrict reporting 
on unrest security force actions and many types of antigovernment 
protests 
two antiapartheid newspapers have been suspended by the 
government for publishing purported subversive material and several 
others have been warned that they could face action 
by south african law and custom apartheid establishes a 
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy

finish in 1988 
under the present accord the four american bases would have to 
close down 17 months after it expires dec 31 1988 a shutdown 
notice has to be issued five months earlier 
well denounce the agreement therefore the bases wont 
exist de jure legally after january 1989 papandreou was quoted 
as saying 
four us military bases have been operating in greece since the 
early 1950s two near athens and two on the southern island of 
crete

and said they could lead to an agreement 
in washington this week us assistant secretary of state 
rozanne ridgway also said the united states was expecting greece to 
issue the shutdown notice

national interests a reference to longstanding regional

aegean airspace and seabed mineral rights as well as the military 
status of some greek islands

democratic national chairman paul kirk unveiled 
the party line against republican nomineeinwaiting george bush on 
friday calling him a quintessential elitist establishment 
republican countryclubber and a donothing public official 
kirks broadside came during a meeting of the association of 
democratic state chairs which drew party leaders from throughout 
the country to review arrangements for the democratic national 
convention in atlanta this summer 
kirk said bush has neither the toughness to govern nor the 
compassion to care its debutante balls and deep doodoo 
when he speaks for himself but when his imagemakers tell him what 
to do its kick a little ass and climb aboard an 18wheeler 
the phrase deep doodoo has been attributed to the vice 
president and after his debate with democratic vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro in 1984 he said he had kicked ass 
kirk said the challenge for democrats this fall is to make 
sure that when people go to the polls in november george bush will 
have a rendezvous with his own record 
the democratic chairman noted that bush was given responsibility 
for a task force to stop drugs at the us borders 
isnt it fair kirk said for voters to ask of the person 
entrusted with that special responsibility not only why are we 
losing the war against drugs but also how could you not have 
known about drug thug noriega dealing drugs and laundering money 
and running guns 
kirk also noted that in march 1986 bush released the report of 
the antiterrorism task force in which he said this country would 
offer no concessions to terrorists just one week earlier the 
white house completed the first delivery of missiles to the 
ayatollah khomeini in iran 
bush has maintained that he had reservations about the 
irancontra dealings and was excluded from decisionmaking on the 
matter 
after kirks address which anticipated the general election 
campaign in the fall state party leaders were reminded by jesse 
jacksons campaign that the contest for the democratic nomination 
isnt over yet 
rep charles rangel of new york a jackson supporter said 
democrats can win the election in november only if they are unified 
after leaving the convention and that could depend on not writing 
off jackson too soon he said 
you dont have to be a professional politician to know that 
this type of thinking will allow you to win the nomination and lose 
the election rangel said 
a somewhat different view came from robert a farmer treasurer 
of frontrunner michael dukakis campaign 
history suggests that where a party has been able to identify 
a candidate early he has a stronger chance of success in the 
fall he said and i think we dont want to appear arrogant and 
we dont want to appear cocky but were very pleased the way 
things are going and if we can identify the nominee early i 
think we can all begin to work together 
outside the meeting room there was scattered talk of a vice 
presidential running mate for dukakis 
georgia party chairman john henry anderson said hed heard home 
state sen sam nunns name mentioned frequently as proof he 
steered reporters to alabama party chairman john baker 
baker commented i personally think that the best ticket from 
the alabama standpoint is the dukakisnunn ticket i think dukakis 
stands a chance to carry alabama maybe with some other people 
than nunn but i believe that would be by far the strongest 
ticket 
ohio chairman jim ruvolo said he is pushing ohio sen john 
glenn who sought the partys presidential nomination in 1984 
we think glenn balances the ticket in terms of his strength as 
someone experienced in defense issues foreign policy issues 
someone whos viewed as a moderate he said and certainly his 
record on important issues like civil rights is right there in the 
mainstream of the party

radical students on friday scaled the 
walls of the us embassy tossed homemade bombs at its buildings 
and shouted yankee go home in protests called to mark a bloody 
demonstration eight years ago 
witnesses said two people were injured in the attack which broke 
out shortly before noon seven attackers were arrested 
us embassy officials said the bombs didnt damage the 
buildings and no americans were hurt 
witnesses said students some of them armed with steel bars 
hurled six homemade bombs at police and over the embassy walls 
topped with barbed wires 
four of the devices made from crude chemical explosives packed 
in soft drink cans exploded with big bangs sending about 100 
people waiting for visa applications running for cover witnesses 
said 
a police officer was hospitalized with blast wounds on his neck 
and hands they said a student was also injured when he was hit by 
a policeman armed with an iron bar 
five students carrying one south korean and two us flags 
climbed over the 6foothigh fence and ran around the embassy 
compound for several minutes scattering leaflets 
one student draped a south korean national flag over his 
shoulder while other students tried to destroy two us flags 
before being overpowered by police the witnesses said 
the students also tried to unfurl a placard which read drive 
out america culprit of the kwangju massacre they said 
the placard refered to an antigovernment uprising in kwangju on 
may 18 1980 during which hundreds were killed fridays protests 
and others earlier this week were called to commemorate the 
bloodshed in that southern city 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman said 
the embassy incident lasted only about five minutes redman said 
five policemen and one student were injured 
he added theres no excuse for this kind of behavior there 
is a political system now in korea that provides for the expression 
of political views and participation in the political process 
national police remained on full alert to cope with the 
demonstrations 
radical groups called for another march in seoul on saturday to 
denounce the government opposition church groups also called for 
peaceful protests 
in other parts of seoul and two provincial cities hundreds of 
students staged demonstrations and marches demanding the fall of 
the government of president roh taewoo and the withdrawal of 
41000 us troops stationed here under a mutual defense treaty 
many of the protests were peaceful but some turned into battles 
with riot police who retaliated with tear gas in kwangju 400 
students clashed with police hurling firebombs and rocks 
eight students were arrested in suwon 25 miles south of seoul 
when they stormed an office of the governing democratic justice 
party with firebombs and sticks riot police overpowered the 
attackers 
protesters have denounced the united states in demonstrations 
this week charging that washington supports military dictatorship 
in south korea 
demonstrators broke windows and hurled firebombs thursday at the 
seoul office of the us information service the center was seized 
by radicals in february who exploded several bombs that caused 
minor damage 
radical groups call for the overthrow of the roh government 
which they consider a continuation of its predecessor military 
dictatorship led by former president chun doohwan 
roh is distrusted by many koreans because of the role he played 
in chuns government roh narrowly won presidential elections in 
december after two opposition candidates ran and split the 
opposition ticket 
on friday rohs government and the opposition failed to break a 
stalemate over clearing the way for talks between the president and 
opposition leaders 
both sides have called for negotiations between the two camps 
after last months legislative elections in which the opposition 
took control of the national assembly 
officials of the rival parties have met several times during the 
past week but failed to work out details on opening the assembly 
one major stumbling block has been rohs plan to include the 
head of his democratic justice party in the summit with kim 
daejung and the two other main opposition party leaders kim 
youngsam and kim jongpil 
the opposition leaders want only roh to meet with the opposition 
chiefs 
chun used to include the chairman of his ruling party in 
summits but opposition leaders emboldened by their election 
victory last month now object to the idea

jurors in the case of carlos lehder 
rivas decided friday that the government can confiscate millions of 
dollars in real estate on a bahamian island as well as several 
planes and other items owned by the convicted drug dealer 
the island is wrecked it is trashed but that is not to say 
it would not be of some future value us attorney robert merkle 
said 
the same jury had found the 38yearold colombian guilty on all 
11 drugtrafficking counts thursday after seven days of 
deliberations codefendant jack carlton reed 57 was found guilty 
on one count of conspiracy 
the issue of property forfeiture has to be considered separately 
under federal law 
during thursdays hearing on that assistant us attorney ernst 
mueller urged the jurors to allow the government to confiscate a 
large portion of normans cay an airstrip a marina three homes 
a condominium and several planes the island was lehders smuggling 
base from 1978 to 1980 
if you prosecute a drug smuggler without taking his property 
only part of the job has been accomplished said mueller 
according to internal revenue service figures lehder earned an 
estimated 250 million in the cocaine business 
after 10 hours of deliberations the jury agreed friday to all 
the forfeitures but the question of how the government could take 
control of property in the bahamas was not clear 
lehder faces up to life plus 150 years in prison and 350000 in 
fines when he is sentenced july 20 reed faces a maximum of 15 
years and 25000 in fines 
lehders attorney edward shohat told us district judge 
howell w melton after the jury was dismissed friday that under the 
uscolombia treaty in existence at the time of lehders 
extradition his client might face a maximum of only 30 years in 
prison merkle disagreed and the judge asked both sides to submit 
briefs on the question 
meanwhile merkle refused again friday to confirm reports that 
bahamian prime minister lynden o pindling who trial witnesses 
said received milliondollar bribes from lehder is his next 
target 
pindling and his aides have denied taking bribes but have said 
they understand a florida grand jury is investigating the matter 
merkle said he could not confirm the existence of such an 
investigation 
although lehder was only on trial for smuggling 33 tons of 
cocaine from colombia via normans cay in the bahamas into deserted 
airstrips in florida and georgia the government presented 
testimony that lehder smuggled 18000 kilos 
lehder has been identified as being one of the leaders of the 
violent medellin cartel the colombian organization also reputedly 
headed by pablo escobar gaviria jorge ochoa vasquez and jose 
rodriguez gacha 
the sevenmonth trial included 22 weeks of testimony from 115 
government witnesses along with mounds of documents lehder was 
extradited to the united states last year following a firefight and 
his arrest by the colombian army at a medellin mansion 
during the trial merkle called lehder the henry ford of drug 
trafficking the man who turned cocaine smuggling into a modern 
hightech operation using airdrops and speed boats 
lehder also is under indictment in miami for his role in the 
cartel and a sealed indictment in los angeles but officials said 
it is unlikely that he can be tried for those offenses

a woman honored recently as the bay area 
gifted teacher of the year has been told by school officials she 
must retire next month so the district can save money 
i feel they are dishonoring the teacher of the year said 
flossie lewis 63 a teacher for 37 years i understand the 
bureaucratic mentality but what are we in education for to treat 
people like robots 
the san francisco unified school district has said lewis must 
retire although a state law would allow her to continue with the 
districts permission 
rod hong district personnel director said the system has about 
550 teachers over age 59 earning top pay the system is seeking 
their retirements to cut costs 
hong also noted that lewis five years are up on a statewide 
reduced workload program that allows her to work half a year and 
receive half her 40000 salary yet still get full retirement 
benefits 
previous state law required teachers to retire after five years 
in the program but last year the law was changed to permit school 
districts to extend the program to 10 years 
chris karlen executive director of the san francisco classroom 
teachers association said he asked officials to permit the 
extension for lewis but they refused however schools 
superintendent ramon cortines indicated wednesday the district 
would be willing to negotiate 
while most teachers use the reduced workload program as a way to 
ease into retirement lewis a published author of fiction essays 
and literary criticism has started working on a doctorate in 
english at the university of california at berkeley 
hong said friday he doesnt have a figure on how much money the 
district would save if all the teachers eligible to resign or 
participate in reduced workload program like lewis did so he 
did say at least 25 teachers are in the reduced workload plan 
still hong said he will not make an exception for lewis 
its not that were trying to be mean or cruel to her he 
said shes just one teacher we have to treat all district 
employees equally she wants her cake and she wants to be able to 
eat it too

the soviet union is about to get a taste 
of cajunstyle diplomacy as chef john folse carries his fiery 
recipes abroad and artist george rodrigue introduces a new audience 
to his haunting portraits of acadiana 
the two left new orleans on friday for a 10day trip to the 
ussr that will overlap summit talks between president reagan 
and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
seeds for the trip were planted in august according to 
rodrigue when a soviet delegation of scientists and public 
officials visited folses restaurant lafittes landing in 
donaldsonville 
it was rodrigue said the delegations first glimpse of rural 
culture in america 
this was not part of their typical american concept we were 
the people living off the land the artist said in a telephone 
interview as he prepared for his departure 
the soviets met folse and sampled his food i doubt the 
soviets ever ate a better meal folse said later 
the soviets also met rodrigue and saw his art i told them i 
paint the people of the land he said 
rodrigues portraits of acadians often posed against the 
backdrop of mossdraped oak trees on bayou shores captured the 
imagination of the soviets 
soviet officials commissioned a gorbachev portrait and rodrigue 
painted him in a yellow suit because yellow is a color of 
peace gorbachev is depicted in front of the kremlin with a 
bright sun shining and smaller figures of himself as a child 
standing with his parents in the background 
the gorbachev portrait and one of reagan will make the trip to 
the soviet union along with about 20 rodrigue paintings depicting 
cajun life 
i tried to pick things that were kind of universal one is a 
horse race one is a story of a church in the aftermath of a 
hurricane one is of a dog my dog one is my little boy with 
the saying kiss me im cajun on his tshirt said the artist 
rodrigue credits folse with arranging the trip folse got help 
from the louisiana congressional delegation earlier this week he 
said he had raised more than half the 130000 he needed to cover 
the costs of food and expenses 
he said he wont keep any of the money however 
the soviets will keep every nickel of revenue he said i 
hope reagan makes a better deal than i did 
rodrigue said he hopes both world leaders will visit the 
temporary cajun restaurant lafittes landing east where he and 
folse will display their artistry 
were pretty sure about gorbachev paying a visit to the 
restaurant rodrigue said the president we dont know

ptl bankruptcy trustee david clark 
announced his resignation friday after a gallant but 
unsuccessful attempt to keep the scandaltainted organization 
intact 
i came here in november to do all in my power to preserve and 
reorganize the ptl ministry and christian retreat clark said in 
a letter friday to us trustee john waites a justice department 
official in columbia who presides over bankruptcy cases 
it is now clear that much of ptl must be sold to pay 
creditors clark 47 said although i have no desire to 
preside over the sale of ptl assets i maintain a strong commitment 
to the survival of the ministry and i hope to be of assistance to 
that end 
clarks resignation was provided for in a revised reorganization 
plan filed with the federal bankruptcy court monday but no time 
was specified the filing outlined plans to sell the heritage usa 
theme park in fort mill and lease the property required to carry on 
its church and television ministry to a separate corporation 
in the court filing clark had blamed the financial failure on a 
drop in contributions after the various scandals and warned 
because of past scandals and credibility problems ptl and other 
television ministries are facing extinction 
if the new reorganization terms are approved by the bankruptcy 
court clark would stay on as initial president of the nonprofit 
corporation heritage ministries inc that would run the church 
and cable television network later a board of directors would 
determine who would serve as permanent president 
clark had previously served as vice president of marketing at 
the christian broadcasting network 
in addition to sending the letter to waites clark announced his 
resignation on the ptl club tv show friday and told viewers he 
is taking a weeks vacation he did not indicate whether he would 
continue as host of the show 
clark could not be reached for comment later friday his office 
said he had gone for the day 
he is the third television evangelist to resign as head of ptl 
in 14 months jim bakker who founded ptl in 1974 resigned in 
march 1987 amid a sexandmoney scandal and turned the ministry 
over to the rev jerry falwell founder of the moral majority 
falwell resigned in october 1987 amid disenchantment with his 
leadership 
us bankruptcy court judge rufus reynolds approved clarks 
resignation and the appointment of mc benton to succeed clark as 
trustee to manage the daytoday operations of ptl waites said 
benton former mayor of winstonsalem nc has served as ptls 
executive vice president for accounting and operational affairs 
since feb 1 
ptl approximately 130 million in debt filed for 
reorganization and protection from creditors in bankruptcy court in 
june 1987 the ministrys assets are valued at 160 million 
dr clark made a gallant effort to ensure the successful 
reorganization of ptl waites said considering the problems 
which preceded him at ptl and the troubled times for television 
ministries generally the financial support of ptl during clarks 
tenure was impressive 
however ptl failed to raise enough money to make the initial 
payment of its debt as required under a reorganization plan filed 
in december a modified reorganization plan filed monday called for 
the trustee to liquidate the assets of ptl to the extent necessary 
to pay creditors 
two parties interested in buying ptl are george shinn a sports 
entrepreneur from charlotte nc who wants to build a 
professional baseball and basketball complex and family

the pentagon should take a slower more 
measured approach to the deployment of a star wars antimissile 
defense system a scientific advisory panel said in a report 
released friday 
the panel a special task force of the defense science board 
said the administrations plan of setting up even an interim 
phase 1 system all at once is too ambitious 
in view of the technical budgetary political and arms 
control uncertainties surrounding the ballistic missile defense 
program the panel recommends planning a number of steps in the 
technical development and deployment of a system rather than a 
single major action the report said 
the task force suggested the defense department start by 
deploying 100 groundbased interceptor rockets as allowed under the 
1972 antiballistic missile treaty either outside washington 
dc or at grand forks air force base nd 
the next step it said should be deployment of a new generation 
of space surveillance systems to improve our early warning 
detection and assessment of a ballistic missile attack 
that could be followed by deployment of new shortrange 
interceptor missiles around washington with the next phase 
consisting of additional bases and groundbased interceptors and 
improved sensors to cope with countermeasures 
only then would a move be made to deploy defensive weapons in 
space the panel said with the final step being the addition of 
ground or spacebased lasers 
this approach would allow for more confident decisions and 
more flexibility in the face of uncertainties and would probably 
not require any more time in the long run the task force 
contended 
the science board task force was asked to take a fresh look at 
the star wars program early this year by defense secretary frank c 
carlucci its report was dated april 13 but was not cleared for 
unclassified release until friday 
the pentagon in finally releasing the study stressed the 
findings were solely those of the authors and the submission of 
the report to the secretary in no way signals a change in us 
policy with respect to the star wars program 
the star wars program known formally as the strategic defense 
initiative is an effort to develop lasers and other exotic weapons 
that could be deployed either in space or on the ground to 
automatically shoot down enemy nuclear missiles 
last september thendefense secretary caspar w weinberger 
selected five star wars technologies for concentrated research 
saying they would form the heart of an initial phase 1 system 
among the five were some spacebased as well as groundbased rocket 
systems 
ever since then the pentagon has suggested the research results 
involving all five technologies would be evaluated sometime in the 
early 1990s and a decision made on constructing an initial system 
we believe that the difficulty of supporting such a large 
decision all at once and of bringing all system elements to a 
satisfactory stage at the same time make the allatonce plan very 
risky the task force said 
the stepped plan allows much more confident decisions and much 
more flexibility in the face of uncertainties 
the pentagon also should consider giving the highest priority to 
development of the sensors processing and communications 
necessary to detect a nuclear attack and track and target 
incoming missiles it said 
moreover it said the defense department and congress must 
resolve their dispute over what research the abm treaty allows 
there is not a force acting on the sdi program that is more 
damaging or more insidious the 11member group wrote 
because the soviets exploit ambiguities to the limit a us 
policy that restricts us to activities that are unambiguously 
permitted by the treaty could seriously impair our security the 
panel said 
we believe the defense department should define a technically 
optimum testing and deployment program and should then adhere to 
that program except when treaty constraints unambiguously require 
it to do otherwise 
the assessment requested by carlucci comes at a time when the 
defense secretary has been studying changes to the star wars 
research schedule caused by congressional budget cuts 
carlucci said earlier this month he would recommend a budget 
veto if the star wars request of 455 billion in fiscal 1989 was 
cut too deeply

the foreign ministry on friday accused pakistan of 
shipping arms and military hardware to afghan rebels and violating 
the agreement under which soviet soldiers are leaving afghanistan 
the official news agency tass quoted ministry officials as 
saying pakistan was not living up to the april 14 geneva agreement 
that prohibits it from assisting afghan antigovernment forces 
in a separate commentary tass criticized pakistani foreign 
minister zain noorani for allegedly inciting the rebels to military 
action 
according to soviet media reports the afghan foreign ministry 
has complained twice this week to un observers that pakistan is 
helping arm the afghan rebels 
soviet foreign ministry officials said the shipping of arms 
and ammunition from pakistan into the territory of the republic of 
afghanistan is an obvious violation of the geneva agreements which 
entered into force on may 5 tass reported 
terms of the geneva agreement mean pakistan should discontinue 
the entire range of actions and activities to interfere in the 
affairs of afghanistan it said 
pakistan has officially denied helping ship arms to the 
guerrillas but noorani said thursday that his country will observe 
the policy of symmetry in which the guerrillas receive us 
aid as long as the soviet union arms the marxist government 
soviet soldiers began withdrawing may 15 and the first convoy to 
leave afghanistan crossed the border wednesday according to the 
agreement all of the estimated 115000 soviet soldiers must be 
withdrawn within nine months 
a soviet journalist indicated thursday that between 12000 and 
15000 soviet soldiers had been killed in fighting since soviet 
troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 
in its commentary tass said noorani promised soviet officials 
on a recent trip to moscow that his country would abide by the 
geneva agreement but said on his return home thursday that 
pakistan will continue to help the united states aid the rebels 
commentator valery vavilov said 
the afghan peace process requires strict observance of all its 
terms and any deviations and free and broad interpretations 
of separate articles and clauses of the accords are intolerable 
said commentator valery vavilov said 
he quoted western press reports as saying unprecedented arms 
shipments were en route to the border of pakistan and afghanistan 
where the afghan insurgents have their bases

president reagan signed federal legislation 
thursday approving the appalachian states lowlevel radioactive 
waste compact but warned the compact commission against attempting 
to enforce federal laws 
in a statement announcing his signature reagan said more than 
three quarters of the states have now entered compacts on lowlevel 
radioactive waste 
he said such actions underscore this nations commitment to 
take those actions needed to ensure the future availability of 
nuclear power as an energy supply option for this country 
reagan objected however to a provision of the bill assigning 
federal law enforcement responsibility to the commission without 
requiring that commissioners be appointed consistently with the 
appointments clause of the constitution 
any effort by the commission to enforce federal regulations 
would contravene the constitution the president said 
while i hope that no such effort would occur i expect the 
nuclear regulatory commission to take note of and report to the 
attorney general on any such actions of the commission in this 
area 
under the compact which includes pennsylvania west virginia 
delaware and maryland the four states are required to ensure that 
there is a regional facility sufficient to dispose of the regions 
lowlevel waste and that each state has equal access to it 
the commission created under the compact is empowered to set 
regulations on waste disposal and to impose fines or other 
penalties for violations 
during consideration of the bill the justice department told 
congress that this part of the bill was unconstitutional because it 
applied to federal as well as state regulations 
the department said enforcing federal regulations pursuant to a 
congressionally approved interstate compact constitutes the 
exercise of significant authority pursuant to the laws of the 
united states 
in order to do this the department said the compact members 
would have to be appointed by the president or by other federal 
authorities designated by congress as provided in the constitution 
instead the commission members are appointed by the states 
in a letter to the senate judiciary committee the governors of 
the compact states said they did not believe a constitutional issue 
would arise because the compact was never intended to apply to 
activities over which the federal government has exclusive 
jurisdiction

foreign minister shimon peres said 
friday the soviet union has agreed to join an international peace 
conference on the middle east and reiterated his belief that peace 
would come to israel 
however peres who returned home from a 13day trip said many 
problems remained with the soviet union 
also friday israel radio reported that president chaim herzog 
commuted the sentences of three jewish underground members from 
life in prison to 15 years for staging a deadly gun and grenade 
attack at hebron islamic college in 1983 
three palestinians were killed and 33 were wounded in the attack 
the three convicted men menachem livni shaul nir and uzi 
sharbaf were among 25 jews arrested in 1984 and charged with 
planning or carrying out attacks against arab targets 
in other developments 
israeli troops shot and wounded a 15yearold palestinian 
during a demonstration in jabaliya refugee camp officials at shifa 
hospital in gaza city said the youth was shot in the hand after 
protesters threw stones at israeli troops 
the army command said a border policemen was slightly injured 
by a knifewielding palestinian woman in nablus in the west bank 
the army confirmed that 1770 palestinians are being held in 
administrative detention but the chief military attorney brig 
gen amnon shtresnov denied the arrests without trial were a 
violation of human rights 
during his trip peres visited hungary spain where he attended 
the socialist international and the united states 
he met with key soviet officials in madrid and washington 
including moscows ambassador to the united states anatoly dubinin 
in an interview at ben gurion international airport peres told 
the associated press the soviets agreed to an international peace 
conference which would not have the power to impose an agreement on 
the parties 
however he said the argument with the soviet union has not 
reached a conclusion 
one major disagreement concerns moscows insistence on the right 
of the palestinians to selfdetermination both prime minister 
yitzhak shamir and peres reject establishment of an independent 
palestinian state in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
peres told a group of supporters at the airport that israel 
would always insist on three points defensible borders refusal to 
talk to the plo and refusal to give up all of the territories 
occupied in the 1967 middle east war 
he said that during his travels he tried to improve israels 
image abroad 
our situation is very difficult especially with the socialist 
international and the european economic community peres said 
i tried to present a balanced picture of israel in front of the 
world 
an arab uprising broke out in the occupied territories on dec 
8 and israels strong measures to quash the insurrection drew 
world criticism 
shtresnov said on israel television in reporting on the 
detainment of palestinians that the army closely examined each 
suspect before making the arrest and gave detainees the right to 
appeal he said the detentions are in accordance with israeli and 
international law 
he denied charges that the military justice system had collapsed 
under the weight of the mass arrests which took place after the 
uprising began 
shtresnov conceded that there were problems initially in 
locating and identifying detainees but said these were quickly 
solved and that computers were now being used to keep track of 
jailed palestinians 
lea zemel an israeli lawyer who represents palestinian 
prisoners described the situation as a big mess 
according to estimates by leftwing legislator deddi zucker 
8100 palestinans are in jail after trial or pending trial in 
addition to 1900 other detainees

us and panamanian negotiators have 
tentatively agreed on a deal that calls for gen manuel antonio 
noriega to leave panama next august and stay away until may 1989 
and gives him a role in setting up a transition government 
beforehand an administration official said friday 
in return for noriegas departure the united states would agree 
to drop federal drug smuggling indictments against him said the 
official who has followed the negotiations but insisted on 
anonymity 
the agreement subject to final approval by both governments 
allows noriega to return to panama for holidays and to go back 
permanently after presidential elections set for may 1989 said the 
official who described himself as opposed to the arrangement 
he said vice president george bush has expressed reservations 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said friday that the vice 
president bush opposes negotiating with noriega over the conditions 
under which noriega might surrender power 
the administration sources who have suggested that the vice 
president favors ending the negotiations and bringing the envoy 
back to washington are essentially correct fuller said 
bush had lunch with president reagan friday but the vice 
presidents aides would not say whether they discussed the noriega 
negotiations 
the official who discussed the tentative deal also said bush has 
recommended that the state department recall deputy assistant 
secretary michael g kozak from panama kozak has spent virtually 
all of may in panama trying to work out an agreement 
the official who disclosed the tentative agreement to an 
associated press reporter said if it gets accepted it gives 
noriega everything he wants 
the official said there were no assurances that noriega was 
negotiating seriously and he raised the possibility that the 
defense chief has no intention of resigning his post as the 
agreement specifies 
if the deal receives final approval the official said noriega 
would be in a position to leave his associates in positions of 
authority because he will be able to influence the formation of the 
transition government 
late friday state department spokesman charles redman said 
kozak was returning to washington for consulations 
he said kozaks return does not mean any change in the process 
the process continues redman said declining further 
comment 
associates of noriega have said in recent weeks that noriega 
sees aug 12 as an appropriate time to resign because that is the 
fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of the defense 
forces

the staccato beat of a samba band 
sounded in front of city hall on friday as this old southern port 
unveiled the 12th edition of its spoleto festival usa arts 
showcase 
about 1000 people looked on as schoolchildren sent dozens of 
colored balloons lofting into a pale blue sky 
then the musicians in white slacks and metallic silver shirts 
played a variety of drums and tambourines as they spun and danced 
on a platform stage 
an hour later the strains of a chamber music concert sounded at 
the nearby dock street theater the first of dozens of performances 
indoors and out throughout charleston over 17 days 
the festival was founded by composer gian carlo menotti and is 
named after the similar festival he founded in spoleto italy 
fridays opening ceremonies also kicked off four days of events 
celebrating the bicentennial of south carolinas ratification of 
the constitution 
charles way jr the chairman of the spoleto board noted people 
sometimes take the constitution for granted and in the same way 
he would like to see the day when folks take the festival for 
granted 
right now after 12 years we are still a very fragile 
organization were still a fragile dream that becomes a reality 
for 17 marvelous days he said 
charleston mayor joseph p riley jr called the festival 
charlestons great contribution to the nation and the world 
adding we make this gift proudly and happily 
but he said the festival is not given to this city it is 
earned and each year we must strive to earn it anew 
during the course of the festival there will be 700 performances 
by 2000 performers including productions staged in piccolo 
spoleto the citys companion arts festival riley said 
alex sanders jr the chief judge of the south carolina court of 
appeals spoke briefly about the constitution saying that when the 
american experiment is measured against the ideals of its framers 
it may have fallen short 
but when you measure the united states against the other 
nations of the world one cannot but be amazed at how well it has 
worked he said 
the samba band was part of the cast of the warrior ant a 
work by director lee bruer and composer bob telson which features 
over 50 dancers musicians and actors and which will have its 
premiere during spoleto 
the festivals major opera dvoraks rusalka which is 
seldom performed in this country was to open friday evening 
menotti said later he feels the spoleto production splashed 
with special effects will be well received 
it is beautiful work very melodic the story has magic 
he said it is done very simply like a japanese play i think 
people will come from all over the country to see our production 
festival general manager nigel redden said that over 1 million 
in tickets had been sold by the opening of the festival the 
festival has a 37 million budget and about half that total is 
generated through earned income he said

a citizens group is calling for a boycott of 
the major news program in mexico accusing it of dedicating 97 
percent of its time the presidential candidate of the governing 
party 
the active and peaceful civic resistance organization 
distributed handbills calling on the public to stop watching 24 
horas the nationally broadcast news program of the private 
televisa network 
it said news of candidate carlos salinas de gortari dominated 
the broadcasts 
the public has a right to choose with its preference or 
rejection of the type of information that it wants to receive 
the handbills say 
let the public make its decision and maintain it until it can 
be proven that these news shows have stopped being instruments of 
one party and have become true outlets of objective information 
the handbills conclude 
no one was immediately available at televisa offices to comment 
on the boycott call 
salinas degortari candidate of the governing institutional 
revolutionary party known as the pri is certain to win the july 6 
elections over five minority party candidates 
rodolfo bermejo who identified himself as civic resistances 
training director said in a phone interview friday that the group 
is an independent nonpartisan organization in 29 mexican cities 
he said it formed in 1986 after controversial elections in the 
northern border state of chihuahua won by the pri and considered a 
major setback to the opposition national action party 
televisa reorganized its news programs in response to numerous 
complaints of biased coverage in the chihuahua elections adding an 
evening news program that it said would emphasize provincial 
coverage and add additional viewpoints 
minority candidates have complained frequently that they are 
prevented from equal access to broadcast media and newspapers but 
president miguel de la madrid and other pri and government leaders 
reject the accusation 
civic resistance did not explain how it arrived at the figure of 
97 percent of 24 horas programming being dedicated to salinas de 
gortari 
a study done by the governments channel 11 found that 24 horas 
in february dedicated 67 bites or 86 percent of its campaign 
coverage to salinas de gortari said raul trejo a researcher at 
the national autonomous university of mexico 
in an interview in this weeks mexico journal magazine trejo 
attributed the heavy coverage to the political ties that exist 
between the heads of this communications enterprise and the pri and 
the insistence by the party that televisa provide coverage of the 
pri candidate

the transportation department concerned about 
local officials interfering in the free flow of air travel 
announced an investigation friday into plans to sharply increase 
landing fees for small aircraft at bostons logan international 
airport 
private pilots and some commuter airlines have complained loudly 
that the higher fees will amount to them being driven from bostons 
major airport 
at the same time transportation secretary jim burnley asked the 
operators of logan to hold off on the landing fee increases which 
are to go into effect july 1 until the departments investigation 
has been concluded next november 
despite the federal urging officials of the massachusetts port 
authority the state agency that runs the airport said they plan 
to go ahead with the higher landing fees as scheduled 
i dont think its appropriate to delay the fee increase 
david davies executive director of massport said in a telephone 
interview 
a spokesman for massport thomas champion said the higher fee 
structure remains an essential first step in our overall program 
to improve service at logan for all new england travelers it 
should be implemented without delay and were committed to a july 1 
startup date 
the transportation department in a statement called the massport 
decision to proceed with the higher fees disppointing but said 
it is premature to speculate whether the new fee schedule will 
actually go into effect 
the plan calls for base landing fees to be increased from 25 to 
nearly 100 with an additional charge pegged to the weight of the 
aircraft this would sharply increase the fees required from 
operators of small personal planes business aircraft and 
commuters while the costs to the major airlines in some cases 
would decline critics complain 
burnley has been under intense pressure in recent months from 
groups representing private pilots and commuter airlines as well as 
some members of congress to intervene in the massport issue which 
is seen as a maneuver by the airports operators to drive away all 
but the scheduled airlines 
officials at crowded airports around the country are known to be 
closely watching the massport case and what actions the federal 
government might take 
legislation designed to prevent the logan plan from being 
implemented has been introduced in congress but its chances for 
passage seem slight this year 
this is just the first foot over the line rep sherwood 
boehler rny said recently of the massport proposal there 
are airports all over the country sort of foaming at the mouth 
just waiting to follow suit 
the transportation department said its investigation 
specifically would examine complaints received about the higher 
fees at logan from the aircraft owners and pilots association the 
national business aircraft association and the regional airlines 
association 
these complaints indicate that reasonable grounds exist to 
investigate whether massports action violates federal aviation 
laws the department said burnley said he would decide whether 
further action is necessary after the report is received sometime 
before nov 15 
in a letter to massport officials burnley urged that the new 
landing fee structure not be implemented until the federal 
investigation is completed because of the potential impact and 
because the complaints about the fees raise questions involving 
national transportation policy 
davis said he was perplexed by the dot request because a federal 
court in boston had already agreed to consider expeditiously a suit 
challenging the higher fees with hopes of a ruling before they are 
imposed the court case is expected to give the issue a full 
review he suggested

the state department view is that dropping the indictments 
against noriega is a defensible bargaining position because he 
cannot be extradited so long as he remains in panama 
it contends that if noriegas price for leaving panama is 
dismissal of the indictments this would be a low cost way of 
resolving the 12week old crisis which has dropped uspanamanian 
relations to a low point and produced economic collapse in panama 
according to a published report earlier this week the united 
states would reserve the right to reinstate the indictment once 
noriega returns to panama 
the reagan administration has been calling on noriega to step 
down since the indictments were returned on feb 5 
president eric arturo delvalle tried to fire noriega on feb 25 
but was ousted himself the following day by the pronoriega 
national assembly the united states continues to recognize 
delvalle as the legitimate authority in panama 
a series of us economic sanctions have contributed to panamas 
economic demise 
us apprehensions about noriega were heightened on thursday 
when a progovernment newspaper published photographs of us 
embassy employees and their families so that panamanians will 
know the gringos who are starving us to death 
the supplement in the newspaper critica a propaganda organ of 
the government said the americans think the walls of their 
embassy are impregnable 
state department spokesman charles redman said the supplement 
has been noted with concern and that appropriate security 
measures have been taken 
he declined to elaborate and refused to say whether any 
americans associated with the embassy are being evacuated 
we have seen a pattern of harassment over a period of time in 
panama redman said this appears to be part of that the way 
to deal with that is to continue to take the precautions that need 
to be taken 
redman had no comment on the negotiations white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater also refused comment except to say they were 
continuing

the system a network of farms canneries and bakeries that 
provide employment and goods for needy church members is based on 
a philosophy of selfhelp that has drawn praise from president

state officials said friday they found no 
evidence that rooms in a welfare hotel had been divided into tiny 
cubicles and said it was acceptable for two families to share a 
bathroom 
social services commissioner cesar perales rejected charges by 
the legal aid society of illegal and substandard conditions at the 
martinique hotel in manhattan but a legal aid lawyer said perales 
was wrong and pledged a lawsuit 
to call a room thats 9by12 not a cubicle is no consolation 
to a family living in it said the lawyer steven banks 
state regulations require that rooms in which homeless 
families are placed contain private bathrooms banks said even 
the commissioner conceded today that these rooms do not have 
private bathrooms 
perales ordered an investigation after banks charged this week 
that as many as 80 rooms at the martinique had been subdivided into 
9by12foot cubicles and lacked sufficient furniture 
city officials and a hotel coowner said some tworoom suites 
used in the past by one large family had been split up for two 
smaller families and that bathrooms were shared legally perales 
said the same friday 
we observed no evidence of new construction or of rooms being 
divided into tiny cubicles and we observed no evidence of major 
infestations of roaches or rats 
while some suites were split with bathrooms shared each 
family has a private entrance perales said each bathroom can 
be locked on both sides to ensure total privacy 
banks said the issue was not new construction and he had not 
alleged rat or roach infestations but that families were being 
crammed into small rooms and forced to share bathrooms 
the city houses 5189 homeless families of which 3437 are in 
hotels and the rest in shelters it recently announced a plan in 
which it hopes to have homeless families out of all welfare hotels 
in five years

top policymakers at the federal reserve 
worried about growing inflationary pressures decided in late march 
to push interest rates slightly higher according to a record of 
the discussions released friday 
the minutes of the march 29 meeting of the federal open market 
committee said the credit tightening was approved on a 101 vote 
with board member martha seeger voting no 
the minutes said ms seeger objected to the tightening because 
she did not see a significant risk of higher inflation it said she 
remained concerned that higher interest rates could have an adverse 
impact on economic growth jittery financial markets and 
financially troubled banks 
the minutes were the first official confirmation of the feds 
move to tighten interest rates in early april the move was noted 
at the time by economists who said they also believe the fed 
tightened once again earlier this month 
the closely watched federal funds rate the interest that banks 
charge each other to make overnight loans has moved higher and 
averaged 704 percent in the past week the highest it has been 
since last october 
a move by the fed to lower the amount of money the banking 
system has available shows up first in an increase in the federal 
funds rate with their own cost of money rising banks are forced 
to hike the interest rates they charge their customers 
after the second round of credit tightening by the fed major 
banks last week raised their prime lending rate from 85 percent to 
9 percent the first hike in this benchmark lending rate since 
before the october stock market collapse 
the committee met again tuesday and many analysts believe it 
left credit conditions unchanged deciding to wait and see whether 
inflationary pressures continue building 
many economists believe the fed will be forced to act again with 
another round of credit tightening possibly as early as next 
month because of this belief they are forecasting that various 
interest rates including mortgage rates will be headed higher in 
the months ahead 
in the minutes of the march meeting fed policymakers noted that 
economic growth had been much stronger than was being predicted 
right after the oct 19 stock market plunge they noted that us 
factories were operating at the fastest pace in eight years while 
unemployment was dropping to the lowest levels of this decade 
several of the participants cited these developments as evidence 
that the fed needed to boost interest rates to prevent the 
business expansion from gathering excessive and unsustainable 
momentum that would lead to higher inflation moreover action 
at this time might preclude the need for more substantial 
tightening later 
at another point the minutes said the economy might well be 
near the point where faster growth in business activity would 
induce a higher rate of inflation and in the view of several 
members there was a potential for a sharp escalation in prices 
the federal open market committee is made up of six members of 
the federal reserve board and six of the 12 fed regional bank 
presidents who serve on a rotating basis there is currently one 
vacancy on the panel 
the minutes of tuesdays meeting will not be released until 
after the next strategy session is held on july 67

a woman carrying at least two handguns 
opened fire in an elementary school friday killing one child and 
critically wounding five others she then fled to a nearby home and 
shot a seventh person police said 
there was blood all over the classroom and desks knocked 
over as the children panicked and attempted to flee or hid under 
desks said glencoe patrolman john ceglieski 
police believe the woman had set fire earlier in the day to 
another home eight blocks away where she worked as a housekeeper in 
this affluent north shore suburb of chicago according to sgt 
michael geier of the wilmette police he was assisting in the arson 
investigation 
joe sumner director of operations for winnetka police 
identified the woman as lori dann 30 the fbi said it had an 
investigative interest in her and madison wis police lt 
william sprague said she had been arrested there march 14 on a 
charge of retail theft he gave no further details 
more than five hours after the initial shooting the woman 
remained barricaded inside the home along a treelined 
neighborhood heavily armed police encircled the dwelling and a 
hostagenegotiating team was on the scene but had not established 
contact with the woman 
its extremely scary shes just an ordinary citizen and she 
went through and set all this up she isnt exactly stable said 
northbrook police commander randy walters who was assisting local 
police at the barricade site 
the idea is to go in and take custody not to kill her he 
said if you go storming in theres going to be a gunfight and 
somebody might get shot either her or one of our officers 
winnetka police chief herbert timm said the woman walked into 
the onestory redbrick hubbard woods elementary school shot one 
boy in a bathroom then entered a secondgrade class went past 
the teacher who was there indicated the gun was real and began 
firing at random 
police recovered a 32caliber handgun from the school bathroom 
and the woman was believed to also have carried a 22caliber gun 
and a third unidentified weapon according to sumner 
sumner said the woman then ran through the woods from the school 
and entered the home where four members of a family and their maid 
were present 
apparently she just walked in and confronted the 
homeowners sumner said the mother came running out and said 
theres a woman in my home with a gun 
then we heard a shot the son came out holding a gun and 
fell over in the driveway sumner said 
the son apparently struggled with the suspect grabbed one of 
her weapons and was shot in the chest sumner said 
the father maid and grandfather fled by side door leaving the 
suspect alone inside sumner said 
he said he believed the woman had three weapons and police had 
recovered two of them 
geier said the suspect was believed to have set fire to the home 
where she worked while a mother and her children were in the 
basement doing laundry 
this woman set a fire in the house trapping the people in the 
basement he said they escaped got out apparently without 
serious injury 
the shooting erupted at about 1045 am cst and police said it 
lasted 15 minutes 
an 8yearold boy died at highland park hospital said 
spokeswoman sue masaracchia 
another 8yearold boy and the 22yearold man shot at his home 
were in critical condition at the hospital she said 
the four children at evanston hospital were reported in critical 
but stable condition with gunshot wounds following surgery said 
spokeswoman mary ash 
they were identified as mark teborek 8 who suffered a gunshot 
wound to the neck lindsay clarkfisher 8 wounded in the chest 
and stomach kathryn ann miller wounded in the wrist and chest 
and robert trossman 6 wounded in the chest 
at the school meanwhile parents clustered in groups consoling 
each other and attempting to make sense of the incident 
i ran here all the way from downtown winnetka said 
benjamin randall waiting outside the school later thursday for his 
son to be released 
i guess were all vulnerable he added it a sad 
commentary on society 
village manager robert buechner said children were released in 
small groups throughout the afternoon to ensure their safety 
were trying to keep the children calm and safely inside we 
will release them but not until its entirely safe to do so 
said buechner

us and panamanian negotiators have 
tentatively agreed on a deal that calls for gen manuel antonio 
noriega to leave panama next august and stay away until may 1989 
and gives him a role in setting up a transition government 
beforehand an administration official said friday 
in return for noriegas departure the united states would agree 
to drop federal drug smuggling indictments against him said the 
official who has followed the negotiations but insisted on 
anonymity 
the agreement subject to final approval by both governments 
allows noriega to return to panama for holidays and to go back 
permanently after presidential elections set for may 1989 said the 
official who described himself as opposed to the arrangement 
he said vice president george bush has expressed reservations 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said friday that the vice 
president bush opposes negotiating with noriega over the conditions 
under which noriega might surrender power 
the administration sources who have suggested that the vice 
president favors ending the negotiations and bringing the envoy 
back to washington are essentially correct fuller said 
bush had lunch with president reagan friday but the vice 
presidents aides would not say whether they discussed the noriega 
negotiations 
the official who discussed the tentative deal also said bush has 
recommended that the state department recall deputy assistant 
secretary michael g kozak from panama kozak has spent virtually 
all of may in panama trying to work out an agreement 
the official who disclosed the tentative agreement to an 
associated press reporter said if it gets accepted it gives 
noriega everything he wants 
the official said there were no assurances that noriega was 
negotiating seriously and he raised the possibility that the 
defense chief has no intention of resigning his post as the 
agreement specifies 
if the deal receives final approval the official said noriega 
would be in a position to leave his associates in positions of 
authority because he will be able to influence the formation of the 
transition government 
late friday state department spokesman charles redman said 
kozak was returning to washington for consulations 
he said kozaks return does not mean any change in the process 
the process continues redman said declining further 
comment 
associates of noriega have said in recent weeks that noriega 
sees aug 12 as an appropriate time to resign because that is the 
fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of the defense 
forces 
the state department view is that dropping the indictments 
against noriega is a defensible bargaining position because he 
cannot be extradited so long as he remains in panama 
it contends that if noriegas price for leaving panama is 
dismissal of the indictments this would be a low cost way of 
resolving the 12week old crisis which has dropped uspanamanian 
relations to a low point and produced economic collapse in panama 
according to a published report earlier this week the united 
states would reserve the right to reinstate the indictment once 
noriega returns to panama 
the reagan administration has been calling on noriega to step 
down since the indictments were returned on feb 5

but was ousted himself the following day by the pronoriega

the white house dismissed as foolish a 
report friday that the administration is trying to determine 
whether telephone calls between first lady nancy reagan and her san 
francisco astrologer had been intercepted by soviet spies 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said if the soviets 
wanted to monitor white house phone calls to get information on the 
president there are thousands of calls a day from white house 
staff of more significance than mrs reagans 
the most definitive information theyre likely to get from 
mrs reagans calls is how many pizzas are ordered by the first

usbacked contra rebels have still 
not responded to a government proposal to extend the civil war 
ceasefire past the may 30 deadline deputy foreign minister victor 
hugo tinico said friday 
they still havent answered a government proposal to call off 
for another month offensive operations he said at a breakfast 
meeting with foreign correspondents 
the leftist government and the ussupplied rebels known as 
contras have been exchanging charges on whos responsible for the 
faltering peace plan to end more than six years of war 
almost two months after the two sides signed the pact they 
agree only on the desire to end the fighting the government has 
warned it will stage the largest offensive to date if the 
ceasefire is not extended after may 30 or if no progress is made 
the contras meanwhile are suffering from infighting a move 
that favors the ruling sandinistas from the governments point of 
view the best way for the war to end would be for the enemy to 
selfdestruct 
prosandinista newspapers were giving widespread coverage to the 
contra bickering at the same time the government last weekend 
cautioned private radio station directors against broadcasting news 
that violates the public order law and warned of permanent 
suspension 
radio station directors called the warning a direct threat 
and described it as selfcensorship that replaces the harsh media 
restrictions withdrawn by the government to comply with last 
augusts regional peace plan 
the problems surrounding the ceasefire plan appear to have 
started almost immediately after the march 23 signing all of the 
meetings held since then have been marked by mutual distrust 
the government announced on wednesday a tentative agreement for 
a new round of peace talks to be held may 2528 but the contras 
immediately disagreed 
the years of civil war have left deep scars in this nation of 3 
million families are divided sons have gone off to fight with one 
side or the other 
if all had gone according to plan the war would just about be 
over and nicaragua would be well on its way to full democracy 
a state security officer argued recently that nicaragua already 
was a democracy his comments came minutes after police hauled off 
several opposition political leaders who spoke to journalists near 
a building where workers staged a hunger strike 
because the ceasefire plan has not moved forward the 
sandinistas have not freed more than 3000 political prisoners nor 
permitted the contras to have a say in internal politics 
talks with the internal opposition political parties stand at an 
impasse the meetings were suspended by the opposition as a show of 
support for the strikers the government responded by saying it 
would consider whether future talks would be held 
according to the ceasefire plan the first measures should have 
been completed by april 15 in exchange the contra rebels would 
have gathered in agreed upon ceasefire zones and been permitted to 
receive humanitarian aid through a neutral organization 
the sandinistas have said the insurgents could now receive food 
medicine and clothes distributed by the international red cross 
but the contras rejected that saying the organization sympathizes 
with the government 
the tactics used at the last meeting were almost to torpedo 
the agreement contra spokesman bosco matamoros said in a recent 
interview they put into question everything we had agreed upon 
meanwhile thousands of rebel troops according to sources 
moved toward the northern border the us agency for international 
development is providing supplies to the contras through honduras 
a group of rebellious contras has demanded the ouster of the top 
contra military officer col enrique bermudez a former officer 
under the ousted dictator anastasio somoza 
matamoros the contras main spokesman said recently the talk 
of divisions was exaggerated 
nicaraguan vice president sergio ramirez said sunday that the 
contra infighting puts into doubt future ceasefire negotiations 
in honduras the mercenary forces the contras are on the 
verge of civil war he said the political heads that come here 
to negotiate have very little influence 
the people meanwhile are war weary the sandinistas continue 
to draft youths into the military the economy is in shambles and 
farmers who fled the war zones in the northern mountains cannot yet 
go home to plant

the nations displaced workers are not 
receiving adequate job search assistance training counseling or 
benefits a study group for senate republicans reported friday 
the report by a task force of the senate republican conference 
said that of the more than 1 million american workers displaced 
annually due to plant closings or layoffs more than onethird of 
them have extended periods of unemployment while some never return 
to the workforce 
of those who do return almost onehalf take pay cuts and more 
than onethird earn less than fourfifths of what they previously 
had earned according to the study group which was chaired by john 
h chafee ri 
the group recommended that congress enact a 980 million reagan 
administration proposal which would consolidate two current 
education and job training programs the job training partnership 
act and the trade adjustment assistance act 
the new worker adjustment program is designed to serve an 
estimated 700000 workers and would seek to eliminate costly 
duplication of effort it would also provide substantially greater 
emphasis on actual retraining 
the 69page report said that poor publicity a general lack of 
coordination among different federal assistance programs and a 
slow response rate when the programs have actually have been 
implemented have plagued the delivery and quality of assistance 
to displaced workers 
projections for the next 15 years it said indicate that 
millions of americans are not only illprepared for existing jobs 
but will have even more difficulty finding and holding jobs in the 
future unless the work force is retrained and continuously 
prepared for marketplace change 
the united states is faced with the creation of a growing 
underclass increasingly made up of former manufacturing and 
industrial workers without the skills to enter the work place 
the report said 
the gop conference is an organization made of all 46 republican 
senators 
in addition to chafee sens dave durenburger of minnesota 
orrin hatch and robert stafford of vermont were members of the task 
force which held three field hearings of march and april of last 
year and conducted interviews with dislocated workers union and 
business representatives service providers and program directors

disgruntled republicans upset over the 
disqualification of 968 wouldbe delegates disrupted fridays 
opening session of the georgia gop convention by chanting no no 
no and parading around the hall carrying placards 
many of the protesters were supporters of pat robertsons 
presidential candidacy but there were also supporters of vice 
president george bush rep jack kemp of new york and sen bob dole 
of kansas 
meanwhile party officials refused to register any of the 
estimated 1600 people attending the convention at the albany civic 
center 
state republican chairman john stuckey told the crowd the party 
was barred from officially seating any delegates until the 
credentials committee had issued its report on the disqualified 
delegates 
i cant proceed with registration until i know who is a 
delegate he said i am acting on the advice of counsel i 
dont intend to register anybody 
the credentials committee began the courtordered review process 
friday morning just hours before the convention opened supporters 
of pat robertsons presidential candidacy boycotted the review 
process however saying they would attempt to seat their own 
delegates 
stuckey called the convention to order about 2 pm amid boos 
on two occasions when party leaders were speaking many of those on 
the floor of the convention hall stood up and shouted 
the dispute was over a may 11 letter sent by the credentials 
committee to 968 of the delegates elected at county conventions 
informing them they had been disqualified as delegates to the state 
convention 
most were rejected because local party officials had not 
provided evidence that the county conventions were advertised in 
newspapers many of the disqualified delegates charged that that 
technicality had never been used before 
a major order of business at the twoday convention is the 
election of the final 18 of the states 48 delegates to the 
republican national convention in new orleans all 48 are committed 
to vote for bush on the first two ballots at the august convention 
because the vice president swept georgias gop presidential 
primary but robertson supporters are seeking to attend hoping 
they can influence selection of the vice presidential candidate and

the syrianbacked amal militia claimed 
friday it had foiled an attempt by guerrillas of the proiran 
hezbollah group to trade a western hostage for arms from a 
christian militia 
the claim came as amal and hezbollah or party of god battled 
for the 15th day for control of south beiruts slums police said 
rival palestinian factions fought housetohouse in nearby bourj 
elbarajneh and chatilla refugee camps 
in the palestinian fighting police said one guerrilla was 
killed and 36 people were wounded in combat that first flared in 
bourj elbarajneh and then spread to chatilla 
they said guerrillas of plo chairman yasser arafats fatah 
faction flushed out syriansupported dissidents of col saeed 
mousas fatahuprising group from their five bases in the sprawling 
shantytown near beirut airport 
the dissidents shelled the camp with longrange artillery in the 
mountains overlooking beirut in a bid to blunt the assault by 
arafats loyalists police said they was no immediate report of 
casualties 
amal politburo member atif aoun told 10000 shiites in the south 
lebanon town of zahrani that hezbollah had worked out an 
armsforhostage deal with the lebanese forces the christians 
main militia 
amal foiled the alleged swap after we found out about contacts 
between hezbollah and the lebanese forces he said without 
elaboration 
most of the 18 western hostages held by shiite factions allied 
with hezbollah are believed held in the embattled southern slums 
militia officials declined to identify the hostage or say how 
the reported trade was thwarted 
hezbollah and the lebanese forces denied the amal claim 
its an attempt to distort hezbollahs image said a 
hezbollah spokesman who refused to be identified 
george adwan the lebanese forces political head said atif 
aouns baseless accusations constitutes a cheap attempt to cover up 
amals military losses in south beirut 
the us ambassador to the united nations vernon walters 
arrived in damascus on friday but told reporters his visit was 
not specifically for the hostages 
the syrians have been helpful in the past in securing the 
release of foreign hostages but i dont want to be in the 
position of telling the syrians what to do he stressed 
hezbollah and the rightwing lebanese forces are bitter foes in 
lebanons 13yearold civil war the only thing they have in common 
is that both oppose syrian efforts to control lebanon 
hezbollah has seized control of most of south beirut in recent 
fighting but the iranianbacked fundamentalists are penned up in 
the slums by the syrians on three sides and the christians to the 
east and apparently unable to get weapons and ammunition in 
amal remains entrenched in the shiyah district on the northern 
edge of the shantytown where they have surrounded a hezbollah base 
in hajjaj street 
a senior amal official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the armsforhostage exchange was to have taken place there 
the lebanese forces hold the christian district of ein rummaneh 
east of hajjaj street the two districts have been separated by a 
25yardwide nomans land since the civil war broke out in 1975 
police said the two factions fought with howitzers and mortars 
friday 
nine people were killed and 42 wounded in the fighting that 
raised the toll since may 6 to 253 killed and 814 wounded 
the syrians have deployed 7500 troops and 500 tanks along the 
southern western and northern edges of south beirut since sunday 
but have made no move yet to push into the labyrinthine slums to 
end the fighting and aid amal its battered proxy 
syrian officers have said this was to give political efforts a 
chance to end the fighting but those efforts have failed 
in paris le monde reported that brig gen ghazi kanaan the 
syrian intelligence chief in lebanon said syrias entry into the 
southern suburbs is inevitable 
syria the main power broker in lebanon is irans principal 
arab ally in its war against iraq 
but damascus has been alarmed by iranian efforts through 
hezbollah to dominate lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys 
largest moslem sect 
in a change of stance sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
hezbollahs spiritual guide voiced cautious approval of a syrian 
deployment 
the entry of syrian troops is a possibility no one is 
thinking of confronting the syrians he said 
a canadian protestant clergyman arrived friday seeking to 
deliver a petition from a christian human rights group to hezbollah 
the rev ray barnett representative of the seattlebased 
friends in the west said he hoped to hand the petition signed by 
40000 people from various countries to fadlallah

a top aide to vice president george bush 
invoked executive privilege thursday when asked what was said about 
narcotics when bush met with the us ambassador to panama in 1985 
in bushs office 
during a threehour deposition col samuel j watson iii 
deputy national security adviser to bush did answer some questions 
posed by lewis pitts the attorney for a group of plaintiffs in a 
private civil lawsuit 
watson said he had prepared a memorandum to set up bushs dec 
16 1985 meeting with ambassador everett briggs briggs wanted to 
discuss a situation involving nicholas barletta who had been 
ousted as panamas president by military leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega and the subject of narcotics watson said 
watson testified in the sworn deposition that he was present at 
the meeting along with bushs top national security aide donald 
gregg and an official from the state department 
but when asked what briggs told bush on the subject of 
narcotics watsons lawyer richard stearns objected and 
instructed his client not to answer on grounds of executive 
privilege stearns later said the privilege applies because it 
covers conversations of the president and vice president 
pitts then asked watson whether narcotics was discussed at all 
in the meeting 
i dont recall specifically whether they were or not i could 
make that assumption but i will not state it as a certainty he 
said watson said he had since searched for any memorandum 
summarizing the meeting but could find no such document 
watson said he had only a vague knowledge of narcotics issues 
involving panama at that time there were vague unsubstantiated 
rumors around that people in the pdf panamanian defense 
forces were facilitating trafficking of drugs watson said 
the new york times reported may 8 citing administration sources 
it did not identify that briggs briefed bush at the 1985 meeting 
on allegations that noriega was involved in the drug trade briggs 
has since denied that he could have given clear indications of 
noreigas drug involvement at that meeting saying he himself did 
not have any solid evidence at the time 
bush has repeatedly denied that he was aware of any clear 
evidence of such involvement by noriega before this february when 
the panamanian general was indicted by two grand juries in florida 
on drug charges his democratic opponents in the presidential 
campaign have questioned how much bush knew about noriegas alleged 
drug involvement 
watsons statements came during a deposition for a 24 million 
damage and racketeering lawsuit charging that a group of defendants 
including some involved in the irancontra affair supplied the 
nicaraguan contra rebels with weapons in trade for cocaine the 
suit also accuses the group of planning the may 1984 bombing that 
injured maverick rebel leader eden pastora in nicaragua

a recent powerful earthquake and an unfounded 
prediction of a devastating temblor have spurred many cambodian 
refugees to leave southern california members of the community 
said friday 
fears have been widespread in the community since a quake oct 1 
that measured 59 on the richter scale and were revived by recent 
publicity about a purported prediction by the 16thcentury seer 
nostradamus that los angeles would be destroyed by a temblor 
how many people are leaving for this i really dont know but 
people are talking about it people are leaving are scared said 
than pok executive director of united cambodian community a 
center for immigrant education and vocational training that serves 
about 10000 people a year 
one reported estimate put the number of cambodians who have fled 
at 2000 
my real gut feeling 1000 may be more realistic than said 
an estimated 35000 cambodian refugees live in southern 
california mainly in long beach it is the largest cambodian 
community in the nation most came after the vietnamese invasion of 
cambodia in 1979 than said 
until last october there had been no significant earthquake or 
other natural disaster in the los angeles area in the time since 
the cambodians arrived 
the reaction to the october quake is based in cambodian culture 
than said the cambodian culture is a mixture of buddhism 
hinduism and animistic belief they believe in the super natural 
power the storm the earthquake the fire the flood so this 
theory is in the back of their mind they think they cannot 
control they just fear he said 
ben kelly director of the department of social services in 
fresno county 200 miles northwest of los angeles said that 343 
people of cambodian ethnicity have been added to the welfare lists 
since last october 
that is unusual growth he said although he did not know 
whether quake fears were behind the influx 
namany keam operator of the private cambodian translation 
bureau said she did not know anyone who had moved but there has 
been a great deal of talk about people leaving to join friends and 
relatives in such places as arizona or washington 
everybody is scared some of them just move theyd rather 
go to the cold states than the earthquake state she said 
impetus to the exodus apparently also came from publicity about 
a video the man who saw tomorrow in which a filmmaker 
interpreted a vague prediction by nostradamus to mean los angeles 
would be destroyed by an earthquake in may 
the purported prediction was dismissed both by scientists and 
experts on nostradamus 
cambodian culture really believes that somone can tell the 
future ms keam said when they talk about the fortune teller 
in the newspaper and tv they really believe 
than agreed that such fears can be triggered by things such as 
children being put through earthquake drills at school and the 
frequent discussion of earthquake preparedness in california 
this kind of thing unless you make an effort to communicate 
to people theyre never going to understand it he said 
than said he wasnt certain whether the refugees were leaving 
permanently 
vora kanthoul associate executive director of united cambodian 
communitys orange county office in santa ana said there are 
some fears around to actually leave because of that fear theres 
only a small percentage 
he cautioned that exact estimates would be unreliable because 
there is also migration north for economic reasons 
people are moving quite a few businessmen are going up there 
because of the opportunity because fresno as far as the cambodian 
population is growing he said

house and senate negotiators reached tentative 
compromise friday on a new medicare prescription drug benefit that 
could clear the way for final votes on a catastrophic health 
insurance bill next week 
rep fortney h stark dcalif told reporters the drug issue 
was the most complicated item separating house and senate members 
of a conference committee 
asked when the committee would have a final compromise ready for 
submission to the house and senate start said i hope next 
week 
but stark noted that several other issues are outstanding 
including the precise way flat and slidingscale premiums will be 
imposed on the 31 million medicare beneficiaries to pay for 
additional benefits and whether participation in the expanded 
coverage will be mandatory or voluntary 
the tentative drug compromise being recommended by an 
eightmember working group to the full conference committee calls 
for the new benefit to be phased in starting jan 1 1991 
medicare does not now cover any outpatient drugs except for a 
handful of particularly costly medications such as antirejection 
drugs for transplant recipients 
under the recommended compromise medicare would pay half the 
cost of prescriptions in 1991 after a 600 deductible is met 
medicare would pay 60 percent of drug costs the following year 
and 80 percent in subsequent years but still only on that portion 
that exceeds 600 a year 
the premiums charged beneficiaries to cover the new benefit 
would be indexed each year to cover the cost of the program which 
is expected to grow each year 
the initial level of those premiums and details of the indexing 
are to be worked out in subsequent negotiations of the full 
conference committee 
the full conference also has to resolve several other albeit 
less thorny differences 
however there is broad support for the legislation and 
negotiators expressed confidence at their first public meeting 
earlier this month that a compromise would be reached quickly 
both bills passed their respective houses by overwhelming 
margins and are patterned after the basic framework proposed by 
president reagan 
neither measure makes provisions for longterm nursing home care 
under medicare but would shield medicare beneficiaries against 
financially crippling outofpocket doctor and hospital bills 
while the cap on how much beneficiaries would have to pay is one 
of the issues still to be resolved it is expected to be between 
1043 the latest house offer and 1370 the latest senate 
offer medicare would pick up all hospital and physician costs for 
a beneficiary after the cap is met in a given year 
medicare now pays full costs of only 60 days of a hospital stay 
in a given year minus a firstday deductible and pays only 80 
percent of doctor bills no matter how high they range 
on the cost side the major disagreement is how to distribute 
the additional premium medicare enrollees will have to pay 
particularly the socalled supplemental premium that is tantamount 
to an income tax surcharge for the estimated 60 percent of retirees 
who would be subject to it 
each beneficiary will have to pay a flat monthly premium for the 
catastrophic coverage but about 40 percent do not have enough 
income to make them also subject to the slidingscale supplemental 
premium that will be based on their ability to pay and be collected 
through the income tax system

jesse jacksons oncepoor presidential 
campaign raised and spent as much as frontrunner michael dukakis 
as they battled in last months crucial democratic primaries 
records filed friday showed 
with the expensive races in california and new jersey still 
ahead dukakis and jackson each entered the month of may with 1 
millionplus bank accounts 
jackson actually spent more than dukakis during april but a 
good chunk of his spending 804570 went to pay off loans 
according to the financial disclosure report he filed with the 
federal election commission 
jackson reported spending 4 million during the month while 
dukakis spent 37 million as they dueled across such expensive 
states as new york and pennsylvania dukakis the best financed 
democrat throughout the campaign has borrowed no money 
jackson took out another 624000 in loans in april for a total 
of 14 million in loans since the beginning of the year spokesman 
tom schade said the loans borrowed and repaid last month reflected 
a rotating line of credit the campaign has for operating expenses 
jackson ended the month with 11 million in cash on hand and 
548741 in debts his report showed dukakis had 14 million on 
hand and 699906 in obligations 
on the republican side certain nominee george bush ended april 
with 4 million in cash on hand after raising 2 million for the 
month including 12 million in matching funds and spending 17 
million bush also reported taking out a 20000 loan for general 
election campaign startup costs 
television evangelist pat robertson who suspended his campaign 
last week showed a debt of 14 million at the start of this 
month after raising 11 million with 341523 of that in federal 
matching funds and spending 11 million during april robertson 
had only 29473 in the bank 
jackson continued his steady upswing in fundraising with total 
receipts of 42 million including the loan and 17 in federal 
matching funds while dukakis took in 34 million including 11 
million in matching funds 
in receipts from contributors the two remaining democratic 
contenders were almost dead even each taking in about 19 
million while dukakis has had many highdollar months and has 
proven a consistent fundraising power the april numbers reflect 
the sophistication of jacksons fundraising arm 
during the first half of april jackson was riding high on the 
success he had achieved with his upset michigan victory and wins in 
other states but he subsequently suffered heavy losses to dukakis 
in state after state 
dukakis campaign said he has raised 236 million from the 
start of his campaign through the end of april including 68 
million in matching funds which are based on the amount a 
candidate raises on his own jacksons campaign total through april 
was 117 million 
dukakis campaign is pennypinching these days so it can spend 
enough on the expensive june 7 california primary and still have 
enough money for the summer convention operations without 
surpassing the 27 million maximum set by federal law 
the rules say candidates who receive federal matching funds can 
spend no more than 23 million on their primary campaigns plus 
another 4 million for fundraising costs 
dukakis through april had spent 18 million against the 23 
million cap but current spending is budgeted to the dime so 
the campaign will leave itself with money to spend on the party 
convention in atlanta this july said campaign spokesman steve akey 
dukakis treasurer robert farmer said in a statement that the 
campaign has received money from 80000 individuals whose 
contributions averaged 170 each he said his candidates 
fundraising success reflects an excitement and enthusiasm 
americans feel toward dukakis

singapore plans to convert its largely 
ceremonial presidency into an elected post with executive powers 
and lee kuan yew seems likely to seek that role after he retires as 
prime minister 
confirmation that an elected president is in the works was made 
in parliament thursday 
legislation described as only a very preliminary draft which 
needs considerable revision and improvements has been prepared 
said phua bah lee a senior parliamentary secretary 
phuas brief statement was a written reply to a question 
submited by chaim see tong the only opposition member of 
parliament it ended four years of speculation that basic changes 
were planned in the way this bustling island republic is governed 
the president is now named by parliament to a fouryear term 
wee kim wee 72 a former diplomat and journalist has been 
president since 1985 
in his national day address in 1984 lee said the constitution 
might be changed to prevent any future government from squandering 
singapores ample reserves he said an elected president with veto 
power over access to these assets might be the answer 
lee has for years said he would like to follow the example of 
many us corporate leaders and step down at 65 he reaches that 
age on sept 16 
goh chok tong 46 who was named first deputy prime minister 
after the 1984 elections is positioned to succeed lee the prime 
ministers eldest son trade and industry minister lee hsien loong 
36 is also regarded as eventual prime ministerial material a 
retired army general he entered politics less than four years ago 
observers here say the elder lee would be a natural candidate 
for the presidential post 
a cambridgeeducated lawyer lee became prime minister in 1959 
on a wave of anticolonialism and with the help of communists whom 
he later purged but steady economic growth has endeared lee to a 
population of 26 million that enjoys one of the highest living 
standards in asia 
on friday the island republics home affairs ministry said a 
prominent singapore lawyer arrested for plotting subversive 
activities admitted he had links with a recently expelled us 
diplomat 
the arrested lawyer 59yearold francis seow was taken into 
custody earlier this month under singapores tough internal 
security act for questioning into possible foreign interference in 
domestic affairs 
at the time singapore also ordered e mason hendrickson a 
first secretary in the us embassys political section out of the 
country for allegedly urging people to run for public office 
against the governing peoples action party 
i found hank hendrickson to be a pleasant person i 
maintained cordial relations with him as he had been supportive of 
my political intentions which i found most encouraging seow 
said in a sworn declaration made public by the home affairs 
ministry on friday 
the government also called on washington to reprimand two of 
hendricksons state department superiors who were not publicly 
named 
the united states denied the allegations and expelled robert 
chua a first secretary at the singapore embassy in washington on 
may 11

democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis said friday the reagan administration owes the 
american people an explanation of why it was doing business with 
panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega 
at a news conference at the sacramento airport dukakis said 
i and the american people want an explanation unless and 
until we have that explanation im not going to be satisfied 
dukakis said president reagan or vice president george bush or 
somebody in the administration should tell the american people 
who it was who thought it was in the interests of the american 
people and this country that we do business with somebody who was a 
known drug peddler and who was suspected of murder 
meanwhile in washington an administration official said us 
and panamanian negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal that 
calls for noriega to leave panama by august and stay away until 
next may 
in return the united states would agree to drop federal drug 
indictments against him said the official who has followed the 
negotiations he commented only on condition he not be named 
on another subject massachusetts gov dukakis administration 
and finance secretary frank keefe announced new proposed spending 
cuts efficiency steps and revenue plans designed to improve the 
bottom line of dukakis 119 billion state budget proposal for 
next year by 217 million 
faced with a shortfall in tax collections dukakis is proposing 
to cut 92 million from expansions he had previously proposed in 
dozens of individual programs he also signed off on a hopedfor 
47 million in savings through improved government operations he 
also hopes to raise millions more through bottle deposits and a 
higher tax on cigarettes 
in sacramento dukakis addressed a rally in a plaza in front of 
the cathedral of the blessed sacrament as hecklers stood on the 
steps of the church holding signs denouncing his stance in favor of 
a right to abortion 
real greeks dont kill babies read one sign 
as he spoke hecklers chanted baby killer baby killer but 
the chants were largely drowned out by the loudspeaker system 
asked about his position on abortion at the news conference 
dukakis said i dont favor abortion i dont think its a good 
thing i dont know anybody who does 
however he said that he believes it is a matter of an 
individual womans choice to be made according to the dictates of 
her conscience 
he said he understood people who had a different view but wished 
they could keep the decibel level down 
earlier friday in los angeles dukakis said he expects to hold 
regular meetings with rival jesse jackson who has stepped up his 
criticism of party rules as his presidential hopes dimmed 
we meet dukakis said after an appearance at an east los 
angeles high school we met sunday well be meeting regularly 
jackson has been pressing democratic party leaders to give him a 
greater share of the votes of socalled super delegates the 
party and elected officials given automatic delegate status at the 
nominating convention in juy 
most of those delegates have been falling in line behind the 
dukakis candidacy prompting jackson to complain that he is 
receiving a disproportionately small number compared to his primary 
and caucus showings 
jackson said thursday he expected to meet soon with dukakis to 
discuss strategy and issues 
dukakis campaigned in los angeles sacramento and san francisco 
with less than three weeks before the june 7 california primary 
one of four that day dukakis expects to collect enough delegates 
on the final primary day to put him over the 2081 delegates needed 
for a convention majority 
when dukakis took questions from the predominantly black student 
body of the george washington preparatory high school the very 
first was is this a token visit 
when the massachusetts governor appeared puzzled by the 
question the student said she wanted to know if his visit was a 
rare appearance in a black neighborhood 
dukakis who has made few appearances in black communities and 
has largely conceded the black vote to jackson replied ive 
been in black schools for years im here because this is a 
very very special place with a great reputation 
one student asked dukakis if he was interested in running for 
vice president on a ticket heaed by jackson 
dukakis grinned and said im not interested in the vice 
presidency 
dukakis wife kitty told the students how she became dependent 
on diet pills and urged them to use her example to stay away from 
drugs and alcohol 
after the questionandanswer session students had dukakis don 
a baseballstyle jacket and then led him and his wife onto a stage 
which was set up for a performance of the musical grease 
dukakis and his wife sat on stools at center stage while students 
performed summer loving a song from the show 
the students tried to get dukakis to wear sunglasses at first 
he pushed them back on his forehead then finally took them off and 
handed them back

president reagan signed legislation friday 
making it easier for hundreds of thousands veterans to receive 
disability benefits for exposure to radiation from the world war ii 
atomic blasts in japan or from nuclear test explosions 
ordinarily veterans claiming disability benefits must prove the 
disability was connected with their military service the bill 
bypasses this requirement for a limited group of veterans with 
respect to specified diseases 
it applies primarily to cancer of various organs the office of 
management and budget said more than 300000 veterans would be 
affected by the legislation and the firstyear cost was estimated 
at 656 million 
the legislation affects veterans who served with us forces 
occupying hiroshima or nagasaki japan it covers the period from 
aug 6 1945 when the atomic bomb was dropped on hiroshima 
through july 1 1946 
also covered are veterans held as prisoners of war in japan 
during world war ii or who served on active duty in japan 
immediately following such internment if they were subject to 
exposure to radioactivity comparable to that of the veterans who 
served at hiroshima and nagasaki 
the bill also applies to veterans who participated in tests 
involving atmospheric detonation of a nuclear device 
norman solomon washington spokesman for the alliance of atomic 
veterans called the new law a long overdue step toward taking 
care of a very large and serious problem 
deadly legacies of radiation exposure hang heavily over every 
american community solomon said 
the legislation would apply only to ailments that manifest 
themselves within 40 years after the veterans last possible 
exposure to the specified sources of radiation or in the case of 
leukemia 30 years afterward this period already has passed for 
veterans who served in hiroshima and nagasaki or were prisoners of 
war in japan 
enactment of this legislation does not represent a judgment 
that servicerelated radiation exposure of veterans covered by the 
act in fact caused any disease nor does it represent endorsement 
of a principle of permitting veterans to receive benefits funded 
through veterans programs which bear no relationship to their 
former military service reagan said 
instead this act gives due recognition for the unusual 
service rendered by americans who participated in military 
activities involving exposure to radiation generated by the 
detonation of atomic explosives the nation is grateful for their 
special service and this bill makes clear the nations 
continuing concern for their welfare

the president of panama told vice president 
george bush in december 1983 of allegations that officials in his 
country were connected to drug trafficking but he also told bush 
the charges were untrue a top bush aide present at the meeting 
said friday 
bushs national security adviser donald gregg said that 
thenpanamanian president ricardo de la espriella mentioned the 
allegations at the end of a meeting in panama gen manuel antonio 
noriega now the de facto ruler of panama attended the meeting 
gregg said 
the vice president said he had not been aware of the charges 
or he would have raised them with de la espriella gregg 
testified in a sworn deposition for a private civil lawsuit 
we did nothing to follow that up after returning to 
washington gregg said bush was then chairman of the south florida 
drug interdiction task force 
gregg also testified that he was aware at the time that the 
government of panama had been helpful to the united states in 
getting military supplies to nicaraguas contra rebels 
bush has said he had no reliable information connecting noriega 
to the drug trade until noriega was indicted in february on drug 
charges by two florida grand juries 
greggs testimony came during a daylong deposition as part of a 
24 million suit by the christic institute a liberal policy group 
charging that a list of defendants some of whom were involved in 
the irancontra affair supplied the contras with weapons in trade 
for cocaine and conspired in a failed attempt to assassinate a 
maverick contra field commander eden pastora 
greggs justice department attorney richard stearns voiced 
repeated objections throughout the day to the questioning charging 
that it ranged far from the subject matter of the suit and was 
being done for political purposes i think its quite clear you 
have some other agenda in mind he said at one point to michael 
withey an attorney for the plaintiffs 
on thursday another bush aide col samuel j watson invoked 
executive privilege and declined to answer when asked during a 
similar deposition what bush and the us ambassador to panama 
everett briggs discussed about narcotics at a dec 16 1985 
meeting 
when withey asked gregg about the same meeting on friday he 
agreed to discuss it but said his recollection was not specific 
i think we came away from the meeting with ambassador briggs 
with the sense that noriega was a growing problem politically 
militarily and possibly in the drug area gregg testified but he 
said any drug problems involving noriega were not highlighted 
by briggs 
later in the day withey asked gregg the fact that general 
noriega may have had some involvement in the narcotics problem 
that was coming out of the december 85 meeting at that time isnt 
that correct 
gregg responded it would have been part of the general 
picture of noriega as a political problem as corruption and as a 
general policy problem yes 
but talking with reporters later gregg said he did not recall 
any discussion of noriegas involvement in drug trafficking i am 
saying that narcotics as a problem in panama was part of the agenda 
of the meeting there was no discussion of any direct 
connection between that and noriega 
earlier this month briggs denied a published report that he had 
briefed bush on allegations that noriega was involved in the drug 
trade 
by the time of that meeting gregg said bush was chairman of 
the presidents antinarcotics task force 
it was certainly in the realm of the possible that gregg was 
aware of charges that noriega was linked to drugs gregg said in 
part because he knew of similar charges that had been made against 
a brother of noriegas predecessor gen omar torrijos during 
senate debate over the panama canal treaties in 1978 
noriega was now in power and it was possible to conjecture 
that hed become involved in some of that gregg said 
gregg also testified that a state department briefing paper 
would have been prepared for bushs meeting with briggs outlining 
the background of the ambassadors concerns and that the paper 
would have been placed in bushs briefing book to prepare him for 
the meeting 
that document is among papers sought by the plaintiffs in the 
suit but which have not been turned over by the government 
after noriegas indictment gregg said the vice presidents 
office searched for documents relating to past bushnoriega 
dealings 
the search turned up a couple of documents from the cia and 
a state department cable prepared after the 1983 meeting in panama 
he said

the cocainesmuggling conviction of carlos lehder 
rivas has heartened the front line in the drug war but officials 
acknowledged friday they are far from destroying the violent 
medellin drug cartel 
in the past month alone drug agents have seized 37 tons of 
cocaine in a single shipment of lumber taken two tons from a 
speedboat making a run into the keys and confiscated two tons more 
hidden in food shipments 
that dwarfs the 33 tons lehder was convicted of smuggling into 
the country from 1978 to 1980 though he is considered responsible 
for much more 
youve got an awful lot of heads on the hydra you have to cut 
off coast guard lt cmdr jim simpson said friday referring to 
the multiheaded creature of greek mythology lehder was one of 
them 
in jacksonville on friday the jury that convicted lehder 
decided the government can confiscate millions of dollars in real 
estate on a bahamian island as well as several planes and other 
items owned by lehder the issue of property forfeiture has to be 
considered separately under federal law 
according to internal revenue service figures lehder earned an 
estimated 250 million in the cocaine business but it remained 
uncertain how the government could take control of property in the 
bahamas 
during the year lehder has been in us custody cocaine 
shipments into the country actually increased and the absence of a 
current uscolombia extradition treaty clouds future antidrug 
efforts said drug enforcement administration spokesman jack hook 
wed all be pretty silly if we thought that the arrest and 
conviction of one man would stop drug trafficking he said 
its very positive news but its just one small battle 
simpson and other south florida officials emphasize their 
efforts to block drug imports are continuing 
the customs services blue lightning speed boat task force 
released its 1987 statistics friday showing it helped arrest 255 
people and intercepted almost seven tons of cocaine along with 
more than 200 tons of marijuana 
the colombiabased medellin cartel still ships up to 80 percent 
of the cocaine that makes its way into the united states the dea 
considered lehder one of the four managers of the cartel until his 
arrest early last year the others have evaded and sometimes 
defied colombian and us justice 
the reputed top leader jorge luis ochoa vasquez has twice been 
seized by colombian authorities and twice succeeded in slipping 
from their hands another of lehders reputed coleaders pablo 
emilio escobar gaviria has been sighted frequently in colombia but 
never caught 
the cartel has turned to violence to intimidate colombian 
authorities into abandoning cooperation with us antidrug 
efforts hook said 
in 1984 justice minister rodrigo lara bonilla was assassinated 
by traffickers and in january colombias crusading attorney 
general carlos mauro hoyos was gunned down the successful 
antidrug candidate for mayor of bogota was briefly kidnapped 
during this years campaign and many believe the 1985 guerrilla 
attack that killed many colombian supreme court justices was 
coordinated with the traffickers 
whether because of the violence or not the uscolombia 
extradition treaty has been invalidated by colombias supreme court 
since lehders capture and the issue is now on hold 
the extradition treaty was the only tool the drugtrafficking 
kingpins ever feared said hook adding he hopes the conviction 
will encourage colombia to renew it 
the lack of a treaty and the continued cocaine trafficking 
doesnt mean lehders prosecution was a meaningless gesture law 
enforcement officials said 
it shows this country does very well mean business when we 
have a drug trafficker anywhere in the world said gerald 
hochman director of a federal task force on the south florida drug 
trade there is no way out if hes committed the crime hes 
going to pay the price 
the conviction was a boost to frontline officers combating drug 
traffickers on a daily basis especially those who have become 
discouraged by talk of a deal to drop the drug indictment against 
panamas ruler gen manuel antonio noriega officials said 
were delighted the coast guards simpson said one of 
the complaints peope have been lodging for many years is that you 
always get the small fry this time we got one of the big guys 
us attorney robert merkle who prosecuted lehder in 
jacksonville said the conviction is a psychological boost to all 
agencies fighting drug trafficking 
every war in history has seen battles which have practical 
consequences byeond the immediate consequence of the battlefied 
he said by that i mean that they serve to catalyze national 
will to win the war or serve as a pyschological defeat for the 
other side 
in that sense lehders conviction was a very real tangible 
victory for the american people and for colombia merkle said

the soviet unions new space shuttle a 
reusable craft that lands on a runway will make its maiden voyage 
at about the same time that the us space shuttle is scheduled to 
return to orbit for the first time since the challenger disaster 
an industry magazine reports 
aviation week and space technology released a report friday 
saying the soviet shuttle will be launched in august and roughly 
coincide with the return to flight of the american space shuttle 
launch of the us space shuttle is now expected in late august 
probably on aug 29 according to nasa sources 
the soviet space shuttle which closely resembles the american 
original in exterior design is to carry two cosmonauts into orbit 
in what is expected to be a short test mission 
earlier reports said that the soviet shuttles initial test 
flight would be conducted unmanned but officials disclosed last 
week that the plans call for two pilots 
aviation week quoted soviet lt gen vladium shatalov chief of 
the soviet space program as saying when the americans tested 
their shuttle two men took off i believe that this experience is 
reasonable and can be used in our country 
the soviet space shuttle is launched on a liquidfueled rocket 
called the energia unlike the american craft the launch rockets 
are not a part of the orbiting craft instead the soviet shuttle 
includes jet engines which can be used when the craft returns to 
the atmosphere this will give the soviet shuttle a greater range 
to manuever than the us shuttle which returns from space as a 
glider with no engines 
challenger exploded shortly after launch from the kennedy space 
center on jan 28 1986 seven crew members were killed since 
then the shuttle fleet has been grounded while national 
aeronautics and space administration engineers redesigned and 
tested flawed equipment including the solidfueled rocket engines 
that were blamed for the accident 
in august space shuttle discovery is scheduled to be launched 
from the kennedy space center with a crew of five all veteran 
astronauts and land four days later at edwards air force base 
calif 
aviation week said the soviet shuttle flight is part of an 
unprecedented series of space missions over the next three 
months 
never before has the ussr attempted so many major new space 
missions withing the same period the magazine said 
among the soviet flights are 
two robot craft to be launched to mars and to the martian moon 
phobos the craft will lift off on july 7 and july 12 for the most 
complex planetary missions yet attempted by the soviets the craft 
will include instruments provided by eight countries and the 
european space agency the united states is not participating 
on june 7 a soyuz spacecraft with a soviet and a bulgarian 
cosmonaut will be launched to the space station mir for an 
eightday mission in august a second soyuz will be launched with 
a soviet and an afghan on board 
last sunday the soviets launched a military intelligence craft 
the size of a school bus in a 530mile circular orbit 
two cosmonauts aboard the space station mir completed their 
150th day in orbit last monday the soviet union has now exceeded 
128000 manhours in space more than triple the us total of 
42463 hours

kidnapped 
im inside some i guess a box small says on the tape 
its under a couple of feet of sand or something like 
underground and i want you to get 1 million 
the kidnapper spoke first warning her not to call the police 
but to raise the money quickly or he would never tell me where my 
husband was buried mrs small said 
mrs small said her husband assured her it was not a joke and 
that the kidnapper wanted the ransom in 50 and 100dollar bills

and to listen to the recordings 
the defense was expected to begin its case saturday 
the first tape of small and his kidnapper was found along a 
road and was reconstructed by the fbi it was difficult to 
understand at times but the jury was given a transcript 
another call at about 1130 pm sept 2 includes a recording of 
small reading instructions to his wife for delivery of the cash 
the money was raised and the family was prepared to pay the 
ransom said mrs small but the quality of the recording was so 
poor she could not understand all the instructions for delivery 
i could hear another voice in the background swearing mrs 
small testified then i realized it was steves voice he was 
giving me instructions where to take the money 
small told his wife that after the cash was delivered and 
counted a map would be mailed to her giving directions to the 
burial site 
mrs small said the kidnappers voice came on the telephone and 
she tried to get clarification of the delivery orders but soon 
he just hung up the phone 
small was lured by a telephone call from the familys victorian 
home near the kankakee river shortly after midnight sept 2 1987 
previous testimony has linked edwards to the coffinsized box 
which witnesses said they saw him building and to a public 
telephone at about the time a ransom call was being recorded by the 
fbi 
the woman with whom edwards lived nancy d rish 26 also was 
charged with murder and kidnapping and was awaiting trial

president reagan asked the senate on friday to 
ratify a united nations treaty against torture and demonstrate 
unequivocally our desire to bring an end to the abhorrent 
practice 
reagan said however that if the treaty is ratified he will 
declare that the united states does not recognize the competence of 
an international committee it sets up to investigate charges of 
systematic torture in the united states 
i believe that a final united states decision as to whether to 
accept such competence of the committee should be withheld until we 
have had an opportunity to assess the committees work the 
president said 
the treaty was unanimously adopted by the un general assembly 
in 1984 and was signed by the united states last month 
it marks a significant step in the development during this 
century of international measures against torture and other inhuman 
treatment or punishment reagan said 
ratification of the convention by the united states will 
clearly express united states opposition to torture an abhorrent 
practice unfortunately still prevalent in the world today 
the treaty requires each signatory country to either prosecute 
torturers who are found in its territory or extradite them to other 
countries for prosecution 
by giving its advice and consent to ratification of this 
convention the senate of the united states will demonstrate 
unequivocally our desire to bring an end to the abhorrent practice 
of torture the president said 
reagan also submitted to the senate for ratification a treaty 
signed in montreal in february under auspices of the international 
civil aviation organization providing for international 
cooperation in combatting terrorism at airports

government regulators closed the doors friday 
of the federal land bank of jackson miss named a receiver to 
take over its troubled finances and vowed that it would soon reopen 
under new management 
officials moved swiftly to reassure borrowers that the move was 
made to strengthen the billiondollar farm credit system 
institution and that it would continue to meet needs of farmers as 
well as obligations to those who hold the banks securities 
we have taken this prudent action in order to enable the farm 
credit system to continue to provide a full range of credit 
services to the borrowers in the threestate area said a 
statement from frank w naylor jr chairman of the farm credit 
administration 
the fca the federal agency that regulates the farm credit 
system placed the bank in receivership the bank and its 90 
branches in mississippi alabama and louisiana were closed 
simultaneously at 530 pm edt 
naylor said the bank under the management of the receiver 
would be open during normal operating hours as soon as is 
practicable 
the farm credit act of 1971 as amended provides mechanisms to 
assure that there will be no disruption of payment of principle and 
interest on the banks outstanding securities naylor said 
the farm credit system is a nationwide network of borrowerowned 
banks and lending institutions that has been a prime source of 
credit for american agriculture for decades its heavily 
spotlighted financial problems led congress last year to approve a 
major bailout bill 
the jackson bank earlier had received 30 million in assistance 
under bailout legislation to raise funds but it had been losing 
47 million a month since the first of the year 
its loan portfolio at years end totaled 168 billion as of 
march 31 40 percent of that amount represented loans classified as 
not performing or at least at high risk it reported liabilities of 
1909 billion

named receiver his company issued a letter to customers saying 
that every available effort will be made to continue serving 
all borrowers 
house agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza 
dtexas issued a statement calling it unfortunate that the 
situation in regard to the jackson federal land bank has come to 
this stage 
but i have been assured by fca personnel that the liquidation 
procedure will be similar to the procedure that the federal deposit 
insurance corporation uses when closing a commercial bank de la 
garza said in fact fdic personnel are assisting with the 
liquidation arrangements today 
borrower stock and rights will be protected and operations 
will begin almost immediately under a new bank structure he 
said he added that he had been assured that other banks will 
assist in providing necessary credit so that there will be no 
interruption in providing for the needs of farmers 
the assistance board set up under last years bailout 
legislation recommended placing the bank in receivership according 
to an fca statement 
borrower stock is protected by the recently passed 
agricultural credit act of 1987 and will be retired by the receiver 
with funds provided under that act naylor said

resolutions and an agenda for a summit meeting next week of the 
organization of african unity 
the ministers met in private but sources speaking on condition 
of anonymity said the resolution was proposed by zimbabwes 
foreign minister nathan shamuyurira 
the oau celebrating its 25th anniversary has long tried to 
persuade the united states britain france and west germany to 
take the lead in mandatory sanctions against whitedominated south 
africa to try to bring about a peaceful end to apartheid its usual 
tack has been to condemn the western governments in endofsummit 
resolutions 
this year the oau seems to be considering new strategies 
several states are pushing for a un security council meeting 
in southern africa to dramatize what they say is the pretoria 
governments undermining of neighboring black states 
johnny makatini foreign secretary of the african national 
congress the biggest guerrilla group fighting the south african 
government said in an interview that the anc wants african leaders 
to mount a new type of diplomatic offensive 
for example we have hardly been making use of the us 
lobbying system he said we want to establish contact and 
solicit support of legislators in washington for the sactions bill 
before the congress 
makatini said the same strategy should be adopted for britain 
france west germany and japan 
were going to go for individuals he said for 25 years 
we have been relying on government or parties in power but when it 
suits a government it takes a militant position when not it

a court ruled friday that 
women in the black homeland of kwandebele must be allowed to vote 
and nullified allmale elections held in 1984 
justice cf eloff declared invalid a proclamation signed by 
president pw botha that denied women the right to vote or sit in 
the homelands legislative assembly 
botha and members of the legislature who opposed the court 
action by five kwandebele women were ordered to pay costs about 50 
women wearing traditional colorful blankets attended fridays 
session at pretoria supreme court 
kwandebele is the only of south africas 10 black homelands 
where women have not been allowed to vote 
the judge also said the 1984 elections for 16 legislative seats 
were null and void one of the 16 seats was captured by majozi 
mahlangu who later was elected chief minister of the homeland by 
the assembly of the 77 seats in the assembly 61 are appointed 
it was not immediately clear how or when the empty seats will be 
filled and whether mahlangu will be allowed to remain chief 
minister 
kwandebele is an impoverished area the size of luxembourg with 
almost no resources or infrastructure about 400000 people live in 
the territory northeast of pretoria and many workers spend up to 
eight hours a day commuting to jobs in white areas 
the homeland currently has selfgoverning status but is 
considering opting for independence as four homelands already have 
done kwandebele authorities have been accused of harsh treatment 
toward dissidents who oppose independence 
nic de villiers of the pretoria legal resource center said the 
police play an overtly political role in the homeland and often 
mistreat activists 
not only does the tone of the police leadership permit 
assaults it positively encourages them de villiers said at a 
recent conference organized by lawyers for human rights 
the south african government said it created the homelands so 
that each major black tribe could exercise selfgovernment on its 
own territory critics of the system say it is part of the 
governments effort to splinter the black majority so that 
whiteminority rule can more easily be maintained

blacks could provide the crucial votes that swing this falls 
presidential election to the democrats even though jesse jackson is 
not likely to be the partys nominee benjamin l hooks head of 
the naacp said friday 
hooks talked about the presidential campaign at a news 
conference before making a commencement address at central 
connecticut state university in new britain conn 
the head of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people forecast that the black vote will be predominantly 
democratic but he said he hoped that both parties will look at 
this black vote which can constitute 10 to 12 percent of the 
general electorate vote as a vote that ought to be pursued 
diligently 
he said blacks should make efforts not to appear to be the 
captives of one party if that becomes the fact then we will be 
ignored by the democratic party and overlooked by the other party 
and we become of no consequence he said 
hooks said massachusetts gov michael s dukakis appears to have 
locked up the democratic presidential nomination jackson will have 
a hard time deciding whether to accept the vice presidential 
nomination if it is offered he added 
the only thing you could give jackson that would be bigger 
than what he has would be the presidency and it appears at this 
point he wont get it hooks said hes a young man and i think 
hell be running for president for the next 20 years and maybe one 
of these years hell make it 
in his address hooks urged 2015 graduates to vote and noted 
that fewer than 60 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the 
1984 presidential election 
in charleston sc former defense secretary caspar weinberger 
urged graduates of the medical university of south carolina to 
combat the use of illegal drugs and said exporting health care will 
help friendly democracies take hold overseas 
only healthy people have the strength really needed to win 
freedom and maintain it against all manner of tyranny weinberger 
told a commencement audience of about 4000 including 554 
graduates

as the japanese planes headed toward pearl 
harbor on dec 7 1941 pfc joseph lockhard tracked mysterious 
blips on his radar screen on the island of oahu 
we picked up a huge indication on the scope of something we 
had no idea what it was he said friday we didnt know if it 
was a bird superman or a plane 
he and another young serviceman were alone in the radar room 
watching the pulsing signal move steadily toward the island 
lockhard relayed the information by telephone to a lieutenant 
who brushed aside the concerns of the 19yearold army signal corps 
radarman noting that it was probably a squadron of b17s en route 
from california 
we continued to plot it and track it and called back again i 
was more insistent but nothing was done he said we plotted 
it to within 20 miles of the island and at that point the signal 
became lost in the terrain 
moments later we had been attacked you could see the smoke 
rising we immediately knew what we had seen 
about 3700 american servicemen and civilians were killed in the 
attack 
friday lockhard and other members of the signal company air 
warning hawaii met in baltimore for the first time in 47 years 
and a visit to the historical electronics museum inc in this 
suburb where a model of the scr270 radar is on display the 
device was built by westinghouse defense in baltimore 
the scr270 which tracked the approach of the planes was the 
model t of radar said lockhard a retired project manager at amp 
inc in harrisburg pa a maker of electrical connections 
many people had faith in it but there were also a lot of 
doubting thomases a lot of military people looked on it as a 
toy he said they didnt believe in it enough to believe it 
was the valuable tool that it was 
six radar units had been delivered to the island about three 
months earlier he said 
it was a brand new animal lockhard said we had no idea 
it was an enemy attack other than we thought something was wrong 
with the equipment i ran it through a series of checks 
the feeling was more like incredulity it was phenomenal its 
one of the footnotes to history you can play out all sorts of 
what if games 
the real value to the whole thing ive always felt was it 
gave credibility to the equipment everybody recognized the 
potential where some didnt before

us negotiator michael b smith served notice 
friday that america is willing to pursue talks on opening the 
japanese market for imported beef and citrus but that it is up to 
japan to offer new proposals 
smith the deputy us trade representative was in japan to 
attend the threeday pacific economic cooperation conference which 
ended friday he met for unofficial talks with officials at the 
ministry of agriculture forestry and fisheries thursday 
on friday he told a news conference at the us embassy the 
us is prepared to listen but we feel the japanese must show more 
flexibility in their position it is not up to the united 
states to make more proposals but up to japan 
were over here and theyre over there he said adding that 
as a negotiator he saw no reason for optimism yet 
smith said japans semigovernmental livestock industry 
promotion corp which controls imports of beef interferes in 
the market and should stay out of our business 
the corporation charges a 50 percent tax on imported beef before 
it is sold to wholesalers 
he reiterated the us position against surcharges on beef 
imports saying such surcharges hurt foreign exporters and violate 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade a genevabased forum 
for international trade disputes 
smith said that unlike tariffs surcharges are unilateral 
measures which involve no swapping with trading partners and 
upset the balance set in tariff negotiations 
he said surcharges fluctuate to stabilize prices and add an 
element of uncertainty to exporters while tariffs are fixed and 
transparent 
in response to a reporters question smith also said an 
increase in japans tariffs would seem exceedingly strange 
since tariffs are a transitional measure to cushion producers 
during structural changes 
instead smith suggested that japan establish a domestic income 
maintenance system that would not burden foreign exporters 
though both sides have expressed a desire to settle the dispute 
between themselves the united states has brought the issue before 
gatt and will keep pursuing gatt action until and unless there is 
a bilateral decision smith said 
an earlier usjapanese agreement setting quotas on us beef 
and citrus exports to japan expired in march talks to set a new 
timetable for market liberalization broke down and washington took 
its case to gatt on may 4 
australia another major exporter of beef to japan has also 
filed a complaint with the international body

senators gave the public a peek at their 
personal finances friday disclosing a generally welltodo group 
that loves to talk for money collects interesting gifts and leans 
toward conservative investments 
release of the financial disclosure forms required annually 
showed there are far more millionaires in the senate than are found 
in most other 100member groups some although not many of the 
senators are not doing nearly so well including joseph r biden 
jr ddel the former presidential candidate and robert w 
kasten rwis 
bidens assets not including the family home total only 
21000 and his liabilities are at least 260000 but he earned

kasten reported assets of 21000 to 45000 and liabilities of 
20000 to 30000 
although it is possible that as many as threedozen senators are 
millionaires it is difficult to determine real financial worth 
from reading the disclosure reports senators are required to 
report income assets and liabilities only within a broad range 
for example a 10 million investment need be reported only as 
exceeding 250000 
on that basis john d rockefeller iv dwva the standard oil

assets of at least 882000 and income of at least 390000

turkey has rejected a west german proposal 
that it negotiate with greece in a move to improve turkeys 
association with the european economic community foreign minister 
mesut yilmaz said friday 
turkey also said it will not discuss with greece the dispute 
over cyprus divided between greek and turkishcypriot communities 
greece is a member of the european economic community or common 
market turkey has been an associate member since 1966 and a year 
ago it applied for full membership 
west german officials have told turkey that an eec meeting with 
associate members cannot be convened before germanys rotating 
presidency of the organization ends june 30 yilmaz said 
greece then will assume the presidency for six months 
we were told that the future of the meeting depended upon 
bilateral talks between greece and turkey yilmaz told reporters 
yilmaz will go to athens monday for talks with greek officials 
but he said neither cyprus nor the eec issue would be discussed 
in our understanding the cyprus problem is not a bilateral 
issue even though it influences these relations he said our 
relations with the eec is not a bilateral issue either it is out 
of the question that the matter will be raised in my talks in 
greece 
mondays meeting in athens will be the first of a turkishgreek 
political committee established under a recent accord to improve 
relations between the historic rivals 
another joint committee to consider cultural exchanges and 
cooperation in trade and tourism will meet in ankara tuesday 
the two committees were set up following a meeting in the swiss 
resort of davos last january between prime ministers turgut ozal of 
turkey and andreas papandreou of greece 
but greece maintains that the presence of turkish soldiers on 
cyprus is a major obstacle fo improved bilateral relations and 
turkish links with the european economic community 
turkey insists that cyprus is not part of the davos 
reconciliation and that dispute should be resolved under united 
nations sponsorship 
turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 after greekcypriot national guard 
officers briefly seized control of the government in an effort to 
make the island part of greece northern cyprus now is controlled 
by turkish cypriots and the southern zone by greek cypriots

a senior government official on 
friday dismissed a critical letter from a roman catholic leader as 
too confrontational an official report said 
deputy premier matej lucan rejected the cardinals letter at a 
meeting of church dignitaries and cultural officials he said the 
letter adopts and authorizes opinions of those who actually try 
to misuse the interests of believers and churches for political 
purposes leading to pressure 
in the letter dated april 23 czechoslovak catholic primate 
frantisek tomasek demanded a new state policy toward religion he 
signaled catholics were ready to fight for religious freedom 
relations between the communist authorities and the church have 
been strained over the governments refusal to allow any bishops to 
be appointed in the last 15 years the vatican has refused to 
accept candidates from the statesponsored clergy association pacem 
in terris 
half a million catholics signed a petition organized by a 
catholic lay activist in december to demand more bishops more 
priests and an end to harassment for churchgoers 
the cardinal in the letter sent to premier lubomir strougal 
said that force used by police to break up a peaceful demonstration 
in bratislava in march illustrated the need for a new policy of 
dialogue 
tomasek said contacts between the state and church had reached a 
state of crisis he said that catholics who are conscious of 
their rights will demand them and are prepared to make sacrifices 
lucan however responded that due to its confrontation 
platform and tactless procedure the letter cannot create a basis 
for constructive relations and the government is therefore forced 
to reject it 
lucan also complained that the letter was made available to the 
western media as background material for new attacks 
authorities and the church recently reached agreement on the 
appointment of two bishops to assist tomasek and an apostolic 
administrator for the slovak diocese of trnava 
still 10 of the countrys 13 bishops posts remain vacant a 
situation the cardinal described as catastrophic the three 
bishops are all over 75

the us conviction of colombian drug 
trafficker carlos lehder rivas received scant attention in 
colombias press friday with most papers concentrating on 
colombias 31 soccer victory over finland 
none of colombias 20 daily newspapers ran editorial comment on 
the case and several did not mention the case at all 
no public demonstrations for or against the conviction were 
reported indeed the legal aspects of the case drew the most 
attention 
former justice minister felio andrade said friday that a 
uscolombia treaty limits to 30 years the us sentence that may 
be imposed on convicted drug traffickers extradited from colombia 
echoing a point that lehders lawyer tried to make in the united 
states 
lehders sevenmonth trial in us district court in 
jacksonville fla ended thursday when he was convicted of 
smuggling 33 tons of cocaine and of related charges he faces up 
to life plus 150 years in prison and 350000 in fines when he is 
sentenced july 20 
in an interview with the radio chain caracol former cabinet 
member andrade said the colombian government should make a case 
in the us courts to the effect that a colombian citizen cannot be 
sentenced to a term not encompassed by colombian law 
the maximum sentence in colombia is 30 years in prison 
another former justice minister jose manuel arias carrizosa 
criticized the trial for using evidence from criminals trying to 
get lighter sentences however colombias attorney general 
horacio serpa uribe said soon after the conviction that lehder was 
known to be involved in the drug trade 
colombian authorities captured lehder on feb 4 1987 and he 
was extradited the same day 
lehder is the biggest colombian drug trafficker ever convicted 
in a us court he was identified as belonging to the medellin 
cartel a group of colombians who control cocaine smuggling into 
the united states 
a 1979 treaty says no colombian extradited to the united states 
can be sentenced to more than the maximum penalty 30 years in 
this case that the defendant would have faced in colombia 
after lehder was extradited last year colombias supreme court 
ruled the extradition treaty unconstitutional on a technicality 
lehder was the last of 15 people sent by colombia to the united 
states to face drug charges 
the us state department insists that the treaty is valid 
former minister arias carrizosa suggested in a broadcast 
interview friday with caracol that lehder did not get a fair trial 
because much of the evidence against him came from criminals on the 
lookout for reduced sentences for themselves 
serpa uribe told reporters during an impromptu news conference 
thursday that lehders conviction did not surprise him since 
lehders link to drug trafficking was common knowledge 
while in colombia lehder bragged publicly about being involved 
in drug trafficking 
earlier this year in tegucigalpa the capital of honduras 
thousands of people rioted to protest the extradition to the united 
states of juan ramon matta accused of being a major drug smuggler

us and panamanian negotiators have 
tentatively agreed on a deal that calls for gen manuel antonio 
noriega to leave panama for nine months starting this august and 
for the united states to drop drug smuggling indictments against 
him an administration official said friday 
the arrangement would give noriega a role in setting up a 
transition government before leaving said the official who has 
followed the negotiations but insisted on anonymity 
the agreement subject to final approval by both governments 
allows noriega to return to panama for holidays and to go back 
permanently after presidential elections set for may 1989 said the 
official who described himself as opposed to the arrangement 
he said vice president george bush has expressed reservations 
however one of noriegas criminal attorneys in miami said 
friday night that no agreement has been reached 
ive just talked to a highranking member of general noriegas 
staff in panama city and he denies that any deal has been 
struck raymond takiff said 
roman popadiuk deputy white house press secretary also denied 
that a tentative agreement had been reached 
the talks have not broken down nor has there been any 
agreement he said the process still continues 
noriega on friday made no reference to the reports of a deal 
when he addressed thousands of supporters in the san miguelito 
district outside the capital of panama city 
in response to questions from local officials about talks with 
the united states noriega said any discussions must be based on 
respect for the president of the republic manuel solis palma 
there cannot be conversation there cannot be a solution if an 
exaggerated number of troops remain on our territory as 
psychological aggression noriega said neither can there be 
any solution as long as the popular forces and a militantly 
recognized government are not part of it 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller said friday that the vice 
president opposes negotiating with noriega over the conditions 
under which noriega might surrender power 
the administration sources who have suggested that the vice 
president favors ending the negotiations and bringing the envoy 
back to washington are essentially correct fuller said 
bush had lunch with president reagan on friday but the vice 
presidents aides would not say whether they discussed the noriega 
negotiations 
the official who discussed the tentative deal also said bush has 
recommended that the state department recall deputy assistant 
secretary michael g kozak from panama kozak has spent virtually 
all of may in panama trying to work out an agreement 
the official who disclosed the tentative agreement to an 
associated press reporter said if it gets accepted it gives 
noriega everything he wants 
the official said there were no assurances that noriega was 
negotiating seriously and he raised the possibility that the 
defense chief has no intention of resigning his post as the 
agreement specifies 
if the deal receives final approval the official said noriega 
would be in a position to leave his associates in positions of 
authority because he will be able to influence the formation of the 
transition government 
late friday state department spokesman charles redman said 
kozak was returning to washington for consultations 
he said kozaks return does not mean any change in the process 
the process continues redman said declining further 
comment 
associates of noriega have said in recent weeks that noriega 
sees aug 12 as an appropriate time to resign because that is the 
fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of the defense 
forces 
the state department view is that dropping the indictments 
against noriega is a defensible bargaining position because he 
cannot be extradited so long as he remains in panama 
it contends that if noriegas price for leaving panama is 
dismissal of the indictments this would be a low cost way of 
resolving the 12week old crisis which has dropped uspanamanian 
relations to a low point and produced economic collapse in panama 
according to a published report earlier this week the united 
states would reserve the right to reinstate the indictment once 
noriega returns to panama 
the reagan administration has been calling on noriega to step 
down since the indictments were returned on feb 5 
president eric arturo delvalle tried to fire noriega on feb 25 
but was ousted himself the following day by the pronoriega 
national assembly the united states continues to recognize 
delvalle as the legitimate authority in panama 
a series of us economic sanctions have contributed to panamas 
economic demise 
us apprehensions about noriega were heightened on thursday 
when a progovernment newspaper published photographs of us 
embassy employees and their families so that panamanians will 
know the gringos who are starving us to death 
the supplement in the newspaper critica a propaganda organ of 
the government said the americans think the walls of their 
embassy are impregnable 
state department spokesman charles redman said the supplement 
has been noted with concern and that appropriate security 
measures have been taken 
he declined to elaborate and refused to say whether any 
americans associated with the embassy are being evacuated 
we have seen a pattern of harassment over a period of time in 
panama redman said this appears to be part of that the way 
to deal with that is to continue to take the precautions that need 
to be taken 
redman had no comment on the negotiations white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater also refused comment except to say they were 
continuing

the furor over expensive yachts confiscated for as 
little as a single marijuana cigarette has led the coast guard to 
review but not abandon the zero tolerance antidrug policy 
civil libertarians have attacked the seizures as 
unconstitutional arguing searches are often illegal and owners are 
being punished for something done by others 
us customs service commissioner william von raab said friday 
the atlantis ii which explored the wreck of the titanic was the 
latest confiscated vessel to be returned to its owners the ship 
was seized in san diego when a crewman was found with a small 
amount of marijuana 
the atlantis ii is being given back because the owners were 
perfectly innocent and theyre actually shocked because they were 
trying to improve their security said von raab 
the crewman pleaded guilty thursday to misdemeanor drug 
possession and was sentenced to a year of unsupervised probation 
and fined 100 said mike fleming a los angelesbased customs 
spokesman 
under an agreement reached friday the atlantis ii will resume 
scientific expeditions technically under customs control while its 
owner the woods hole oceanographic institution of massachusetts 
petitions the seizure he said 
privately customs officials have expressed anger at the coast 
guards highly publicized aggressive seizures of boats 
they are destroying the program said one florida customs 
official who spoke on condition of anonymnity 
in florida the coast guard boarded and confiscated the 25 
million ark royal as well as the monkey business notorious as the 
bahamas vacation boat of gary hart and donna rice and their 
friends both yachts carried only minute amounts of drugs 
under zero tolerance the coast guard is supposed to turn over 
all vessels seized for drugs to customs 
but customs refused to take custody of the monkey business 
because officials felt the search was poorly done that yacht had 
to be returned to its owners by the coast guard without fines or 
penalties 
the coast guard has now agreed to take another look at such 
seizures 
specific changes will be implemented within a couple of 
weeks capt john c trainor who heads the coast guards 
enforcement division said thursday 
we realized that although the owner is responsible for that 
boat there had to be some reasonableness to it trainor said 
were not in the business of harassing boaters and were not in 
the business of seizing boats he said 
among changes being considered are delaying seizures of charter 
vessels until after the boats return to port and drop off their 
passengers employing technical seizures that allow owners to 
keep their vessels while they argue against forfeiture and 
educating coast guard officers on exemptions in the zero tolerance 
policy 
but trainor said the changes dont mean the coast guard is 
abandoning enforcement of the policy 
we are part of the national effort to stamp out drugs in this 
country trainor said were holding everybody accountable for 
his own actions 
the american civil liberties union is conducting a review of its 
own said attorney barbara levinson 
from reports ive heard coast guard officers are jumping on 
board and not bothering to check safety theyre going right to a 
search that means peoples billfolds that means drawers that 
means closets she said the search of every nook and cranny 
when theres no reasonable cause that violates peoples 
constitutional rights

big increases in food energy and clothing 
costs sent consumer prices up 04 percent in april an annual rate 
of increase of 53 percent as the country got its second monthly 
dose of higher inflation the government reported friday 
inflation which has been at or below 4 percent for the past six 
years is being pushed higher by price pressures caused by tight 
labor markets high factory operating rates and a weak dollar 
analysts said 
the april price increase followed a 05 percent march advance 
which had been the sharpest monthly gain since january 1987 
analysts said the uptick in inflation over the past two months is 
worrisome because it reflected price increases in a variety of 
areas 
in april grocery store prices shot up 08 percent the biggest 
increase in 20 months while gasoline costs which had fallen from 
september though february jumped 11 percent 
clothing costs which had surged a record 2 percent in march 
posted another 2 percent rise in april reflecting higher costs of 
imports 
we have an unacceptably high rate of inflation that is 
widespread said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
this is the consequence of both the strength in the economy and 
the effect of the weaker dollar on imported goods prices 
seven months after the october stock market crash raised fears 
of a recession analysts have now switched to worrying that the 
economy is growing so strongly that inflationary pressures are 
building they cite the fact that factories are now operating at 
the highest level in eight years while unemployment has fallen to a 
14yearlow of 54 percent 
the federal reserve already has boosted interest rates twice in 
the past two months in an effort to dampen demand and head off 
further inflationary pressures 
but the tightening has done little to reassure financial 
markets which have been in a tailspin in recent days driven down 
not only by inflation concerns but fears that interest rates will 
go higher 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 613 to close at 
195259 bringing the loss for the week to 3795 points as 
concerns about inflation and higher interest rates continued to 
dominate the market 
top reagan administration officials including treasury 
secretary james a baker iii have contended the markets 
inflationary fears are overblown 
in a statement friday presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said inflation remains under control with no significant 
acceleration from recent years 
but private economists disagreed david jones an economist with 
aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer predicted 
consumer prices would rise by 55 percent this year that would be 
the fastest inflation rate since 1981 and up substantially from the 
44 percent increase in 1987 
the fears that people have had about higher inflation are 
justified said bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch 
the general message in this report is that prices have been 
rising in the past two months at a faster pace and they will 
continue to do so 
steinberg said the fed will be forced to keep pushing interest 
rates higher to fight rising inflationary pressures and that this 
eventually will lead to a recession sometime next year but other 
economists said it was too soon to predict a recession from the 
upturn in inflation 
the labor department gave these details of its consumer price 
index for april 
more than onefourth of the monthly increase came from the 2 
percent rise in clothing costs paced by a 35 percent jump in 
womens apparel a 27 percent rise in the prices for childrens 
goods and a 21 percent increase in mens clothing 
the 08 percent rise in grocery store prices the biggest since 
august 1986 reflected higher prices for beef up 23 percent 
fish up 29 percent and fruits and vegetables up 14 percent 
the higher food costs contributed another onefourth of the overall 
price increase in april 
in addition to the 11 percent rise in gasoline prices home 
heating oil rose 09 percent and natural gas and electricity costs 
were up 04 percent some analysts predicted further gasoline price 
increases in may but they said prices should moderate after that 
because of the failure of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries to reach agreement with nonmember nations to limit 
production 
new car prices were unchanged in april but the cost of public 
transportation jumped 08 percent reflecting higher airline ticket 
prices 
the various increases left the consumer price index at 1171 
meaning a market basket of consumer goods costing 1000 on average 
between 1982 and 1984 cost 1171 last month 
the labor department said in another report friday that 
americans average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation 
rose 09 percent in april as the 04 percent rise in inflation was 
offset by increases in hourly pay and number of hours worked 
the changes left americans inflationadjusted earnings 03 
percent above a year ago 
in other economic news friday 
income tax collections helped shrink the federal budget deficit 
by 139 billion in april but the deficit for the first seven 
months of the fiscal year 1050 billion was running 246 percent 
ahead of last year economists said the reagan administration would 
have difficulty meeting its deficit projection for 1988 of 1467 
billion 
the veterans administration announced that effective monday it 
was increasing the maximum interest rate on federallybacked va 
home mortgages by 05 percentage points to 105 percent 
average rates on 30year fixedrate conventional mortgages 
increased to 1052 percent this week up from 1040 percent last 
week the federal home loan mortgage corp said

the world bank suggested friday that 
commercial banks in the united states and other countries 
voluntarily give up 5 billion to 6 billion of interest owed them 
by 17 heavily indebted countries 
in a special report the bank which is owned by 151 
governments said interest waivers of about two percentage points 
on the debt owed by the socalled middle income countries would 
generate the same financial relief in the first year as a 5 
billion to 6 billion loan 
the middle income countries in question are argentina 
bolivia brazil chile colombia costa rica ecuador ivory coast 
jamaica mexico morocco nigeria peru philippines uruguay 
venezuela and yugoslavia they have foreign debts of about 500 
billion 
the 42page report the world bank and the heavily indebted 
middleincome countries did not say how long the waivers should 
be continued 
the same suggestion was made privately last month by barber b 
conable the banks president to representatives of member 
countries 
conable and government financial leaders including treasury 
secretary james a baker iii have criticized commercial banks for 
not lending more 
the commercial banks meanwhile say governments and 
intergovernmental bodies like the world bank and its sister body 
the international monetary fund should do more lending 
the report said governments of borrowing countries are reluctant 
to borrow more without some relief they complain they are already 
paying out 30 billion a year to more prosperous countries mostly 
on old debt 
in many of these countries per capita income and consumption 
have fallen considerably over the past five years and are for some 
countries back to levels that were already attained in the early 
1960s according to the report 
the average argentine earned 2350 in 1986 compared with 160 
for the average nepalese 17840 for the average swiss and 17500 
for the average american according to the world banks figures 
the report cites mexico where 700000 teenagers reach working 
age every year and few jobs have been created since 1981 
unemployment in mexico increased by 70 percent between 1981 and 
1984 it says 
the world bank is the largest source of aid money to nearly 120 
countries lending about 17 billion annually that figure is 
expected to increase to more than 20 billion in the 1990s

gov george deukmejian signed a law friday 
permitting state law enforcement officers to wiretap suspected big 
time drug dealers but officials said the bill wont add much punch 
to the war against drugdealing street gangs 
the law is a longsought if partial victory for police and 
conservatives who spent decades seeking far broader powers to 
conduct electronic surveillance 
outrage over drugrelated gang violence overrode concerns about 
privacy and helped win passage of the bill but some officials said 
the powers are too weak to be of much use against gangs 
los angeles police chief daryl gates said most gangs dont deal 
in large enough quantities of drugs to trigger wiretapping 
if youre able to use it extensively for gangs it would give 
law enforcement an insight into the structure of gangs gates 
said they are very smart much smarter than our legislators 
unfortunately 
gates also criticized the bill because it only applies to drug 
crimes 
it should be used for murders kidnappings and terrorists 
but were only using it for narcotics he said adding that 
federal investigators can use wiretaps to investigate a greater 
array of crimes 
beginning jan 1 state and local law enforcement agencies may 
tap telephones in drug cases involving at least 10 gallons or three 
pounds of heroin cocaine pcp or methamphetamine 
police must obtain permission to tap from a superior court 
judge officers conducting taps would have to go through special 
training could not enter a private residence covertly to install a 
listening device and would have to report to the judge every 72 
hours on the progress of the tap 
unauthorized use of information obtained through a wiretap could 
result in a fine of up to 10000 or imprisonment 
the bill is not as strong as wed like it to be however it 
is going to be an effective tool deukmejian said in signing the 
law at the hall of justice 
this is not a panacea that will end all the drug abuse in 
california but its a small tool we can use said grover trask 
the riverside county district attorney and president of the 
california district attorneys association 
under the federal wiretapping law adopted in 1968 federal 
investigators can use electronic surveillance in certain murder 
cases such as political assassinations and murdersforhire drug 
cases and other suspected crimes such as bribery racketeering 
treason and sexual exploitation of children said jim sander 
assistant us attorney in los angeles 
there are no quantity limitations on the drug cases that can be 
investigated he added 
the state senate has approved wiretap legislation several times 
since 1970 but all previous attempts died in the assembly many 
legislators and the american civil liberties union have opposed 
wiretapping as an invasion of privacy 
but aided by the rising concern over gang activities a 
coalition of republicans and conservative democrats this year 
pushed the proposal around a committee that has blocked previous 
efforts in the lower house the bill was approved by votes of 313 
in the senate and 4919 in the assembly 
aclu officials did not return phone calls friday

an official statement issued friday 
confirmed that federal military commanders met in march and 
considered ways to quell dissent in slovenia 
the statement by slovenias information ministry followed 
reports published by the slovenian youth magazine mladina that 
there had been plans for a military takeover of the republic 
slovenia is considered the most liberal of yugoslavias six 
republics and two autonomous provinces 
the ministry statement said the federal military council met on 
march 25 and concluded that dissident tendencies in slovenia 
were part of a foreignbacked conspiracy to overthrow the countrys 
communist government 
but it said there was no discussion at the meeting about a 
plan for action against special warfare in slovenia the term 
special warfare refers to subversive actions 
the statement did not identify the foreign elements and said 
slovenia police later challenged the claim that there was such a 
conspiracy 
it said the police disputed the military councils conclusion at 
a later meeting between the republics police authorities and 
ljubljanas military command 
the police said they had no available data which would justify 
such evaluations according to the ministry statement it 
reported the police also said there were no subversive forces 
behind articles carried in the slovenian news media 
slovenias communist party presidium also expressed 
disagreement with part of the military councils opinions said 
the statement 
some army commanders have been increasingly critical of 
slovenias leadership saying it should act firmly against 
political dissidents and slovenian communists have frequently 
criticized the way the federal government is dealing with the 
countrys economic and social problems 
mladina the official publication of the socialist youth 
organization wrote of possible military intervention in its 
current issue 
it published a letter to slovenias communist party leader milan 
kucan from two student unions that said military action had been 
planned earlier this year including the arrests of nonconformist 
journalists writers and officials 
the letter said military units would be used to crush 
demonstrations that were expected to be called to protest the 
arrests 
it also said the army did not notify slovenias civilian 
leadership of the planned intervention the plan was blocked by 
kucan and stane dolanc slovenias member in yugoslavias 
collective presidency after they were told about it by slovenian 
security organizations the letter said 
svetozar visnjic commander of ljubljanas military command 
dismissed the reports of planned military action as nonsense and 
a fabrication he made the comment in an interview with the 
belgrade politika ekspres newspaper

a federal judge on friday temporarily 
blocked reagan administration plans to start random drug testing of 
all 13000 federal prison workers saying the testing of 
lawabiding employees posed constitutional problems 
us district judge stanley weigel issued a temporary 
restraining order sought by a labor union against the bureau of 
prisons one of the first federal agencies scheduled to begin drug 
testing under president reagans september 1986 executive order 
the program would force lawabiding employees of the bureau of 
prisons to submit to testing even though not suspected of any 
wrongdoing negligence or dereliction of duty weigel said in his 
order 
the 750000member american federation of government employees 
the largest union representing federal workers also has challenged 
reagans entire drug testing program covering 345000 employees in 
40 agencies in a separate lawsuit 
the union chose the federal court in san francisco for both 
suits because of favorable precedents from the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals which has ruled against postaccident testing of 
railroad workers 
the supreme court may resolve the issue in a case scheduled for 
argument this fall involving the testing of applicants for jobs and 
promotions in the customs service 
weigels order blocks testing of prison workers which had been 
set to start monday until at least next thursday when a hearing 
is scheduled on a longerlasting preliminary injunction the 
injunction if granted could be appealed to higher courts 
weigel pressed a government lawyer apparently without success 
to bypass the preliminary injunction hearing and allow the ban to 
stay in effect until a fullscale trial of the lawsuit june 16 
i dont think the worlds going to come to an end because the 
program is delayed until a full careful consideration the judge 
said 
but justice department lawyer richard lepley said the government 
was unwilling to let the temporary ban which cannot be appealed 
stay in effect longer than the 20day legal limit for restraining 
orders 
at a hearing thursday lepley said the bureau of prisons had 
concluded that even a few days delay in testing would cause a 
great chance of serious injury even death both weigel and a 
union lawyer questioned that claim 
under reagans 1986 order federal agencies are to conduct 
random urinalysis testing of employees in sensitive jobs and 
also test applicants for new jobs and promotions workers involved 
in accidents and supervisors workers who fail the tests can be 
fired if they decline rehabilitation and lesser discipline 
the bureau of prisons has declared that all its employees hold 
sensitive jobs and therefore are subject to random testing 
with 5 to 10 percent of the staff tested each year 
the afge suit contends the program violates constitutional 
standards for unreasonable searches by allowing testing without 
individual suspicion of drug use the suit also claims violations 
of federal laws forbidding discrimination against the handicapped 
and requiring employee discipline to be related to job performance 
in his order weigel said supreme court and appellate rulings 
cast serious doubt upon the constitutionality and lawfulness of 
the program 
the judge said his order does not prohibit testing of any prison 
employee based on a reasonable suspicion of drug use that impairs 
job performance that is the standard the government has been 
following since 1985 lepley said

opportunities should not be missed 
gorbachev offered much the same formula at his april 9 meeting

military leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega said friday that talks between panama and the united states 
cannot be held if the aggression continues 
noriega told thousands of supporters in the san miguelito 
district outside the capital that there cannot be conversation 
if aggression continues aggression at whatever level whatever 
magnitude whether it be psychological or economic aggression 
he made no reference to reports in washington that us and 
panamanian negotiators have tentatively agreed on a deal calling 
for noriega to leave panama in august and stay away until may 1989 
when presidential elections will be held 
a reagan administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity told reporters that in return for noriegas departure 
the united states would agree to drop federal drug smuggling 
charges against him and give him a role in setting up a 
transitional government 
the agreement subject to final approval by both governments 
allows noriega to return to panama for holidays and to go back 
permanently after the presidential elections the official said 
noriega in response to questions from local officials about 
talks with the united states said any discussions must be based on 
respect for the president of the republic manuel solis palma 
there cannot be conversation there cannot be a solution if an 
exaggerated number of troops remain on our territory as 
psychological aggression he said 
neither can there be any solution as long as the popular 
forces and a militantly recognized government are not part of it 
he said at the inauguration of a grandstand at a sports complex in 
san miguelito 
noriega as head of the 15000member panamanian defense forces 
is the power behind the civilian government 
the reagan administration has imposed sweeping economic 
sanctions against the country in an effort to force noriegas 
ouster 
the united states still recognizes eric arturo delvalle who has 
been in hiding as panamas legitimate president noriega allies in 
the national assembly dismissed him feb 26 the day after delvalle 
tried to fire noriega 
there are about 10000 us military personnel stationed at 10 
installations in panama 
noriega said panama is a democratic country but it is a 
democracy without the usa label democracy with the 
panamanian tricolor with the taste of panamanian soup and with the 
tone and the tune of the little drum 
arrayed on the field before noriega were hundreds of members of 
socalled dignity battalions the volunteer battalions have been 
formed to confront what the noriegacontrolled government says is 
the danger of a us invasion 
about 30 volunteers clad in tshirts and blue jeans and 
carrying world war iiera rifles ran through an obstacle course 
then jabbed or battered a dummy dressed in olive green as a 
demonstration of their training 
san miguelito will be the tomb of yankee imperialism said 
an announcer through loudspeakers as the volunteers went through 
their paces 
noriega said the militias would fight any invaders 
those powerful ones who think they can come to this territory 
without getting a whipping are mistaken he said 
the master of ceremonies who introduced the general addressed 
himself to the foreign journalists gathered below him 
if there is an invasion you wont be filming panamanian 
cadavers but the cadavers of north american soldiers that we will 
send home to north american mothers he said 
noriega concluded the list of conditions for a uspanama 
solution by saying if i have said nothing it is because i know 
them the americans and because i know them i remain silent

acting prime minister poul schlueter 
won approval friday to form a new government after two other 
leaders failed during a political crisis over nato and the 
countrys ban on nuclear weapons 
schleuter had hoped for a clear mandate from may 10 
parliamentary elections for full danish participation in nato and 
against a stronger antinuclear ban 
however schlueters centerright coalition merely kept its 70 
seats in the 179member legislature the twoparty socialist 
opposition lost ground but still holds 79 seats making it 
difficult for schlueter to form a new government 
schleuter now caretaker prime minister was asked to try to 
form a new government by queen margrethe ii 
its a hard task and far from certain that i will succeed 
said schlueter on friday 
the socialist opposition pushed a resolution through parliament 
april 14 calling on schlueters government to notify each visiting 
warship of denmarks longstanding peacetime ban on nuclear weapons 
 
schleuter said he hoped a new government would be in place for 
the opening of parliament on thursday 
the nonpartisan chairman of parliament and the leader of the 
centrist socialliberal party both failed to forge a ruling 
coalition among the eight parties elected to the legislature on may

the usbacked contras agreed friday 
to nicaraguas proposed dates for the next round of peace talks 
but the two sides suggested different sites 
jorge rosales spokesman for the nicaraguan resistance said in 
a phone interview from miami that leaders of the contra rebels will 
attend two days of peace talks beginning wednesday as the 
government has proposed 
he said the rebel leaders will arrive for talks at the border 
town of sapoa where the agreement was reached in march for a 
60day ceasefire lasting until may 30 
but deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco said in a note to 
the rebels that the talks must be held in managua 
to hold the discussions outside of the capital he said is to 
go back in the advances that with great difficulties have been 
achieved in the ceasefire talks 
tinoco said earlier that the rebels had not yet responded to a 
government proposal to extend the ceasefire one month past the may 
30 deadline 
the interior ministry meanwhile ordered radio catolica to pull 
off the air until tuesday a news program that carried an interview 
with a rebel chief according to auxiliadora echegoyen director of 
the program 
she said the suspension notice cited an interview which we 
transmitted with a rebel chief whose pseudonym is tigrillo and 
which we monitored from another radio 
she did not say which station had originally carried the 
interview 
the interior ministry said in a statement that the station 
should have cleared the interview with the government 
radio catolica which is operated by the roman catholic church 
was one of three privately owned radio stations barred from 
broadcasting news programs earlier this month because it reported a 
workers strike 
the sandinista government and the contras have been blaiming 
each other for the faltering peace plan to end more than six years 
of war 
almost two months after the two sides signed the pact they 
agree only on the desire to end the fighting the government has 
warned it will stage the largest offensive to date if the 
ceasefire is not extended after may 30 or if no progress is made 
the contras meanwhile are suffering from infighting a move 
that favors the ruling sandinistas from the governments point of 
view the best way for the war to end would be for the enemy to 
selfdestruct 
prosandinista newspapers were giving widespread coverage to the 
contra bickering 
the problems surrounding the ceasefire plan appear to have 
started almost immediately after the march 23 signing if all had 
gone according to plan the war would just about be over and 
nicaragua would be well on its way to full democracy 
because the ceasefire plan has not moved forward the 
sandinistas have not freed more than 3000 political prisoners nor 
permitted the contras to have a say in internal politics 
talks with the internal opposition political parties stand at an 
impasse the meetings were suspended by the opposition as a show of 
support for the strikers the government responded by saying it 
would consider whether future talks would be held 
according to the ceasefire plan the first measures should have 
been completed by april 15 in exchange the contra rebels would 
have gathered in agreed upon ceasefire zones and been permitted to 
receive humanitarian aid through a neutral organization 
the sandinistas have said the insurgents could now receive food 
medicine and clothes distributed by the international red cross 
but the contras rejected that saying the organization sympathizes 
with the government 
meanwhile sources said thousands of rebel troops moved toward 
the northern border the us agency for international development 
is providing supplies to the contras through honduras 
a group of rebellious contras has demanded the ouster of the top 
contra military officer col enrique bermudez a former officer 
under the ousted dictator anastasio somoza 
matamoros the contras main spokesman said recently the talk 
of divisions was exaggerated 
nicaraguan vice president sergio ramirez said sunday that the 
contra infighting puts into doubt future ceasefire negotiations 
in honduras the mercenary forces the contras are on the 
verge of civil war he said the political heads that come here 
to negotiate have very little influence

big increases in food energy and clothing

of increase of 53 percent as the country got its second monthly 
dose of higher inflation the government reported friday 
inflation which has been at or below 4 percent for the past six 
years is being pushed higher by price pressures caused by tight 
labor markets high factory operating rates and a weak dollar 
analysts said 
the april price increase followed a 05 percent may advance 
which had been the sharpest monthly gain since january 1987 
analysts said the uptick in inflation over the past two months is

three years after the original 1904 walters art 
gallery closed for a 6 million overhaul baltimores renaissance 
palace museum has been restored to the glory that railroad magnate 
henry walters envisioned for one of the greatest private art 
collections in the world 
the renovation has created for walters precious jewels 
bronzes paintings and sculpture what gallery director robert p 
bergman calls a seamless museum environment that is easy on the 
eye and alluring even to those not trained in art history 
in a lot of ways we think the public is going to see the 
collection for the first time bergman said recently pointing 
proudly to carefully concealed display spotlights designed to lure 
viewers we direct people directly to the object through the 
lighting 
the massive stone building with a marblecolumned court 
fashioned after the 17thcentury palazzo balbi in genoa italy is 
one of six comprehensive museums in the united states walters 
bequeathed it to the city upon his death in 1931 along with the 
22000piece collection 
the leaking roof blackened marble drab painted walls and 
poorly lighted rooms bergman inherited when he left an art history 
post at harvard university and arrived here are gone in their 
place stands a pristine and colorful complex of rooms featuring 
gleaming stone rich silk moire red blue and gold cotton damask 
polished woods glass lucite and plaster the works themselves 
were carefully conserved to bring out colors and features hidden 
for centuries 
the renovated gallery holds some of the 30000object collection 
spanning 5000 years of history a 1974 addition that stayed open 
during the renovation holds many of the works while thousands more 
lie in storage 
walters who made his fortune with the atlantic coast line 
railroad left the collection along with a 3 million endowment 
to his native city for the benefit of the people 
the works include such masterpieces as one of three surviving 
14thcentury italian perspective paintings called view of an 
ideal city an early lifesize italian crucifix from the school 
of cimabue the first raphael madonna to come to america and one of 
only 12 known paintings by hugo van der goes 
now however their future is assured by a climate and 
lightcontrolled environment that is so hightech that special 
louvers regulate the amount of natural light let in by skylights 
and storage spaces for metal works vent outside to prevent 
oxidation from destroying other valuable pieces 
bergman jokingly calls the project a modest calling 
we wanted to create the finest facility possible for this 
collection of renaissance baroque and 18thcentury paintings and 
sculpture and decorative arts he said 
to do that was a special project the building is a work of 
art we had to respect at every turn the character of this landmark 
structure said the medievalist who moved from the rarified 
atmosphere of art history theory to a comfortable position as 
ceaseless champion of his worldclass museum 
bergman is satisfied with the effort financed with 1 million 
in city funds 1 million in state funds and another 4 million in 
contributions in fact he considers the workmanship he got for the 
money a bargain pointing out how the wood in new doorways matches 
original woods and marblepainted sculpture bases mimic the marble 
columns for a consistent look 
going room to room bergman marvels at the miraculously 
preserved royal jewel cabinet in wax and wood made for marie 
antoinette a collection of european porcelains considered second 
only to the british royal collection at windsor castle and some of 
the nearly 1000 pieces of jewelry spanning the styles from ancient 
egypt to art nouveau 
the installation includes a 19thcentury alcove modeled on a 
french goldsmiths shop for walters delicate faberge enamels an 
iris corsage ornament created by tiffany and co and an ivory 
orchid comb by lalique 
the gallery went up between 1904 and 1909 and before walters 
death he would open the doors a few times a month charge 
admission and donate the proceeds to charity just as his father 
who began the collection had done 
more recently the gallery has been drawing 150000 to 200000 
visitors a year including 1500 museum members who celebrated the 
official opening on may 15 the first visitors to the reopened 
gallery included former employees as well as local visitors 
seasoned by a lifetime of trips 
one after another they stopped bergman to thank him for 
restoring the collection to splendor 
just hearing these people convinces me we did the right 
thing he said 
end adv pm fri may 27

tigermania is here 
the grammy awardwinning tigres del norte the kings of northern 
ranchera music are performing the songs that champion 
struggling workingclass people 
at a recent concert the outdoor arena in this town in the 
northern border state of nuevo leon was so tightly packed with fans 
that those in the front rows had to brace their arms against the 
stage to keep from being smashed into it 
and fans of all ages struggled through the crowd to hand 
requests and flowers to the fiveman band which has sold more than 
20 million albums to date 
its their music after all northern ranchera polkastyle 
ballads backed by an accordion two guitars a saxophone and drums 
and for the past 18 years los tigres del norte the tigers of 
the north have been making it famous in latin neighborhoods 
throughout the united states and central america 
the grammy award for best mexicanamerican performance has 
opened new doors for los tigres they said and now theyre hoping 
to be able to perform with artists from the united states they won 
for their grammywinning album gracias america sin 
fronteras or thanks america without borders 
their new album idols of the people contains two songs 
sung in english and spanish marking their first attempt to reach 
an englishspeaking audience 
its part of the folklore of the north its strictly northern 
and we dont want it to die said guitar player raul hernandez 
about ranchera music 
los tigres brothers jorge raul and hernan hernandez cousin 
oscar lara and friend jose guadalupe olivo have recorded 18 
albums and performed in 12 movies based on their songs in the two 
decades since they moved from northwestern coastal sinaloa state to 
california seeking a record contract 
our music wasnt accepted here in mexico said jorge the 
oldest hernandez brother at 37 and leader of the band nobody 
would put it on the radio 
their lyrics speak of national pride and the realities of their 
lives im proud to be called mexican because there is nothing 
else like it one song says 
they now are residents of san jose calif and record their 
music there 
just teenagers at the time they left mexico and without a name 
for the band an american immigration agent at the border city of 
calexico calif baptized the group los tigres del norte 
jorge hernandez said 
from workingclass families only jorge finished junior high 
school and received some formal musical training they all play 
music by ear 
tigres producer enrique frinco writes the lyrics and is the 
major contributer on the melodies 
los tigres started out singing songs of drug deals gone bad 
such as the 1971 hit contraband and betrayal that launched 
their musical career 
although the drug theme the smuggler always dies still is 
prevalent in their music they often sing about the status of 
mexicans living in the united states such as their hit the 
other mexico nominated last year for a grammy 
dont criticize me because i live on the other side the 
lyrics say 
im not rootless i live for necessity 
already many years since i came as a wetback 
my customs havent changed 
nor my nationality 
im like so many other mexicans beaten by life working under 
the sun 
in gracias america sin fronteras the america of 
which they sing is all of north and south america 
america is the whole continent and he who is born here is 
american the song says 
but the song also says i was born the color of the earth by 
inheritance my language is spanish in the north they call me 
latin they dont want to call me american 
los tigres didnt intend to give the impression that america no 
longer has borders or that the group was thanking america for not 
having borders 
its a little confusing acknowledged raul hernandez who 
added that fans often request the song america without borders 
our idea was to make it known to the people that buy our 
albums that they should feel american said jorge hernandez 
los tigres said they were kicked out of restaurants in the 
united states because they spoke only spanish when they first began 
touring in the 1970s they say mexicanamericans still are made to 
feel like secondclass citizens in the united states

are things really that bad 
is the economy ready to swell into inflation and plunge into 
recession are interest rates about to soar are we helpless 
against the enemy or are there tools for dealing with problems 
during the past week a cloud of pessimism descended upon those 
who look into the future it blotted out the sun and obscured 
vision and it induced a lot of people into stating that the dark 
ages had returned 
good news became bad news small fractional increases in 
various economic measurements were projected to the extreme tools 
to contain inflation soften recession or keep interest rates in 
check suddenly seemed useless 
contradictions were presented as wisdom if interest rates were 
to soar for instance how could the economy simultaneously turn 
into a runaway bull wouldnt the skyhigh interest rates prevent 
that 
faith was abandoned what ever happened for example to the 
notion that growth neednt be inflationary if based on productivity 
gains or that the economy could be influenced by the federal 
reserve albeit with great limits 
what became of restraint does a small increase in interest 
rates mean that huge increases will follow and persist for years 
or that the economy will pitch forward into the worst recession 
ever 
a lot has to do with the perspective and that perspective has 
been marked for years by wariness weariness doubt and probably 
meanspiritedness 
economist paul craig roberts says one reason for the gloomy 
perspective is that supplyside economics was supposed to fail the 
recovery wasnt supposed to happen and interest rates and inflation 
werent supposed to fall 
gene jay seagle vice president of gruntal amp co a securities 
firm says that positive events have left so many forecasters with 
egg on their faces that it is hard for them to be pleased with the 
economic recovery 
it is similar in the securities markets as described by john d 
connolly senior vice president at dean witter he observes that 
two of the casualties of the stock market crash last october were 
analysis and imagination 
rather than assessing the interplay of forces for change and the 
inertia of the status quo he says a great deal of energy has 
been expended in trying to force the present into some historical 
mold 
it wont fit he says 
chronicling the surface similarities between now and 1929 was 
an amusing exercise but it has lost its persuasiveness since the 
economy has refused to contract 
therefore the hunt is on for another analogy this time 
including overheating and inflation the analysis and imagination 
brought to bear involve annualizing the last numbers that is 
extrapolating them to the extreme 
nobody knows what the economy holds in store it might be 
recession it might be high interest rates it could mean lower 
stock prices and all these possibilities could be faced in the 
extreme 
but if all this happens you may be sure that recovery will 
follow if there is one thing known for certain about all 
industrial economies it is that they are cyclical ups and downs 
precede and follow each other 
while todays consensus seems to view the world through dark 
glasses you can still find some rosetinted views such as this 
encouraging observation from gerald w perritt publisher of the 
newsletter investment horizons 
he writes do not be frightened by bear markets on the 
contrary since they present a rare opportunity to accumulate the 
shares of good companies at bargain prices you should view bear 
markets in a favorable light 
remember the only time you want stock prices to be at their 
peak is the day you plan to sell in the meantime you should be 
glad that the stock market periodically places its merchandise on 
sale

the nations first law making recycling 
mandatory across a state has forced new jersey residents to become 
more intimate with their trash 
no longer can one toss the chicken bones the baby food jars and 
the bean cans into the garbage bag and forget about them recycling 
isnt just for boy scouts operating saturday newspaper collections 
anymore 
to 79yearold vera collett this means converting her kitchen 
into a mini recycling center she has to collect newspapers 
bottles and garbage in separate containers and then remember which 
day to carry each bag downstairs for pickup 
well for us old folks its a pest she said adding i 
guess we can struggle through if we have to 
her resigned acceptance is echoed across new jersey as county 
governments tackle the logistical difficulties of recycling and 
residents contend with separating coffee grounds from cans and 
soaking labels off bottles 
its not pleasant and to tell you the truth its a pain in 
the neck but it has to be done said mark hart of fair haven 
brian krulick an 11yearold from manalapan whose chores 
include most of his familys recycling said he hears many similar 
complaints from the grownups around him 
they think its a pain in the neck but its worth it he 
concluded its a good law because youre throwing away a 
resource but its a lot better to use it again 
new jerseys law was the most sweeping in the nation when it was 
signed by gov thomas kean in april 1987 it requires every 
community to compost leaves and recycle three materials chosing 
from aluminum glass tin plastic and newspapers 
by the end of 1988 all of new jerseys 567 communities are 
scheduled to be recycling 
under a rhode island law that took effect last fall communities 
must recycle trash or be charged higher rates at the state 
landfill most towns are planning to avoid the higher rates by 
refusing to pick up residents garbage that is not recycled so 
far two of the states 39 communities have launched pilot programs 
and 16 more are scheduled to begin by the end of the year 
connecticut enacted a more comprehensive measure in july 1987 
requiring nearly a dozen materials to be recycled but it is not 
scheduled to be in full force until 1991 
in early may new york gov mario cuomo signed a mandatory 
recycling law that requires all communities to recycle by late 
1992 oregon has a law requiring recycling in larger communities 
and pennsylvania is considering a similar statute 
the state recycling laws have been spurred by the need to ease 
solid waste burdens on dwindling landfill space 
new jersey is probably feeling the pinch of the solid waste 
crisis harder than other states because of its limited landfill 
space said judy roumpf publisher of the oregonbased trade 
magazine resource recyling 
unfortunately we tend to be crisisoriented said jerry 
rhodes the recycling coordinator in paramus which has faced 
soaring rates for dumping garbage at landfills as space became more 
scarce 
paramus pilot program for 220 homes allows residents to mix 
their glass and metal waste and bundle their newspapers separately 
the easier it is for the people the more cooperation youre 
going to see by letting them comingle the waste we meet about 
half the resistance said rhodes were trying a pilot because 
we dont want to make an 8000home mistake 
implementation has not been without some hitches 
officials report problems with curbside scavengers stealing 
valuable aluminum which is commanding up to 50 cents a pound 
midnight dumpers have dropped unwanted couches and refrigerators 
at community recycling centers 
oceanside communities are gearing up for seasonal problems when 
vacationers are likely to ignore local recycling pickup schedules 
other towns have encountered problems with waste haulers who get 
paid by the ton and cart away garbage even if it is improperly 
loaded with newspapers and glass 
still others say they have heard of residents bragging that they 
circumvent the law simply by sticking to plastic bags that cant be 
seen through 
state sen paul contillo who created the law said he wants to 
revise it to eliminate loopholes and make it easier to go into the 
recycling business at the same time he said the state must avoid 
opening the field to organized crime which controls some waste 
haulers 
another obstacle has been generating markets for the recycled 
plastics the state must report back to the legislature by the end 
of the year on what steps have been made 
many local recycling coordinators say compliance has been good 
but residents continue to grumble some complain the new law 
makes them giftwrap their garbage and others grow angry when their 
rubbish is left by the curb because a hauler spotted a wayward 
glass jar 
theres always going to be maybe 5 percent of the people who 
feel you are asking them to do something they should not have to do 
because theyre paying their taxes said ann moore the 
coordinator in burlington county 
ms roumpf said the resistance is no surprise 
she cited opinion polls showing most people support recycling 
like they support apple pie and motherhood until they are 
asked whether they recycle or if they would want to

hes no bird hes no plane and in the first 
issue he makes the mistake of trying to rescue superman 
hes the tick a clumsy musclebound comic book superhero 
in a tick costume who has escaped from a minnesota insane asylum to 
become the protector of boston 
the tick is also the first publishing venture of new england 
comics a bookstore chain anchored in boston that is thriving on a 
resurgent national interest in comic books 
comic books have come of age along with their readers old 
favorites are being remodeled and a new generation of adult comics 
takes chances with art content and subtle humor vivid drawings 
are richly detailed and often seem charged with an electric current 
its exploded said george suarez a 33yearold accountant 
who cofounded new england comics five years ago comics are 
being read by more and more of the general population it used to 
be you didnt admit you read comics if you were over 13 
comic books are proliferating in a way not seen since the early 
1950s when readership was estimated at 4 million but its not all 
the same old superman and lulu that generated 300 million in 
retail sales last year 
wonder woman for instance created in 1941 and published by 
dc comics recently relocated to intellectual boston and took as 
her mentor an archaeologist at harvard university 
her new artist and writer george perez is 33 and based in new 
york he consulted with former ms magazine editor gloria steinem 
before modernizing wonder woman 
i try to hold on to some fans trying to adultify her 
without ignoring our younger reader said perez who said wonder 
woman has soared out of a slump to become one of dcs top five 
sellers 
wonder woman is most definitely a feminist or a humanist in 
no uncertain terms he said her prime goal in life is to teach 
peaceful coexistence and equality 
other adult comics include omaha cat dancer which deals with 
malefemale relationships and the punisher about a vietnam 
veteran whose adventures address such contemporary issues as drugs 
and whitecollar crime on wall street 
comic books emerged in 1933 as an evolutionary offshoot of comic 
strips neatly reflecting the churnings of american popular culture 
in the mid1950s comic books were widely read for their 
detailed and energetic violence and often moralistic messages 
railing against war and racism but their very popularity 
frightened people and in a mccarthy era backlash comic books were 
accused of causing juvenile delinquency 
senate hearings were held the industry retreated and comic book 
publishers instituted selfcensorship with the comics code 
authority with comic books tamed their audience shrank 
comic books began to recover however in the 60s when products 
of the baby boom toddled off to college and found the superheros 
waiting for them 
like everything else that revival of mainstream fare also had 
its antiestablishment variety in underground comix with their 
stories about hippies longhaired motorcyclists and loose sex zap 
comics and the fabulous furry freak brothers were among the stars 
of the underground comix market 
the future computer scientists engineers defense analysts and 
psychologists who read those comic books still buy them but their 
tastes have aged 
todays comics readers expect more they expect depth of 
character said marc dolan who is earning a doctorate at harvard 
university in the history of american civilization and is a student 
of comics they want earthy realism like the way stephen king 
blends werewolves with burger king 
these grownup comic books can be read on two levels he said 
its sort of like huck finn you can have fun or you can say 
this thing is coming down the river and what does it mean 
comic books have eclipsed stamps coins and wine as collectible 
investments according to jerry weist a boston comic book 
collector and dealer for 28 years 
however while weist estimated the number of collectors today at 
around 250000 million he said few will make anywhere near the 
60000 fetched in the past year by a single mintcondition issue 
of the first marvel comics 
a lot of it has gotten out of hand he said collecting is 
risky stamps coins and wines have been around for three 
centuries and they will outlast comic books weist predicted that 
the cheap paper on which comics are printed will not allow them to 
last and in 50 or 75 years those precious early copies of superman 
and the others wont be worth holding on to 
the boston area is thick with stores that specialize in the 
higherpriced comic books than run from 75 cents to 15 and 
supplement newsstand offerings 
thats the story around the country said john davis a 
cofounder of capital city distribution in madison wis the 
countrys biggest comic book distributor carrying every one of the 
approximately 400 titles available 
davis said in a telephone interview that the average comic book 
reader is a 20yearold male although about 20 percent of comic 
book fans are older he estimates there are just half a million 
regular readers of comics about 5 percent of them female 
these are an example of the growing sophistication of comic 
books as an art form in the past five to 10 years davis said 
in a way that may be a result of the fact that the baby boom is 
growing older 
comics today are better than they ever have been comics have 
grown up

if it bombed in pretoria will it play in 
peoria paul slabolepszy hopes so 
at one theater in south africa the entire audience walked out 
on slabolepszys new antiapartheid film saturday night at the 
palace now hes looking for a more sympathetic crowd in the 
united states 
people couldnt take it slabolepszy said of the movies 
south african run its kind of like showing a movie of someone 
dying of lung cancer to an audience who are all heavy smokers its 
so real and so close 
the movie is based on a real event a rampage by two white men 
at a blackrun roadhouse on the outskirts of johannesburg it was 
made into a play that ran in south africa and europe 
slabolepszy 40 who wrote the successful play on which the film 
is based plays vince a white racist who winds up at a diner late 
one night with his nerd of a roommate forsie the black manager of 
the roadhouse played by tony awardwinning actor john kani is 
just closing up for the night 
forsie wants only to use the telephone but vince demands that 
the manager whose name is september reopen for business in a 
scene that encompasses the last half of the movie an increasingly 
ugly confrontation pits the characters in shifting allegiances 
against one another 
the movie produced and directed by south african robert davies 
is a catharsis of sorts for slabolepszy who based vinces 
character loud abusive violent on some of the people with 
whom he grew up in a small south african town the son of polish 
immigrants he moved to south africa when he was 3 years old 
i grew up in a kind of white racist area the attitudes were 
very deep he said in a recent interview and when i went to 
college university of cape town i was studying alongside 
blacks and meeting them socially and it was a stunning 
transformation because all of the prejudices id grown up with 
suddenly melted away and i realized id been living in the middle 
of this kind of lie 
i cant watch the movie he said i just slide down in my 
seat and im praying for someone to get rid of this guy vince 
its just too much it assaults and assaults and assaults but in 
a way its a story that has to be told 
at one point in the film vince the unemployed roustabout 
delivers a monologue that frames the movies political message 
enraged at the stubborn gentility of september he roars 
whos he to be in charge of a roadhouse when im out of work 
everywhere you go all you see is black faces bus drivers bank 
tellers bloody threepiece suits man 
apartheid says slabolepszy comes from the soul of that kind 
of character it comes from fear its a fear of being swamped 
this character vince has i think the central line of the 
film when he says my old man said if you let a black man get 
the better of you thats the end youre finished theres no 
going back thats his belief 
this is a heady time for slabolepszy and others in south 
africas artistic community a series of hit plays have emerged 
from johannesburg master harold and the boys 
sarafina woza albert among others south african music 
has become an international rage and there is an emergence of black 
south african art and literature 
history is happening said slabolepszy who yearns to 
someday make a picture of hope perhaps he muses there will 
be a happy accident in south africa in the meantime he finds 
his drama in turmoil

women who come to have babies because the infants automatically

in the search for stock saboteurs and 
bearmarket villains hiding in the aftermath of the october crash 
a new group of suspects has emerged the short sellers investors 
who bet money that prices will drop 
the securities and exchange commission and new york stock 
exchange have quietly been probing allegations that improper short 
selling may have contributed to the crash though evidence of 
wrongdoing hasnt yet emerged 
the national association of securities dealers which runs the 
overthecounter market is considering whether to implement 
restrictions on short selling 
in addition several companies have raised a postcrash clamor 
about alleged manipulation of their stock by users of the trading 
tactic the head of one such company urgent care health systems 
inc is cosponsoring a conference monday on short selling titled 
is anyone really safe 
short selling in itself isnt a crime in theory short sellers 
sell borrowed stock they believe is overvalued on the hunch the 
price will decline potential profits can be immense 
for example if a short seller borrows 100 shares at 1 a share 
and sells them he earns 100 and uses the money as collateral for 
the borrowed shares if the stock drops to 50 cents a share the 
short seller buys 100 shares returns the borrowed stock and 
pockets 50 
defenders of short selling argue that it injects liquidity into 
the market and helps all investors more accurately determine 
whether a touted stock is worth buying or not 
selling short enables market participants to adjust positions 
and causes stock to be more responsive said peter j dapuzzo 
head of retail equities at shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
i think short selling has a lot of positive attributes 
critics say short selling can be disastrous to fledgling 
companies trying to raise capital especially in the postcrash 
environment when so many investors already are avoiding the stock 
market 
theres nothing illegal about selling short if you think a 
company is going to be in decline whats bad is when people 
deliberately circulate adverse information that may be false for 
the purpose of causing a stock to go down said aa sommer a 
former sec commissioner and securities lawyer in the washington 
dc law firm of morgan lewis amp bockius 
foes of short selling often recall how the strategy was widely 
abused after crash of 1929 when it played a central role in the 
bear raids in which speculators would relentlessly gang up on a 
target company spreading lies about it to drive down the stock 
price 
such abuses led the nyse to implement the shortsale rule also 
known as the uptick rule which theoretically prevents short 
sellers from mercilessly depressing a stock price 
under the rule a short sale may be executed only if the 
previous sale moved the stock up at least point or one tick 
but there are strategies for sidestepping this rule and a debate 
has intensified on whether it works 
moreover the stocks most susceptible to shortselling assaults 
havent been protected by the uptick rule since they are usually 
small overthecounter issues such as upstart hightechnology or 
research concerns 
these stocks soared in value in the 198287 bull market and 
became visible targets for short sellers 
in the case of occupational urgent health care systems for 
example founder james cameron has contended that short sellers 
tried to destroy his company by spreading vicious rumors about its 
management 
the stock of carrington laboratories a drug firm working on a 
substance that could advance treatment for aids sank after false 
rumors surfaced that the company was prohibited from testing in the 
united states carringtons management claims short sellers spread 
the rumors 
still many investment professionals believe the argument 
against short selling isnt persuasive and that further regulation 
would make us stock markets less attractive 
were not going to try to defend anybody who lies about a 
company to knock its stock down thats wrong said michael 
murphy a shortselling strategist who publishes the overpriced 
stock service newsletter but 98 percent of the effort in the 
securities business is aimed at touting stocks theres far far 
more lying pushing stocks up then pushing them down 
the real effect of short sellers murphy argues is to expose 
companies that have serious deficiencies 
people say short selling is unamerican but its the reason 
america has the best capital market in the world murphy said 
you need to get a lot of opinions into the market

there is something so sad about the rows of 
graves freshly cut into the bright green grass 
something so wrong about magnolias coming alive in these days of 
mourning spring is a time of rebirth and renewal 
a week ago the children of radcliff were planning their 
summers playing ball practicing the trumpet but these have been 
seven days of sorrow each day tears and one question with no 
answer why 
most of the children many of them classmates were buried in 
the warming soil this past week seven days after their church bus 
was hit headon by a pickup truck heading the wrong way on the 
interstate highway 
the pickup driver who police said was drunk has been charged 
with 27 counts of murder one for each of 24 children and three 
adults 
it was one of the nations worst bus crashes and every parents 
worst nightmare in this army town next to fort knox these have 
been seven days in which faith has been tested dreams destroyed 
and pain endured 
the shock really hasnt worn off said the rev dan 
mattingly of the first assembly of god which lost 13 members 
its going to take a long long time to heal the hurt 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it began as a journey home the end of a days outing at kings 
island amusement park near cincinnati 
it ended in the still of the night may 14 on interstate 71 
at 1055 pm the bus was near carrollton 100 miles from home 
heading south when it was rammed by the pickup driven by larry 
mahoney traveling north on the wrong side of the road tests 
showed his bloodalcohol level was 2 times the legal limit 
the collision ruptured the bus gas tank turning the front of 
the vehicle into a smoky fireball screaming panicked children 
piled on top of each other in their struggle to escape 
with 67 people inside the front door blocked by flames and just 
one working door in back dozens were trapped many were saved 
joshua conyers 14 died a hero pushing his critically burned 
brother aaron 13 out a window 
he loved his family and his little brother recalled martha 
tennison wife of the pastor of the first assembly of god 
by the time trooper jim mudd arrived half an hour later 
helicopters had ferried some of the injured to louisville about 50 
miles away 
there was quietness somberness he recalled there was 
smoke the heavy stench of death from the remains 
being a father and a parent he said it hurts so much 
more when you see young people teenagers so many of them dead at 
one particular scene

for the 27 dead the trip home finally ended three days later in 
a procession of gray hearses from carrollton traveling the same 
route the bus would have taken at the accident site someone has 
since placed a cross of pink plastic flowers 
the grim task of identification took two days dental records 
were used for most clothing shoes and jewelry for others 
most bodies were taken to the radcliff area others went to 
missouri florida colorado and tennessee 
it took nearly four hours for all the hearses to leave 
departures were staggered to ease the pain 
the idea of seeing a bunch of hearses in front of the funeral 
home we thought would be devastating to the community said 
aaron smith a lexington funeral director who helped out 
i cannot identify with those families he said softly i 
have not lost a child it is normal for them to start thinking 
about their children burying them in 40 or 50 years they are 
suddenly having to bury their own children how can anybody 
deal with it

fort knox where a 24hour crisis phone line was set up 
seventeen of those killed had some link to the army post a 
sergeant lost his entire family his wife a childhood sweetheart 
and his two daughters 
if youre in the army the job is to do a soldiers work 
said maj john eagles a spokesman that might include getting 
killed but the children have been killed everything youve 
trained for all that is out the window 
every day people ask why a question with no answer 
theyre confused said the rev danny glover who counseled 
students at one middle school they want to know why god let that 
happen 
there is anger too he said at the same time that anger is 
mixed with a feeling of pity for the driver human justice will 
never be able to do anything worse than having him live with the 
memory of what happened

ministers from leading industrialized countries 
have set the stage for what some said would be a crucial yearend 
showdown over a us call for ending public subsidies to the 
worlds farmers 
after two days of talks on trade and other world economic 
issues the ministers agreed thursday to work for tangible 
progress in liberalizing global trade in agriculture and other 
fields 
liberalizing the rules of trade generally is considered a 
crucial step for ensuring the longterm health of the world 
economy a key aim is to suppress tendencies by some nations 
including the united states to shield domestic industries from 
foreign competition 
the paris meeting brought together trade and finance ministers 
from the 24 members of the organization for economic cooperation 
and development 
the ministers said they would try by december to agree on a 
framework approach to the trade negotiations which were 
launched in september 1986 under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
the 96nation gatt which sets and monitors world trade rules 
has scheduled a december ministerial meeting in montreal to review 
progress in the talks 
us treasury secretary james a baker iii said the december 
meeting must produce agreement on the longterm goal of the farm 
trade talks as well as a road map and timetable for reaching 
that goal 
all major industrial countries agree that government subisidies 
to farmers have grown too large but they dont agree on how to 
correct the problem 
geoffrey howe the british foreign secretary told thursdays 
meeting that all industrialized countries are guilty of excessive 
aid to farmers 
we are all milking our taxpayers to forcefeed our cows 
paying huge subsidies to make two blades of wheat grow where one is 
more than enough he said 
new zealands finance minister roger douglas said government 
aid to farming in britain france west germany and italy alone was 
costing them 3 million jobs equivalent to the entire population 
of new zealand 
a main sticking point in the gatt farm negotiations is european 
resistance to a us proposal for phasing out all tradedistorting 
farm subsidies by the end of the century 
willy de clercq the european economic communitys top trade 
official said the eec or common market would never agree to 
eliminate such subsidies although it favors unspecified reductions 
the eec believes some government aid is needed to protect 
farmers incomes and to keep enough people living in rural areas 
clayton yeutter the us special trade representative 
acknowledged differences in the us and european approaches but 
said officials from both sides of the atlantic were basically on 
the same wavelength 
he added that the montreal meeting would be difficult if de 
clercq did not agree with the us view that the december talks 
should produce tangible results on farm policy reform 
austrialian foreign minister bill hayden said the december 
meeting would be crucial to the prospects for success in the gatt 
trade talks which are expected to last at least until 1990 
if there are no constructive results in montreal there could 
be a great loss of confidence among the participating 
governments he said 
officials from other countries sought to play down the 
differences 
the paris meeting found some middle ground that all sides can 
live with said michael wilson canadas finance minister 
were setting ourselves clear objectives for the next few 
months

facing an apparent trend toward unified standards 
among computer giants a boston attorney is seeking to organize a 
nationwide coalition representing up to 20000 corporate computer 
users to call attention to their needs 
peter marx head counsel for a group of customers of data 
general corp said he plans a meeting monday in boston with 
representatives of at least a dozen similar groups connected to 
other computer firms including international business machines 
corp digital equipment corp and ncr corp 
the proposed coalition of user groups would establish a stronger 
voice and greater clout for users concerning development of new 
software systems said marx it also would serve as a liaison 
between the computer users and the public and congress he said 
a user group is an umbrella organization composed of companies 
using the same type of computer system the members generally use 
the group to share information and express concerns to individual 
manufacturers 
you look at the articles written about the computer industry 
and there is hardly any mention of users and users are what it is 
all about said marx who also serves as counsel for the 
washington dcbased information industry association and 
chairman of the new england computer law forum in boston 
there is no voice now for the users there are some years of 
chaos ahead until this issue of a standard operating system is 
settled its time the users should be united 
on tuesday four american and three european computers announced 
formation of a joint 90 million project to create a software 
package modeled after the unix operating system by american 
telephone amp telegraph unix which controls the basic operation of 
a computer has been sought by nonatampt customers because it allows 
computers from different manufacturers to use the same programs 
if were moving in the direction of a standard then its 
vital we make our presence known said marx it would be too 
costly to have a system we cant live with leverage is important 
others agreeing to attend the monday meeting include 
representatives of the user groups for honeywell bull inc prime 
computer inc xerox corp and wang laboratories inc marx would 
not name the other user groups planning to attend the meeting 
several computer industry analysts question the feasibility of a 
nationwide coalition of user groups 
it would be noble cause but im pretty skeptical it could 
succeed because there are too many vested interests among the 
users said robert djurdjevic president of annex research inc 
in phoenix ariz 
on the other hand he said there is a strong need for the 
user to speak in unison rather than be led by vendor interest 
users have generally been meek and mild and nonconfrontational 
and this has actually hurt them right in the pocketbooks 
michael geran an analyst at nikko securities co international 
inc in new york said the push toward connectivity among different 
computer systems could unite users in the future but the variety 
of needs may pull apart the proposed coalition 
whats good for one user is not good for another at this 
point said geran it seems there are just too many 
applications and needs to unite the users

payless cashways inc says takeover strategist 
asher b edelman and his partners who control 76 percent of the 
building materials retailer and may make a takeover offer have 
nothing to contribute to this company 
edelman and sutherland lumbersouthwest inc of kansas city 
mo disclosed thursday they had bought about 256 million shares 
of payless the nations thirdlargest building materials retailer 
with about 3366 million shares outstanding kansas citybased 
payless has a market value of about 728 million based on 
thursdays closing price 
payless stock rose 137 a share to close at 2162 in new 
york stock exchange composite trading 
the edelmansutherland holdings were disclosed in a securities 
and exchange commission filing 
perry sutherland one of the family members who runs 
privatelyheld sutherland lumber said he had no comment on a block 
of 519000 shares of payless stock that was traded thursday if the 
block went to the investment group that would boost its stake to 
about 92 percent 
david stanley chairman and chief executive of payless said in 
a statement that in our view mr edelman and his group have 
nothing to contribute to this company or its shareholders nor do 
we believe the reported plan to dismantle the company serves any 
constructive purpose 
the edelman group said in its sec filing that it would consider 
selling payless operations as going concerns in many regions of 
the country 
sutherland called it a possibility that his company would 
acquire at least some of the payless operations that would be sold 
our expertise in management is part of the partnership with 
edelman he said 
payless has 194 retail facilities in 23 states and reported 1987 
revenue of 17 billion 
spokeswoman brenda nolte confirmed that the payless board of 
directors approved a complex shareholder rights plan last week to 
protect shareholders from attempts to acquire control of payless 
at an inadequate price 
nolte noted the board said the plan was intended to 
encourage buyers to negotiate with the board before attempting 
a takeover 
perry sutherland said his father has had a business relationship 
with edelman for several years he said dwight sutherland the 
companys chief executive officer serves on the boards of 
directors of united stockyards corp datapoint corp and intelogic 
trace inc along with edelman who has large investments in these 
companies 
edelman has launched unsuccessful takeover bids for a gamut of 
companies including lucky stores inc fruehauf corp and 
burlington industries inc earning millions in the process 
he acquired the restaurant chain ponderosa inc but is believed 
to have made no profit when he sold it 
national home center news an industry trade publication 
recently ranked payless the thirdlargest building materials and 
doityourself retailer in the nation 
the magazine ranked sutherland lumber ninth with estimated 
annual revenue of about 650 million sutherland lumbers 86 stores 
are concentrated in the midwest and south 
in an investment report last month sutro amp co noted payless 
had been considered a potential takeover target for three years 
sutro contended an acquirer could boost its earnings instantly by 
closing down a score of payless stores in the depressed oil patch 
region where sales were off 45 percent last year 
sutro also said pieces of payless such as its new england 
operation could be sold at substantial premiums after some 
paring an acquiror could still retain a major national presence in 
the industry through 125150 profitable welllocated stores

federal reserve chairman alan greenspans 
remarks strongly supporting program trading have prompted bear 
stearns amp co to reconsider its recent move to halt its use of the 
controversial strategy the firm says 
bear stearns one of several major wall street firms to reduce 
their program trading activity will reexamine its position in 
light of greenspans remarks and other factors alan greenberg 
bear stearns chairman and chief executive officer said thursday 
bear stearns went further than four other investment firms when 
it announced last week it would stop index arbitrage a major form 
of program trading not only for its own accounts but also for its 
customers 
salomon brothers inc morgan stanley amp co painewebber group 
inc and kidder peabody amp co halted index arbitrage for their own 
accounts amid concern that the popular form of program trading was 
at least partly responsible for the stock markets volatility 
greenspan testifying before the house telecommunications and 
finance subcommittee said thursday that excessive restriction of 
index arbitrage would limit market liquidity and tend to 
destabilize the market 
he said insufficient arbitrage between cash and futures can be 
a destabilizing force in a declining market 
in index arbitrage traders use computers to buy or sell baskets 
of stocks with offsetting trades in stockindex futures to help 
them profit from brief price discrepancies 
greenspan said that reduced arbitrage implies less connection 
between cash and futures markets and more price disparities across 
these markets 
he also said it is a mistake to single out one segment of the 
broad marketplace as the culprit for large and rapid price 
movements 
bear stearns greenberg said his firm had been monitoring 
closely the action and the liquidity problems of the stock market 
for the past week 
he also pointed to other firms suspension of index arbitrage 
activity for themselves but continuation of those activities for 
customers as further reason for the firm to reevaluate its 
position 
if we do decide to reenter index arbitrage we will consider 
limiting our activities to buying on a downtick and attempting to 
sell on an uptick in the stocks involved greenberg said in a 
statement

the new buoyancy in the longfloundering steel 
industry has eased downward pressure on bluecollar wages but 
companies will continue demanding costsaving changes in work 
rules companies and analysts say 
bethlehem steel corp chairman walter williams says a united 
steelworkers union representative told him recently that 1989 
will not be a concession year 
i guess with the industry looking better they have a right to 
say that williams told reporters during the american iron and 
steel institute annual meeting in washington 
even at ltv steel co which is reorganizing under chapter 11 of 
federal bankruptcy laws theres not been tremendous pressure 
from creditors to cut labor costs president david hoag said 
thursday 
those remarks and others could hearten usw members who retreated 
on wages benefits and featherbedding work rules in two rounds of 
bargaining since 1982 
contracts at the major producers are due for renegotiation 
beginning next year 
if we have a somewhat inflationary labor increase in the us 
i think the stock market would overlook it said securities 
analyst peter marcus of painewebber inc 
plant closings and automation have combined with contract 
givebacks to help cut labor costs for a ton of shipped steel from 
262 in 1982 to 160 last year that shift lessened the impact of 
wages on production costs 
also we have had fairly fearsome increases in wages abroad 
marcus said thursday during a panel discussion in korea last 
year they had a 23 percent wage increase and the korean won 
increased on the order of 10 percent 
analyst james rudolph of buckingham research group said that 
with no signs of rampant inflation wage increases would not 
necessarily hurt steel companies which are enjoying a recovery of 
uncertain duration after five years of devastating losses 
peter anker of first boston corp was more concerned about wage 
hikes and encouraged managers to offer stock or a share of profits 
to workers instead of just another escalation of wage costs 
willaims said he hopes usw negotiators realize were not out 
of the woods yet 
he stressed the need for further work rule changes that would 
foster more efficient job combinations reduce idle time and 
allow greater flexibiliy in job assignments 
williams said each job eliminated through work rule changes 
saves as much as a 10 percent cut in labor costs for 15 workers 
labor costs including wages benefits unemployment insurance 
pension payments and other costs peaked for bluecollar steel 
workers in 1982 at 2629 per hour and declined to an average of 
2370 last year according to the aisi 
bluecollar employment fell from about 190000 in 1982 to 
121000 in 1987

the investor group waging a 17 billion 
hostile takeover offer for koppers co says it controls or has been 
tendered more than threequarters of the companys outstanding 
common shares 
the group led by the british construction company beazer plc and 
the investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc stated thursday 
that about 732 percent of outstanding common shares and about 687 
percent of outstanding preferred shares had been tendered as of 
wednesday under its 60 a share tender offer 
the group also extended its tender offer through midnight edt 
wednesday 
the common shares tendered together with 21 million common 
shares already owned by related entities represent about 752 
percent of the outstanding common shares the beazer group 
indicated 
the group must acquire 85 percent of koppers shares in order to 
complete the deal under the antitakeover law in delaware where 
koppers is incorporated 
right now the group may not purchase koppers shares under 
terms of federal court injunctions in pittsburgh and los angeles 
it appealed the los angeles ruling to the 9th us circuit court 
of appeals in san francisco but a decision has not been announced 
also thursday us district judge maurice cohill said he would 
hold a hearing may 31 on the question of whether the hostile bid 
violates federal securities rules 
the hearing specifically will address whether the 540 million 
of preferred securities that the group plans to issue to shearson 
in return for 540 million of its financing should be considered 
stock or debt 
cohill said the tender offer as currently structured must be 
permanently enjoined if the stock in question is found to be a debt 
security if that is the case the beazer group could restructure 
the financing to comply with regulations

amfac incs proposed 8077 million 
leveraged buyout apparently was a move to stave off a takeover 
threat by castle amp cooke inc which is seeking to sharply raise 
its stake in the company analysts say 
los angelesbased castle amp cooke on thursday raised its holdings 
in amfac to 73 percent from 49 percent and said it had received 
federal clearance to buy up to 15 percent of amfacs roughly 172 
million outstanding common shares 
castle amp cooke chairman david h murdock owns another 26 
percent share of amfac according to documents filed with the 
securities and exchange commission 
amfac management proposed its 41 a share buyout offer on 
wednesday to the companys board of directors 
the companys stock soared 675 to 4512 a share thursday on 
the new york stock exchange indicating speculation a higher offer 
would emerge castle amp cooke stock closed at 2475 up 50 cents a 
share 
the buyout would be led by amfac president and chief executive 
officer richard l griffith who has said it would strengthen the 
companys ability to develop amfacs hawaii asset base in a paced 
and profitable manner 
amfac is a diversified services company with main lines of 
business in food processing hotels and resorts retail 
agriculture and property it had revenue of 22 billion last year 
castle amp cooke has operations in food production through its 
dole food company the worlds biggest pineapple producer 
transportation equipment leasing and real estate development 
san franciscobased amfac is hawaiis largest landowner while 
castle amp cooke is no 2 
murdock who has made his reputation by buying and turning 
around failing companies met with amfac officials in january to 
talk over a real estate venture amfac did not pursue the 
securities and exchange filing said 
amfac said murdock proposed merging some of his property into 
amfac in exchange for amfac stock 
securities analyst kevin skislock of rotan mosle inc in 
houston said murdocks aim is to control amfacs 56400 acres of 
hawaiian real estate and amfacs buyout offer is an attempt to 
prevent such a move 
analyst randy havre of jb havre securities inc in honolulu 
said amfacs valuable hawaiian land made the 41ashare buyout 
offer too cheap 
my feeling is that shareholders should not tender for less 
than 50 havre said hawaiian real estate is a hot commodity 
analyst charles bureker of sutro amp co inc in san francisco 
said there has been speculation that murdock might be working with 
japanese investors to gain control of amfacs real estate

stock market crashes similar to last octobers 
could happen again even if market procedures are changed say the 
toplevel federal officials who produced a white house study of the 
nations financial markets 
the officials told the house telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee thursday that their proposals for changing some market 
procedures could do little about external factors that influence 
investors 
their report is being criticized by lawmakers for its lack of 
significant recommendations 
we cannot provide an ironclad guarantee that there will not be 
another oct 19 in our future said federal reserve board 
chairman alan greenspan one of the reports authors unforeseen 
economic forces could on their own conceivably trigger such an 
event 
the white house report released monday focused on the record 
508point drop in the dow jones industrial average of last oct 19 
and the unusually large price swings that have occurred repeatedly 
ever since the report was written by greenspan treasury 
undersecretary george d gould securities and exchange commission 
chairman david s ruder and commodity futures trading commission 
chairwoman wendy gramm 
the officials recommended instituting a circuit breaker that 
would temporarily halt trading on the nations stock futures and 
options exchanges in case the dow jones industrial average dropped 
by 250 points in a single day that has happened only once last 
oct 19 
the report also urged that improvements be made in the credit 
clearing and settlement procedures the markets use to complete 
transactions 
but the working group suggested no limitations on computerized 
program trading some forms of which have been blamed for adding to 
market volatility it also failed to agree on whether to change the 
margins or upfront payments required for futures transactions 
margin requirements are lower on futures exchanges than for stock 
markets which critics say causes speculation 
the group ignored as well a recommendation made by an earlier 
white house panel headed by nicholas f brady an investment 
banker that the fed or some other agency oversee issues that 
affect all markets 
the working groups members have cautioned that it would be 
unrealistic to take steps such as curbing program trading 
we cannot go back to the days of the abacus or mechanical 
adding machines gould said 
lawmakers however accused the report of not going far enough 
to ease volatility and soothe worried investors 
it is you and your panel who continue to embrace anachronistic 
regulatory reforms that have been outstripped by new 
technologies said the subcommittee chairman rep edward markey 
dmass 
further criticism came from rep john dingell dmich chairman 
of the house energy and commerce committee of which the finance 
subcommittee is a part he accused the working group of having 
given birth to a mouse and of failing to take steps to restore 
investors confidence 
you should not come by my office when people start buying rope 
and heating pots of tar and collecting feathers to apply to persons 
who have sat idly by while the financial situation of this 
nation erodes dingell said 
the subcommittee has been holding hearings on the markets 
problems for months but so far has written no legislation asked 
outside the hearing room when a bill would emerge dingell said 
as soon as circumstances permit

the us labor department has asked the justice 
department to consider criminal prosecution of unocal corp and its 
executives for a 1984 refinery explosion in south suburban lemont 
that killed 17 people 
the labor department made its request thursday following a 
finding by an administrative judge that unocal then called union 
oil co violated federal health and safety regulations overseen by 
the ocupational safety and health administration 
unocal is appealing osha citations and the administrative 
finding to the us court of appeals in chicago 
while it does the company faces the prospect that it and 
individual employees could be found in criminal violation of 
federal safety regulations 
osha has the right to seek criminal prosecution for such 
violations but rarely has done so during the reagan 
administration according to the national safe workplace institute 
osha found that unocal violations included inadequate 
inspections for cracks in a pressure tank that exploded as well as 
poor training for its fire brigade 
in addition to the 17 killed the july 23 1984 explosion

a new allnatural orange juice has been introduced 
in new england to challenge tropicana products incs domination of 
the estimated 16 billion readytoserve orange juice industry 
the minute maid premium choice which contains no additives 
marks houstonbased cocacola foods entry into the 
notfromconcentrate orange juice market which surpassed frozen 
juice in sales in 1986 
vice president of marketing george g woody iii would not 
comment on when the product may be sold in other sections of the 
country it will be available in about 1200 new england stores 
woody said growth in the orange juice market contributed to the 
decision to challenge tropicana which has a virtual lock on 
allnatural orange juice sales 
we consider ourselves the leaders in total orange juice sales 
and this is one segment of the market where we looked to expand 
said woody on thursday 
woody said new england was chosen for the introduction due to 
strong allnatural juice sales which represent less than 20 
percent of the total readytoserve orange juice sales 
since 1979 orange juice sales in the united states have 
increased by 23 percent with most growth in the chilled 
readytoserve market cocacola foods reported 
per capita consumption of juice in 1987 was 61 gallons down 
from a peak of 78 gallons in 1983 according to clevelandbased 
beverage industry magazine 
chilled readytoserve orange juice accounted for 57 percent of 
total orange juice sales of about 28 billion last year 
cocacola foods a division of the cocacola co in atlanta 
reported sales of approximately 12 billion last year the 
division also produces hic fruit juices and bacardi cocktail 
mixers 
tropicana a subsidiary of beatrice cos inc is ranked second 
by most industry publications but the floridabased company does 
not release sales figures

consumer prices rose 04 percent in april only marginally 
better than marchs 05 percent gain the government reported today 
more than onefourth of the april rise came from a steep 20 
percent jump in clothing costs tying march for the greatest 
onemonth gain since price records were first kept in 1947 
grocery prices climbed at their fastest pace in 20 months while 
energy prices were up sharply as well reflecting the steepest 
rise in gasoline prices since august 
the april gain meant that for the first four months of 1988 
retail prices were up at an annual rate of 45 percent 
while this was little changed from the 44 percent for all of 
1987 economists were concerned because much of the inflationary 
pressure has shown up in the last two months analysts noted that 
the march rise had been the most severe since january 1987 
on thursday investors set aside worries about inflation long 
enough to help the stock and bond markets break their recent slides 
a number of senators meanwhile have reaffirmed the 
governments pledge to stand behind deposits in the nations 
savings and loan institutions after a congressional agency reported 
the doubling of the deficit in the federal sampl insurance fund 
there is absolutely no doubt the us congress stands behind 
our deposit insurance program banking committee chairman william 
proxmire dwis said at a hearing thursday by his panel 
on wall street stock prices staged a partial recovery thursday 
that traders attributed to bargain shopping and lessening of 
recent tension over inflation 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which fell a total of 
5654 points tuesday and wednesday rose 763 to 195872 broader 
market gauges were mixed 
bond prices advanced after falling in the first three sessions 
this week the price of the bellwether 30year treasury bond rose 
nearly 250 for every 1000 in face value as its yield slipped to 
927 percent from 929 percent late wednesday 
in the report on thrifts frederick d wolf director of the 
accounting and financial management division of the general 
accounting office said the liabilities of the federal savings and 
loan insurance corp exceeded its assets by 137 billion at the 
end of 1987 up from 63 billion a year earlier 
he also said the money available to the insurance fund 28 
billion over the next 10 years probably will not be adequate 
to restore the industrys health by closing or merging 505 
institutions listed as insolvent 
wolf estimated it would cost 30 billion to 35 billion to clean 
up the sampl mess which is centered primarily in southwestern states 
hard hit by depressed real estate and oil markets that estimate 
does not include an additional 435 barely solvent institutions 
he said 
in other economic developments thursday 
the two broadest measures of the nations money supply rose in 
early may while a narrower measure fell the federal reserve board 
reported 
the nations 24 largest investorowned utilities charged their 
commercial and industrial electric users an average 628 cents per 
kilowatthour over the 12 months ended april 30 down from 629 
cents a year earlier a study by the consulting firm national 
utility service inc said 
assets of the nations 425 money market mutual funds rose 370

consumer prices rose 04 percent in april as 
clothing costs gained for the second straight month and grocery 
prices climbed at their fastest pace in 20 months the government 
said today 
energy prices were up sharply as well reflecting the steepest 
rise in gasoline prices since august 
the overall gain only marginally better than marchs 05 
percent gain meant that for the first four months of 1988 retail 
prices were up at an annual rate of 45 percent 
while this was little changed from the 44 percent for all of 
1987 economists were concerned because much of the inflationary 
pressure has shown up in the last two months 
analysts noted that the march rise had been the most severe 
since january 1987 last months 04 percent overall gain was 
equivalent to an annual inflation rate of 53 percent 
the general message in this report is that prices have been 
rising in the past two months at a faster pace and they will 
continue to do so said bruce steinberg an economist with 
merrill lynch the fears that people have had about higher 
inflation are justified 
steinberg said that the underlying inflation rate is now 
somewhere around 5 percent about 1 percentage point higher than it 
has been for the last year 
the stock market which had fallen sharply on tuesday and 
wednesday because of worries about inflation and interest rates 
took todays report in stride with the dow jones industrial 
average edging up slightly in early trading 
analysts said the overall gain did not prompt a new selloff 
because the report was in line with expectations but they 
cautioned that financial markets remain edgy about the building 
inflationary pressures 
more than onefourth of the april gain in consumer prices came 
from a steep 20 percent jump in clothing costs tying march for 
the greatest onemonth gain since price records were first kept in 
1947 
as was the case with march analysts said the more expensive 
clothing was chiefly the result of higher priced womens clothing 
lines 
grocery store prices rose 08 percent in april the biggest 
advance since august 1986 leading the way were sharply higher 
prices for beef up 23 percent fish up 29 percent and fruits 
and vegetables up 14 percent 
gasoline prices climbed 11 percent last month after a 04 
percent march rise last months jump was the steepest since a 33 
percent rise in august after that gasoline prices had fallen for 
six straight months 
the gasoline price increases over the last two months largely 
reflected concern that the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries would agree with nonmember nations to limit production 
but those talks ended in failure and world oil prices have since 
fallen substantially leading analysts to believe that retail 
prices will soon turn downward 
the department gave these other specifics on april retail price 
activity 
the record gain in clothing costs reflected an average 35 
percent gain in the prices of womens apparel a 27 percent rise 
in the prices for childrens goods and a 21 percent jump in mens 
clothing costs 
new car prices were unchanged while automobile financing costs 
fell by 11 percent 
public transportation expenses reflecting a jump in airline 
fares rose 08 percent 
home heating oil prices rose 09 percent while natural gas and 
electricity costs rose 04 percent 
the april increase left the overall index at 1171 meaning that 
a hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 during a 198284 
base period would have cost 11710 last month unlike the other 
figures in the report the overall index is not adjusted for 
seasonal fluctuations 
fears of inflation have stirred up financial markets in recent 
days and economists 
stocks barely broke a twoday losing streak thursday after 
worries about inflation and rising interest rates pushed the dow 
jones industrial average down sharply tuesday and wednesday 
investors have viewed with some alarm a string of seemingly good 
economic reports in recent weeks unemployment in april fell to a 
14yearlow of 54 percent while the factory operating rate climbed 
to an eightyearhigh of 827 percent 
while evidence of betterthanexpected economic activity the 
reports also 
raised fears in financial markets that the economy is growing 
too strongly and soon tight labor markets and high factory 
operating rates will translate into higher wages and rising prices 
the reagan administration maintained that the concerns about 
inflation have been overblown treasury secretary james a baker 
iii told reporters thursday that the administration saw no reason 
to change its forecast that consumer prices would rise by 43 
percent this year in 1987 consumer prices climbed 44 percent 
private economists are in general agreement with the 
administrations forecast contending that the inflation worries 
exhibited by the market would subside once the impact of a spike in 
oil prices abates 
the markets discovered inflation and now they are overdoing 
it said donald ratajczak director of the economic forecasting 
project at georgia state university inflation is going to rise 
but i dont see it going above 5 percent even next year 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he 
was not looking for inflation to get above 45 percent this year 
because of the actions already taken by the federal reserve 
twice in the past two months the fed has tightened up on credit 
conditions and pushed interest rates higher in an effort to dampen 
economic demand 
the fed has tightened and it will tighten more and that will 
keep inflation in check evans predicted

a tentative contract settlement between the 
united rubber workers and goodyear tire amp rubber co has been 
approved by four of the five union locals that have voted on the 
pact a union spokesman said today 
voting by the remaining six locals continues through monday the 
union represents 15000 workers at 11 goodyear plants nationwide 
meanwhile a walkout by 4700 firestone inc union workers in 
six states continues for a sixth day with no contract talks planned 
urw workers in union city tenn marysville ohio and topeka 
kan voted in favor of the proposed goodyear contract on thursday 
and workers in sun prairie wis approved it today said urw 
spokesman curt brown said 
workers in madisonsville ky rejected the offer thursday he 
said 
with the approval by union city the proposal appears headed for 
ratification nationwide under urw bylaws ratification must be 
made by a majority of the locals representing a majority of the 
membership 
an earlier tentative agreement with goodyear was rejected and 
union city with about 2500 members was one of the pivotal locals 
because of its size 
if the voting by the remaining locals follows the first 
ratification vote the threeyear pact would be approved 
it would appear that the improvements made to the contract 
during the negotiations session may 17 turned around the vote in 
union city tennessee and satisfied their needs and their 
concerns said brown 
firestone workers in six states went on strike sunday after 
union negotiators rejected firestones offer saying it didnt

bond prices slipped in light dealings this 
morning as inflation worries continued to weigh on the market 
despite a new government report that consumer prices rose only 
modestly in april 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond edged down point or 
about 125 for every 1000 in face value by midday as its yield 
rose to 929 percent from 927 percent late thursday 
as trading got underway today the government said consumer 
prices rose 04 percent in april compared with a 05 percent rise 
in march 
while low inflation is usually seen as good news for bond 
investors the report failed to inspire any buying in todays 
market 
that was partly because the size of the increase had been widely 
expected and partly because investors remain fearful that the 
economy is growing so quickly that inflation may eventually 
accelerate analysts said 
william v sullivan jr director of money market research at 
dean witter reynolds inc said the reaction is the hallmark of a 
bear market 
there is some good news in the april statistics that should 
allay concerns that inflation is accelerating and the market 
ignores that it gravitates to bad news he said 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments slipped 132 point intermediate maturities fell 332 
point and 20year issues were off 932 point according to telerate 
inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer was off 007 at 10868 the shearson lehman hutton 
daily treasury bond index which makes a similar measurement fell 
095 to 113711 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer was up 002 at 27466 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose 10 basis points to 
624 percent a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
sixmonth bills rose 5 basis points to 660 percent and oneyear 
bills rose 4 basis points at 695 percent 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks traded at 7 percent up from 6 1516 percent late thursday

nova pharmaceutical corp has agreed to a joint 
venture with smithkline beckman corp to develop and market a 
variety of painkilling and central nervous system drugs pending 
approval from both firms boards baltimorebased nova announced 
the preliminary agreement estimated to be worth 725 million 
to nova eventually will give philadelphiabased smithkline an 
estimated 20 percent stake in nova which was founded in 1982 
the two firms would be advancing work on a range of drugs nova 
has developed including a class of painkillers targeted at 
bradykinin which nova and the johns hopkins medical institutions 
report plays a key role in relaying pain messages to the nervous 
system the findings were reported in the current issue of the 
proceedings of the national academy of science 
this is quite significant for nova arda m minocherhomjee 
a healthcare analyst with cable howse amp ragen inc in seattle 
said of the joint venture it gives them access to an excellent 
marketing partner and furthermore it gives them the capital 
needed to develop their products 
after the agreement was announced thursday novas stock closed 
unchanged in overthecounter trading at 825 a share 
nova cut a very attractive deal as far as theyre concerned 
said david m bartash pharmaceutical analyst with dean witter 
reynolds in new york its very good and they get smithkline to 
carry some of the development costs 
you need to raise the funds when you dont need them said 
dr hans mueller president and chief executive of nova which 
analysts estimate had 24 million in cash and more than 15 
million in available funds as of march 31 more than enough to 
finance its research and development expenses this year 
for the first quarter ended march 31 the company lost 14 
million compared with a loss of 2 million a year ago revenues 
increased to 41 million from 16 million 
nova received food and drug administration approval in january 
to start clinical testing on an analgesic that blocks the 
transmission of bradykinins a powerful painproducing substance in 
the body 
the company is conducting clinical trials on a nasal spray form 
of the drug to block symptoms of the common cold and plans to seek 
fda approval to test the drugs effectiveness in relieving 
inflammation and blocking burn pain 
analysts estimate that the potential annual market for the 
analgesic could easily top 100 million three or four years after 
it is released 
nova also is developing compounds to treat central nervous 
system disorders including epilepsy parkinsons disease and 
huntingtons chorea 
under the terms of the agreement nova and smithkline would form 
separate partnerships to develop and market the painkillers and the 
central nervous system products 
as part of the latter agreement smithkline would make an 
immediate cash payment of 25 million to nova in return for 27 
million newly issued common shares and warrants to purchase 775000 
shares of smithkline at 928 a share 
smithkline has also agreed to purchase by december 1991 24 
million worth of nova common stock and warrants to purchase an 
undisclosed number of shares at 15 percent above market price at 
the time of the purchase 
the partnership which is to be 60 percent owned by smithkline 
would receive the right to license smithklines psychiatric drugs 
including thorazine and stelazine which currently account for 
about 40 million in annual revenues once the first central 
nervous system product was marketed 
the analgesics partnership calls for smithkline to pay an 
initial 1 million and assume 215 million of debt primarily to 
commercialize the painkiller smithkline would manufacture it and 
obtain exclusive worldwide marketing rights while nova would 
retain a 50 percent share of control over that partnership and half 
the profits obtained from product sales 
we fully expect to take a leadership role in the evolving 
field of neurobiology henry wendt smithklines chairman and 
chief executive said in a prepared statement novas exciting 
research projects together with our drug development and marketing 
capability makes a powerful combination

the british government is considering selling off 
british rail the national railroad system the economist magazine 
reported in its latest issue 
the plan is being worked on by a policy unit within prime 
minister margaret thatchers office the magazine said in its may 
21 issue which was made available friday 
spokesmen for the prime minister british rail and the 
department of transport said friday they were unaware of any plans 
for the privatization of the railway 
a report in londons evening standard however said the prime 
ministers office confirmed that a study of the state companys 
privatization is in progress but stressed that it was at an early 
stage 
the economist said three options are being explored the first 
is selling the entire network as a going concern but that would be 
made difficult by british rails current troubled financial state 
which requires government subsidies for operation 
a second option calls for splitting british rail into regional 
companies the magazine said this option is under study by greg 
bourne a special adviser in the prime ministers policy unit 
bourne declined to answer questions about the reports 
the third option would be to form a track authority which 
would put operation of british rails track and signaling hardware 
up for private bidding the magazine said 
the economist said plans for a splitup of british rail into 
regional companies are also being studied by the center for policy 
studies a private think tank which will publish its conclusions 
next month 
mrs thatchers government has sold off billions of pounds worth 
of state assets including british telecom plc the phone company 
british gas plc and british airways plc since she came into power 
in 1979 
it currently is in the process of preparing the sale of the 
electicity industry of england and wales

twenty years after public service company 
of new hampshire announced it would build it own atomic reactor 
the illfated seabrook project has become a symbol for the problems 
that extinguished many of americas grandest hopes for nuclear 
power 
public service is the first major public power company to seek 
refuge from its creditors in bankruptcy court and there remains no 
assurance that seabrook its pricetag now at 54 billion and 
rising 50 million a month ever will clear evacuationplanning 
hurdles and generate electricity 
spokesman nicholas ashooh conceded this week that with the 
benefit of hindsight public service would have followed a 
different course if the decision to build were being made again 
but thats irrelevant ashooh said the bigger question 
is how can we have a regulatory system that after 20 years cannot 
make a decision on a major power project 
public service narrowly averted bankruptcy in 1984 completing a 
425 million bond sale that was the largest financing in utility 
industry history but nuclear disasters first at pennsylvanias 
three mile island in 1979 and then at chernobyl in the soviet union 
in 1986 dealt seabrook a devastating blow 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis now the likely 1988 
democratic presidential nominee cited chernobyl when he decided to 
oppose evacuation planning for massachusetts communities near 
seabrook dukakis has since become a key obstacle though new 
hampshires evacuation plans also still lack final approval 
the environment surrounding nuclear power in may 1968 and public 
services early experiences with it gave little clue of the 
troubles that lay ahead 
a byproduct of research that produced the atomic bomb during 
world war ii nuclear power in the 1940s and 1950s was seen by many 
as the key to the worlds future christopher flavin of the 
worldwatch institute wrote in his 1983 report nuclear power the 
market test 
it would supply infinite amounts of energy indefinitely and 
remove many of the constraints under which humanity had struggled 
for millennia flavin wrote 
another early claim by nuclear proponents was that it would 
provide energy too cheap to meter energy from new englands first 
nuclear plant yankee rowe in rowe mass wasnt too cheap to 
meter but it was only pennies per kilowatthour cheaper than 
other alternatives at the time 
public service owned 7 percent of yankee rowe which cost 44 
million to build and began operation in 1960 as one of a halfdozen 
prototype reactors nationwide funded by the us government by 
1968 public service also had investments in other nuclear plants 
operating or under construction connecticut yankee vermont 
yankee and maine yankee 
after conducting studies that projected continued strong growth 
in energy demand public service decided to join dozens of other 
utilities that were jumping on the nuclear bandwagon 
new hampshires largest power company announced on may 20 1968 
that it would build an 860megawatt reactor on the piscataqua river 
in newington nh public service was to own 50 percent of the 
plant with united illuminating of connecticut to pick up most of 
the rest of the tab 
the plant was to cost 150 million and be operating commercially 
by the fall of 1974 company chairman avery schiller announced 
but the federal government squelched the original plan saying 
the newington location was too close to pease air force base 
public service chose an alternate site on marshland at seabrook 
public service shelved the plans in 1969 after problems arose in 
financing the plant later utility studies showed a need for a big 
new power plant and the company revived its nuclear plans on feb 
1 1972 
the plans were subsequently revised to include two 
1150megawatt reactors the first to be operating commercially in 
1979 the second in 1981 the total cost was estimated at 850 
million 
although the oil crisis of 1973 heightened awareness about 
energy seabrook began running into problems that earlier nuclear 
plants had not faced ashooh drew a comparison between seabrook and 
maine yankee in wiscasset an 826megawatt reactor that began 
operating in 1972 at a construction cost of 239 million 
they went through their environmental impact hearings in an 
afternoon ashooh said it took seabrook several years 
controversy over seabrooks coolingwater system wasnt finally 
settled until august 1978 causing years of delays and adding 
hundreds of millions of dollars to the plants cost by then 
seabrook also had become the target of highly visible opposition 
civil disobedience actions began at the plant site in 1976 
months before groundbreaking and a may 1977 protest that ended 
with 1414 arrests the largest at any us nuclear plant at that 
time made seabrook the focus of the nations antinuclear 
movement 
as further delays kept boosting the projects pricetag interest 
rates skyrocketed in the late 1970s and public services financial 
health deteriorated 
in the aftermath of the partial meltdown at three mile island 
the nuclear regulatory commission enacted rules that now represent 
the final major obstacle to a commercial license for seabrook 
requiring approved evacuation plans for a 10mile zone around all 
nuclear power plants 
also in the spring of 1979 new hampshire gov hugh gallen 
signed a law barring utilities from charging ratepayers for power 
plants before they operate

the dollar rose in lackluster european trading 
friday gold prices fell 
dealers said trading was extremely thin and quiet partly 
because many traders on the continent went home early before a 
threeday weekend 
you could hear a pin drop in the trading room today said 
one dealer at a british merchant bank 
the dollars slight gains were due to a flurry of buying in the 
morning after hashemi rafsanjani the speaker of irans parliament 
reiterated that his country was at war with the united states and 
called for an arms buildup 
the dollar jumped up on the report but then it barely moved for 
several hours until it edged back late in the day dealers said 
one dealer said market players did not take the report seriously 
but that it gave them something to do 
the dollar was not affected by news that the us consumer price 
index rose 04 percent in april because the rise was in line with 
expectations dealers said 
in london the dollar gained against the british pound the 
pound fell to 18615 from 18665 late thursday 
in tokyo where the business day ends before europes begins 
the dollar rose fractionally to a closing 12482 yen from 12480

us trade representative clayton 
yeutter warned friday that the sharp narrowing in the nations 
trade deficit in march does not necessarily signal a trend 
the gap narrowed to 975 billion from 1383 billion in 
february catching the markets and some government officials off 
guard 
yeutter the top us trade official said the improvement was a 
pleasant surprise but said he preferred to look at quarterly 
averages which give a better idea of trends 
we have to be concerned that this isnt an aberration he 
said 
yeutter said a 13 billion rise in us imports to 387 
billion did raise concern 
he called on foreign firms to stop dumping but added wed 
have a healthy situation if our consumer demand were a bit less 
strong 
yeutter was in zurich during a european trip to address the

stores inc announced friday it is laying off 1200 employees as a 
result of federateds purchase by campeau corp of canada 
lazarus a cincinnatibased department store group said 600 
employees will lose their jobs in the companys central 
organization and the remaining 600 will be laid off from the 43 
stores and regional organization lazarus has 15000 employees and 
operates in ohio kentucky indiana west virginia and michigan 
all of the employees will know their status by june 11 company

being laid off 
asked whether there will be further layoffs ms charlton said 
i have no way of telling that but this is all thats been given 
to us

farmers group inc faces a 
difficult challenge in attempting to defeat bat industries 45 
billion takeover bid the insurers chairman said friday 
the 63ashare offer is perhaps the test of farmers 
mettle leo e denlea jr farmers chairman told about 500 
people attending the companys annual meeting here 
the offer by bat and its american subsidiary batus inc has 
been vigorously opposed by management at farmers the nations 
thirdlargest home and auto insurance company and the 
seventhlargest property and casualty insurer 
denlea warned shareholders against becoming confused by the 
offer 
farmers record is unparalleled we are supremely confident we 
can continue to enhance shareholder value in the future denlea 
said 
results of a nonbinding shareholder resolution proposed by 
batus which urged farmers board to negotiate will not be 
available for at least a week denlea said 
also addressing farmers shareholders was bats chairman pat 
sheehy he agreed with denleas upbeat forecast for farmers and 
reiterated earlier statements that bat would pay substantially more 
than 63 a share if farmers would only negotiate 
we want to buy farmers because its a firstclass organization 
that has excellent growth prospects sheehy said 
we are pleased with the support that we received from farmers 
group shareholders on our resolution recommending the farmers 
directors reconsider their refusal to negotiate with us sheehy 
said we look forward to receiving the actual tally 
batus a diversified company whose betterknown interests 
include kool cigarettes and saks fifth avenue stores said thursday 
about 18 percent of the companys shareholders had offered to sell 
their stock to batus at the offered price of 63 a share 
the outcome of the proxy vote may not be known for some days 
because anything other than an obviously overwhelming vote one way 
or the other will have to be independently verified said jerry 
faulwell farmers vice president and treasurer 
the battle for control of the company has been spirited with 
farmers criticizing bat for doing business in south africa and 
suggesting its tobacco holdings make it unfit to control an 
insurance company that gives nonsmoker discounts 
louisvillebased batus for its part has responded by pointing 
out that farmers has invested 200 million of the money collected 
from policy holders in us companies that do business in south 
africa 
batus has committed to maintaining nonsmoker discounts and 
points out that british insurers owned by bat industries have 
instituted nonsmoking rates since bat acquired them bat does less 
than 1 percent of its business in south africa and subscribes to 
common market guidelines for such businesses aimed at bettering the 
lot of blacks under apartheid spokesmen have said 
batus owns brown amp williamson tobacco corp maker of kool 
viceroy raleigh and belair cigarettes and retailers including 
saks fifth avenue and marshall fields it also owns appleton

grain and soybean futures closed higher friday on 
the chicago board of trade with soybeans up sharply on fears of 
continued dry weather 
weekend weather forecasts were mixed but even the most 
optimistic outlooks called for scattered showers to bring only 
slight moisture to parts of the corn belt analysts said 
with soybean stockpiles declining a poor crop this year could 
lead to tight supplies next year 
my weatherman is the market and the market says were not 
going to get much rain this weekend so thats what im going by 
said victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter reynolds inc 
but if more rain should fall than expected this weekend grain 
and soybean prices probably would plummet on monday lespinasse 
said 
its a very nervous market he said 
at the close wheat was unchanged to 5 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 346 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 3 cents higher with july at 221 a bushel oats

stock prices closed mostly lower today in some 
of the lightest trading this year capping a lossriddled week in 
which apathy and tension over higher interest rates dominated the 
market 
its just a continuation of complete lack of interest by the 
public said john muldowney head of equity trading at the 
richmond va investment firm of scott amp stringfellow inc 
although the market showed little reaction to a government 
report that consumer prices rose 04 percent in april the figure 
helped substantiate existing fear that higher inflation is 
inevitable 
since inflation means higher interest rates yields in the bond 
market rose and became an increasingly attractive alternative to 
stocks driving prices lower

canada wont withdraw from a proposed freetrade 
agreement even if the united states carries through with proposals 
to restrict imports of canadian lobster and plywood trade minister 
john crosbie said friday 
crosbie told the commons he has sent diplomatic notes to 
washington and telephoned us trade representative clayton yeutter 
in paris to protest recommendations by the senate finance committee 
which canada says would violate the agreement negotiated last fall 
yeutter is in paris for an international economic meeting 
but crosbie shied away from opposition demands that he threaten 
to kill the deal unless the americans back down 
when we encounter a problem we dont throw up our hands and 
withdraw altogether and leave chaos in its place crosbie told 
the commons 
crosbie said if the united states doesnt eliminate the 
provisions from its legislation canada could take the issue to the 
bilateral trade panels which would be set up under free trade to 
settle disputes or could take countermeasures presumably 
restrictions on american goods 
under the freetrade deal to take effect in january canada and 
the united states would phase out tariffs and a wide range of other 
barriers 
however both the canadian parliament and the full us congress 
must still approve the necessary legislation crosbie said he 
intends to introduce the canadian legislation in the commons on 
tuesday 
liberal leader john turner and new democratic party leader ed 
broadbent both prodded crosbie to draw a firm line against any 
concessions the united states wants to add to the freetrade deal 
just for once will this government stand up for canadian 
interests before something is done against us instead of after 
said broadbent 
crosbie replied what is it you want do you want me to go 
down there with a machine gun

financially strapped eastern airlines will cut back 
its operations by nearly 20 percent starting this summer its 
pilots union says 
the air line pilots association said eastern officials told 
union representatives of the plans at an april 29 meeting during 
discussion of pilots scheduling the miami herald reported in 
fridays editions 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the 20 percent is a 
speculative figure 
thats from alpa she said we havent determined or 
finalized our flying plans beyond july 
but eastern a subsidiary of giant texas air corp said in its 
most recent quarterly report to the securities and exchange 
commission that more cutbacks and losses are imminent 
in anticipation of continuing losses eastern is considering 
and anticipating a further downsizing of the operations said the 
report made public this week 
eastern sustained a net loss of 309 million in the first 
quarter 
the union representing some 3500 eastern pilots said they were 
told by eastern that the planned flight reductions stem from a 
worsening pilot shortage a huge backlog of pilot vacations 
postponed by the company to keep planes flying and a training 
logjam on a300 and boeing 757 jetliners 
according to union calculations eastern would operate 56812 
block hours this september down sharply from 78236 this month a 
block hour measures how long it takes a plane to taxi and fly from 
one airport to another flight levels have not been that low since 
1968 the pilots said 
alpa said though there was no indication that eastern would 
lay off more workers to adjust for the cutbacks 
the union also said eastern estimates it has lost 1037 pilots 
since july 1986 a total of 392 will have been hired for a net 
reduction of 645 eastern spokesman robin matell said the carrier 
has enough pilots to meet its planned schedules 
employment at eastern has been slashed from 40000 to around 
32000 workers since easterns 1986 takeover by texas air

a federal judge said friday that he 
would rule after the financial markets close monday on murray ohio 
manufacturing cos attempt to block a 182 million hostile 
takeover by ab electrolux of sweden 
us district judge thomas a wiseman said he would review the 
case over the weekend before ruling on murray ohios request for a 
preliminary injunction against the swedish appliance manufacturer 
murray ohio produces lawn mowers and bicycles 
a fiveday hearing had focused on the new york law firm sullivan 
amp cromwell which represented ab electrolux in its 48ashare 
offer made may 6 but the firm also offered advice in 1987 to 
murray ohio on strategy for fighting takeovers testimony showed 
in closing arguments murray ohio attorney robert j walker 
contended that the huge electrolux benefited from inside 
information provided by sullivan amp cromwell 
walker said the law firm was privy to sensitive information 
about murray ohio including financial projections and takeover 
tactics 
he said neil anderson a sullivan amp cromwell partner advising ab 
electrolux on the takeover knew that his firm had confidential 
information about murray ohio in its files 
anderson then told daniel r elliott an ab electrolux vice 
president of the existence of the information and then advised the 
swedish company on what price to offer for murray ohios shares 
walker said 
he elliott was being told how to bet by one who knew he 
said 
but ab electrolux attorney william g mcguinness said his 
clients were innocent bystanders 
he said that no witness including those from murray ohio 
testified about any specific insider information being given to ab 
electrolux 
in addition he said thousands of pages of files produced for 
the hearing offered no evidence that electrolux ever used 
confidential information to analyze murray ohio for the takeover 
the analysis was based on public sources he said 
if electrolux had any inside information you would think 
some of it would be documented somewhere he said

income tax payments in april helped shrink the 
federal budget deficit but the monthly surplus was less than a 
year ago leaving government red ink so far this year 246 percent 
higher than 1987 the treasury department said friday 
the april surplus of 139 billion representing the difference 
between what the government took in and what it spent last month 
helped hold the deficit for the first seven months of the fiscal 
year to 1050 billion 
but that figure was much higher than the 843 billion in red 
ink during the first seven months of fiscal year 1987 when the 
total annual deficit eventually amounted to 1502 billion 
economists say the april report indicates the reagan 
administration will have a tough time meeting its goal of a 1467 
billion deficit for fiscal 1988 which ends sept 30 or even the 
congressional budget office projection of 157 billion 
michael k evans head of an economic forcasting service in 
washington said the april report indicates the deficit for the 
year will be between 170 billion and 175 billion 
aprils the big month after that its all arithmetic 
the belief that it was going to stay below 150 billion was just 
pure fiction he said 
the 1988 deficit target in the grammrudman deficitreduction 
law is 144 billion budget director james c miller iii warned 
congress on tuesday that an acrosstheboard cut in federal 
programs which would occur in october under the law was 
perilously close 
the april surplus bolstered by 533 billion in individual 
income tax payments was about 5 billion less than expected by 
private economists they had been waiting for the report to see 
what effect the new income tax law would have some had thought the 
new tax law would provide a small windfall 
however evans said the average median taxpayer enjoyed a tax 
cut 
people who used deductions and shelters paid more than they 
did the year before but the rank and file paid less he said 
april income tax collections were 258 percent less than the 
same month a year earlier which was inflated by the rush to take 
capital gains in 1986 before the favorable rates on that kind of 
income disappeared under the new tax law 
personal income tax collections of 2376 billion for the first 
seven months of the fiscal year are running 27 percent behind last 
year however that has been offset somewhat by corporate income 
tax collections of 506 billion 84 percent greater than last 
year 
in april all government revenue totaled 1093 billion 110 
percent lower than april 1987 spending totaled 954 billion 136 
percent ahead of the same month a year earlier 
for the first seven months revenues totaled 5221 billion up 
3 percent over 1987 while spending was 6271 billion up 61 
percent from the same period a year ago 
as usual the largest spending categories in april were the 
military followed by social security other programs in the 
department of health and human services and interest on the 
national debt 
military spending totaled 261 billion last month and 1684 
billion for the fiscal year so far up 63 percent from the same 
period a year ago 
spending for social security totaled 163 billion last month 
and 1213 billion for the past seven months up 57 percent from 
the same period in the 1987 fiscal year social security is 
exempted from budget limitations under the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law and most months has been showing faster 
spending increases than the other categories 
the other programs in the department of health and human 
services including medicare and medicaid spent 157 billion in 
april and 932 billion so far this budget year a 65 percent 
increase over 1987 
interest on the 25 trillion national debt totaled 149 
billion last month and 1201 billion so far this fiscal year an 
increase of 95 percent over the same period last year

hundreds of general motors corp retirees marched 
outside gms annual shareholders meeting friday to protest changes 
in healthcare benefits they say discriminate against salaried 
workers 
we retirees all retired with what we thought was an implied a 
moral and a legal contract that we would have our health insurance 
benefits for life said leonard moeller a retiree who lives in 
grand blanc 
what right does general motors have to discriminate against 
salaried gm employees he said 
of gms 309000 retirees about 84000 were salaried workers 
hourly workers pensions and other retirement benefits are 
negotiated by the united auto workers union which does not 
represent salaried workers 
in july gm will change its health care plan for salaried 
workers both active and retired to encourage the use health 
maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations over 
gms traditional blue crossblue shield health insurance by forcing 
users of the traditional plan to pay deductibles and half of each 
monthly premium 
single salaried workers will be required to pay 200 
deductibles families will pay 250 and both pay 20 percent of the 
next 2500 in medical charges 
workers who opt for hmos and ppos pay no deductibles or premiums 
and only 30 percent of charges for each office visit said john d 
butler gms general director of employee benefits 
gm also moved vision and hearing care from separate plans that 
covered all costs into its optional comprehensive coverage which 
has deductibles and premium costsharing butler said 
butler said ford motor co and chrysler corp made similar 
changes in 1984 only 13 percent of gm salaried workers now 
participate in managed health care plans none of the changes 
affects hourly workers 
gm chairman roger smith said the company made the changes to 
stem costs and halt abuses gm spent 29 billion on employee and 
retiree health care in 1987 and faces higher costs in the future as 
its work force ages and the number of active workers supporting 
each retiree shrinks 
separately gm increased salaried pensions by 850 a year 
butler said the increases will total 3400 by 1990 while the 
changes in the health care plan could cost salaried workers and 
retirees 750 a year 
we are no 1 in benefits literally in the world by almost any 
measure smith said he said the retirees anger would be an 
easy thing to fix next time it comes around we dont put the 
money in cash we put it back in the benefits but that means the 
people who dont use the benefits are going to get hurt and the 
people who do use them or abuse them are going to be better off 
thats what we tried to avoid 
a typical gm salaried employee who retired at age 65 in 1985 
receives about 40400 a year in pension benefits and social 
security payments butler said smith said gm retirees earn more 
than 66 percent of active workers in the united states 
at a news conference after the nearly fivehour meeting smith 
also told reporters gm spent 3 billion on buyer incentives in 
1987 which helped improve gms share of the us vehicle market to 
374 percent in firstquarter 1988 from 334 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 1987 
smith said he believes any savings from eliminating incentives 
would be overcome by resulting lost sales 
smith also said gm hasnt decided whether it will need 
additional plant closings to shrink the companys production 
capacity to fit its market share which is still well below the 45 
percent gm held several years ago

613 point loss to 195259 bringing its decline for the week to 
3795 broader market indices were mixed 
new york stock exchange volume totaled 1206 million shares vs 
16516 million the previous session it was the most lethargic pace 
since a 11158 millionshare day dec 29 without the inflating 
influence of dividendcapture trading in selected stocks the 
volume would have been substantially lighter 
its just a continuation of complete lack of interest by the 
public said john muldowney head of equity trading at the 
richmond va investment firm of scott amp stringfellow inc 
the government reported that consumer prices rose 04 percent in 
april although that level was widely anticipated by economists and 
traders it substantiated some anxiety about inflation that haunted 
the market all week 
this concern pushed yields on the key 30year treasury bond to 
the 934 percent friday the highest of the year making bonds an 
increasingly attractive and less risky alternative to stocks 
the market has said something loud and clear im going to 
attach myself to the tail of the bond market said stephen 
shobin a vice president and market analyst for merrill lynch amp co 
in new york 
nevertheless shobin said he saw the potential for a stock 
rally arguing that fears over inflation are highly exaggerated and 
that any further substantial rise in interest rates is unlikely 
i think the market has very little vulnerability here 
shobin said the level of fear is very high right now but fear 
is very fashionable the market rarely rewards what the street 
considers fashionable

investor burt sugarman apparently conceding 
that his 18 billion bid for media general inc has stalled on 
friday suggested splitting the communications firm into two or more 
parts 
speaking at the companys annual shareholders meeting sugarman 
also played down the bitter proxy fight he has waged with media 
general chairman d tennant bryan over the election of directors to 
the companys board 
the questions that i have are not based on personalities 
sugarman said its time to get down to business lets meet 
together lets talk together 
bryan whose family owns 71 percent of media generals powerful 
class b shares presided at the meeting but did not respond to 
sugarmans offer to negotiate bryan has said the familys stake in 
the company is not for sale 
sugarman who controls about 10 percent of the companys class a 
shares initially offered 6150 a share but later boosted his bid 
to 70 a share 
subsequently he and two allies have challenged three directors 
seeking reelection to media generals ninemember board 
sugarman told the stockholders that his slate would be fair to 
the bryans and would seek to split the companys assets in a way 
that preserved the familys publishing concerns my interest is 
not in taking the newspapers away from the bryans he said 
in addition to the richmond timesdispatch the richmond news 
leader the tampa tribune and other daily and weekly newspapers 
media general owns several television stations and cable television 
operations 
bryan meanwhile received a lengthy ovation from the crowd of 
about 400 shareholders when he read his own name for reelection to 
the board 
because of delays in counting proxy votes the tally on the 
election of directors will not be released until may 27 but media 
general president and chief executive officer james r evans said 
based on the proxies that we have received we believe the 
incumbent directors have defeated sugarman and his dissident 
slate 
sugarman however said after the twohour meeting that he 
believed the vote was nearly even i think youll find i was not 
the only shareholder who voted for our slate he said 
but several shareholders said sugarmans proposal to split the 
company indicated some doubt about his chances 
still sugarman said his 70pershare bid still stands 
media general closed thursday at 4262 a share look at the 
disparity in those numbers he said 
the stock dropped 112 a share friday to close at 4137 on 
the american stock exchange 
sugarman criticized the twotier stock arrangement and said he 
was seeking congressional action to eliminate such structures last 
month a federal district court in richmond rejected sugarmans 
challenge to the system 
like several media companies including the new york times co 
and the washington post co media general has two classes of stock 
to keep control of the company in the hands of a few while there 
are fewer class b shares outstanding those shares are more 
powerful than the class a shares 
under media generals arrangement the bryan family controls the 
election of a majority of the board through its classb shares 
sugarman is chairman of the californiabased barris industries 
which produces the dating game and other popular television 
game shows and the south carolinabased giant group ltd a cement 
company

platinum futures prices jumped more than 11 a troy ounce 
friday leading other precious metals higher as key indicators 
reinforced ideas that inflation is worsening analysts said 
on other markets most livestock and meat futures gained the 
pork markets received some startling news about supplies grains 
and soybeans advanced energy futures were mixed and stock index 
futures retreated 
a combination of inflationary signals and indications of 
economic growth have made platinum the leader of the 
preciousmetals complex because platinum is used as both an 
industrial metal and a hedge against inflation analysts said 
fridays government report showing a 04 percent increase in 
consumer prices in april supported the metals rally on friday but 
the real boost came late in the day when a sudden surge in soybean 
and grain futures prices propelled the commodity research bureaus 
price index of 21 commodities up sharply 
with fridays 131point gain the crb index for may delivery 
ended the week at 24611 up 681 points from the previous fridays 
close on the new york futures exchange 
thats really a fantastic move said craig sloane metals 
analyst for smith barney harris upham amp co in new york all 
these things commodity prices strength of the economy theyre 
all feeding into why the metals are beginning to move 
platinum settled 1110 to 1120 higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange with the contract for delivery in july at 
56860 a troy ounce 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold was 50 cents to 70 
cents higher with june at 45870 a troy ounce silver was 75 
cents to 79 cents higher with may at 669 a troy ounce 
livestock and meat futures finished mostly higher in light 
preweekend trading on the chicago mercantile exchange but a 
government coldstorage report released after the close prompted 
predictions that pork futures would open lower on monday 
the agriculture department said the number of hams in cold 
storage nearly doubled during april to 516 million pounds that 
compares with 24 million pounds on april 1 and 113 million pounds 
on may 1 1987 
the usda said the total amount of pork in cold storage was up 82 
percent from last year including 1025 million pounds of frozen 
pork bellies the thirdlargest may 1 total ever said chuck 
levitt an analysts in chicago with shearson lehman hutton inc 
the large stocks of frozen pork wont have an immediate impact 
on futures prices but will begin exerting heavy price pressure in 
july when demand for pork products typically outstrips the supply 
of fresh meat levitt said 
live cattle settled 40 cent lower to 25 cent higher with june 
at 7337 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 25 cent 
higher with may at 8090 cents a pound hogs were 05 cent lower to

cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures closed higher on the chicago board of 
trade with soybeans up sharply on fears of continued dry weather 
weekend weather forecasts were mixed but even the most 
optimistic outlooks called for scattered showers to bring only 
slight moisture to parts of the corn belt analysts said 
with soybean stockpiles declining a poor crop this year could 
lead to tight supplies next year 
the national weather service in a sixto10 day outlook issued 
after the close predicted warm temperatures and normal rainfall 
for most of the midwest during the latter half of next week and the 
memorial day weekend

a federal bankruptcy judge on thursday 
granted public service company of new hampshire at least four extra 
months to come up with a reorganization plan and may grant another 
two months after that 
after a sevenhour hearing judge james yacos said he doubted he 
would grant the utility the eight months it had requested 
but he said the utility was entitled at least to a fourmonth 
extension because the first 120 days have been used for 
organization in a rather unique case 
realistically public service is only now in a position they 
would be in the first few weeks of a normal case yacos said 
federal bankruptcy law gives a debtor the exclusive right to 
propose a reorganization plan for 120 days after it files for 
protection from creditors the exclusivity period for public 
service the states largest electric utility and main owner of 
the stalled seabrook nuclear power plant ends may 27 
it had asked for an eightmonth extension citing the complexity 
and uniqueness of the case 
yacos said he would consider lengthening the extension later if 
he was assured that parties involved in the reorganization had 
adequate access to information needed to develop and negotiate a 
plan 
yacos said he either would grant a fourmonth extension with a 
hearing in september to consider more time or would grant a 
sixmonth extension with a hearing in september to be certain that 
necessary information is being made available to all involved 
several lawyers representing other parties to the bankruptcy had 
proposed shorter extension periods 
but yacos said he was not convinced that it yet was appropriate 
to open up the reorganization process to other proposals although 
he noted that one way to make things move is to make them 
concrete put them on the table 
public service sought bankruptcy protection because of financial 
problems stemming from its 36 percent share of the 54 billion 
seabrook plant it blames its woes largely on political opposition 
to seabrook and a state law barring the company from charging 
customers for the plant until it operates commercially which had 
forced the company to borrow heavily

amax inc said friday it has repurchased 
152 million shares from chevron corp for 23 each or about 350 
million 
a statement from the companies said chevron has a onetime 
option to request additional payment for the shares over the next 
two years if amax stock rises above 23 a share with a ceiling of 
28 a share 
chevron which acquired its interest in amax in 1975 was the 
largest shareholder in the metals oil and gas company 
analysts said the move highlights chevrons interest in focusing 
on its basic oil businesses 
jordan estra vice president of sg warbug amp co in new york 
said what it really means is chevron is focusing its effort back 
to its basic businesses and its interest in diversification is 
diminished 
alan born president and chief executive officer of amax said 
the company will have to borrow to finance the repurchase but he 
expected the funds to be repaid from the current years cash flow 
amax has completed a number of major steps to improve its 
profitability and potential and is experiencing significant 
improvement in its operating results born said this share 
purchase will not dilute the earnings of amaxs remaining 
shareholders 
we are currently expecting amaxs net income in 1988 to be in 
the order of 4 per share and with this purchase of shares those 
expected earnings should increase to about 425 per share he 
said 
the repurchase represents chevrons total holdings in amax 
although corporate headquarters for amax are in new york the 
companys headquarters for its metals businesses are in greenwich 
chevron is headquartered in san francisco
