early unofficial returns wednesday 
night showed conservative fernando collor de mello leading brazils 
first free and direct presidential election since 1960 
with about 8 percent of the votes counted collor de mello who 
led most exit polls with 30 percent had 2225909 votes followed 
by leftwing populist leonel brizola with 1628735 votes said 
globo tv the nations largest network 
late wednesday the government announced a 12hour delay in the 
official count reportedly because of computer problems 
in third place was luis inacio lula da silva of the 
marxistoriented workers party with 1561739 votes trailed by 
sen mario covas of the leftofcenter brazilian social democracy 
party with 1345248 votes but with surprising leads in two of the 
countrys largest cities the network said 
covas a darkhorse candidate held a strong lead in sao paulo 
the nations most populous city and was a solid second in belo 
horizonte the tv network said 
the network said some 130000 people voted for popular tv 
gameshow host silvio santos who tried to enter the race two weeks 
before the election but whose candidacy was thrown out by the 
electoral court 
more than 82 million people were eligible to vote for a 
successor to president jose sarney who was chosen by an electoral 
college when the generals relinquished power in 1985 after two 
decades rule voting was mandatory for brazilians aged 1869 
the chief of brazils federal police romeu tuma said there 
were no significant incidents to mar the voting we are very 
pleased with how calm the day was 
final results are not expected until saturday and on the 
assumption no one gains a majority a runoff between the two 
leaders is planned for dec 17 
the first official results announced were from a relative 
handful of brazilians who cast ballots in embassies and consulates 
in 19 countries with collor de mello leading followed by covas and 
da silva 
collor de mello a 40yearold former state governor has been a 
harsh critic of sarney leading in the polls since april his 
dapper good looks and anticorruption platform made collor de mello 
popular with the poor a majority in the brazilian electorate 
sarney is widely blamed for official corruption and an annual 
inflation rate of at least 1300 percent 
the superior electoral court first announced results would start 
being released at 800 pm local time just three hours after the 
polls closed however that time was pushed back to 1100 pm and 
then to thursday 
an election official speaking on condition of anonymity told a 
reporter there was a problem with computer links between brasilia 
and faroff voting precincts 
parties ranged from the communists to one formerly backed by the 
military entered candidates 
fully 73 percent of the brazilian electorate had never voted for 
president lines lines of voters began forming before dawn hours 
before polls opened at 8 am from the amazon jungle in the north 
to the southern pampas 
the results showed the candidates leading in their regional 
strongholds collor de mello led in the federal capital of 
brasilia in northeastern maceio and southeastern curitiba 
da silva an exlabor leader held wide leads in southeastern 
belo horizonte and the two northeastern atlantic coastal cities of 
salvador and recife 
brizola of the democratic labor party led in the southern 
capital cities of porto alegre and rio de janeiro brazils 
secondlargest city 
promotional spots on nationwide television said that whereas in 
1960 it took three months to count the votes this year with 
modern computer technology the results would be announced as 
quickly as possible 
the federal electoral court promised results by 8 pm but that 
was postponed several times for reasons not explained 
election officials directed that ballots cast at the 250000 
voting stations in the nations 4445 counties be flown to brasilia 
after local counting 
several candidates raised the possibility of fraud roberto 
rosas of the superior electoral court responded on wednesday 
many candidates are setting up parallel votecounting for 
fear of fraud but fraud is impossibe and there is no virus or 
microbe that can affect our computers 
collor de mello voted early in maceio and flew back to brasilia 
to follow the count for president who will serve five years and 
cannot seek reelection 
the election took place on a national holiday the 100th 
anniversary of the republic that ended the reign of emperor pedro 
ii 
in rio many brizola sympathizers wore red bandannas the 
candidates trademark in brasilia election officials delayed 
voting for two hours and ordered the bandannas removed 
the penalty for not voting is a fine of up to 20 new cruzados 
about 330 
a 1988 constitutional reform also enfranchised citizens aged 16 
and 17 but voting is not compulsory for them 
liquor sales were forbidden from midnight tuesday to 6 am 
thursday 
janio quadros won brazils last free and direct presidential 
election in 1960 he resigned after seven months and the ensuing 
confusion led to a military coup in 1964 
the army canceled direct presidential elections although they 
permitted some regional elections 
sarney 59 said this election concludes the transition to 
democracy 
there has never been so much freedom in the country he said 
tuesday night in homes at work in the streets opinions are 
divided and no one is afraid because we know democracy exists 
he did not publicly support any candidate and described his 
role in the election as a magistrate

members of congress have written to president 
bush asking about industry reports that the administration plans 
heavy cuts in research in high technology financed through the 
defense department a congressional aide said wednesday night 
a white house spokesman steven hart said he was not sure the 
letter had been received and could give no response i have 
nothing for you on that said hart 
among the signers of the letter were reps richard gephardt 
dmo the democratic majority leader in the house and rep mel 
levine dcalif according to michael wessel an aide to gephardt 
an aide who spoke on condition that he not be identified said 
sources in the semiconductor industry with access to classified 
documents had been alerting congressional offices to what they 
described as an administration plan for sharp cuts 
among programs that might be affected he said were sematech 
the consortium now conducting semiconductor research with the aid 
of 100 million in federal money every year a planned program in 
xray lithography that could increase the capacity of computer 
chips and highdefinition television or hdtv 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher lost a bid in september 
inside the administration to launch a major effort to capture world 
leadership in hdtv 
as the aide described the letter the members were asking 
information about what they heard about possible cuts in hightech 
research and urging that no cuts be made

peace talks between nicaraguas leftist 
government and the contra rebels fell into disarray wednesday night 
with the two sides offering sharply differing assessments on the 
progress of the negotiations 
the contra delegation stunned the sandinista negotiators in 
early evening by asking for a weeklong recess just when 
sandinista officials said an agreement seemed within reach 
the chief nicaraguan government negotiator viceforeign 
minister victor hugo tinoco described the contra proposal as a 
total surprise because he said the two sides had made a lot of 
progress earlier in the day 
the talks took a bizarre twist when according to tinoco the 
contra delegation disappeared at 8 pm after members said they 
wanted to talk among themselves 
we dont know where they are tinoco told reporters shortly 
after 10 pm they are somewhere in this building 
tinoco and other members of the sandinista delegation then 
returned to their hotel 
an hour later the contra delegation reappeared and told 
reporters they planned to return late thursday morning to discuss 
with the sandinistas the timing for the resumption of the 
negotiations 
they left the impression that they might rescind their earlier 
request for a sevenday recess 
earlier rebel spokesman bosco matamoros disagreed strongly when 
he was informed that an american member of the sandinista 
delegation paul reichler had given an upbeat account of the 
discussions 
unfortunately there was not any flexibility on the part of the 
government to reach a ceasefire matamoros said 
informed that reichler had said that the two sides were on the 
verge of an agreement matamoros replied i would say mr 
ricklers perception is not accurate 
still earlier tinoco said his government offered a major 
concession in ceasefire talks with the contras by dropping its 
demand that the rebels demobilize 
as its price for restoring the ceasefire the government allowed 
to lapse nov 1 tinoco said the government is insisting only that 
contra forces in nicaragua return to their base camps in honduras 
we think that is a very important change in our position 
tinoco told a news conference at the nicaraguan embassy a few hours 
before the peace talks reconvened at the organization of american 
states 
tinoco maintained that while the sandinistas are willing to make 
concessions the contras have shown not an inch of flexibility 
in four rounds of talks starting last thursday at the united 
nations 
there was no immediate response by the rebels but administration 
officials said the contras have told them evacuation from 
nicaraguan territory is not feasible 
as part of a ceasefire agreement the rebels would be willing 
instead to relocate in designated enclaves in nicaragua where 
their activities could easily be monitored by international 
observers the contras have told us officials 
if they return to honduras it is possible they could be 
prevented by international monitors from returning to nicaragua 
the contras have argued 
in addition they said since the contras are nicaraguans it 
makes more sense for them to remain inside their own homeland 
rather than in a neighboring country 
there are an estimated 5000 rebels in nicaragua about 2000 of 
whom have infiltrated from the honduran base camps in recent weeks 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega declined to renew the cease 
fire on nov 1 drawing widespread international condemnation 
secretary of state james a baker iii said monday that the 
suspension of the truce had created a militarized election 
atmosphere ortega defended his decision by saying the rebels had 
been engaging in terrorist activity 
while allowing the truce to lapse after 19 months ortega 
simultaneously called for a resumption of discussions with the 
resistance 
hoping to prod the negotiators toward a settlement were 
representatives from the united nations and the organization of 
american states they are members of the international commission 
for support and verification which was set up to oversee the peace 
process

president bush called el salvadors president 
wednesday to express solidarity with the rightist government in the 
face of a fierce guerrilla attack that has left upwards of 500 
people dead and more than 1000 wounded 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush commended 
president alfredo cristiani for the efforts of the salvadoran armed 
forces to avoid causing casualties to the civilian population 
the spokesman said bush also pledged the united states would 
continue to speak out about cuban and nicaraguan support for the 
guerrillas which flies in the face of regional peace accords 
the fourdayguerrilla offensive appeared stalled as government 
troops drove the rebels from workingclass neighborhoods in fierce 
combat the armed forces air power and numerical superiority 
combined with lack of popular support for the guerrillas appeared 
to tilt the battle for the capital in favor of the government 
in friday editions the new york times said us officials were 
accelerating deliveries of munitions and other aid scheduled for 
delivery to el salvador 
fitzwater said bush told cristiani he stands behind the 
salvadoran government the president said that the rebel force 
bears full responsibility for this tragedy and that he wanted to 
express the solidarity of the american people for the great 
suffering in sal salvador and elsewhere 
the press spokesman said cristiani thanked bush for his support 
and reported that the armed forces were having increasing success 
against the guerrillas 
further cristiani told bush that the government would 
continue to give the highest priority to protecting the civilian 
population in military operations against those guerrillas that 
remained fitzwater said

the nations oldest air passenger service whose 
seaplanes carried celebrities outlaws and at least one fleeing 
dictator in its 70 years may be grounded by financial losses and 
competition from modern jets 
unless a buyer is found the final islandhopping chalks 
international airlines flight will splash down dec 15 on biscayne 
bay off miami 
its a very sad moment this is an item of living history that 
may bite the dust said harold rifas an attorney for financially 
troubled resorts international inc which has owned chalks since 
1974 
it was an exciting thrilling way to move people said 
rifas its really a depressing thing for me to handle this 
rifas said losses have been very very substantial at 
chalks whose 17seat seaplanes were featured on the opening 
credits of the former hit series miami vice 
resorts reported losses of 23 million for the first half of 
1989 for its airline operations including chalks and paradise 
island airlines which carries travelers to resorts bahamian 
casino complex 
chalks dropped its paradise island route last month and now 
operates three daily flights between miami and the bahamian island 
of bimini 
resorts itself is struggling with mounting debt and falling 
values of junk bonds used by merv griffin to finance acquisition of 
the company from developer donald trump last year 
the possible demise of chalks would end a direct link with 
miamis flamboyant past as a mecca for such pioneer aviators as 
amelia earhart eastern airlines founder eddie rickenbaker pan 
american airways founder juan trippe and glenn curtiss of curtiss 
aviation 
in 1919 barnstormer and stunt pilot arthur pappy chalk took 
a curtiss f flying boat to miami and tied up along the bayfront 
where he pitched an umbrella and began offering 5 sightseeing 
flights 
during the next decades chalks caribbean island flights 
carried everyone from sunburned tourists to shady prohibitionera 
rumrunners passenger manifests also included names such as ernest 
hemingway and errol flynn 
in 1933 a hail of bullets followed a chalks plane whisking 
deposed cuban dictator geraldo machado into exile 
in 1972 a chalks crewman and pilot were wounded by two gunmen 
who commandeered an aircraft to cuba the crew and passengers 
returned to miami the next day 
five years later 88yearold chalk died after falling from a 
tree he was trimming 
the only accident involving a chalks aircraft and resulting in 
an injury occurred in 1985 when a grumman mallard crashed after 
takeoff from cat cay south of bimini one the 12 passengers was 
injured 
when you talk about amphibious aircraft you are going back to 
the origins of international air travel said donna corbett at 
the smithsonian national air and space museum in washington its 
really a look back to the beginnings 
the museum is exhibiting a former chalks grumman goose the 
forerunner of the mallards now operated by the airline 
ms corbett said 63yearold northwest airlines in eagan minn 
outside minneapolis is officially the nations oldest passenger 
airline a designation that requires posted schedules and a 
federal license 
but she said chalks which received airline status in the 1940s 
after years without firm posted schedules may lay claim to being 
the oldest passenger service and the last surviving scheduled 
seaplane operation in the united states 
catalina flying boats discontinued seaplane service last year 
from long beach calif to catalina island 
like other seaplane services chalks has been unable to compete 
with faster and larger jets 
several airlines including pan am eastern and midway airlines 
have service to the bahamas paradise island airlines now uses 
50seat dash 7 planes to its private airstrip 
resorts reported it lost 485 million for the first six months 
of 1989 on revenue of 2237 million

penthouse magazine sued a religious organization in 
federal court tuesday accusing the group of using extortion and 
racketeering to suppress the sale of adult magazines 
the lawsuit filed in us district court names the florida 
chapter of the american family association it seeks to recover at 
least 25000 the magazine claims it lost when a grocery store 
chain stopped selling penthouse according to a statement from 
penthouse international 
a similar lawsuit was filed against the association two weeks 
ago by retailing and publishing companies including playboy 
magazine and the waldenbooks book store chain 
these people represent the worst possible element in a free 
society penthouse publisher bob guccione said in the statement 
they will not rest until the public through its inaction allows 
them to regulate and approve our reading viewing listening and 
other educational and entertainment activities 
a call late tuesday to the groups state headquarters in tampa 
seeking comment was not immediately returned a home phone number 
for the groups state director david caton was unlisted 
the lawsuit accuses the association and caton of distributing a 
letter in september to store chains threatening them with legal 
action and public ridicule unless they agreed to stop selling the 
magazines the statement said 
the letter claimed the stores were violating floridas obscenity 
statute and promised to name those stores as violators and demand 
enforcement 
the publishing companies have said the statute applies only to 
publishers the association acknowledged in a news release that was 
included in the earlier lawsuit that the pornography statute 
applies only to publishing companies 
the association has campaigned for years against the sale of 
magazines such as penthouse and playboy the association which has 
also backed boycotts of tv programs it considers offensive most 
recently persuaded matchbox to cancel sale of a freddy krueger 
doll based on the ghoulish killer in nightmare on elm street

senior editors at east germanys state news agency 
used to dread the daily phone call from the communist party central 
committee telling them what to write such calls are just a memory 
now 
nobody tells us what to report and what not to report 
anymore said ralf bachmann assistant director general of the 
adn news agency its as if someone had removed the brakes on 
us 
bachmann 59 and others said tuesday that decades of 
restrictions on reporting have been lifted over the last three 
weeks in the course of radical changes that toppled the hardline 
leadership of erich honecker and culminated in the opening of the 
berlin wall 
bachmann says he sees adn evolving from a mouthpiece of the 
communist party into a nonpartisan news service that is there 
for all readers for all parties for all newspapers 
acting chief editor hansjoachim koppe of the daily neue zeit 
also perceives the news media moving toward a real pluralism of 
opinions and parties after shaking off constraints that resulted 
in some of the worlds most slanted and boring reporting 
his paper is run by the christian democratic union one of four 
parties allowed to survive after the communist party assumed sole 
control in 1949 in exchange for acknowledging communist supremacy 
for decades that tradeoff was reflected in neue zeits 
reporting with the exception of sports on the last page the 
eightpage edition on oct 9 was devoted to celebrations of east 
germanys 40th anniversary and the visit of mikhail s gorbachev 
a headline from that edition the idea of socialism becomes 
more enriched and is conducive to joint action 
since then east germanys peaceful revolution has swept neue 
zeits pages clean of such subservience 
the issue is true pluralism of letting the people decide 
read one frontpage headline ninetythree percent of 
respondents want a new election law read another 
an editorial criticized the communists in a way that would have 
been unthinkable just three weeks ago urging those who are 
guilty to be made accountable to the people 
it is just that party leaders and ministers are made 
accountable to us the editorial continued it is just when 
property and privileges gained illegally are confiscated one 
should be made to take responsibility for political mistakes and 
crimes have to be punished 
state television also isnt what it used to be over the past 
three weeks 
chief editor klaus schickhelm of the main news program went on 
the air to apologize to the public for biased and false reporting 
and pledged quick and honest news presentation 
the black canal a rabidly antiwest propaganda program 
that enraged east germans for nearly 30 years was abruptly 
canceled 
a parliament session was transmitted live for the first time 
giving viewers a chance to see suddenly enlivened legislators call 
for free elections and criticize the communist leadership 
such changes are appreciated by east germans many of whom used 
to watch west german television to get a feel of what was happening 
in their country and the world 
i never used to watch the aktuelle kamera taxi driver frank 
schimansky said of the main evening news show but now i watch 
it all the time because i find it keeps me better informed about 
what is happening here than west german tv does 
the newfound boldness in reporting also has made reading the 
newspaper more rewarding 
i used to be through the newspaper in five minutes said the 
46yearold schimansky as he dropped off a passenger near the 
checkpoint charlie crossing point to the west now i need about 
two hours

in the grimy birthplace of east 
germanys peaceful revolution the opening of the berlin wall was a 
bittersweet victory for the opposition 
were really afraid of a sellout to west germany said falk 
hocquel a leader of leipzigs branch of new forum the biggest 
opposition group 
this opening of the border came too quickly it was chaotic 
hocquel said we see a real danger that the big firms move in 
here and east germany becomes the poorhouse of western europe our 
people will go and work illegally in west germany for six months to 
get hard currency then come back we have no interest in being 
bought out by big business 
hocquels ideals strike a chord among many in this polluted 
industrial center east germanys secondlargest city and the 
throbbing heart of its astounding popular revolt 
many east germans are proud of what they have achieved in 40 
years of communism and are uneasy at the thought of being taken 
over by their rich brothers in the west 
in recent weeks they have been strongly politicized but they 
are nonetheless susceptible to western wealth this economically 
strong nation is our great danger hocquel said 
the opposition thus counted it a victory that after a weekend 
in which 3 million east germans went west many for the first time 
in 28 years at least 200000 marched in leipzig monday night to 
demand free elections and shout anticommunist slogans 
but the real test of popular belief in new forum as a political 
movement will come saturday when the group is host to east 
germanys first legal opposition assembly on leipzigs market 
square 
before the opening of the borders i would have said half a 
million people would come hocquel said now i dont know i 
hope at least 300000 
new forum formed only in september as a national movement has 
said it plans to contest the free elections promised by the 
communists and due in 1991 
but the group which is far more organized in leipzig than in 
east berlin is trying to put the brake on calls for a vote next 
spring it argues that fall 1990 is the earliest point it and other 
parties could stand on meaningful platforms 
to a foreigner the call for an orderly slower reform may sound 
typically german to east germans baffled by the stunning changes 
of one short month it sounds like a sensible breathing space and a 
chance to avoid mistakes 
reunification they feel should not be high on the political 
agenda 
thats not a theme until the people here have really created 
something new said christian fuehrer vicar of the nikolai 
church whose weekly prayers for peace became the kernel of a mass 
prodemocracy demonstration 
for 40 years fuehrer said our identity was only three 
initials ddr east germany 
now we have to learn our history which for years in schools 
here started with the revolution in the soviet union in 1917 we 
must know what is german then maybe you can talk about 
reunification but its not something that can just be ordered 
then administered weve seen where that led for 40 years 
the deep disillusionment with four decades of false promises and 
hardship comes through far more strongly in leipzig than in east 
berlin 
pure frustration drove these people onto the streets said 
uwe dreilich 32 a communist party member who has taken part in 
every monday demonstration of the past two months 
people were simply sick of being told what to do in every 
little thing dreilich said 
leipzig added a special factor to that despair as second city 
it has always had a great rivalry with berlin and resented the 
resources poured into the capital and denied the provinces 
residents complain of polluted air and decrepit peeling buildings 
side by side with a vibrant intellectual community are hundreds 
of thousands of workers toiling in outdated polluting factories 
and thoroughly discontent with the rewards 
for 28 years we allowed ourselves to be oppressed said 
maria mueller 43 from a small town outside leipzig she has been 
marching for more democracy for the past eight mondays 
they exploited us she said of the communists they 
grumble about capitalism but they are much worse and when i saw 
the police lined up here oct 9 i thought we got another 1938 
when the nazis assumed power the only difference was the 
uniforms 
such strong sentiments feed opposition hopes that the peaceful 
revolution can achieve much more than last weekends massive 
eastwest border bash 
after 40 years in the ghetto the lid is off and of course 
the people want out fuehrer said 
but for me as a churchman things like the promise to an 
alternative to military service something we fought for for 28 
years are more important than drinking beer on the kudamm he 
said referring to west berlins main street 
the beer goes but these real changes remain every hand and 
thinking head is needed here now

the opening of east germanys borders has exposed 
troubling economic hazards for both germanys 
the sight of millions of east germans visiting west berlin gives 
a hint of the onslaught that could result if living standards fail 
to rise to meet the growing expectations of east germans 
east germany fears being further impoverished by west germans 
using hardcurrency clout to buy up property or subsidized goods in 
an accessible eastern market 
but deutsche bank chairman alfred herrhausen predicts that with 
marketoriented reforms im convinced that east germany can 
reach our western living standards within the next five to 10 
years 
herrhausens forecast and bonns promise of massive aid in the 
style of the postwar marshall plan demonstrate the strength of west 
german interest in rebuilding the east german economy 
but even with the best of intentions the east german problems 
may be insurmountable 
east germans can rarely be reached by phone from the west 
because the hopelessly insufficient network is subject to 
breakdowns and equipment shortages 
consumers wait years to buy smokespewing trabant and wartburg 
cars that are the butt of jokes in west germany where the wheels 
of preference are the luxury mercedes and bmw 
fresh fruit is seldom more than a memory in winter 
refrigerators tvs and vcrs can cost several months salary and 
break down two weeks later 
euphoria over travel freedom could quickly give way to 
frustration as east germans discover firsthand the vast difference 
between their meager burdened lifestyles and the prosperity of 
western neighbors 
and west germanys constitutionally mandated practice of 
granting citizenship to ethnic germans keeps the door wide open to 
permanent settlement in the west 
more than 200000 east germans have fled to west germany this 
year emptied of hope their nation could ever provide them with the 
life available next door 
the deluge has ebbed considerably since the stalinist controls 
on travel fell thursday but bonn recognizes the risks involved if 
reforms should fail 
economics minister helmut haussmann on tuesday offered an aid 
package for east germany if the new leadership converts to a market 
system but a leading east german economist karl morgenstern said 
a freemarket system is not the goal of his socialist state 
reformoriented leaders in east berlin have not indicated how or 
when they will consider the critical step toward conversion to a 
hardcurrency system even the most optimistic economists doubt a 
convertible east german mark could be achieved before the end of 
the century 
because the state needs to generate enough hard currency to buy 
priority equipment and commodities it is forced to sell goods for 
export at only 15 percent of the cost of production finance 
minister ernst hoefner disclosed monday 
limited hard currency also puts up an effective ban on travel to 
the west in the place of the physical one removed 
in principle the people are free to travel but in reality 
without the funds to do so they are still behind the barriers 
said manfred milzer an economist with the west german federal 
institute for economics research 
he said the west german government must kick in billions of 
marks to a travel fund to take the pressure off east berlin while 
it reforms industries 
major west german firms have long eyed the potential for joint 
ventures but most plans hinge on changes that are to far from 
socialist principles to be acceptable to the east german 
authorities 
erwin flick of siemens berlin division said the electronics 
giant would love to work with east germany to revamp the antiquated 
phone system 
but the conditions that have long hindered investment remain 
absolutely nothing in a legal or economic sense has changed 
flick said 
on the side of optimism however the automotive giant 
daimlerbenz plans to send a delegation to east germany within a 
few days to discuss the prospects for joint production of passenger 
cars said spokesman matthias kleinert in stuttgart 
some investors fear the exodus of young workers a body blow to 
the already laborshort state further damages the prospect for 
improving productivity 
east germany already had a critical demographic problem of an 
overaged population and the refugees have sharpened this 
development said wolfgang stinglwagner an economist with the 
intergerman affairs institute in bonn 
hoefner the east berlin finance minister disclosed the 
national debt was the equivalent of more than 70 billion worse 
than western economists had imagined 
east german officials and opposition activists alike have 
expressed fears that a hardcurrency hunger could result in a 
twoclass system in east germany those with foreign money and 
those without 
west german marks already command the best goods on the 
shortageplagued market and east germans are worried they could be 
bought out unless customs controls are invoked 
prime real estate in central berlin may be opened up on the east 
side if the communist government dismantles the berlin walls 
security zone that could ease the shortage of building land in 
both sectors of berlin 
but the east has too little money to embark on major new capital 
investments and western investors still lack the confidence in the 
stability of east german reforms to commit funds for construction

in a dispatch nov 2 the associated 
press identified 15 ethnic albanians on trial in kosovo province as 
separatists but neglected to attribute the term to certain 
authorities 
the 15 who include former kosovo communist party leader azem 
vlasi are charged with counterrevolutionary activities in 
connection with ethnic albanian protests in kosovo 
the term separatists has been applied to the 15 by some 
authorities in the yugoslav republic of serbia of which kosovo is 
part who claim the ethnic albanians sought to make the province 
part of neighboring albania the term should have been attributed 
to those authorities 
about 85 percent of kosovos population are albanians and most 
are described as favoring a restoration of the autonomy the claim 
they lost with recent constitutional changes but there is no 
evidence that the majority favors separating from yugoslavia to 
become part of albania

magnolias according to sally field 
there was one scene where dolly was by herself and she was 
supposed to be looking offcamera and giggling field said in 
decembers redbook 
to help her laugh we did things that would have caused us to 
be blackmailed forever they should have filmed us and released 
the footage to porno shops the crew crawled away in 
mortification she said 
parton said the director herbert ross seemed to have a hard 
time adjusting to the predominantly female cast which also 
includes shirley maclaine olympia dukakis and daryl hannah 
i think he was really scared working with all these women 
scared that wed all have pms premenstrual syndrome at the same 
time said parton herbert was hard on me because i wasnt as 
skilled in acting as the others he told me i couldnt act 
parton characteristically handled the criticism with aplomb 
i said well hell i know i cant act its your job to 
teach me how you hired me to make money for you

congress has acted to restrict the use of cia 
money to arm the noncommunist guerrillas fighting the 
vietnamesebacked government in cambodia according to a published 
report 
a bill awaiting final passage would prevent president bush from 
using the agencys contingency funds to send weapons to the 
guerrillas unless he first gets approval from congress the new 
york times reported in its wednesday editions 
ordinarily the administration does not need such approval to 
use cia contingency funds 
the restriction is part of a secret appendix to the military 
appropriations bill for the current fiscal year the times said 
the bill has emerged from a housesenate conference committee and 
is awaiting final action by both houses 
the noncommunist guerrillas in cambodia belong to two groups 
that are linked in a loose coalition with the communist khmer 
rouge which murdered up to 2 million people when it ruled cambodia 
between 1975 and 1979 
the united states opposes a return to power by the khmer rouge 
but favors the noncommunist resistance which vice president dan 
quayle has called the best hope to see a political settlement 
occur in cambodia the bush administration has been providing 
food medicine and other nonmilitary aid to the noncommunist 
guerrillas 
in september the state department said the noncommunist forces 
should be strengthened as a means of encouraging the phnom penh 
government to agree to share power at that time state department 
spokesman richard boucher declined to say whether the united states 
was attempting to strengthen the rebel groups with military aid 
key members of the congressional appropriations committees 
strongly oppose any american military aid to the guerrillas the 
times reported it quoted sen robert c byrd dwva as saying 
such aid could lead the united states into a major new military 
involvement in the wars of southeast asia

the us civil rights commission torn by 
internal feuding and under fire in congress would gain a sixmonth 
extension under legislation approved by the house judiciary 
committee 
the time has come in this country to put the petty bickering 
and the waste of the taxpayers money on the civil rights 
commission behind us rep james f sensenbrenner rwis told 
committee members tuesday 
the commission will go out of business nov 30 unless congress 
extends it republicans and democrats critical of the strife that 
has wracked the panel have so far been unable to agree on the 
length of the extension 
approved by the committee 259 was a democraticsponsored 
sixmonth extension that would keep on the front burner the 
question of how to reshape the commission and end its longrunning 
internal feuds 
the committee turned down a republican plan to allow the 
commission to go out of business for one day only thus allowing 
the bush administration to dump any members it opposes it then 
would be reconstituted for six years 
the republican plan offered by sensenbrenner was similar to a 
version recommended to the committee by the bush administration 
we should not ram through a sixyear bill in the closing days 
of this congress said rep don edwards dcalif chief 
supporter of the democratic version he said he had initially 
sought a oneyear extension but bowed to a proposal by sen paul 
simon dill to cut that time in half 
twentyfive years ago civil rights forces hailed the 
commissions hearings across the south its ringing reports on 
racial injustice and its bold legislative proposals it served as 
the conscience of the nation says ralph g neas executive 
director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
over the last six years however the commission has been 
snarled in fierce internal fighting lately democrats and 
republicans on capitol hill have joined in slashing its budget 
controversy has dogged commission member william b allen its 
former chairman he most recently came under fire for a speech to a 
conservative group the title was blacks animals homosexuals 
what is a minority 
allen who is black calls himself the only conservative on the 
commission and says he does not believe in coddling people 
in a 61 vote the commission branded the speech thoughtless 
disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory 
frankly it is a waste of the taxpayers money to continue the 
prattle that has been coming out of the commission for another six 
months sensenbrenner said we would be better off with no 
civil rights commission than with this civil rights commission 
hostile exchanges between allen and democratic commission member 
mary frances berry have been at the heart of the controversy he 
said 
rep barney frank dmass however told the committee that 
anyone who was committed to the cause of civil rights who did not 
spend a lot of time disagreeing with chairman allen would be 
derelict in his or her duty since he is one of the more bizarre 
public officials in my memory 
sensenbrenner retorted that berry has come up with some 
bizarre statements of her own he said it was urgently necessary 
to take action to turn around the course of the commission 
they have frankly made themselves into a national 
laughingstock he said

better safe than sorry is the motto of a 
public interest group that says americans should act as watchdogs 
for their own pension plans 
like millions of americans a large part of your savings may 
be in a pension fund says the washingtonbased pension rights 
center but a great dane or a german shepherd cant protect the 
money in your pension fund 
the center publishes a booklet which costs 6 titled 
protecting your pension money it outlines your rights as well 
as the rules that your pension plans administrator must follow 
free pamphlets on the same subject are available from the 
american association of retired persons and the labor department 
whether or not you have a pension plan is up to your employer 
only 46 percent of the nations privately employed fulltime 
workers are covered by private pension plans and only 40 million 
of the 76 million people covered by those plans are insured by the 
governments pension benefit guaranty corp 
pensions for employees working in offices or shops with fewer 
than 25 employees are not insured by the federal government 
retirement benefits are most commonly based on the number of 
years worked and final salary most plans have age and service 
requirements before an employee can participate and similar rules 
for when the pension can be collected 
the employee retirement income security act of 1974 known as 
erisa sets rules for pension plans 
all pension plans differ but overall you have the right to 
find out the overall status of your plan by requesting in 
writing from your employer a summary plan description outlining 
your companys plan 
ask your plan administrator for a copy of your employers 
summary annual report which details your companys finances 
obtain a copy of the companys form 5500 a more detailed 
financial report available on written request from the labor 
department 
those running your plan must follow a number of rules among the 
most important 
your plan managers are required to invest the money with your 
best interests in mind they may not make investments to benefit 
themselves or your employer if these conflict with your interests 
administrative costs of running your plan must be reasonable 
to hedge against risks managers cant put all the pension 
money into one investment such as a single stock or one piece of 
real estate 
if it appears the rules have been broken you should notify the 
labor departments pension and welfare administration if you 
suspect the administrators have taken loans from the plan or had 
conflicts of interest you should contact the employee plans 
division of the internal revenue service 
the federal bureau of investigation handles cases of kickbacks 
and embezzlement 
the most effective way to convince government investigators to 
take a look at your problem is to provide them with a short summary 
of the problems you have found together with the supporting 
documents the pension rights center says 
if you cannot convince a government agency to investigate your 
plan you might want to consider contacting a lawyer it says

prices of holiday turkeys will be down from a 
year ago but hams are going to be more expensive the agriculture 
department says 
consumers will find adequate supplies of turkey and ham for 
the holiday season the departments economic research service 
reported tuesday prices likely will be lower for turkeys but 
higher for hams than last year 
turkey production in the fourth quarter may be up about 12 
percent from a year ago with frozen inventories up slightly ham 
supplies are expected to decline slightly despite an increase in 
coldstorage stocks 
total red meat and poultry production is expected to set a 
record in 1989 and again in 1990 the report said among the 
major components only beef production may decline in 1989 
reflecting the reduced cattle inventory 
looking to 1990 the report said beef production may increase 
somewhat because of more cattle going into feedlots before 
slaughter resulting in more fed beef 
in both years pork output could remain relatively large 
the report said broiler output will continue to grow because 
of improved profits in recent years 
turkey production also is expected to grow but at a lower 
rate than broilers because returns are being squeezed 
for producers the report said more meat and poultry in 1990 
along with weaker growth in per capita income could put 
downward pressure on market prices 
increased red meats will be about offset by population 
growth the report added as a result prices of choicegrade 
steers and market hogs should be a little above 1989s average 
however with higher per capita output wholesale poultry prices 
are expected to decline moderately 
exports of beef and veal in 1989 could rise to a record of 1 
billion pounds up 46 percent from 1988 due largely to 
liberalization of the japanese market the report said an 
additional increase of 12 percent to 15 percent is expected in 1990 
comparatively total us beef production in 1989 is forecast at 
228 billion pounds and pork at 158 billion pounds 
imports of beef and veal mostly from australia and new zealand 
are expected to decline about 8 percent this year from their 1988 
level mostly due to smaller supplies in australia declines are 
likely in 1990 because of smaller new zealand shipments 
pork imports in 1989 are indicated at about 950 million pounds 
down 16 percent from 1988 but those may rise to about 1 billion 
pounds in 1990 if danish production continues to increase the 
report said 
us pork exports mostly to mexico and japan are expected to 
be about 240 million pounds this year up from 195 million in 1988 
those may decline to around 205 million pounds in 1990 
broiler exports may rise to a record of around 937 million 
pounds this year up 22 percent from 1988 most of the sales are 
commercial rather than under foreign aid and subsidy programs 
exports could decline slightly in 1990

the white house says president bushs 
opposition to abortion rights is not subject to change though 
he will campaign next week for a pair of prochoice house 
republicans 
the two reps lynn martin of illinois and claudine schneider of 
rhode island were among four gop women who met with bush on 
tuesday to press their point that the republican party should 
remain open to those who dont go along with bushs opposition to 
most abortions 
we could see the wheels of thought going through his mind 
said schneider i think he heard us 
the house meanwhile took a step in bushs direction on the 
question of federally funded abortions 
the appropriations committee approved new versions of two 
spending bills bush vetoed last month the new versions comply with 
bushs demand that they maintain a ban on federal funding for most 
abortions including cases of rape or incest however one measure 
still could draw bushs objections by allowing the district of 
columbia to use local money for abortions 
abortion rights leaders said they may continue their fight to 
loosen the restrictions on abortions for poor women at least in 
the senate 
but house speaker thomas s foley said it was time for the 
prochoice side to accept that bush will prevail for now and devote 
their energies toward another try next year 
without the votes to overturn that veto we have to face the 
fact that theres going to be a denial of funds foley said 
the president has to take responsibility for that decision 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
bush would speak at a fundraising event monday for martin and 
schneider who are planning 1990 races for senate seats in their 
respective states 
both have been advocates of abortion rights they are among 
republicans voicing concern that the partys antiabortion platform 
and identification with abortion foes hurt it in the oddyear 
elections last week and may do more damage in the 1990 elections 
abortion is not a test of support no matter what ones 
position is fitzwater said 
the president supports all republicans fitzwater said he 
supports republican candidates without regard to specific positions 
that differ from him he said bushs own views are based on his 
firm moral beliefs and they are not subject to change 
rep olympia snowe rmaine who also attended the meeting said 
the republicans gained no commitment from bush and did not expect 
him to reverse positions but she said they hoped there could 
be some gradations in his position in the future 
we certainly mentioned the fact we were concerned about the 
implications for our party snowe said we want to avoid 
political losses 
also attending was rep nancy johnson of connecticut 
bush supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw most 
abortions 
the appropriations panel approved without dissent the revised 
versions of a 157 billion bill for 1990 spending on labor 
education and health programs and a bill appropriating 558 
million for the district of columbia government bush vetoed both 
last month because of their more liberal abortion provisions 
the houses approval of the larger bill last month marked the 
first time in a decade it had voted to loosen a restriction on 
federally financed abortions except in the cases where the mothers 
life is in danger but the house failed by 51 votes to override 
bushs veto 
abortion opponents said they still objected to the dc bill 
however because it would permit the district government to use 
local money to pay for abortions for poor women bush objected to 
even that financing in his veto message and doug johnson lobbyist 
for the national right to life committee said the new version 
would invite yet another veto 
on still another abortion front the house backed away from a 
threatened bush veto on a foreign aid bill that includes 15 
million for the united nations population fund a family planning 
effort that opponents charge indirectly supports coerced abortions 
in china

senate majority leader george mitchell says he 
wants a comprehensive proposal to clean the nations air as the 
first legislation considered by senators when they return from a 
recess in late january 
mitchell said tuesday that the scheduling is a response 
accusations by president bush that the democraticled congress of 
moving too slowly on the bill 
bush introduced his clean air proposal in july calling it one 
of his top priorities and promising the plan would sharply reduce 
urban smog toxic chemical air pollution and acid rain by the end 
of the century 
bush asked congress to give him a clean air bill by the new 
year but sponsors of the legislation said from the start that the 
timetable likely would not be met 
moments after mitchell dmaine spoke to his colleagues on the 
senate environment subcommittee on environmental protection the 
panel completed work on clean air legislation and sent it to the 
full environment and public works committee 
earlier members of the subcommittee complained the panel was 
moving so fast they lacked time to study lastminute acid rain 
proposals 
the subcommittee which previously completed work on the urban 
smog and toxic chemical portions of the legislation approved acid 
rain language that incorporated much of bushs proposal 
the full committee will begin work thursday while senators 
began their consideration later than the house they have outpaced 
their counterparts the house energy and commerce committee is 
unlikely to take up the bill until next year because lawmakers plan 
to begin their recess this month 
the senate subcommittee accepted these bush proposals 
a 10 million ton reduction by the end of the century in sulfur 
dioxide the chief ingredient of acid rain 
a cap that would prevent any growth of acid rain emissions once 
reduction targets are met by jan 1 2000 
placing the cleanup burden on 107 of the nations dirtiest 
coalburning utilities mostly in the midwest 
a program of credits for utilities exceeding their reduction 
targets which could then be sold to utilities seeking to expand 
capacity 
other language authored by subcommittee chairman max baucus 
dmont would go beyond the administrations proposal 
a second main ingredient of acid rain nitrogen oxide would be 
reduced by 1 million tons by 2000 while the bush legislation would 
permit a 1 million ton increase also the baucus legislations 
reduction deadline is a year ahead of the administration date 
acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
that mixes in the atmosphere and is carried for hundreds of miles 
before falling in rain snow fog mist and as dry particles 
the pollution makes lakes and streams acidic killing aquatic 
life destroys trees and can be harmful to human health much of 
the pollution comes from utilities that burn high sulfur coal but 
other industrial facilities also contribute to the problem 
the most controversial language added by baucus would allow six 
states to postpone meeting acid rain reduction targets and to be 
assigned reductions more lenient than the rest of the country 
the language would apply to states that emitted less than 
150000 tons of sulfur dioxide in 1985 provided their utilities 
installed devices known as scrubbers to cut pollution the break 
would go to baucus state montana as well as north dakota 
wyoming utah new mexico and minnesota 
another baucus provision would repeal a 1977 requirement that 
new coalfired utilities install scrubbers the purpose is to allow 
use of low sulfur coal without requiring this expensive technology

the energy department bypassed the usual 
competitive bidding process in granting a 36 million consulting 
contract to avert a shutdown of key nuclear weapons plants 
according to government records 
the contract was given to bdm corp earlier this month for 
specialized technical and administrative support of the 
departments effort to handle radioactive wastes generated by the 
federal nuclear weapons complex according to an internal 
department memorandum made public tuesday by sen david pryor 
dark 
the document said that unless a bridge contract or 
extension of bdms original work agreement was granted for at 
least six months starting nov 1 at least three weapons production 
facilities might have been forced to close 
such a closure would have effectively paralyzed the production 
of nuclear arms 
the three sites are the rocky flats plant near denver that is 
the nations only producer of plutonium triggers for nuclear 
warheads the savannah river complex near aiken sc the sole 
source of tritium to boost the explosive power of warheads and the 
idaho national engineering laboratory near idaho falls which 
recovers enriched uranium from fuel used by naval and research 
reactors 
pryor sent a letter to energy secretary james d watkins 
outlining what pryor called excessive use of private consultants to 
do government work including drafting letters to congress and 
writing memos to field office managers pryor said this raised 
troubling questions about potential conflicts of interest 
i question if doe as a whole is serious in addressing this 
issue pryor wrote 
pryor who has criticized federal use of consultants and 
contractors for years said he was astounded to learn during an 
investigation by his staff that some weapons plants might have been 
forced to close if bdm were not kept on the departments payroll 
a document issued by the departments office of procurement 
operations said bdm was the only company which can provide the 
required continuity to carry out the waste management work it 
added only bdm staff through their 29 months of constant 
contact with the program is cognizant of the current status of 
each project 
that is total dependency on a major contractor for work that 
the governments own employees should be performing pryor said 
the energy department had no response tuesday to pryors remarks 
bdm said the appropriate officials to respond to questions were 
not available 
the documents released by pryor indicate that the energy 
department had used up its available work hours by bdm faster than 
planned thus an emergency bridge contract for 6 to 9 months 
was sought to continue the consultants work on various nuclear 
waste projects until a new longterm contract could be awarded 
the usual competitive bidding process for a new longterm 
contract was started july 7 but that process cannot be completed 
until at least next march the documents said 
a department memorandum to undersecretary john tuck dated oct 
31 said a decision to grant the emergency contract should take 
into account the likely publicity resulting from pryors staff 
investigation of the bdm matter 
it may be argued that the emergency award of a letter 
bridge contract modification demonstrates sen pryors point that 
the government is being performed by invisible contractors 
performing vital federal functions berton j roth of the 
directorate of procurement and assistance management said in the 
memo to tuck 
the memo indicates that tuck approved the emergency contract on 
oct 31

surreptitiously the aflcio smuggled aid into 
poland to keep the spirit of solidarity alive while lech walesa was 
under arrest and publicly very publicly walesa is thanking his 
benefactors 
on his visit to washington he kept tossing bouquets he threw a 
bear hug around a beaming brother kirkland lane kirkland 
president of the aflcio tuesday and thanked america for 
receiving him 
he sounded like a happy tourist 
it seems to me that no country has so many trees in the 
streets he marveled 
this shipyard electrician from gdansk went before the labor 
federation to revel in the bond of friendship between solidarity 
and the aflcio which had been shaped over the years both good 
and bad 
during walesas nineyear ordeal which has resulted in a 
noncommunist government peacefully taking power in warsaw 
kirkland arranged quietly to provide about 5 million in help 
the aflcio sent into poland the printing presses solidarity 
needed to circulate its message when the authorities discovered a 
press and seized it another would be delivered in the night 
in repayment walesa gave washington a piece of the action a 
hero to cheer while history unfolds in eastern europe 
official washington is officially cautious about events in the 
soviet bloc but even president bush could set aside prudence 
monday night and welcome a teary walesa as the spiritual 
godfather of a new generation 
to address his colleagues in the labor movement walesa stuck a 
union button in his lapel when he arrived the labor leaders stood 
and cheered him for 15 minutes 
he even brought a historic fact the first strike in american 
history in the jamestown colony in 1619 was staged by poles 
some of my countrymen glassworkers he said recalling 
that bit of labor history lit a flame of freedom and human 
dignity that is burning to this day at home in poland and here in 
the united states 
organized labor here has had its own bad years recently 
membership growth is stagnant fewer than one worker in six is 
unionized the strike against eastern airlines has been costly and 
ineffective praise from an international hero could hardly have 
been more welcome 
at a news conference walesa his words translated sentence by 
sentence pleaded for more help for a poland that he said is 
desperate and ripe for investment 
twothirds of its apartment houses he said are slums and its 
automobiles are antiques that pollute and gulp gasoline like 
monsters 
our children and grandchildren will laugh at us because we had 
poverty but tanks and missiles those were plentiful 
if american banks were willing to make loans when it was run by 
the communists he said they should be willing to help now 
in eastern europe everything is in short supply even or 
rather first and foremost time he said no one knows how much 
time we have left to reform our economy but we all feel it is not 
much if we fail to convince people that although things are 
changing perhaps too slowly they are nevertheless changing for the 
better then this breeze of freedom i spoke of will soon disappear 
leaving behind only a sense of bitterness accompanying 
unaccomplished dreams 
it will result in a defeat for us but not only for us 
when he finished speaking the union chiefs in his audience 
leaders of the garment workers the carpenters the teamsters the 
musicians the schoolteachers linked arms and serenaded him with 
an old union song whose title took on a new twist solidarity 
forever

makers of ltryptophan are suspending 
distribution and sales of the dietary supplement because of its 
possible link to a potentially fatal blood disorder an industry 
group says 
the council for responsible nutrition called for the temporary 
sales halt as a prudent and cautious course of action even 
though no link has been established between the nonprescription 
supplement and the disorder 
some companies started halting sales soon after the council 
called for the action tuesday afternoon said jb cordaro 
president of the washingtonbased council that represents 
nutritional supplement companies including most makers of 
ltryptophan he said he expected virtually all makers of the 
product to comply with the councils call by thursday 
officials were investigating 81 unconfirmed cases of the 
disorder known as eosinophilia in 17 states and the district of 
columbia according to the food and drug administration 
new mexico on monday banned ltryptophan oregons health 
division recommended the product be withdrawn and health officials 
in illinois and idaho recommended that people avoid using 
ltryptophan 
the councils action pertains to the food supplement that is 
sold in tablet and capsule form which is used for sleeplessness 
and premenstrual syndrome it does not cover multiingredient 
products that also contain ltryptophan 
this action should not be viewed as a product recall but an 
interim measure pending clarification of the causes of this 
outbreak the council said 
public health agencies investigating have not been able to 
establish a scientific basis or isolate medical evidence that links 
ltryptophan with this disorder the council said in addition 
to date fda and industry testing of ltryptophan products have not 
identified any product contamination 
a spokesman for the food and drug administration don mclearn 
said the agency was satisfied with the industrys action 
mclearn said that without a stronger causeandeffect link the 
fda has no authority to order a recall he said the strongest 
action the agency could take was announced saturday when it advised 
people taking ltryptophan to discontinue use of the product 
at least 12 different brands of ltryptophan have been 
identified as having been used by the individuals who became ill in 
recent weeks 
eosinophilia is marked by a higher than normal number of white 
blood cells known as eosinophils symptoms include severe muscle 
pain fever joint pain weakness swelling of the arms and legs 
and skin rash

an additional 32 billion to finance the bush 
administrations war on drugs is heading for the presidents desk 
after getting final congressional approval from the senate 
under the measure antidrug funds would climb to 88 billion 
this year 900 million more than requested by president bush on 
sept 5 in a nationally televised address outlining his plan of 
attack on narcotics 
approval of the funds represents the major congressional action 
on the drug issue thus far this year the house and senate are 
forming a fresh conference committee to try to resolve differences 
over nonmoney items including the administrations socalled 
andean strategy 
the funds were included in an overall 12 billion money bill for 
the transportation department in the fiscal year that began oct 1 
the rest of the transportation bill received final congressional 
approval from the senate last week with only the antidrug money 
drawing fire it was approved tuesday by unanimous consent without 
discussion 
all but a few details had been worked out between the 
administration and senate negotiators in september the conference 
committee last month dropped all nonmoney items but made only 
minor funding changes 
the house approved the money nov 1 on a voice vote 
included in the package is 1 billion for the federal prison 
system for buildings 308 million for law enforcement grants to 
state and local governments as well as 727 million for programs 
involving alcohol drug abuse and mental health 
the house on monday approved four bills containing the nonmoney 
items that had been detached from the package the senate on 
tuesday considered those four bills substituted its own version 
for the language approved by the house and sent the measures to a 
housesenate conference committee 
the primary measure would authorize military training and law 
enforcement assistance for bolivia colombia and peru under the 
administrations socalled andean strategy mexico and other 
countries also would receive aid under the proposal 
other measures would expand a drugfree schools program approved 
by congress earlier this year allow transfers out of the fund for 
assets seized from drug dealers and divide the alcohol drug abuse 
and mental health block grant program into separate programs for 
substance abuse and mental health 
the overall transportation bill permanently prohibits smoking 
aboard nearly all airline flights within the united states 
smoking would be allowed on flights originating in alaska or 
hawaii or bound for those states and scheduled to last longer than 
six hours about 28 out of 17500 daily us flights 
currently smoking is banned on flights lasting two hours or 
less the new rules would take effect 96 days after the measure is 
signed into law 
the same measure provides 12 billion for federal transportation 
programs for the new fiscal year the bill includes 307 million 
to subsidize air carriers that serve small towns and a 40 million 
down payment to build a new airport in denver the first new us

legislation to force federal authorities to 
restrict the shipment of food in rail cars or trucks that also ship 
garbage or hazardous materials is proceeding through the house 
the energy and commerce subcommittee on transportation tourism 
and hazardous materials approved the legislation tuesday after 
testimony last week described a practice known as backhauling 
backhauling intended to increase the revenues of shippers 
means carrying a cargo on the return trip after making an original 
shipment 
recent hearings and news reports have documented how shippers 
bringing food from the midwest to the east have carryied return 
loads of garbage because eastern landfills are overflowing 
the bill would require the administration to determine which 
cargoes may be backhauled and what procedure are needed to clean 
the vehicles when backhauling is permitted 
subcommittee chairman thomas a luken dohio said the bill is 
intended to give flexibility to regulators 
this is not intended to be a veto or elimination of any 
backhauling he said we dont want to foul up or create 
blockades within the food distribution system 
luken represents cincinnati where kroger a major supermarket 
chain has its headquarters 
the bill is part of larger legislation dealing with hazardous 
shipments including the safety of hazardous chemical shipments by 
rail the spinoff bill was created because of publicity generated 
by the hearing 
today the public works and transportation surface 
transportation subcommittee is putting the final touches on related 
legislation and the full committee is scheduled to vote on it 
thursday 
the bill sponsored by rep bill clinger rpa forbids 
backhauling of municipal solid waste in refrigerated food trucks 
and forbids mixed use of tank trucks or cars for hauling both food 
and nonfood items

congress is moving rapidly to reinforce 
polands dramatic political and economic changes with us dollars 
creating a threeyear 657 million aid program and providing the 
first hard cash to back up that promise 
the senate voted 990 on tuesday to support new business 
enterprisesstabilize currency provide emergency food and 
encourage democratic institutions in poland on the eve of 
solidarity labor leader lech walesas speech to a joint meeting of 
congress the measure also included 81 million in aid for hungary 
lech walesa this is for you and a free poland said sen 
paul simon dill a primary sponsor of the aid measure 
both poland and hungary have been in the forefront of the wave 
of reform sweeping eastern europe that includes radical opening of 
political institutions and restructuring of economies along western 
lines 
at the same time the house moved to put the first dollars into 
the new program voting 32493 for a foreign aid bill that includes 
293 million in the current year along with another 240 million 
in standby credit and trade insurance 
the house measure a 146 billion bill providing us aid to 
allies around the globe also offered up to 85 million for el 
salvadors besieged military and 125 million to help andean 
countries fight the drug war 
but the money bill was the subject of a white house veto threat 
because of a provision growing out of the irancontra scandal 
which would bar use of foreign aid to entice other countries to 
carry out policies contrary to us law the administration 
believed the language would tie its hands in dealings with allies 
another potentially contentious issue in the 146 billion bill 
was defused when the house voted 219 to 203 to give president bush 
the right to withhold 15 million for the united nations population 
fund if he finds the agency supports forced abortions or 
sterilizations in china the measure now goes to the senate 
for poland and hungary major elements of the appropriations 
measure included a 200 million grant to help stabilize polands 
battered economy and 45 million for a private enterprise 
development fund other money would go for environmental cleanup 
agriculture and educational and cultural exchanges 
the bill creating the longterm aid program represented an 
apparent truce in a game of oneupsmanship between the white house 
and congressional democrats over who could provide the biggest 
reward to poland bush had proposed a 455 million program which 
was immediately labeled timid by democrats who proposed 
upwards of 1 billion in aid 
as passed by the senate the measure offers 200 million in 
currency stabilization 400 million in enterprise funds and 125 
million in food aid recognizing polands serious economic problems 
and a reform plan advanced to address them the bill allocates 657 
million for that country over three years hungary would receive 
81 million 
overall the foreign aid appropriations bill included 47 
billion in military aid and 32 billion in economic aid for us 
friends and allies around the world 
among major earmarks for countries in the bill were 3 billion 
for israel and 21 billion for egypt always the largest aid 
recipients because of their participation in the camp david peace 
process 
other large recipients included pakistan with 460 million in 
military and economic aid turkey 500 million in military aid

a package of reforms for the scandalplagued 
department of housing and urban development is heading for the 
senate after winning house approval 
the house agreed overwhelmingly on a voice vote tuesday evening 
to approve the hud reform package which includes proposals from 
secretary jack kemp as well as others arising from a congressional 
investigation of the departments multibilliondollar scandals 
i believe the bill allows us to get the hud scandals behind 
us said rep henry gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house 
committee that approved the measure 
the action came after his panel the house banking subcommittee 
on housing and community development last week stripped away a 
larger proposal to revamp federal housing programs some democrats 
had hoped to keep the two linked as a way to force congressional 
action on the housing program revision 
the bill requires that consultants and lobbyists working on hud 
programs register with the department and identify for whom they 
are working as well as any fees they receive civil penalties 
would be imposed for those who fail to comply and recipients of 
hud grants would have to report their use of consultants and 
lobbyists 
other provisions 
create a new hud chief financial officers position as well as 
a comptroller of the federal housing administration to oversee 
financial management it includes reforms in the fhainsured 
mortgage program including a prohibition on loans for second homes 
apply new restrictions on the section 8 moderate rehabilitation 
program which provided subsidies for renovating lowincome housing 
that were at the heart of evidence of influencepeddling and 
political favoritism in the hud scandals the bill limits the 
number of housing units that may be subsidized per project to 100 
authorize 25 million for hud to monitor and evaluate its 
programs less than the onehalf of 1 percent of program spending 
or about 100 million that kemp sought 
require full disclosure of hud funding decisions and place 
restrictions on accounts for which the secretary has discretionary 
authority 
increase from 60 percent to 75 percent the amount of assistance 
under the community development block grant that must be used for 
projects benefiting the poor kemp had proposed an even tighter 
requirement that spending go for the poor 
restrict the administrations ability to fire the departments

a convicted drug dealer says the only way to 
stop the cocaine trade is to destroy the coca crop in south america 
cut off the snakes head and the snake will die he said 
go after the crop or the chemicals that process the coca i dont 
think anything else will do any good 
the witness who wore a black hood to conceal his identity 
mr witness the congressmen called him insisted to a 
skeptical house subcommittee tuesday that stepped up efforts to 
interdict the drug flow are fruitless 
wiping out the coca crop in colombia and surrounding south 
american nations might result in substitute crops springing up in 
other regions of the world he said adding that such a move would 
buy time 
what we need now is a breather it would take two to three 
years to reestablish a useable crop of coca he said during 
that time we could take steps to see that it is not done 
such a move he said would be more practical than what were 
doing now 
the witness arrested in 1985 after several years of overseeing 
huge cocaine shipments from colombia to miami said nothing can 
stop the flow of cocaine once the coca crop is harvested and 
processed into the drug 
he said the drug importing cartels can change their tactics 
instantly to circumvent us enforcement moves 
for example he said if efforts are concentrated on sealing off 
borders along the gulf coast the importers say well let you 
have fun there well bring the stuff through california 
the witness was accompanied by a group of federal marshals 
during his appearance before the house banking subcommittee on 
financial institutions supervision regulation and insurance his 
voice was distorted electronically to help protect his identity 
he said he is convinced the people of colombia would support 
eradication of coca crops if the united states provided economic 
aid for poor coca farmers to replace their lost income 
the cartel had the popular support of the people but not 
now he said all these bombings and raids have done more to 
hurt the common man than anyone else 
he said he didnt know anything about money laundering the 
subcommittees main area of jurisdiction in drug laws but 
suggested currency financial restrictions arent as important as 
several subcommittee members believe

the state department says the soviet union has 
cut its defense spending but the pentagon says it cant provide an 
estimate until the year is over 
its too early to give a final estimate of soviet defense 
spending for 1989 state department spokeswoman margaret d 
tutwiler said tuesday however it does appear that soviet 
defense spending this year is less than it was last year 
the bush administration has seen evidence of cuts in soviet 
defense efforts including reductions in the production of 
conventional weapons she said 
we have also seen withdrawals of conventional weapons and 
troops from eastern europe and mongolia ms tutwiler said 
cia estimates of soviet military spending show a 15 percent 
decline for this year and intelligence officials project a decline 
of 7 percent for 1990 the washington post reported in its 
wednesday editions citing anonymous sources 
last week at an arms control seminar near queenstown md a 
us official told reporters that the soviets had cut tank 
production and slowed production of typhoon nuclear submarines 
the official who could not be identified under seminar rules 
said there was credible evidence of a cutback in tank output 
but pentagon spokesman pete williams echoing statements made 
earlier this week by defense secretary dick cheney disputed 
reports the soviets had slowed the modernization of some longrange 
nuclear weapons or had evidence of cutbacks in conventional arms 
theres obviously no way of knowing for sure what spending for 
89 is until 1989 is over williams said 
however ms tutwiler said the experts believe there have 
been reductions 
house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis said 
two weeks ago that soviet president mikhail gorbachev had basically 
fulfilled his pledge to reduce tank divisions in eastern europe 
gorbachev promised last december to withdraw six divisions over 
two years aspin who recently visited the soviet union and eastern 
europe said regiments amounting to three divisions had been 
withdrawn 
gorbachev also promised to cut military spending by 14 percent 
and to remove 500000 men from the soviet armed forces

supporters of a law requiring all new bottles 
and cans of alcoholic beverages to carry a warning directed at 
drivers and pregnant women are complaining that the warning is too 
small 
its almost impossible to read sen albert gore dtenn 
said tuesday pointing at a sample beer bottle the atf has 
purposely allowed the industry to come up with a label that is 
illegible 
gore was joined by sen strom thurmond rsc and several 
public and private medical officials in lambasting the treasury 
departments bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms for allowing 
distillers and brewers to print the warning in small narrow type 
half the size of newspaper type in many cases 
under the law that becomes effective saturday the label of each 
can or bottle of alcoholic beverages must carry these words 
government warning 1 according to the surgeon general women 
should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of 
the risk of birth defects 2 consumption of alcoholic beverages 
impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery and may 
cause health problems 
thurmond and gore said the first part of the warning is 
especially necessary because many americans remain unaware that 
alcohol is the leading recognizable cause of mental retardation in 
infants 
under the atfs temporary regulation implementing the law the 
warning may be affixed virtually anywhere on a bottle or can 
dot koester a spokeswoman for the atf took note of the 
criticism and said remember this is a temporary rule we hope 
to get our final regulations out before the end of the year and 
certainly well be considering everybodys complaints 
alcoholic beverages bottled or canned as of saturday must have 
the new warning not those already on the shelves even for beer 
it could take months for the new labels to turn up in stores 
frederick k goodwin administrator of the alcohol drug abuse 
and mental health association said fetal alcohol syndrome a 
cluster of irreversible birth defects affects 22 of every 1000 
infants born in the united states it ranks ahead of downs 
syndrome and spina bifida as a cause of mental retardation he said 
goodwin stressed there is no known safe level of alcohol 
consumption for pregnant women 
james c sanders president of the beer institute an industry 
lobbying arm said we believe the information on the labels 
should have little or no impact since the risks of alcohol abuse 
are common knowledge to the public the temporary regulations for 
the size and placement of the labels are reasonable however we 
will comply with whatever final regulations are issued

the white house says president bushs 
opposition to abortion rights is not subject to change though 
he will campaign next week for a pair of prochoice house 
republicans 
the two reps lynn martin of illinois and claudine schneider of 
rhode island were among four gop women who met with bush on 
tuesday to press their point that the republican party should 
remain open to those who dont go along with bushs opposition to 
most abortions 
we could see the wheels of thought going through his mind 
said schneider i think he heard us 
the house meanwhile took a step in bushs direction on the 
question of federally funded abortions 
the appropriations committee approved new versions of two 
spending bills bush vetoed last month the new versions comply with 
bushs demand that they maintain a ban on federal funding for most 
abortions including cases of rape or incest however one measure 
still could draw bushs objections by allowing the district of 
columbia to use local money for abortions 
abortion rights leaders said they may continue their fight to 
loosen the restrictions on abortions for poor women at least in 
the senate 
but house speaker thomas s foley said it was time for the 
prochoice side to accept that bush will prevail for now and devote 
their energies toward another try next year 
without the votes to overturn that veto we have to face the 
fact that theres going to be a denial of funds foley said 
the president has to take responsibility for that decision 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
bush would speak at a fundraising event monday for martin and 
schneider who are planning 1990 races for senate seats in their 
respective states 
both have been advocates of abortion rights they are among 
republicans voicing concern that the partys antiabortion platform 
and identification with abortion foes hurt it in the oddyear 
elections last week and may do more damage in the 1990 elections 
abortion is not a test of support no matter what ones 
position is fitzwater said 
the president supports all republicans fitzwater said he 
supports republican candidates without regard to specific positions 
that differ from him he said bushs own views are based on his 
firm moral beliefs and they are not subject to change 
rep olympia snowe rmaine who also attended the meeting said 
the republicans gained no commitment from bush and did not expect 
him to reverse positions but she said they hoped there could 
be some gradations in his position in the future 
we certainly mentioned the fact we were concerned about the 
implications for our party snowe said we want to avoid 
political losses 
also attending was rep nancy johnson of connecticut 
bush supports a constitutional amendment to outlaw most 
abortions 
the appropriations panel approved without dissent the revised 
versions of a 157 billion bill for 1990 spending on labor 
education and health programs and a bill appropriating 558 
million for the district of columbia government bush vetoed both 
last month because of their more liberal abortion provisions 
the houses approval of the larger bill last month marked the 
first time in a decade it had voted to loosen a restriction on 
federally financed abortions except in the cases where the mothers 
life is in danger but the house failed by 51 votes to override 
bushs veto 
abortion opponents said they still objected to the dc bill 
however because it would permit the district government to use 
local money to pay for abortions for poor women bush objected to 
even that financing in his veto message and doug johnson lobbyist 
for the national right to life committee said the new version 
would invite yet another veto 
on still another abortion front the house backed away from a 
threatened bush veto on a foreign aid bill that includes 15 
million for the united nations population fund a family planning 
effort that opponents charge indirectly supports coerced abortions 
in china

president is blocking the education secretary from doing a good 
job 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif told reporters tuesday at the 
national press club i feel rather presumptive in grading the 
president but ive been asked to do so he then harshly 
criticized bush who pledged to become the education president 
if elected 
there is not a single accomplishment initiative or 
educational credit with which the president can be identified even 
if the summit is so regarded said hawkins referring to the 
recent twoday meeting of bush and the nations governors that 
resulted in a push for national performance goals 
however hawkins was kinder to education secretary lauro 
cavazos noting he and i are very very friendly 
i think hes a fine honorable man i think he has good 
motives said hawkins i think that if he was not restrained 
he probably would do very well i think under the restraints he 
cant 
hawkins said cavazos is being hampered by policies pushed by the 
office of management and budget and the white house which i 
think differ diametrically from his own philosophy

plymouth rock the boulder marking the 
spot where the pilgrims landed 369 years ago is in danger of 
splitting in two but a mason says hell preserve it in time for 
thanksgiving 
i dont look at it as a job i look at it as a privilege to 
preserve something that means a lot to people all over the united 
states said paul choquette 42 of south dartmouth who planned 
to start work on the rock today 
he bid 1 to win the contract to patch up the historic landmark 
where pilgrims are said to have first set foot on american land in 
1620 
ronald hirschfeld a geotechnical engineer hired by the states 
department of environmental management to analyze the rock has 
concluded that the rocks crack will worsen if left unattended 
it would look terribly embarrassing if it split in half 
said peter oneil a department spokesman 
the crack first appeared in 1774 when the 6ton boulder was 
dropped during an attempt to move it to the town square breaking 
it in two 
the smaller piece was used for the town display but because 
tourists kept chipping away at the monument guardians of the rock 
decided to glue it back to its partner in 1880 
that job has stood up to the tides that occasionally submerge 
the rock which is 14 feet wide and 6 feet long and stands in a 
halfenclosed protective structure in the waters off of this 
seaside town 
the mortar however is deteriorating state and town officials 
fear water that seeps into the rock will freeze causing further 
fissures or worse 
the main crack is about 2 feet long choquette said repairs 
could be completed in one day 
he said hes not using hightech glues or epoxy because 
scientists want to be able to undo his work without damaging the 
rock if more substantial repairs become necessary 
he has prepared a special mortar mixed to match the color and 
consistency of the 19th century repairs but he declined to reveal 
his mix beyond saying it contained small pebbles 
choquette a mason for 22 years said he also will fix a series 
of hairline cracks that have developed within the main fracture and 
in some other areas of the rock the smaller cracks were caused by 
the vibrations of the tourist buses that rumble over the road about 
5 feet from the landmark he said 
two masons submited bids choquette was chosen after the other 
mason asked for about 100 
it just makes me feel good choquette said its just 
knowing what it stands for its a symbol of freedom and how 
america supposedly started off

three studies provide new dramatic evidence 
that people with heart disease who cut down on cholesterol can 
actually begin to clean out the clogged arteries that threaten 
their lives 
all three studies show that whether you use diet or drugs you 
can lower cholesterol dramatically said dr basil m rifkind of 
the national heart lung and blood institute the greater your 
reduction in cholesterol the greater your reduction in heart 
disease 
cholesterol kills by plugging up the blood vessels that feed the 
hearts own muscle the latest studies show that when people take 
cholesterollowering medicines or go on strict vegetarian diets 
they can stop new fatty deposits from building up in their arteries 
often they can actually turn back the clock eliminating some of 
the damage of a lifetime of too much cholesterol 
we are excited about these results said dr daniel 
steinberg of the university of california san diego they 
strengthen our resolve to try to save more lives by lowering 
cholesterol 
the studies were cited by some of the nations top heart experts 
as they sought to quiet doubts that have been raised about the 
wisdom or need of lowering everyones cholesterol 
the three reports were presented tuesday at the annual 
scientific meeting of the american heart association along with a 
joint statement by the heart association and the heart institute 
the report called the cholesterol facts was intended to 
rebut a september article in atlantic monthly 
in the article the cholesterol myth washingtonbased 
writer thomas j moore argued there is no firm proof that lowering 
blood cholesterol levels saves lives or that people live longer by 
changing what they eat the doctors countered that evidence to the 
contrary is overwhelming 
their pointbypoint challenge of moores report concluded that 
the evidence more than justifies the current national campaign 
for cholesterol control 
six of the nations most prominent heart experts presented the 
joint statement and outlined the case against cholesterol 
if you give the message that cholesterol is a myth it is 
wrong it is important that we detect and treat it said dr john 
c larosa of george washington university 
moore could not be reached to respond there was no answer at 
his washington office the only location his publisher said he 
could be reached at 
the doctors cited 36 different studies including several not 
mentioned in moores article they said he had ignored some of the 
most persuasive data including animal and population studies and 
misread other research 
there is overwhelming data that in addition to lessening your 
heart attack risk in your 40s 50s and 60s you will live a little 
longer by following a better diet said another panel member dr 
william castelli of the framingham heart study in suburban boston 
two of the studies presented tuesday relied on medicines to 
lower cholesterol in people at a high risk of heart trouble 
dr greg brown of the university of washington put people on two 
combinations of cholesterollowering drugs over five years the 
fatty buildups shrank in 35 percent and got bigger in 23 percent 
dr david blankenhorn and colleagues from the university of 
southern california also found a significant slowing of the disease 
in people treated for four years with cholesterol medicine 
in the third study dr dean ornish of the university of 
california san francisco put subjects on strict vegetarian diets 
and had them participate in exercise and relaxation programs after 
one year 82 percent showed overall regression of artery deposits 
even though these and many other studies were conducted on 
people at the highest risk of heart trouble the doctors contended 
that sensible eating and lower cholesterol are good for everyone 
not only does diet make a difference it is the major approach 
to cholesterol lowering across the board said dr scott m 
grundy of the university of texas in dallas

for those who enjoy a drink or two each day 
the latest news from medical research is bad especially if they 
are over age 50 
the research suggests that drinking causes dangerous enlargement 
of the heart and the doctors who conducted the study say it 
convinces them that older people should give up booze entirely for 
the sake of their hearts 
the study found an association between alcohol consumption and 
enlargement of the left ventricle the hearts main pumping chamber 
even the smallest doses of alcohol seem to have some effect on 
left ventricular mass said dr teri a manolio of the national 
institutes of health in bethesda md 
the findings were based on information from 1968 men and 2505 
women who took part in the framingham heart study in suburban 
boston 
age is also a factor said manolio and our conclusion is 
that anyone past the age of 50 or so and certainly anyone who 
already has an enlarged heart would be better off not drinking at 
all 
left ventricular enlargement is associated with dangerous 
irregular heart rhythms the more ventricular size increases the 
greater the risk of heart failure and death 
the link was most pronounced in men while womens hearts appear 
to be less susceptible to the bad effects of alcohol the 
researchers said this may simply be because women typically drink 
less than men 
the research was presented tuesday at the annual scientific 
meeting of the american heart association

with the coveted batvideos 
fans also lined up elsewhere 
we sold 100 within the first 40 minutes said todd gerber 
department supervisor at tower video in nashville tenn 
but as the videocassette was released nationally at midnight 
tuesday its expected blockbuster sales were making some in the 
entertainment industry as grim as the caped crusader himself 
batman is still playing in more than 500 north american 
theaters according to the latest boxoffice figures the 
blockbuster movies speedy arrival in cassette form could mean 
those cinemas are out of luck and customers 
you can look at the lines in the video stores and think that 
those people would be going to the theaters if that were the only 
source for the movie said randy hester an executive of the 
640theater cinemark usa chain in dallas 
the video release will really hurt discount houses where 
batman is now playing said hester who couldnt estimate the 
revenue loss

after replacing a flawed computer on its 
last unmanned rocket nasa set saturday for the launch of the first 
of several satellites that will reveal an unbelievable view of 
the universe 
hold on to your hats because this is going to shake up the 
world of science program scientist larry caroff said of the 
cosmic background explorer spacecraft and four observatories that 
will be placed in earth orbit during the 1990s 
saturdays launch of the 150 million explorer spacecraft the 
centerpiece of a 400 million mission is going to begin an 
explosion of knowledge about the universe program manager david 
gilman told reporters tuesday at the space agencys jet propulsion 
laboratory 
the 4850pound explorer will provide clues to the development 
of the universe by measuring radiation left over from the big 
bang the explosion scientists say created the universe 15 
billion years ago 
gilman said the explorer will be followed by the launches of 
what nasa calls its great observatories the hubble space 
telescope next march the gamma ray observatory in june the 
advanced xray astrophysics facility in 1997 and the space infrared 
telescope facility in 1999 
these are going to provide us with an unprecedented 
unbelievable view of the universe caroff said in an interview 
we will see things we havent even imagined 
the explorer is scheduled for launch from vandenberg air force 
base during a 30minute period starting at 624 am pst saturday 
said roger mattson project manager at nasas goddard space flight 
center in greenbelt md 
the launch had been scheduled for friday then was delayed until 
sunday because of a malfunctioning rocket guidance computer but 
the computer was replaced so quickly last weekend that the launch 
was moved again said peter eaton a nasa rocket official 
the solarpowered satellite will be carried into a nearpolar 
orbit by a 116foottall delta rocket the last unmanned 
expendable rocket ever to be launched by the national aeronautics 
and space administration 
nasa will continue to launch manned shuttles and possibly 
unmanned cargo shuttles with reusable boosters but air force or 
private companies will charge nasa to launch any payloads that 
require unmanned expendable rockets 
after a 30day shakedown in orbit the explorer will spend up to 
two years measuring cosmic background radiation which makes up 
about 2 percent of the static on a television set it includes 
microwaves heat and other electromagnetic radiation given off by 
the big bang 
the explorer will measure the collective glow of all the stars 
and galaxies and whatever else has been there since the 
beginning project scientist john mather said 
he said nasa will share information from the mission with the 
soviet union which has flown one similar research mission and 
plans two others

the astronauts aboard next months 
space shuttle mission hope to return home with a bussize christmas 
present a satellite carrying a bounty of space experiments begun 
nearly six years ago 
columbias five astronauts scheduled to begin their 10day 
flight dec 18 are charged with the task of retrieving what nasa 
calls the long duration exposure facility 
the 11ton 30footlong payload carrying 57 experiments was 
placed in orbit during a 1984 shuttle mission it was to be 
retrieved in a year but that plan was scuttled due to schedule 
changes and the challenger explosion in 1986 that killed all seven 
crew members 
the craft is falling from orbit and is expected to crash back 
into the earths atmosphere in february if the columbia astronauts 
dont snatch it 
we hope that even though well be gone from our families and 
loved ones for christmas that well be able to bring back a great 
big christmas present commander dan brandenstein said tuesday 
the other crew members are pilot james wetherbee and mission 
specialists bonnie dunbar marsha ivins and g david low they 
spoke at a news conference and in interviews tuesday at the johnson 
space center 
more than 200 scientists have been waiting years to see how 
their science technology and materials experiments have fared 
during the long exposure to the space environment such information 
could be used to build a planned space station or other longterm 
spacecraft 
the vehicle is invaluable to us said the missions flight 
director al pennington almost every material known has been 
sitting up there in space being bombarded by atomic oxygen and 
other space materials for six years 
low said if the crew doesnt snag the satellite it will be a 
loss to science and a blow to us prestige the crew will attempt 
to retrieve the payload on the missions fourth day 
its a completely passive satellite and no data has been 
transmitted to earth low said so its a complete loss of that 
mission if we dont get it back 
the chances of satellite chunks hitting anything on earth are 
remote because it flies mostly over oceans he said 
but i think its poor form to let something like that come 
back low said 
the crew also will deploy a navy communications satellite 
to track down the old satellite brandenstein and wetherbee will 
complete a complex set of maneuvers dunbar is in charge of using a 
60foot robot arm to grab it and pull it into the cargo bay 
columbia will follow another holiday shuttle flight into space 
a secret defense department mission to be flown by a fiveman 
discovery crew is scheduled to lift off nov 22 the night before 
thanksgiving

rebels today tried to fan the 
flames of their 4dayold offensive into a popular insurrection 
president alfredo cristiani called the insurgent push the act of 
a desperate beast 
both cristianis rightist administration and the marxistled 
farabundo marti national liberation front claimed widespread 
popular support more than 500 people have been reported killed and 
1000 wounded in the fighting 
the government battled guerrillas holding poor districts on the 
capitals northern outskirts on tuesday the militarys helicopter 
gunships pouring fire on at least one workingclass neighborhood 
thousands of residents remained trapped in their homes by the 
heavy fighting and civilian casualties were high the government 
declared a 24hour curfew in seven northern neighborhoods where 
guerrilla fighters had dug in 
fighting was also reported in eastern provinces to which travel 
is restricted 
rebel commander ana guadalupe martinez speaking early today on 
the insurgents clandestine radio venceremos said the guerrillas 
had declared more than a quarter of the massachusettssized country 
liberated 
she said revolutionary committees had been set up in dozens of 
towns 
we call on the popular committees to give priority to the task 
of supporting the combatants to form militias to construct 
workshops of popular armament to collect food medicine and 
bandages and organize the means of getting them to the combat 
zones she said 
cristiani said the offensive begun saturday night has been a 
failure for the guerrillas 
the harshest blow to them has been the repudiation of the 
people he said in a speech broadcast nationwide tuesday night 
this the offensive is the act of a desperate beast 
the combat a state of siege a dusktodawn curfew and a 
guerrillaimposed road transport ban made circulation difficult at 
times impossible 
these conditions hampered efforts to gauge the degree to which 
the general population was being swayed toward either side 
the streets were deserted overnight for the third straight night 
red flares dropped by helicopters drifted over the mejicanos 
neighborhood and tracerlaced bursts from the gunships 30caliber 
machine guns sporadically blasted the workingclass district 
mejicanos was one of several neighborhoods on the capitals 
periphery where insurgents were entrenched 
the fighting was been the fiercest since the rebels final 
offensive of january 1981 failed to win them power 
at least 500 people have been killed in the battle of san 
salvador with nearly double that number wounded according to the 
military hospitals and morgue reports 
a 10yearold civil war between the rebels and a succession of 
usbacked governments has claimed an estimated 70000 people 
most of them civilians 
rebel leaders ordered the offensive after announcing they would 
not participate in peace talks scheduled for next week in 
venezuela they said cristianis government was not negotiating 
seriously and blamed it for the oct 31 bombing of a union 
headquarters that killed 10 people and wounded 29 
two leftist political leaders who had been operating publicly 
since late 1987 took refuge in the mexican and venezuelan 
embassies the leaders guillermo ungo and ruben zamora have not 
asked for asylum and are described by their hosts as guests 
many leaders of union peasant and student organizations 
considered guerrilla fronts by the government have gone underground 
this week 
cristiani a rightist who took office june 1 said government 
forces had neutralized insurgents on san salvadors 
southeastern southern and western periphery but that combat 
continued with dugin rebels on the northern outskirts 
the army is advancing but advancing slowly he said he 
accused the guerrillas of holding civilians hostage and of 
using them as screens against army counteroffensives 
there is no danger whatever of the government being toppled 
he said 
cristiani denied air force planes and helicopters had bombarded 
civilian zones where the guerrillas are dug in he acknowledged 
that rebel positions were strafed 
gen humberto larios minister of defense said helicopters have 
fired rockets at guerrilla positions 
nearly 100 civilians have been killed and more than 680 wounded 
in san salvador since saturday night many reportedly casualties of 
air attacks 
the new yorkbased human rights organization americas watch on 
tuesday called on both the armed forces and the rebels to respect 
the articles of the geneva conventions obliging belligerents to 
take all measures possible to prevent civilian casualties 
pedro varela spokesman for the salvadoran red cross said the 
local organization had appealed to the international red cross in 
geneva to mediate a 72hour truce between the government and the 
guerrilla command 
he said the international red cross agreed to try to arrange the 
measure which would be used to evacuated wounded and civilians 
from combat zones

bernard barnie akers one of the 
original duncan yoyo men who died at age 80 was remembered as a 
man with a smile on his face and a yoyo in each hand 
akers died friday at a huntington hospital a memorial service 
has not been scheduled 
akers uncle donald f duncan popularized the toy in america 
during the great depression and set up an exhibition schedule with 
dozens of men traveling from towntotown telling stories and 
selling yoyos 
stuart crump editor of yoyo times a washington dcbased 
magazine for yoyo enthusiasts said tuesday that akers was one of 
the best 
he was probably the most important link with the great yoyo 
years crump said he actually almost singlehandedly created 
the yoyo contest a competition designed to increase yoyo sales 
i will remember him with a smile on his face and two yoyos in 
his hands said crump who last saw akers last winter while in 
charleston to record music to yoyo by 
akers never married he said in an interview last summer that a 
yoyo mans life like the toy is up and down 
i had a few girlfriends but they didnt realize that if you 
do something like this 10 months a year it gets tiring i would 
travel 800 miles in a day just to get to a new market akers said 
if you get married a woman thinks she would like that like 
it was a twoweek vacation not many would like it not for 50 
years 
akers had surgery for prostate problems during the summer and 
fought lymphoma he died in the hospital but his brother 
franklin another yoyo man who left the trade said he believed 
akers died of a weak heart 
barnie akers didnt like calling the yoyo a toy saying it 
taught too many skills like eyeandhand coordination and 
discipline 
in his spiels he used to give a history of the yoyo telling 
how ancient vases discovered in greece show wooden knobs suspended 
on strings 
go back before the birth of christ and you can see how the 
string is tied on their fingers akers said

a lawyer who began kidney dialysis 18 
years ago because he had good medical insurance and was considered 
a worthy risk for treatment eventually became a crusader for others 
less fortunate 
but now 48yearold paul feinsmith finds himself in need 
on tuesday he was in pittsburgh awaiting a liver and kidney 
transplant his only hope against liver cancer but medicare the 
federal insurance program that pays medical costs for people with 
advanced kidney disease excludes coverage of liver transplants 
so after years of working on others behalf feinsmith has to 
raise money for himself 
as ill as he is and has been for years he still has been 
responsible almost singlehandedly for intervening with congress 
to prevent cuts from kidney programs said spero moutsatsos 
project director for the end stage renal disease network of florida 
in tampa 
feinsmith has served as president of the american association of 
kidney patients and was the first president of the national kidney 
foundation of florida 
if you were white middleclass married and insured you got 
on dialysis if not you died he said recently at his hollywood 
home above the noise of a dialysis machine during one of his three 
weekly treatments 
dialysis gave feinsmith a chance at a full life it has allowed 
him to watch two teenage children grow and go on to college at 
duke university and ithaca college he also has a daughter 4 with 
his second wife alicia 
although medicare usually pays for kidney transplants the 
agency originally denied compensation to feinsmith because he 
needed a double transplant of his liver and kidneys 
feinsmith conducted a tireless telephone campaign and enlisted 
the aid of political and medical allies to convince medicare to pay 
about 80000 for the kidney transplant 
but rather than exult feinsmith was enraged 
its outrageous he said if it werent for me and the 
people i know some poor shnook who didnt have connections 
wouldnt get this 
but that wasnt the only battle feinsmith faced 
he needed a 100000 downpayment to be considered a liver 
transplant candidate at the university of pittsburgh where he was 
evaluated the operation ultimately could cost more than 200000 
plus extra expenses for transportation lodging and medication 
feinsmith and his father sydney a retired north miami beach 
cantor have raised almost 200000 an undisclosed amount came 
from an angel out of the blue who anonymously left a large 
check at a north miami beach pizza parlor feinsmith said 
he also has gained support from doctors nationwide said his 
doctor allan jacob 
hes unique hes not just another individual with a difficult 
medical problem jacob said in the area of public policy and 
dialysis hes an expert every major nationally reknowned 
nephrologist on patient and government issues has rallied around 
him

after 4yearold christopher hoy was 
seriously injured in a twocar accident two years ago he sued the 
driver of the car in which he was riding his mom 
on tuesday christopher won a 75000 settlement of the lawsuit 
against his parents he also won a 50000 settlement against the 
driver of the second car both parties insurance carriers will pay 
the boy the money 
the case was tried last week in state supreme court and his 
mother barbara j hoy testified she was not speeding before the 
accident as her sons lawsuit claimed 
christopher who is now 6 was placed in the unusual position of 
suing his parents over the accident because the court decided his 
mother was partly responsible for the crash said his lawyer 
edward menkin 
a jury had ruled barbara hoy was 30 percent responsible for the 
accident and the other driver sharon m hawthorne was 70 percent 
responsible 
because the court decided the mother was partially to blame the 
boy had to sue both parties menkin said 
barbara hoy and her husband norman were pleased when the suit 
was settled with the 125000 going to their son 
were happy about the result said hoy who was named as a 
defendant because he owned the car its common for occupants of 
a vehicle to sue the driver this just happened to be mother and 
son 
christopher suffered a broken leg broken nose and broken back 
in the jan 5 1987 accident he spent nine days in a hospital and 
three months in a body cast and has recovered from the injuries 
except for a fused spine menkin said

a fire that injured 31 people on the 
amphibious assault ship uss inchon apparently was caused by a short 
circuit in an electrical compartment the navy said 
twelve people were hospitalized the others treated and released 
the fire which started about 930 am tuesday and was 
extinguished in about 40 minutes was one of a series of recent 
accidents that prompted the navy later in the day to order a 
48hour halt to all normal operations for a review of safety 
procedures 
in the past three weeks the navy has experienced 10 serious 
accidents in which 10 people have been killed or lost at sea and at 
least 53 have been injured the recent series of accidents followed 
the april 19 explosion on the battleship uss iowa in which 47 
sailors died 
the inchon fire broke out as the ship was in the metroc machine 
corp shipyard for routine repair work 
lt cmdr steve burnett a spokesman for the atlantic fleet 
said the blaze apparently was caused by a short circuit and that 
most of the damage was to electrical cables and insulation in the 
shore power compartment there also was smoke and heat damage to 
the hangar deck 
the compartment holds cables from the pier bringing electricity 
to the ship 
lt cmdr john lloyd another atlantic fleet spokesman said 23 
sailors and eight civilians were taken to area hospitals the 
condition of the 12 admitted for smoke inhalation ranged from 
stable to serious according to the hospitals 
the 602foot troop and helicopter carrier has a crew of 675 and 
can hold up to 2000 marines and 20 helicopters when on deployment 
the inchon entered the shipyard sept 21 for a fourmonth 
overhaul

thousands of people are expected to 
participate in a walk across the 85mile san franciscooakland bay 
bridge which lost a 50foot section in the oct 17 earthquake that 
tore through northern california 
the walk thursday over the bay bridge that links oakland and san 
francisco will cost 5 and feature entertainers carol channing and 
tony bennett it will be limited to 40000 people 
some of the fees will go to quake relief but the main purpose 
seemed to be to celebrate the bridges scheduled saturday reopening 
to traffic and the spirit of bay area residents in dealing with the 
quake 
transportation secretary samuel skinner hailed the cooperation 
that mended the bridge 
bureaucracy has been beaten skinner told a news conference 
tuesday 
it looks great he said while flanked by the mayors of san 
francisco oakland and alameda on the upper decks newly installed 
concrete 
he referred to the reopening as nov 17 a month after the 
71magnitude earthquake that killed 66 people and caused 7 
billion in damage unaware that the state department of 
transportation earlier in the day pushed the date to nov 18 
cars and other vehicles will start rolling across the bridge 
as soon as possible on saturday said burch bachtold the state 
department of transportation district director who guided skinner 
during his brief visit to the 53yearold bridge 
department officials said the delay was needed because two days 
of damp weather slowed work on the bridge 
the spans repair represents a magnificent effort by state 
local and federal officials said skinner

identical twin brothers who have 
monopolized the mayors office here for 42 years will continue 
their smalltown dynasty following a 26vote election victory 
im surprised i didnt win by a greater majority but a win is 
a win knox ridley said tuesday night after being reelected to a 
fouryear term 
unofficial returns showed that ridley received 1185 votes to 
denise eskers 1159 mrs esker a homemaker and former city 
employee making her first bid for political office said she would 
decide today whether to seek a recount 
ridley who served on the rutherford county court for a 
quartercentury and was a justice of the peace was appointed 
interim mayor two years ago to replace his brother sam who was 
ousted for misusing public money 
the 70yearold twins born 30 minutes apart are still close 
they dress similarly wear glasses and have gray balding hair 
knox is described by locals as the one with the hearing aid 
its little wonder then that townsfolk speculate that sam 
ridley who held the post for 40 years still pulls the strings 
sam became mayor in 1947 but was ousted after the courts found he 
misused 11000 from the citys 1980 budget 
knox ridley doesnt try to distance himself from his brother 
referring to sam as his chief of staff sam campaigned actively 
for knox 
the cozy relationship between the brothers was the main issue 
for mrs esker 
its still as crooked now as it was then she said during 
the campaign 
mrs esker said the close vote scared the ridleys i think 
they will have even more people watching them now she said 
she had hammered on the theme that smyrna needed a change in 
leadership noting the town outside nashville had 500 people when 
sam ridley became mayor today smyrna is a growing city of 13000 
boasting a sprawling new plant where nissan produces light trucks 
and cars 
knox ridley agrees the times are changing but says he 
referrring to himself in the the plural has changed too 
we might have old age but we have a young heart and a young 
mind he said

the chicago board of trade is denying farmers 
allegations that it illegally manipulated soybean prices with an 
emergency order last summer 
the order led to a 20 percent drop in soybean prices along with 
corresponding declines in other commodities and caused heavy 
financial losses among family farmers nationwide the american 
agriculture movement says 
the group a lobbying organization that represents small farmers 
and rural business people in 34 states and family farmers from 
leading soybeanproducing states filed a federal lawsuit tuesday 
against the bot 
the lawsuit seeks more than 100 million in damages 
the complaint stems from the board of trades emergency action 
july 11 ordering traders to reduce their holdings in soybean 
futures contracts 
the boards move was widely viewed as an effort to break up an 
attempt to corner the market by ferruzzi finanziaria spa an 
italian company and one of the worlds largest soybean processors 
the cbots order was a bad faith and selfserving action 
initiated by the cbots dominant grain merchants and futures 
traders to create profits for their accounts and for their 
clients said harvey joe sanner aams president and an arkansas 
soybean farmer 
sanner spoke at a news conference at a downtown hotel 
accompanied by about 25 other farmers from illinois iowa 
missouri indiana minnesota ohio nebraska arkansas kansas and 
south dakota many of whom said they had been devastated by the 
board action 
im angry as hell about what has been done to us as producers 
of this nation said corky jones a soybean farmer from 
brownville neb 
the bot meanwhile has slapped ferruzzis central soya unit 
with a 1000aday fine for failing to provide documents the 
exchange says are needed for an investigation into the italian 
companys actions 
but a central soya spokesman said the company is cooperating 
with the investigation and has agreed to provide the documents 
rail contracts between the company and its shippers 
the lawsuit filed tuesday names as defendants the exchange bot 
chairman karsten mahlmann and 21 other directors along with five 
other exchange officials 
after the news conference the group carrying banners and 
buckets of soybeans marched five blocks to the board of trade 
bot spokesman raymond carmichael said officials were in 
meetings he agreed to take the soybeans to exchange officials as a 
symbol of the complaint 
in a news release mahlmann said exchange officials had not seen 
the lawsuit but are confident in the action taken by the 
board of directors to maintain an orderly liquidation in our july 
1989 soybean futures contract 
he said board officials expect this lawsuit to be proven 
frivolous

ageold tradition met the information age as 
absentee ballots sent by fax to a couple on a trip to california 
were returned by an overnight delivery service in time to be 
counted 
resident chris lynn set up his facsimile machine tuesday in the 
town clerks office so absentee ballots in a school bond vote could 
be sent to his friends richard and teri barnaby 
this is certainly unique said deputy secretary of state 
paul gillies when he heard of the new way of distributing paper 
ballots i dont think this has ever happened in vermont before 
its really kind of exciting 
the barnabys had gone to the west coast on a business trip 
facsimile machines allow transmission of printed matter over 
telephone lines but they dont allow the for the sealed envelopes 
required for secret ballots town clerk eva morse explained 
residents were voting for the second time on a 105 million 
plan to expand the town elementary school the measure passed 
narrowly in september opponents gathered enough signatures on a 
petition to call for another vote 
gillies said morse called him monday to ask whether the fax was 
a legal way to distribute absentee ballots 
i dont think that the people who drafted the absentee ballot 
laws in the 18th century knew about fax machines he said 
but he said a fax would probably meet the legal definition of a 
mailed ballot and consequently could be allowed

troops raided a clandestine radio 
station and captured its operator in a dragnet that is decimating 
the leadership of an extremist group of sinhalese nationalists 
military officials said today 
in addition the bodies of 31 suspected sinhalese extremists 
were discovered at daybreak in the central hills the officials 
said they blamed the killings on progovernment vigilante groups 
the governments 2yearold battle to subdue the peoples 
liberation front took a dramatic turn monday with the reported 
capture and killing of the groups senior leader rohana wijeweera 
according to a military source the avowed marxist sang like a 
bird about the whereabouts of his top lieutenants in less than 
18 hours wijeweera and the fronts no 2 and no 3 men were killed 
by security forces according to government announcements 
more than 6000 people have been killed since august 1987 in 
violence associated with the peoples liberation fronts 
assassination campaign targeting governing officials and supporters 
the front professed outrage that the sinhalesedominated 
government made concessions to the tamil minority and its battle 
escalated into a challenge of the governments right to exist 
the military officials said the raid on the fronts clandestine 
radio station was carried out tuesday night in boralesgamuwa six 
miles southeast of colombo 
the front member in charge of the station andreas costa was 
captured and radio equipment worth 13 million seized according 
to the officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
the shortwave radio station was called voice of the revolution 
it broadcast three days a week varying its hours to avoid jamming 
and transmitted wijeweeras speeches revolutionary songs and 
allegations of government atrocities 
the front as well as human rights activists and opposition 
politicians have long accused the government of fielding or 
tolerating death squads bent on wiping out the front 
some government officials have privately acknowledged that 
excesses may have occurred but they usually blamed the 
killings of suspected front members on shadowy vigilante groups 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne claimed tuesday that six of 
the fronts seven politburo members had been killed but the 
military officials said today the politburo had expanded to nine 
members of whom seven were known to have been killed 
although killings blamed on the front have tapered off this 
week it is too soon to say whether the front is finished or simply 
regrouping 
the bodies of the suspected front members were found in two 
locations in the center of the island wednesday 
twentythree badly mutilated bodies were discovered in 
keppitipola about 65 miles east of colombo eight more bodies were 
found in kandy 55 miles northeast of colombo 
the violence by the sinhalese extremists erupted after the sri 
lankan government signed an indiansponsored peace accord on july 
29 1987 in an effort to end a tamil insurrection that started in 
1983 the accord spawned a sinhalese backlash as members of the 
ethnic majority accused their government of making too many 
concessions to the tamil minority 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
are mostly hindus and claim the predominantly buddhist sinhalese 
majority discriminated against them in jobs and education 
sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the population have 
dominated the government and military since sri lanka formerly 
called ceylon became independent from britain in 1948

the jogger who was gangraped and badly beaten 
in central park will spend thanksgiving at home with her family 
her father said 
she was released tuesday from a connecticut hospital after what 
doctors said was a remarkable recovery after being left for dead 
her father said he was thrilled to have her back and was 
preparing a quiet thanksgiving family celebration 
in state supreme court on tuesday the prosecution rested after 
four weeks of testimony in a hearing on whether statements six 
defendents gave police should be allowed as evidence at their 
upcoming rape and attempted murder trials 
defense lawyers maintain the statements in which nearly all the 
youths implicate themselves or their codefendants were coerced 
and therefore illegal 
a spokesman for gaylord hospital in wallingford conn said the 
jogger would continue to be treated there on an outpatient basis 
she continues to have posttraumatic amnesia said spokesman 
gerald main but she has made good recovery and rehabilitation 
head injuries often lead to posttraumatic amnesia in which the 
victim cannot remember what took place immediately before during 
and for some time after the injury 
the jogger a 29yearold investment banker was dragged 200 
feet into the underbrush raped beaten with a pipe and a rock and 
left unconscious april 19 she had been on her nightly run 
when police found her 3 hours later she was in a coma and had 
lost almost 80 percent of her blood she had suffered brain 
contusions two head fractures broken facial bones and bruises 
from head to toe 
she remained in critical condition at a hospital until may 1 
when she raised her hand and appeared to raise her eyebrows as her 
name was called she was walking a bit when she was moved june 7 to 
gaylord 
by midsummer she was reading novels relearning basic math 
skills and calling colleagues at salomon bros where she had 
worked before the attack 
main said the jogger and her family thanked the public and press 
for their support over the past seven months saying it made a 
difference in her ability to recover 
the family also thanked the news media for respecting her 
privacy and anonymity and stressed that the womans continued 
recovery is highly dependent on these being maintained main

former president jimmy carter said the sandinista 
government was attemptingm to unfairly tie nicaraguas civilian 
opposition coalition to the usbacked contra rebels 
carter who will lead an official team monitoring nicaraguas 
feb 25 elections said at a seminar tuesday at his presidential 
center that he has complained privately to sandinista 
representatives about a news article in the official sandinista 
newspaper barricada 
the publication attacked alfredo cesar a member of nicaraguas 
national opposition campaign committee carter said the newspaper 
has apparently published a totally fraudulent letter ostensibly 
written by cesar 
carter said barricada has tied the opposition coalition with 
the contra military activity in a completely illegitimate fashion 
cesar speaking at the seminar claimed that president daniel 
ortegas decision to end a 19month ceasefire in the war with the 
contras was due to the tight race he faced for reelection against 
violeta barrios de chamorro the candidate of the national 
opposition union a coalition that represents 12 of 21 registered 
nicaraguan parties 
a new independent poll of nicaraguan voters commissioned by a 
miami television station and released tuesday showed ortega and 
chamorro in a dead heat the poll was taken in late october 
ortega announced two weeks ago he was canceling the ceasefire 
citing increased attacks by contras trying to disrupt the elections 
cesar however cited nicaraguan government figures showing that 
such attacks had decreased in october 
when the sandinistas agreed last summer to advance the elections 
from november to february he said they did not think they would 
be seriously challenged 
that equation has changed he said 
cesar also accused the sandinistas of forging documents that 
tied the opposition coalition to the contras he said the coalition 
has condemned violence from all sides 
alejandro bendana secretarygeneral of nicaraguas foreign 
ministry said fair and free elections are an issue but so is 
sovereignty 
independence is a prerequisite of democracy american policy 
fails to recognize the link between the democratic process and 
selfdetermination he said 
we are not running these elections to satisfy the united 
states he said he said the united states may have to live 
with a democratically elected government that is not of its 
liking 
carter said he believes the bush administration will honor the 
results and probably lift the 4yearold trade embargo with 
nicaragua no matter who wins if the independent observer groups 
report clean elections 
carter said his team will try to monitor voting at about 10 
percent of the nicaraguan polling places and compare the vote 
tallied there with the votes turned in to the central counting 
point 
the former president led an official monitoring team at 
elections may 7 in panama carter denounced that election as 
fraudulent

mikhail s gorbachev concerned by western powers 
response to the democratic upheaval in eastern europe urged them 
not to sour the new spirit of international cooperation by 
exporting capitalism to the region 
he made the comments six days after east germanys embattled 
communist leaders let their citizens travel freely to the west and 
as western countries appropriate hundreds of million of dollars in 
aid for poland and hungary 
other top soviet officials joined their president in condemning 
any western attempts to exploit the current instability in the east 
bloc and throwing cold water on calls for german reunification 
in tokyo gorbachev adviser alexander yakovlev said he was 
surprised by western commentators who interpret the tumult in the 
region as demonstrating the failure of socialism and soviet policy 
this is an obsolete archaic way of thinking the politburo 
member told a news conference today we would like to have a 
common european house based on freedom if someone interferes in 
that process we might go back to the time of the cold war we are 
standing at such a juncture 
gorbachev issued his warning to the west in a kremlin meeting 
tuesday with foreign minister roland dumas of france 
it is useless to clamor about victory in the cold war about 
the disintegration of some or other social system tass 
paraphrased gorbachev as saying everything should be analyzed 
realistically and interests should be balanced 
he then urged western leaders not to practice their own form of 
socioeconomic imperialism 
when accusations of exporting revolutions are replaced with 
calls for exporting capitalism we have at hand a dangerous 
manifestation of old thinking tass paraphrased gorbachev as 
saying 
gorbachev made the comments as west germanys economics 
minister helmut haussmann offered to rebuild east germanys 
economy through broadbased investments and joint ventures and to 
overhaul the countrys moribund communications and transport 
systems 
while not offering details haussmann said such aid would occur 
only if east germany carried out a thorough change of its 
centrally planned economy 
in a june 15 news conference in bonn west germany gorbachev 
declared the cold war over but did not take credit for ending it 
as he now apparently is accusing the west of doing 
the kremlin has called for negotiating an end to the warsaw pact 
and nato as military alliances turning them into purely political 
groups that cooperate more closely gorbachev also has called for 
cooperation between the european economic community and comecon 
the east blocs economic alliance 
on tuesday gorbachev indicated these groups should not be 
scrapped but rather transformed into bodies that foster stability 
it is no time to destroy the established international 
political and economic institutions let them transform themselves 
with taking into account internal processes let them find 
themselves a niche in the new situation and interact tass quoted 
him as saying 
gorbachev praised the changes that have taken place in 
individual eastern european countries without identifying them 
in the past several months dizzying changes have swept through 
the east bloc 
east germanys ruling communists ousted their longtime leader 
erich honecker last month and on thursday opened their borders in 
an effort to win credibility with a people demanding free elections 
and an end to the communist monopoly on power 
czechoslovakia on tuesday granted its citizens free travel 
abroad 
on friday bulgaria replaced its longtime communist leader 
todor zhivkov 
in august poland became the first east bloc nation with a 
government not led by communists 
last month hungarys communists changed the name of their party 
to the hungarian socialist party and endorsed a transition to 
parliamentary democracy promising free elections by june 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and his french 
counterpart clashed tuesday over whether reunification of east and 
west germany is desireable 
according to tass shevardnadze expressed great concern with 
west german officials pushing for reunification 
he said such talk encroaches on east germanys sovereignty in a 
separate speech the soviet envoy added that other countries should 
not profit by the complications tie on various kinds of advice 
or conditions 
in his speech however dumas said france and west germany want 
european unity and he called for resolving the german 
question tass reported dumas said this should not be seen as a 
threat risk or danger by other countries 
the soviet union has about 380000 troops in east germany which 
has since the end of world war ii been the linchpin in their 
european defense corridor

a study at the university of pennsylvania 
indicates stress can worsen skin diseases giving credence to a 
theory long held by doctors according to a researcher 
the study scheduled for publication today in the journal 
proceedings of the national academy of sciences shows nerve fibers 
in the skin release a protein that triggers inflammation such as 
in psoriasis or acne 
there is now some evidence to show that at least in the skin 
the immune response is controlled to some extent by state of mind 
and emotional status said dr george murphy the studys lead 
author 
for dermatologists this is remarkably significant because of 
the observation that has been held for hundreds of years that 
anxiety and stress can provoke itching or cause worsening of skin 
diseases 
other scientists cautioned that other dermatological research 
showed different factors also could trigger the response they 
called murphys claims of a stressimmunity link premature 
the penn researchers in studing a series of live skin samples 
found that the protein called substance p is released by tiny 
nerve fibers in the skin that lie near mast cells 
as substance p bathes the mast cells it causes them to release 
granules which secrete a substance that leaks into blood vessels 
according to the study 
the walls of the blood vessel become sticky and white blood 
cells begin to accummulate inflamming the skin the penn study 
said 
previously researchers believed the loss of granules from the 
mast cells occurred after inflammation which current treatments 
try to suppress 
dr bruce wintroub of the university of california in san 
francisco called the mast cell conclusion a reasonable 
hypothesis 
but he hesitated to agree that murphys research proves a 
stressimmunity link 
dr alan lorincz of the university of chicago said a variety of 
substances can stimulate the loss of granules from mast cells 
earlier research showed that even when the release of substance p 
is blocked some signs of inflammation occur lorincz said 
i have no doubt that substance p is involved in 
inflammation but whether its a universal key i would say no 
lorencz said 
the penn researchers while using skin as a model said the 
studys results could lead to new forms of treatment for 
inflammation in other organs such as the lungs

gov michael s dukakis conceded for the 
first time that the massachusetts miracle that nearly carried him 
to the white house is no more 
but the former democratic candidate for president said tuesday 
that the formula that produced a whitehot economy in the early 
1980s can bring massachusetts back from the brink of recession 
the miracle of the 80s may be over but the fundamental 
strengths that made it happen are still here daring entrepreneurs 
and productive workers great universities and great hospitals 
the governor said 
i dont plan to spend the next 14 months debating whether 
or not were in a recession i plan to spend that time laying the 
foundation we will need to make the 1990s every bit as good or 
better than the 80s 
declining revenue has left the state with a 720 million budget 
deficit and budget cuts are threatening already strapped social 
construction and educational programs 
dukakis comments came in an address at the massachusetts 
institute of technology in which he outlined his blueprint for 
economic success in the 1990s dukakis has said he will leave 
office when his term is up after 1990 
the governor called for revitalized state construction 
expansion in manufacturing and the troubled hightech industry and 
aggressive recruitment of international investment to capitalize on 
the european communitys economic merger in 1992 
massachusetts must go international with a vengeance he 
said 
dukakis was chatty and joking at the outset of his speech the 
first time he was visibly at ease in public since his wife kitty 
was hospitalized last week after drinking rubbing alcohol 
i believe in the economic future of this commonwealth because 
i believe in the timetested qualities of the people of this state 
their creativity and innovation and determination he said

brazil today made a final stride 
toward full civilian rule as voters cast ballots in the countrys 
first popular presidential election in nearly three decades 
the vote on the 100th anniversary of the founding of the 
brazilian republic follows two decades of rapid economic 
development in spite of massive foreign debt and widespread poverty 
the favorite is a conservative former state governor fernando 
collor de mello of the national reconstruction party but he is not 
expected to win enough votes to avoid a runoff with one of two top 
two leftist candidates 
early reports indicated voting was peaceful across the country 
in rio de janeiro voters waited goodhumoredly in huge lines 
that snaked around city blocks despite a threat of rain many 
voted early to take advantage of the national holiday which marks 
the 100th anniversary of the founding of a republic that overthrew 
emperor pedro ii 
brazilians lined up to vote hours before the polls opened at 8 
am 5 am est polls were to close at 5 pm with partial 
results expected at around 9 pm an official projection of the 
winner was due saturday 
collor de mellos attacks on president jose sarney for 1300 
percent annual inflation and widespread corruption have struck a 
chord with many of the 82 million registered voters most of whom 
earn less than 36 a week 
in a national tv address tuesday night sarney called the 
election an extraordinary spectacle that demonstrated the 
flourishing of brazilian democracy 
the democratic transition is complete said sarney who was 
chosen in 1985 by an electoral college after the military ended 21 
years of rule god has won in brazil 
fighting for second place are two leftists exgovernor leonel 
brizola who pledges west europeanstyle socialism and rep luis 
inacia lula da silva a former factory worker and strike leader who 
wants a workers republic with nationalized banks and 
cancellation of brazils 110 billion foreign debt 
if no candidate wins a majority and its doubtful anyone will 
the top two votegetters will meet in a runoff dec 17 
collor de mello had a comfortable lead but far short of a 
majority in the 21candidate field according to two opinion polls 
announced tuesday 
many voters wore red bandanas the symbol of brizola who was 
about even with da silva in voter surveys but in brasilia the 
capital election officials made brizola sympathizers take off the 
bandanas to vote 
other than brizola or lula only two other candidates were given 
any chance of squeaking into the no 2 spot centerleftist sen 
mario covas and rightist rep paulo maluf 
the twomonth campaign has been marred by some personal insults 
but enthusiastic crowds have gathered at street rallies across this 
nation of 150 million people south americas largest silvio 
santos a television personality tried to enter the race at the 
last minute but officials ruled he had violated election rules 
paper ballots with squares beside each candidates name were 
waiting at 250000 polling stations from the southern plains to 
the remote jungle villages in the northwestern amazon region 
special stations were set up for the blind and for the estimated 
halfmillion people with leprosy in some places voting equipment 
had to be carried in by canoe or on mules 
federal troops were stationed in 39 of brazils 4445 counties 
mostly in the remote north and northwest to keep order and to 
prevent lastminute campaigning 
brazilians under 47 nearly 73 percent of the electorate have 
never voted for president 
in the last election in 1960 janio quadros won but he stunned 
the nation by saying he was plagued by occult forces and 
resigned after seven months in office his vice president joao 
goulart took over but was ousted in a military coup in 1964 
the military regime banned direct voting for president but it 
was restored by a new constitution enacted last year voting is 
mandatory for everyone between age 18 and 69 
and for the first time in the countrys history 16 and 
17yearolds may vote though its not mandatory some 33 million 
more than half of those eligible have registered 
the election comes a century after republicans in brazil 
overthrew latin americas only independent monarchy

the government may lift the 
state of emergency and free jailed african national congress leader 
nelson mandela to coincide with the opening of parliament on feb 
2 a newspaper said today 
business day said cabinet members are prepared to concede in 
private that the two steps are essential if president fw de 
klerk is to succeed with his proposals to negotiate some form of 
blackwhite powersharing 
the newspaper which generally reflects the views of liberal 
business leaders said senior government officials have accepted 
the state of emergency is an obstacle to getting negotiations 
started and are pressing for it to be lifted 
mandela whom many blacks regard as their paramount leader has 
been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for planning 
an antigovernment sabotage campaign on behalf of the outlawed anc 
the state of emergency was declared in june 1986 emergency 
regulations allow police to detain people indefinitely without 
trial outlaw certain forms of protest and subject the news media 
to various restrictions 
last month the government unconditionally freed seven african 
national congress leaders five of them codefendants of mandela 
their freedom to speak out even at mass rallies was been widely 
viewed as a move by the government to begin dismantling the 
emergency 
in a related development the official magazine of the dutch 
reformed church to which most government officials belong 
called on de klerk to consider reprieving political prisoners on 
death row 
several anc guerrillas convicted on terrorism charges are among 
the more than 200 prisoners currently facing execution 
mandelas release has been demanded by a wide range of black 
leaders as a precondition for accepting the governments invitation 
to negotiate a new political system 
last weekend however one of the most powerful moderate black 
groups the zulu political organization inkatha announced that it 
was prepared to open talks with the government immediately 
inkathas leader mangosuthu buthelezi in the past had been among 
those demanding mandelas release but he has expressed annoyance 
at the freed anc leaders for remarks which he perceives as 
suggesting the anc is the sole legitimate voice of south africas 
blacks 
de klerk who took office in august has offered to negotiate a 
new constitution within five years that extends some form of 
political rights to the black majority while providing whites with 
some form of veto power 
inkatha in a concession likely to anger the anc said it was 
willing to negotiate a new system that stopped short of oneperson

business inventories rose 02 percent in 
september while business sales dropped 03 percent the government 
reported today 
the combination of the accumulation of goods on shelves and 
backlots rising faster than sales could be bad news for the 
economy if inventories were to pile up excessively it could mean 
cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs 
the commerce department said inventories climbed to a seasonally 
adjusted 7918 billion in september following a gain of 04 
percent in august 
business sales meanwhile dropped to a seasonally adjusted 
5246 billion after advancing 3 percent in august 
the september business activity produced an increase in the 
ratio of sales to 151 meaning it would take 151 months to 
exhaust inventories at the september pace the ratio was 150 in 
august 
retailer backlogs were up 1 percent in september and could be 
worse in october the commerce department reported on tuesday that 
retail sales last month dropped a full 1 percent that included a 
51 percent decline in car sales 
on the other hand manufacturers inventories which represent 
about 45 percent of the total slipped 01 percent and wholesale 
backlogs dropped 03 percent 
manufacturers sales on the other hand fell 16 percent in 
september retailers and wholesalers sales both were up 07 
percent 
overall inventories were 64 percent above those of a year ago

president bush jumping the gun on anniversary 
report cards is already declaring a successful first year 
after just 10 months in office but his assessment of his own 
performance misses a few mileposts 
for instance when bush travels to rhode island on monday to 
appear at two republican fundraisers it will be the 30th state he 
has visited since his inauguration in january 
and when bush goes to malta for his dec 23 shipboard summit 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev it will be the 14th 
foreign nation he will have visited as president 
bush has vetoed five bills and has not yet been overridden by 
congress 
by the same token bush has received few legislative victories 
of the nearly two dozen major proposals he has sent to capitol 
hill only one legislation to rescue the ailing savings and loan 
industry has been enacted 
some 119 of his nominations remain in limbo in congress and he 
was the first president in recent times to have a cabinet nominee 
john tower as defense secretary rejected by the full senate 
the president has given what the white house considers 27 
formal news conferences 
white house pet spaniel millie in her first 10 months as first 
pup has killed six squirrels two rats and one pigeon on the white 
house grounds bush recently confided to several reporters during 
one of his frequent jogs 
bush took 15 days in august to catch one fish 
the president has spent only six weekends at the white house 
since taking office and while he has made six trips this year to 
his family compound at kennebunkport maine he spends most 
weekends at the presidential retreat at camp david 
he spends so much time at the retreat in the catoctin mountains 
in maryland in fact that he told a recent audience my son 
marvin has started a modest lobbying campaign for me to change the 
name to camp marvin 
he observed that former president eisenhower named the retreat 
after his grandson david but bush added since he himself had 
four sons one daughter and 11 grandchildren picking a new name 
might touch off a fierce interfamily competition 
in offyear general and special election races he made campaign 
appearances for six republican candidates his batting average 
two won four lost 
he claims he gets up to 60000 letters a week from children to 
our oldest citizens 
postmaster general anthony m frank recently suggested that bush 
who himself dashes off thankyou notes and letters throughout 
each day has generated and received more correspondence than any 
president in us history at an equivalent point in his term 
in 10 months in office in fact bush has been responsible for 
more correspondence than some presidents generated in their entire 
administrations frank said 
meanwhile bush frequently breaks his own selfimposed rule 
about answering reporters questions at picturetaking sessions 
in fact he violated it twice on tuesday answering questions 
on the easing of travel restrictions in czechoslovakia in the 
morning and on nicaraguan arms shipments to el salvador in the 
afternoon 
bush also continues to stick to his own versions of some places 
and peoples names often talking about the middle east nation of 
the lebanon and referring to polish solidarity leader lech 
walesas first name as lock 
asked on tuesday why bush always called walesa his dinner guest 
at the white house tuesday night lock spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said that when bush went to poland as vice president in 
1987 someone in poland told him that the correct pronunciation 
was lock and he has used it ever since 
of course fitzwater has some trouble with last names himself 
the other day he turned redfaced after beginning a briefing by 
referring to the nations 41st chief executive as president

the trial of a hispanic policeman in the slaying of 
a black motorcyclist opened today with the prosecution arguing that 
the officer was in no danger and did not have to fire the shot that 
set off three days of riots 
circuit judge joseph farina cleared the way tuesday for the 
manslaughter trial of miami officer william lozano by refusing to 
move the case out of miami he rejected defense arguments that the 
threat of violence hung over the trial and could frighten jurors 
into convicting lozano to avoid another riot 
assistant state attorney don horn told the racially mixed jury 
seated after three weeks of questioning that the 31yearold 
officer failed to act as a prudent policeman should have in the 
slaying of clement lloyd 23 
it was not a lifeordeath situation it was not a 
splitsecond decision and he did not have to shoot said horn 
he said lozano shot lloyd in the head after taking two steps 
into the street and putting himself closer to the path of lloyds 
speeding motorcycle which was being chased by a patrol car 
defense attorney roy black in his opening arguments said the 
shooting had nothing to do with race 
officer lozano did not shoot his gun because hes a hispanic 
clement lloyd was not shot because he is black black said but 
within moments he said race had everything to do with this 
case as a crowd formed in a prelude to a night of rioting 
the jan 16 shooting which also led to the death of lloyds 
passenger exploded into three days of rioting one looter was shot 
to death 11 people were wounded by gunfire and 13 buildings were 
burned down 
some black leaders said the jurys ethnic mixture two blacks 
one hispanic and three nonhispanic whites could head off a 
repeat of rioting that followed acquittals by allwhite juries in 
1980 and 1984 of two other officers who had killed blacks 
the fact that the jury resembles the triethnic balance of 
this community goes a long way to reducing that level of tension 
said william sims of dade countys community relations board 
a televised forum tuesday night in the predominantly black 
overtown neighborhood where the shooting occurred illustrated the 
communitys continuing anger as many participants complained that 
they were mistreated by hispanics who arrived in this country only 
recently 
the anger led the defense to enter into the record scores of 
items showing that more violence was expected if lozano was 
acquitted 
the exhibits included violencethreatening posters by the 
overtown comrades and documents showing police contingency 
plans to combat a riot if lozano is found innocent 
decisions by the judge have sharply limited how much the defense 
can reveal to jurors about the slain motorcyclists police record 
and allegations that he was picking up drug profits the night of 
the killing 
we have to start out with the the court already excluding 75 
percent of our defense black said tuesday needless to say 
were operating under a great handicap 
the shooting took place during the week of the super bowl in 
miami the colombianborn lozano and his partner were on an 
overtown street talking to the victim of a minor crime 
as they talked another squad car was chasing down a speeding 
motorcycle driven by lloyd and carrying his friend allan blanchard 
24 
when the motorcycle turned onto the street where lozano was 
standing the officer fired one shot killing lloyd instantly and 
sending the motorcycle crashing into a car 
blanchard died later lozano was charged with two counts of 
manslaughter 
if convicted on both counts he would face a maximum penalty of 
60 years imprisonment 
within an hour after the shooting a mob gathered at the scene 
and began pelting officers with rocks and bottles starting the 
rioting 
lloyd was found to have high levels of alcohol and thc the 
active chemical in marijuana in his blood at the time of his 
death 
he also had 55 grams of marijuana and 1500 in his pocket 
facts the defense contends showed he was a drug dealer desperate 
enough to run down a policeman to avoid arrest 
the city later set up a commission to examine the roots of the 
racial disturbance the fourth to hit miami in the 1980s 
the first occurred in 1980 after an allwhite jury in tampa 
acquitted a group of metrodade policemen in the fatal beating of 
black insurance executive arthur mcduffie the case was moved to 
tampa because of pretrial publicity 
in 1982 a riot broke out when miami policeman luis alvarez 
entered an overtown video arcade and shot and killed nevell 
johnson a black two years later violence broke out again when an 
allwhite jury acquitted alvarez of manslaughter

a government panel has proposed 
revising laws on assembly and association to comply with 
international human rights accords without discarding traditional 
communist principles an official said today 
the staterun human rights committee submitted the three draft 
laws to premier ladislav adamec who on tuesday announced that 
czechoslovaks wishing to travel to the west will no longer need 
exit visas beginning jan 1 
despite some easing of restrictions however the hardline 
government continued to crack down on dissent a court in 
bratislava on tuesday sentenced an activist who urged his 
countrymen to honor those killed in the 1968 warsaw pact invasion 
that crushed reforms in czechoslovakia 
zbynek vokrouhlicky a member of the human rights committee that 
worked out the draft laws told the associated press they will go 
to a legislative commission before being considered by parliament 
probably in the spring 
the communist party organ rude pravo on tuesday said the 
committee submitted the drafts to adamec on nov 1o copies of the 
drafts could not be obtained immediately and there were few 
details on their contents 
czechoslovakia is rewriting its laws to conform with human 
rights commitments signed at a 35nation conference in vienna early 
this year 
those accords commit the signatory nations to allow freer travel 
and guarantee human rights it was not immediately clear if the 
laws under discussion will translate into more freedoms for the 
countrys population 
adamec said the easing of travel which has been introduced 
gradually over the past two years was designed to reduce

the telephone company in metropolitan new 
york is free to pull the plug on live dialaporn services after 
today a federal judge ruled in a freespeech case 
us district judge neal mccurn on tuesday refused to block new 
york telephone co from barring twoway conversations on its 970 
exchange 
the exchange available only in four area codes around new york 
city allows callers to participate in sexually explicit 
conversations as well as hear taped messages 
companies that operate such services set fees of 3 per minute 
or more that new york telephone is responsible for collecting the 
phone company was taken to court by dialaporn providers when it 
refused to continue billing 
the services won a temporary order from a state court in 
september that allowed the services to continue and then brought 
the matter to federal court as a fight over freedom of speech 
mccurn ruled that the services had not proved the case was a 
first amendment issue but he also refused to throw out the case 
leaving open the possibility the vendors can seek court relief on 
other grounds 
twoway dialaporn services provided by five companies will 
cease at the end of the business day today said their lawyer joel 
dichter but he said he would file a motion as soon as possible to 
allow the services to resume 
new york telephone attorney kevin walsh said the case was never 
a fight over freedom of speech he said the phone company has no 
power to regulate the content of taped messages or live 
conversations 
no one is prohibiting them from speaking if people want to 
spend 50 minutes on the phone with stella or 30 minutes with 
raquel they have the right and the companies have the right to 
provide that service said walsh 
but were not going to do the billing and collecting with 
this kind of thing its easy to see people getting carried away 
and then not wanting to pay the bill when it comes due

a quarrel between two brothers touched 
off street battles between rival shiite moslem militiamen loyal to 
syria and iran killing one combatant and wounding three police 
said today 
in a separate development the christian army commander gen 
michel aoun threatened to cut the throats and tongues of moderate 
christian leaders who support an arabbrokered peace plan to end 
lebanons civil war 
his threat appeared aimed at blocking moderates in the christian 
heartland he controls from joining a national reconciliation 
cabinet under premierdesignate salim hoss a sunni moslem 
police said the brothers quarrel began after sheik hassan 
nasrallah a senior leader of the iranianbacked hezbollah or 
party of god went to visit his ailing mother at the sprawling 
shiyah district at nightfall tuesday 
he was stopped by gunmen guarding the house under his younger 
brother who goes by the nom de guerre of abulroub or father of 
horror and commands shiite fighters of the prosyrian amal 
militia according to police 
nasrallahs bodyguards fired in the air to clear way for the 
sheik his brother shouted orders to his men from the mothers 
bedside to shoot back and all hell broke loose said a police 
spokemsan 
fighting quickly engulfed the entire shiyah district and then 
spread to bir elabed and hay madi neighborhoods as sheik 
nasrallahs motorcade raced back under gunfire to 
hezbollahcontrolled territory said the spokesman 
he said the command of a syrian army contingent in charge of 
security of beiruts moslem sector intervened with the leaders of 
amal and hezbollah to curb the flareup 
it tapered off briefly but picked up again at midnight when 
militiamen of the two factions shot at each other with machine 
guns 106mm jeepmounted recoiless guns and rocketpropelled 
grenades until dawn the spokesman said 
he said syrian troops patrolled shiyah and other shiite slums 
this morning to prevent a new outbreak of violence 
hezbollah and secular amal have long been fighting for dominance 
of the 12 million shiites who make up the largest single sect 
among lebanons 4 million population 
aouns threat was reported in a statement released by his press 
office in the shellbattered presidential palace in suburban 
baabda five miles east of beirut 
those who support the arab solution deserve to have their 
throats and tongues cut the 54yearold maronite general said 
we are not going to be lenient with them 
aoun appeared to be responding to a statement by maronite 
parliament member butros harb who publicly ridiculed the war of 
liberation aoun declared in march to drive syrias 40000 troops 
from lebanon 
harb represents the independent maronite bloc which has 14 
deputies in the lebanese parliament that approved the arab league 
peace plan forged at a special session in taif saudi arabia which 
shifts power to the moslem majority aoun who heads an interim 
military cabinet rejected the accord demanding a timetable for a 
total syrian withdrawal

a judge today permanently barred the release of a 
ringo starr album that the former beatle considers an embarassment 
recorded while he was on drugs and alcohol 
the action by superior court judge clarence cooper was revealed 
as the trial began on two remaining issues a dispute over whether 
starr owes memphis tenn producer chips moman 146239 in 
expenses for making the 1987 record and whether moman has the 
rights to future recordings by starr 
cooper gave no reason for making permanent another judges 
temporary order keeping the record under wraps 
the suit against moman and college parkbased crs records 
contends that the results of the 1987 recording sessions are 
substandard and would be a professional embarrassment to starr who 
concedes he was then addicted to alcohol 
starr the first witness to testify today said he went to 
memphis in february 1987 to work with moman on an album thinking 
that there was no formal contract between them 
we felt some agreement would be reached but it always hinged 
on if the album was a hit starr testified the drummer and 
singer said he paid his own expenses and believed moman was not 
charging for studio time 
momans attorney thomas washburn iii told cooper in opening 
arguments that moman would never have agreed to work with starr 
without a contractual agreement 
if there is anyone in this room who knows what theyre doing 
regarding the music industry its chips moman washburn said 
starrs appearance in atlanta drew a stream of courthouse 
employees seeking a glimpse of the former beatle 
he drew laughs when he took the stand and jokingly said into the 
microphone is it on or are we rolling bob 
starr has claimed that he and other musicians at the recording 
dates were often drunk and sometimes high on marijuana starr 
recently underwent treatment for his addiction and embarked on a 
wellreceived us concert tour during the summer 
momans lawyers have argued that the recordings in question are 
of good quality and they cited the producers reputation 
including work with elvis presley moman has testified that he did 
not allow liquor in his studio 
washburn said his client rejected an offer of 100000 from 
starr to kill the album he said in august that the album could 
make 35 million

five hispanics quit a grand jury to 
protest what they said was a railroad job by prosecutors to 
help a former policeman avoid trial in the shooting death of a 
mexicanamerican rape suspect 
district attorney frank conard said tuesday he expects the grand 
jurors to return when their session resumes friday they took an 
oath to do a duty he said 
the grand jury was the second in this town of 5500 to refuse to 
indict the former parttime policeman billy ray williamson in the 
1988 slaying of sammy gomez 
a grand jury cleared williamson a week after the shooting after 
pressure from hispanic leaders and state and federal officials a 
grand jury reviewed the case again but did not have the nine votes 
to indict 
we are resigning because we cannot be party to this railroad 
job performed by the state and district attorneys office the 
five grand jurors said in a statement tuesday we are willing to 
risk the consequences whatever they may be 
chris castillo one of those who resigned said the proceedings 
were unfair but he declined to elaborate im just too upset 
about it she said maybe later when ive gotten over it 
the district attorney said there is no provision in the law for 
grand jurors to resign 
its kind of like being drafted you get selected and serve 
that term of court he said the 12member grand jurys term ends 
in february 
district judge weldon kirk was researching the law to determine 
if the grand jurors are in contempt of court district clerk bill 
erwin said 
the league of united latin american citizens has said the case 
is a watershed in mexicanamericans struggle for equal treatment 
in the smaller cities of west texas 
they have said they want williamson tried for civilrights 
violations in federal court because they perceive bias in the state 
justice systems 
williamson told officials he was trying to arrest gomez when 
gomez lunged at him with a knife williamson said he shot gomez in 
selfdefense and local investigators agreed 
but an autopsy that lulac hired an el paso medical examiner to 
perform concluded from the the wounds and bullet trajectories that 
gomez had his hands above his head 
gomez was shot in the side of the chest in the back below the 
shoulder blade and in the back of the head

the bush administrations nominee to head 
nuclear weapons production told congress today controversy over his 
selection was rooted mainly in popular opposition to nuclear power 
referring to his 23 years of service in regulating commercial 
nuclear power victor stello jr said nuclear power is an 
inherently controversial subject and all decisions are subject to 
criticism from one source or another 
at the start of his confirmation hearing which is expected to 
last at least three days stello told the senate armed services 
committee his opponents also were motivated by a dislike of his 
management style 
i say what i think im aggressive im not a diplomat 
i can be abrasive stello said 
the hearing opened on a note of confusion with sen sam nunn 
dga the panel chairman announcing that the white house and the 
justice department had not yet provided letters reports and other 
materials on stello requested several weeks ago 
sen john glenn dohio questioned whether the hearing should 
go ahead since the missing materials might be important to members 
questioning stellos credentials 
glenn raised a series of questions about stellos suitability 
for the job and democratic sens timothy wirth of colorado and 
edward kennedy of massachusetts said in opening statements that 
they would vote against stellos nomination 
glenn and sens carl levin of michigan albert gore of tennessee 
and jeff bingaman of new mexico also are expected to oppose stello 
republican members john warner of virginia strom thurmond of south 
carolina and trent lott of mississippi told stello they would 
support his nomination 
the committee has 20 members 
in an unusual move energy secretary james d watkins personally 
introduced stello to the committee and pleaded for his confirmation 
to a post he called one of the toughest in the federal 
government 
watkins called stello the right person for this job an 
individual whose tough yet reasoned style meets my requirements 
to bolster his chances for committee approval stello this week 
sent panel members a massive volume of his rebuttals to charges 
that he is unqualified for the job and illsuited to restore public 
trust in the safety of operations at the weapons complex which 
includes 17 major defense facilities in 12 states 
stellos report was not made public 
even if the committee voted to recommend confirmation it 
appeared highly unlikely the full senate would vote on the 
nomination before its holiday recess next week 
in a move interpreted by some as a sign that watkins doubted 
stellos chances of winning senate confirmation watkins late last 
month told a top aide to take charge of the weapons office pending 
the outcome of the stello debate 
representatives of the environmental group greenpeace usa 
which has led a national campaign against stellos nomination said 
tuesday they were disappointed the committee did not accept the 
groups request to testify at todays hearing 
if ever a nominee called for a thorough review process this is 
it said stephen schwartz of greenpeace 
on monday wirth joined four other senators not on the committee 
in urging president bush to withdraw the nomination which watkins 
had predicted would be controversial before it was announced in 
july 
the letter said the poor condition of the weapons facilities 
coupled with declining public trust in the energy departments 
ability to safely operate the plants made it imperative that the 
credentials of the weapons production chief be unassailable 
even if confirmed the controversy surrounding mr stello 
would critically impair his ability to address the management 
failures of past administrations which have reduced our nuclear 
weapons production program to a shambles the letter said 
the five senators cited a record by stello of circumventing 
health and safety regulations and obstructing investigations 
while serving at the nuclear regulatory commission 
the letter was signed by wirth and democratic sens richard 
bryan of nevada howard metzenbaum of ohio brock adams of 
washington and alan cranston of california 
the controversy surrounding stello comes from his more than 20 
years of work at the nuclear regulatory commission which regulates 
commercial nuclear power and the atomic energy commission the 
predecessor of both the nrc and the energy department 
the most recent incident which sparked a congressional 
investigation of stellos conduct in 1987 involved unorthodox 
procedures he used as nrc chief of staff in approving cash payments 
to obtain information from a former utility employee

east german newspapers today appeared to dismiss 
west germanys offer of massive financial aid and mikhail s 
gorbachev cautioned that exporting capitalism could hurt the 
climate of cooperation in europe 
also today east germanys official news agency said nearly half 
its 165 million people have been issued visas for the west since 
travel restrictions were lifted on thursday 
adn quoted an unidentified interior ministry official as saying 
7765881 visas for west berlin and west germany had been approved 
by this morning 
economist karlheinz arnold told the communist party newspaper 
berliner zeitung that east germany can manage its own economic 
recovery an indication that bonns conditional aid offer may be 
rejected 
i dont see any need to dramatize the internal or external 
financial situation of east germany arnold was quoted as saying 
the government newspaper bauernecho aimed at east germanys 
farmers warned of becoming too greatly influenced by west germany 
yes to unrestricted travel no to an east german sellout 
the paper declared yes to meeting again no to reunification 
the two german states are politically and economically too 
diverse 
there was no official response from the government to west 
germanys offer which would require easter germanys ruling 
communists to fundamentally reform their centrally planned economy 
communist officials have made clear they do not favor a full 
freemarket system 
in frankfurt west germanys thirdlargest bank said it would 
seek to open an office in east berlin the proposal by commerzbank 
however requires the approval of authorities in both germanys and 
west berlin 
gorbachev believed to have encouraged the ouster of hardline 
east german leader erich honecker and the dizzying reforms that led 
to the berlin walls opening warned westerners not to gloat over 
the demise of communism in the east bloc 
when accusations of exporting revolutions are replaced with 
calls for exporting capitalism we have at hand a dangerous 
manifestation of old thinking tass paraphrased gorbachev as 
saying tuesday in moscow 
even leaders of new forum the east german opposition group 
leading massive protest marches for democratic change have 
expressed concern that western capitalists might exploit an 
unstable east germany without helping its people 
west berlin mayor walter momper said outsiders should not 
interfere with east germanys economic reforms 
east germany needs no patronage the society of east germany 
is strong enough to improve its economic performance he said 
the citizens want selfdetermination and do not want to exchange 
the decades of communist party tutelage for the patronage of the 
west german state or society 
west germanys economics minister helmut haussmann offered 
tuesday to rebuild east germanys economy through broadbased 
investments and joint ventures and to overhaul it moribund 
communications and transport systems 
while not offering details haussmann likened his plan to the 
brainchild of us secretary of state george c marshall that 
revitalized postwar western europe with an infusion of 12 billion 
but he said such aid would be made available only if east 
germany carried out a thorough change of its centrally planned 
economy 
east germanys new premier hans modrow is known to favor 
gradual economic change and oppose a swift transition to full 
democracy 
modrow a 61yearold communist reformer confirmed by parliament 
as premier on monday has resisted recognition of unofficial groups 
as viable opposition forces or negotiating partners 
modrow has said the government has no intention of tearing down 
the berlin wall which it opened to free travel in an effort to 
halt an exodus of refugees and appease a public that has taken to 
the streets en masse since early october to demand free elections 
and other reforms 
in the newest challenge to the communists supremacy parliament 
speaker guenther maleuda said tuesday he would seek to amend the 
constitution so the communist party is no longer deemed the leading 
force in society 
maleuda elected by parliament monday in the chambers 
firstever secret ballot made the remark at a meeting of his 
democratic peasants party one of the four formal opposition 
parties that have recently begun to assert independence 
the liberal democratic party also called for increased 
powersharing it urged convening talks to include the unofficial 
opposition patterned after negotiations held in poland that helped 
usher in the solidarityled government 
in a development heralding the possible inclusion of another 
prominent reformer in the government politburo member guenther 
schabowski resigned as berlins communist boss 
schabowski the partys propaganda chief had announced 
thursdays opening of east germanys borders his resignation was 
considered a possible prelude to his appointment to an influential 
post in the government 
a celebration began at the brandenburg gate on tuesday after adn 
said the east germany leadership was contemplating a new hole in 
the berlin wall that would reconnect the central monument with the 
west 
in west berlin revelers who waited in excited anticipation of 
reopening of the famed thoroughfare dwindled to a few hundred after 
dawn when rumors spread that the new eastwest crossing would open 
only on thursday 
east germanys red cross said meanwhile that it is setting up 
reception centers for any east germans who fled to the west and now 
want to return 
it said the centers can handle up to 10000 people the west 
german red cross said it did not expect many of the 200000 who

the director of the denver housing authority has 
quit after 33 years with the agency citing blame heaped on him 
over a plan to move poor people into middleclass neighborhoods 
everybody has called for my head without cause bill 
ratzlaff said tuesday the focus has turned from housing to 
witchhunting headhunting which has really taken away from what 
the housing authority is all about 
ratzlaff began working for the agency as a handyman in 1956 and 
had been director since 1976 he supervised public housing for 
27000 people and earned 70000 a year 
ratzlaff and his staff were faulted most notably by mayor 
federico pena for misjudging community concerns about a plan to 
relocate several hundred residents of innercity projects to homes 
in middleclass neighborhoods 
pena said ratzlaffs departure will restore public confidence in 
the agency and added that he didnt agree with the fivemember 
housing commissions decision to keep ratzlaff on as a consulant at 
his annual salary 
the approach of scattering public housing in middleclass 
neighborhoods has been tried in various cities with the goal of 
avoiding the drug and crime problems that plague big innercity 
projects 
opponents say it simply transplants problems and can isolate 
those involved from social services and public transportation that 
they rely on

the russian federations supreme court has upheld 
a ruling that a strike by arctic coal miners is illegal and that 
organizers could lose their jobs and face stiff fines a strike 
leader said today 
the consequences will follow us the rest of our lives 
nikolai a teryokhin told reporters he said the ruling was made 
tuedsay 
about 15000 miners at 12 of the 13 shafts in the vorkuta coal 
fields 950 miles northeast of moscow walked off the job oct 25 
to press the government to fulfill promised improvements in working 
and living conditions and to implement farreaching political 
reforms 
they defied calls by president mikhail s gorbachev premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov and other officials to return to work even 
though the walkout is depleting fuel supplies as the country heads 
into winter 
tass reported tuesday the strike has cut coal deliveries from 
the regions mines by more than a halfmillion tons and the 
government daily izvestia said vorkutas electricity and heating 
supplies were threatened because of a coal shortage first deputy 
premier lev voronin says rationing of heat light and electricity 
may be necessary 
on oct 27 the supreme court of the komi autonomous republic 
where vorkuta is located said the strike grossly violated a 
labor law passed by the supreme soviet legislature earlier in the 
month the court found the miners in violation of provisions of the 
law that require conciliation and arbitration commissions to be set 
up before a strike occurs 
on tuesday the supreme court of the russian federation which 
includes the komi autonomous republic upheld the lower courts 
decision clearing the way for the sanctions to be imposed 
teryokhin said the court decision means the strike organizers face 
firing from the jobs and fines of 1620 each the case cannot be 
appealed to the national supreme court 
the miners had asked that the ruling be set aside because they 
contended proper court procedure was not followed 
four strike organizers are scheduled to meet with ryzhkov in 
moscow on friday to discuss the walkout but their representatives 
expressed little hope a solution will be reached 
virtually all the nations coal miners ended a twoweek strike 
in july after the government passed a resolution promising reforms 
including improved social and economic conditions the miners now 
say the government is not fulfilling its promises 
the workers also have advanced new political demands including 
removing language in the soviet constitution making the communist 
party the leading force of society they demand that power be 
turned over to local governing councils land to farmers and 
factories to workers

nations economy from the verge of utter catastrophe 
we are not asking for charity or expecting philanthropy but 
we would like to see our country treated as a partner and a 
friend walesa said in a historic speech to a joint meeting of 
the house and senate

house chamber as walesa made his way to the podium he stood in 
silence as the ovation thundered on for seven minutes

his arms and flashed a double v sign with his hands a symbol 
favored in poland by solidarity supporters 
after his speech walesa was meeting congressional leaders 
sitting down with secretary of state james a baker iii and 
returning to the capitol for a dinner he dined with president bush 
at the white house tuesday night 
walesas appearance marked only the second time a foreign 
private citizen spoke to a joint meeting of congress and the first 
since the marquis de lafayette appeared in 1824

solidarity to back their words with solid economic support 
being a worker and a man of concrete work i must tell you 
that the supply of words on the world market is plentiful but the 
demand is falling let deeds follow words now the 46yearold 
onetime shipyard electrician said

translation filling the chamber with the rustle of paper as they 
turned each of the seven pages an interpreter rendered his words 
into english for a vaster television audience 
walesa was repeatedly interrupted with applause it filled the 
chamber as he concluded walked from therostrum and pumped hands 
all the way to the door

legislation to send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to his 
country 
his speech in the house chamber came on the second day of a 
weeklong trip to the united states 
the senate voted 990 tuesday to authorize 657 million in 
economic aid to poland over three years and 81 million for 
hungary another east bloc nation attempting to shed its rigidly 
controlled economy 
the house went further approving an initial oneyear 
installment of 533 million for the two nations 
in his speech walesa offered a lengthy history of the 
solidarity labor movement and polands economy under four decades 
of communist rule 
he said investment from abroad was the only way to avoid 
economic collapse as the new solidarityled government shifts to a 
market economy 
efforts to rebuild the economy face a grave danger because 
of our long subjection to a political system incompatible with 
national traditions to a system of economy incompatible with 
rationality and common sense coupled with the stifling of 
independent thought and disregard for national interests walesa 
said 
all this has led the polish economy to ruin to the verge of 
utter catastrophe he said 
walesa also took time to thank the american people for their 
support of solidarity during the 1980s it is they who supported 
us in the difficult days of martial law and persecution he said 
it is they who sent us aid who protested against violence 
today when i am able to freely address the whole world from this 
elevated spot i would like to thank them with special warmth 
walesa said the economic assistance planned by congress opens 
a new road to rebuild the polish economy for this wonderful 
decision i thank you warmly i promise you that this aid will not 
be wasted and will never be forgotten he said 
walesa told audiences tuesday that poland needs massive western 
investment to make her way to the shore of freedom 
i know that the pioneer spirit which made this country big and 
free is still around walesa told a convention of the aflcio 
labor federation i would like you to transplant this spirit to 
poland do not let the world and us wait any longer 
walesa wept openly after a 15minute standing ovation welcoming 
him to the convention hall 
he thanked the united states its people its labor movement and 
its government for being our most steadfast allies in 
solidaritys long and bitter struggle with the communist regime it 
eventually replaced in free elections 
today when we are threatened by recession and inflation 
rather than police repressions we need this international 
solidarity no less than in the past he said 
walesa accepted the aflcios george meany human rights award 
which he won in 1981 two years before receiving the nobel peace 
prize 
the eightyear delay in collecting the award was caused by 
walesas fear he would be barred from returning to his country and 
forced into exile 
walesa who received the presidential medal of freedom from 
president bush on monday told a news conference our country 
needs your experience your knowledge your modern technologies 
sometimes we feel as if we are swimming chained hand and foot 
trying to summon all our energy just to make it safely to shore 
walesa said and on the shore there is a cheering crowd of people 
who offer us their admiration instead of simply throwing a life 
belt 
we want to make it to the shore to join the community of 
democratic countries with efficient economies walesa said

lesya yurshova smiled for the tv camera while 
doctors operated on her hernia with no other anesthetic than the 
mental energy of one of the countrys popular psychic healers 
eight and a half months later however she has stopped smiling 
and started talking she was in monstrous pain which tormented 
me from the first minute of the operation until the end 
her revelation in an interview with the weekly literaturnaya 
gazeta was the most damaging of several reports this week clouding 
the reputation of anatoly m kashpirovsky which quickly drew the 
attention of many soviets 
kashpirovsky is one of the two bestknown healers who have 
gripped soviet society this year with their claims to be able to 
cure illnesses with mental energy even over tv many people have 
turned to them out of despair over a medical system in which many 
medicines are not available and much of the equipment and 
scientific knowledge is out of date 
miss yurshova underwent the operation in the capital of the 
georgian republic tbilisi while kashpirovsky was hundreds of 
miles away his mental energy transmitted to miss yurshova over 
television was to block the pain the operation helped build 
kashpirovskys reputation as a healer among soviets 
she said in the interview published in wednesdays edition of 
literaturnaya gazeta that she endured the pain and even smiled 
for the camera because she did not want to let him down 
the faith healer promised she would feel nothing worse than a 
mosquito bite and that after recovering that she would travel 
abroad to advertise his method miss yershova said 
in a tv session shown tuesday night on the late evening program 
good evening moscow kashpirovsky claimed that miss yurshova 
attacked him only because he did not send her abroad as promised 
kashpirovsky staring straight into the tv camera with his dark 
eyes also told his followers he could not be blamed for pure 
coincidences 
kashpirovsky and another healer alan chumak have appeared all 
over the soviet union including at news conferences at the soviet 
foreign ministrys information department their popularity has 
spread widely through their exposure on television 
citing viewer surveys that indicate many people believe chumaks 
sessions have helped them the tass news agency said that beginning 
wednesday radio moscows world service would begin transmitting a 
510 minute program with the healer in more than 10 languages 
miss yurshova said she broke her silence because of her 
worsening health and kashpirovskys indifference her eyesight and 
hearing have worsened and she suffers headaches and chest pain she 
said 
after the operation which was another step toward olympus for 
anatoly mikhailovich he became indifferent to my fate and he told 
me so she told the respected newspaper 
leningrad tv reported earlier this week on claims that a 
7yearold boy lost consciousness and was paralyzed after watching 
one of kashpirovskys televised sessions 
doctors familiar with the boys case told the daily 
komsomolskaya pravda the boy was suffering from an infection of the 
brain and that kashpirovsky had nothing to do with it one way or 
the other 
in another case detailed by the communist party daily pravda on 
wednesday a moscow cooperative is being investigated for allegedly 
trying to organize a phony healing session in the southern city of 
krasnodar for an advance price of 97000 
officials said they have determined kashpirovsky was not 
involved in the plan

the white house said today an unprecedented 
48hour cutback in naval operations is important for the safety 
of the navy and would not compromise us readiness at sea 
its exactly the right thing and it was done in the right 
manner said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the unprecedented operations cutback and 48hour safety check 
designed to stem the string of deadly accidents plaguing the 
service was announced tuesday by adm carlisle ah trost the 
chief of naval operations 
he ordered that a safety standdown be conducted at all navy 
facilities within three days 
fitzwater said the order does not involve the frontline 
forces and those in places like the mediterranean and the indian 
ocean and so forth that are involved in militarily sensitive 
situations 
the spokesman said president bush did not have advance notice of 
the safety review because its an administrative action that the 
navy has taken and there was no need to notify the white 
house 
however fitzwater added we do support it we think its 
important for the safety of the navy 
trost in announcing the decision told reporters that prudent 
leadership demands that we take a look at everything that might be 
a possible cause for this recent spate of accidents regardless of 
their severity 
the order requires ships flying squadrons and shore facilities 
to interrupt normal operations and review basic safety and 
operating procedures 
however it allows such operations as ship movements in the 
persian gulf and druginterdiction activities to continue the 
fourstar admiral said 
a standdown does not say bring ships in from sea stop 
flying airplanes completely clearly operations around the 
world must continue trost said 
in his statement trost told fleet commanders and other senior 
navy leaders that they should leave no stone unturned to ensure 
the safety of operations is foremost in the minds of all hands 
the order also requires all commanders to report their findings 
after the 48hour interruption in operations 
the action came as the navy has suffered through a series of 
mishaps since oct 29 in which 10 people have been killed or lost 
at sea and at least 53 people injured 
between jan 1 and nov 1 the navy counted 101 operation and 
training related fatalities in the service including 47 in the 
explosion aboard the uss iowa on april 19 
the admiral defended the navys safety record saying that 
absent the iowa fatalities this would be the services safest year 
in this decade 
trost said he has found no common thread in the recent spate of 
accidents that some were due to mechanical failure while others 
were caused by human error such as a lapse of attention to 
procedure 
he said he did not believe commanders were working their sailors 
too hard but he wanted to ensure that no short cuts were being 
taken during the many dangerous activities that navy personnel must 
conduct every day 
the admiral said all commanders should ask are we adhering to 
all the proper procedures are we doing what we should be the way 
we should be doing it is there something were overlooking 
are people getting careless 
i would say there are three problems here james webb who 
was navy secretary during part of the reagan administration said 
today on cbs this morning one is the continuous operating 
environment where you can get careless the second is the technical 
nature of the equipment but i would say by and large the people 
are very good right now 
the third is the training environment teaching people how to 
anticipate problems and to make sure junior leaders are 
supervising when the people under them are in a dangerous 
environment webb said 
overall the navy has 599000 fulltime personnel and some 566 
ships and usually a third of those are at sea for training 
operations at any one time 
the announcement came as three more incidents were added to the 
navys accident list 
a navy f14 jet fighter crashed in the gulf of mexico 60 miles 
northwest of key west fla with the crew escaping serious injury 
a fire broke out aboard the amphibious assault ship uss inchon 
in norfolk va injuring 31 people as the vessel was undergoing 
shipyard maintenance 
a navy ordnance technician suffered minor burns and possible 
eye injuries when an experimental explosive mixture detonated in a 
research laboratory at the naval surface weapons testing center in 
white oak md 
in recent weeks the service has been plagued by a number of 
deadly accidents including a training jet crashing into an aircraft 
carrier off florida in which five people were killed sailors who 
have been washed overboard on two different aircraft carriers and 
the accidental bombing of a ship by a navy pilot in the indian 
ocean 
on monday the destroyer uss kinkaid and a freighter collided in 
the malacca strait 240 miles northwest of singapore killing one 
navy crewman injuring five and starting fires on both vessels 
last thursday a navy reserve pilot flying an a7e jet crashed 
into an apartment complex in smyrna ga killing two civilians and 
injuring two others including himself 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the senate 
armed services committee called the action a prudent step 
if i were the secretary of the navy today i would be taking 
the exact same steps said warner a former navy secretary 
rep ike skelton dmo a member of the house armed services 
committee said that although the recent accidents didnt appear to 
be related it was a very wise move on the navys part to 
review safety procedures 
rep charles bennett dfla chairman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical 
materials also said the navys decision was wise but he added 
criticism of the services leadership 
in particular he complained the navy has decided to make capt 
fred moosally skipper of the uss iowa eligible for another major 
command 
the iowa explosion killed 47 sailors including the gunners 
mate that the navy later said most likely caused the blast 
intentionally

the drama in east germany is forcing britain to 
ponder anew its place in europe 
some analysts say now is the time to get into closer step with 
the continent to join forces in order to absorb a unified german 
colossus and thus render it harmless 
others argue the opposite that as the old order unravels and 
longheld certainties disintegrate britain should keep its 
distance and wait for the dust of the crumbling berlin wall to 
settle 
the question of britains place in europe is an old one but it 
had become urgent well before the momentous changes overtook 
poland hungary and the germanys 
the 12nation european economic community of which britain is a 
member is to become a single tariff and passportfree trading 
bloc at the end of 1992 and has ambitious plans for monetary union 
and europewide standards on workers rights and social welfare 
prime minister margaret thatcher the crusading freemarketeer 
believes these are corporatist tendencies and that the eec 
bureaucracy in brussels is trying to foist on her the very 
socialist constraints she has fought for 10 years to eradicate in 
britain 
economic and monetary union which france is pressing would be 
an intolerable encroachment on national sovereignty says mrs 
thatcher 
the eec she insists is primarily a trading bloc and that by 
unshackling the markets abolishing currency controls and opening 
britain to outside investment she is being a good european 
she repeated this position monday signaling that events in 
germany had not changed her mind at all but the conflicting 
reactions to her speech underlined the differing attitudes while 
the times of london praised mrs thatchers realism the 
guardian denounced her as the supreme nitpicker of europe 
britons who share mrs thatchers view tend to see the 
internal market as the end of a process while the others see it as 
the beginning of something more dynamic said vernon bogdanor a 
constitutional expert at oxford university 
until recently mrs thatchers approach seemed like smart 
politics the british never have shared the continents romantic 
philosophical notion of europe 
they sometimes seem to relish being odd nation out whether in 
refusing to join the exchange rate mechanism that harmonizes the 
european currencies or in resisting attempts by brussels to impose 
new health warnings on cigarette packs 
they cling to what sets them apart whether its driving on the 
left or measuring distances in miles their biggestcirculation 
newspaper repeatedly derides the french as frogs and union 
featherbedding is known as spanish practices 
in the election campaign for the european parliament in june 
mrs thatchers conservative party built its propaganda around the 
specter of interfering eec bureaucrats complete with feeble puns 
about forcefeeding the british on brussels sprouts 
but the tories were routed by the opposition labor party and 
many analysts sensed a sea change in public opinion perhaps it 
was suggested europebashing was no longer a votecatcher 
the issue of the exchange rate mechanism triggered a crisis last 
month that prompted the resignation of nigel lawson chancellor of 
the exchequer and architect of the boom of the mid1980s now comes 
a new and bigger challenge in the shape of berlin 
the prointegrationists paint a scenario of a united germany 
with an economy as big and britains and frances combined to 
prevent germany going neutral and drifting to the new markets of 
eastern europe western europe must tighten its bonds thus tying 
germany inextricably to the eec and dampening any temptation by 
german to flex its nationalist muscle 
the counterargument says harmonization of social law and 
monetary union are difficult enough when economies as different as 
portugals and west germanys are involved add east germany and 
later perhaps hungary and poland and harmonization begins to 
look like a joke 
for those who worry about a germany getting back to its old 
style through reunification the only answer is to bind germany 
more tightly and tightly to the community says former prime 
minister edward heath who took britain into the eec in 1973 
if west germany is going to be bound more tightly into the 
community then we in britain have got to be as well he said 
wednesday if we drag our feet then theyll go ahead and just 
leave us outside

the staff of the polish embassy consisting 
mainly of career communist party members gave a collective gasp 
when solidarity leader lech walesa cheerfully said he hoped to see 
them all in poland soon 
but walesa giving a pep talk to the embassy staff assured them 
he was just being friendly that he thought they were doing a great 
job improving relations with the united states and that the 
solidarityled government has no plans to call them home 
i am not taking the place of the government i am not 
replacing anybody at the embassy walesa said 
that was good news for ambassador jan kinast who served as 
deputy foreign minister in the communistled government that 
preceded solidarity to pwer and who has been working long hours 
since then to rally us economic support for the new reform 
government 
the embassy staff played virtually no role in arranging the 
walesa visit which was sponsored by the aflcio labor federation 
but its diplomats have had their hands full getting ready for 
visits by many polish government dignitaries and an unending stream 
of us congressional and administration figures headed for poland 
ryszard krystosik the no 2 embassy official said in an interview 
this week 
many of polands foreign service professionals shared the 
conciliatory sentiments expressed by walesa 
we should forget our differences walesa told them we 
have had many over the last 45 years many of those were caused by 
others 
this is the time for all poles to work together for 
poland walesa told the diplomats assembled in the second floor 
reception room of the stately turnofthe century mansion atop 
meridian hill in washington he spoke to them tuesday during a 
hectic week and his remarks were recounted by three poles who were 
present 
walesa who is chairman of the solidarity trade union but holds 
no government post arrived in washington on monday on a trip that 
includes numerous honors as well as nonstop exhortations for 
americans to send aid and investment to bolster the polish reforms 
his remark about seeing the polish diplomats soon in poland 
delivered at the end of a short pep talk was taken in the same 
good humor it was made said one pole who was present 
it didnt have any overtones at all said a polish diplomat 
who spoke on condition he not be further identified he was very 
courteous and was very well received 
although courtesy cannot entirely ease the tension caused in the 
diplomatic corps by the fall of the communist government after 45 
years in power krystosik said the embassy staff is dedicated to 
seeking us aid to bolster the polands reform government 
we know very well how important is the role of the united 
states as the leader of the western world we know very well the 
initiative of the united states organizing and sponsoring 
assistance to poland a program that paves the way for the 
implementation of polish reforms he said 
the embassy presents the policy line of the government of 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the solidarity adviser that 
heads the government said krystosik 
besides said other polish diplomats the presence of a 
solidarity rather than a communist government in warsaw has eased 
one of their main tasks promoting uspolish friendship 
polish diplomats showing a reporter around the embassy this 
week eagerly pointed out icons of polishamerican friendship 
including a letter to thomas jefferson from thaddeus kosciusko a 
pole who served as a colonel in the american revolution then 
returned to poland and led two uprisings against russian domination 
in one corner of the main reception area stands a steinway grand 
piano owned by ignace paderewski who was polish premier in 1919 
and who performed many times in the united states as a reknowned 
concert pianist 
one polish diplomat played a few bars on the piano looked up 
thoughtfully and said we really ought to get this thing tuned

the nicaraguan government in a bid to break 
an impasse in negotiations with the contras has dropped its demand 
for the immediate demobilization of the rebels a sandinista 
official said today 
vice foreign minister victor hugo tinoco said the government 
instead is insisting as its price for a restoration of a 
ceasefire the evacuation of the rebels from nicaraguan territory 
to contra base camps in honduras 
we think that is a very important change in our position 
tinoco told a news conference at the nicaraguan embassy 
when the two sides recessed tuesday evening after their fourth 
round of talks nicaraguan cardinal miguel ovando y bravo was 
downcast as he spoke to reporters 
i was more optimistic last thursday when the talks started 
than i am now he said 
the talks were to resume later today the sandinistas and the 
contras both agree a ceasefire should be a first step but beyond 
that there is a large gap between their respective positions 
meanwhile president bush said tuesday that he is sending a 
20member congressional team to monitor the elections in nicaragua 
and he vowed to make east bloc arms shipments to managua an issue 
at the malta superpower summit in 18 days 
bush said the soviets can help facilitate free elections by 
cutting off arms deliveries to nicaragua the one country that 
seems to be swimming against the democratic tide 
chief contra negotiator col enrique bermudez said the 
sandinistas are conditioning everything on the withdrawal of our 
forces from nicaraguan territory and their demobilization 
the estimated 5000 contras based in nicaragua bermudez said 
should be allowed to remain in place when the ceasefire goes into 
effect 
the two sides had been informally observing a ceasefire reached 
in march 1988 but president daniel ortega contending there had 
been widespread violations by contra forces allowed the truce to 
lapse nov 1 
he has said that elections set for feb 25 will go ahead as 
scheduled even if there is no settlement with the contras the 
rebels are wary about demobilizing without ironclad guarantees that 
they will be able to return in safety to a democratic nicaragua 
bermudez complained that the sandinista delegation refused to 
consider a truce even for the duration of the peace talks 
helping to prod the delegations toward a settlement were 
representatives from the united nations and the organization of 
american states they are members of the international commission 
for support and verification which was set up to oversee the peace 
process ovando y bravo is attending the talks as a witness 
bush alleged anew that the sandinistas for their part are arming 
the marxist rebels in el salvador 
salvadoran rebels are engaging in senseless bloodshed and 
are aided and abetted by nicaragua and the cuban government in 
central america bush said tuesday at a luncheon meeting for oas 
foreign ministers gathered here 
the salvadoran rebels launched the biggest offensive of their 
10year war over the weekend virtually paralyzing much of san 
salvador and leaving hundreds dead 
the state department announced the administration was enlisting 
retired diplomat harry shlaudeman to give advice and monitor the 
nicaraguan talks 
shlaudeman 63 has agreed to work as a consultant to the 
department but state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
he will not participate directly in the discussions nor have 
substantive contact with sandinista officials 
nonetheless a senior official said shlaudeman did have a 
halfhour meeting in recent days with sandinista diplomats at their 
request he was in a listening capacity said the official 
asking not to be identified

the white house said today we have no 
apologies for extolling capitalism as a remedy for the economic 
woes of eastern europe and said the us position should not be 
offensive to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the statement by white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
followed a warning by gorbachev that the west should not gloat 
about the demise of socialism or attempt to export capitalism 
fitzwater said president bush views the freemarket economy of 
the united states as the pride of the world and as a good way to 
reform the economic problems that they are facing 
we certainly are proud of the capitalist system and the 
rewards that it has offered he added we hold it up as an 
example to all but we have not tried to dictate it to any of these 
countries 
nevertheless fitzwater said all the actions taken by the 
united states have been appropriate and not been offensive and 
have had the desired effect of offering our support without 
inciting revolution or other actions that would take the process 
backward we have no apologies or concern with anything that 
weve done at this point 
gorbachev said westerners who claim the changes in the east 
signify the failure of socialism are engaging in wishful 
thinking he did not say to whom he was referring we are 
expanding the potential of the socialist social system he said 
today 
bush who will meet gorbachev at a summit dec 23 declared 
himself unconcerned tuesday about the dizzying pace of change 
most recently the opening of east germanys borders and the easing 
of travel restrictions by czechoslovakia 
i dont think its moving too fast and i dont know of anybody 
in my administration that feels that its moving too fast the 
president said 
even so administration officials acknowledge they have been 
surprised by the rapidly changing events 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said experts from 
the state department national security council and other agencies 
were evaluating developments in the wake of last weeks opening of 
the berlin wall 
fitzwater said that rather than be preoccupied by the idea of 
the reunification of germany there are large issues of eastwest 
relations of the natowarsaw pacts future of the status of the 
soviet empire as these countries change their relationship with 
moscow 
all of those issues and questions are being considered by the 
united states government at this time he said obviously the 
questions call for answers that will lead to changing relationships 
and new policies and programs 
the changes in eastern europe will be at the top of the agenda 
when bush meets gorbachev in the shipboard summit in the waters of 
the mediterranean off the coast of malta 
despite heightened expectations the united states is trying to 
play down the summit 
we still see it as an informal meeting where no decisions will 
be made said one administration official insisting on anonymity 
but some political leaders are expressing concerns about the 
malta meeting 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed forces committee 
has warned that bush should expect a proposal from gorbachev to 
withdraw all us and soviet armed forces from europe within a few 
years 
the administration also has been warned that gorbachev may 
propose dismantling nato and the warsaw pact 
bush spoke of the developments in eastern europe during a speech 
to a gathering of foreign ministers from latin american nations 
im sure the people in every country here are caught up in 
this fantastic change thats taking place he said 
democrats are pressing bush to respond more strongly to the 
changes sweeping eastern europe 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said it was 
regrettable that bush had rejected the idea of going to berlin to 
express american satisfaction with the symbolic destruction of 
the wall or to normalize trade relations with the soviet union 
while the president has rejected all of these he has reversed 
himself on issues before and i hold out hope he will do so again 
mitchell said 
for his part bush hailed the decision by czechoslovakia one of 
the last hardline soviet bloc nations to ease travel restrictions 
on its citizens calling it a very encouraging first step 
several months ago we called for a europe whole and free and 
as i survey the changes taking place it seems to be moving towards 
a europe whole and free bush said 
the people of czechoslovakia have the same aspirations for 
freedom that others have and i would expect wed see further 
changes there just as we have seen in poland hungary and in east 
germany 
so its a very good and encouraging step he said and 
this is further manifestation that europe some day will be whole 
and free

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
nov 10 
the herald everett wash on east germany 
the iron curtain is up the berlin wall is down communism is on 
the rocks or so it seems based on the most recent news from east 
germany 
a propaganda minister for that nation announced the opening 
of east german borders to unrestricted travel a liberty denied 
citizens since the infamous wall was erected in 1961 this dramatic 
policy turnaround although a longawaited step toward freedom 
seems likely to accelerate the recent exodus from east to west 
that could pose enormous social and economic difficulties for 
both germanys so far in 1989 more than 200000 discontent east 
germans have fled their country seeking better lives in west 
germany as the east is losing its workers and young people the 
west is running out of jobs and housing 
not a moment too soon perhaps 28 years too late the east 
german government has heard its citizens demands 
egon krenz east germanys new head of state advocated a law 
that would ensure free democratic general elections with a 
secret ballot and with public supervision in every stage of the 
balloting 
krenz also has been pleading publicly for his countrymen to 
remain in their homeland and help build a new nation western 
leaders should join in encouraging east german citizens to stay and 
shape their free democratic destiny 
but why should east germans heed this call and take a chance on 
a bloody crackdown 
thats nearly impossible to answer yet an active role by the 
west might help push forward reforms and guard against a tiananmen 
squaretype massacre 
west germany chancellor helmut kohl already has pledged to meet 
with krenz and has offered farreaching aid if real political 
and economic changes take root president bush and leaders of 
the other western european nations would do well to follow 
kohls lead

baraboo wis newsrepublic on east germany 
there could be no greater symbol of the changes in europe than 
the announcement that the berlin wall no longer would stand in 
the way of free travel for east germans 
the news must come as a special joy to the millions of veterans 
in the united states who fought in two world wars to retain 
freedoms in europe 
the wall has stood for 28 years as a stark reminder that sharp 
divisions existed between east and west 
while the wall was effective in holding east germans hostage to 
a totalitarian regime it could not bend the minds of citizens who 
knew its true meaning not a wall to protect them from the west 
but rather a wall to prevent them from getting to the west

delta democrattimes greenville miss on panama 
if hollywood made a movie of the bush administrations handling 
of recent events in panama it would be called the gang that 
couldnt coup straight 
as more facts are revealed the bungling becomes even more 
embarrassing a newsweek cover story called it amateur hour 
but thats an inaccurate tag the men involved have years of 
experience in government 
this is one of the most credentialed administrations ever to 
hold office they should simply admit we goofed its our 
fault 
bush set the trap himself he made the mistake of setting up 
gen manuel noriega as a target calling repeatedly for his ouster 
and working with the coups unsuccessful plotters 
bushs best policy would be for him to simply say that the 
united states has no compelling interest in overthrowing 
noriega such an assertion by bush would be true leadership 
however ruthless a thug noriega is he does no great harm to 
us interests even his arrest as part of the phony drug war 
would hardly dent the influx of drugs into our country

argus leader sioux falls sd on former presidents 
much has been reported and debated lately about the proper role 
that expresidents should play 
current members of the exclusive fraternity are richard nixon 
gerald ford jimmy carter and ronald reagan 
the consensus of scholars and selfproclaimed political experts 
seems to be that of the four men carter is the model of public 
behavior carter decided even before leaving the presidency 
that he would not join any boards of directors or otherwise 
commercialize the presidency 
based on the citizenship carter has demonstrated since leaving 
office he would be a welcome addition to public service 
the same cant be said of the nations other three living 
expresidents at least it cant be said with as much enthusiasm

the athens ohio messenger on bush and abortions 
last year republican presidential candidate george bush found an 
unlikely political ally in willie horton a convict who raped a 
woman after skipping out of a massachusetts prison on a weekend 
furlough 
rightly or wrongly bush invoked the horton case as evidence his 
democratic opponent massachusetts gov michael dukakis was more 
concerned about criminals than about their victims 
now the specter of horton has come back to haunt the oval 
office during a congressional abortion debate rep steny h 
hoyer dmd raised these hypothetical questions what if horton 
had impregnated his victim would president bush want her to bear 
hortons baby 
an aroused electorate is closely watching the uncomfortable 
gyrations of politicians and subjecting them to an abortion litmus 
test time will tell how many candidates will lose because of their 
abortion positions or win despite them 
regardless bush should have approved the proposed abortion 
funding for poor victims of violent sex crimes he could have 
emerged as a voice of compassion and reason instead he seemed to 
box himself into a narrow corner far from the middle ground of the 
majority

st louis postdispatch on homosexuals in the military 
a recent gallup poll showed that 60 percent of americans believe 
that homosexuals should have a right to serve in the armed forces 
that figure is up from 52 percent in 1982 but if the public is 
becoming more tolerant about homosexuals in uniform the pentagon 
is not judging from its reaction to a couple of studies on the 
topic 
the first study is on whether homosexuals are security risks 
after reviewing the professional literature the researchers 
conclude that homosexuals posed no more of a risk to expionage 
blackmail than heterosexuals when the pentagon saw an early draft 
it called the report flawed biased and a waste of money 
the pentagons overreaction was not due to the quality of the 
reports scholarship which is high but to the fact that the 
studys findings disagree with the current pentagon policy to ban 
all homosexuals period 
a second study by the center also set off fireworks it found 
that homosexuals who attempted to join the military had fewer 
personal problems and were likely to adjust to military life as 
good or better than heterosexuals 
social attitudes are slowly changing on this issue the 
pentagons assumptions should change as well

portland maine press herald on the first amendment 
figure this one a national consumer group is asking congress to 
prevent a major american manufacturer from sponsoring an 
advertising campaign commemorating get this now the bill of 
rights 
the company in question is philip morris the consumer outfit 
public citizen health research group says the promotion smears 
the bill of rights with the blood of all americans killed as a 
result of smoking 
the cigarette manufacturer agreed to donate 600000 toward 
construction of an exhibit gallery in the national archives and to 
sponsor a series of television ads with archives cooperation 
celebrating the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the first 10 
amendments to the constitution 
a spokesman for the health research group says the agreement 
allows philip morris to obscure its deadly role in american and 
worldwide society and should be reversed it has called upon 
congress to do the reversing 
for heavens sake were talking the bill of rights here if 
anything is being obscured its the first amendment rights of a 
perfectly legal business enterprise engaged in a perfectly 
honorable celebration of american freedoms 
under the first amendment the public citizen health research 
group is free to condemn smoking tobacco manufacturing government 
subsidies of tobacco growers or anything else 
it is decidedly not free to prevent anybody including the

los angeles times on the stealth bomber 
congress is poised to pay for at least two more b2 stealth 
bombers at 530 million each the most expensive airplane in the 
nations history but it also has attached enough strings to make 
certain that the b2 does not fly away with the defense budget 
that makes sense in light of a study that says that the united 
states would spend 14 timesas much to hit a target with a b2 as it 
would have to spend to hit the same target with alternative weapons 
already on hand 
in theory the b2 could pounce on targets before an enemy knew 
it was coming but according to a recent analysis published by 
harvard universitys international security magazine using a b2 
would cost more than using a midgetman missile a singlewarhead 
missile that the air force has resisted as too expensive 
in fact the ability to sneak past radar may not even be 
important in a war the bomber would reach targets in the soviet 
union long after the united states had started retaliating with 
longrange missiles that might well have destroyed or at least 
ripped big holes in the radar screen of the soviet airdefense 
network so stealth would not be important 
if some radar were to survive there are nearly 100 b1b bombers 
already on duty that the air force says are nearly as elusive as 
the b2 
stealth bombers would be good for dropping bombs that would 
burrow into soviet command posts and explode the air force says 
but does that mission make sense would america want to kill the 
only soviets who might be able and willing to call off a nuclear 
war

government tv on wednesday broadcast 
an appeal for peace by a radical sinhalese leader that was 
videotaped while he was in custody and hours before he was shot to 
death by government troops 
officials also reported finding the bodies of 31 suspected 
sinhalese radicals wednesday and blamed the killings on vigilantes 
in favor of the sinhalesedominated government in a country wracked 
by ethnic and factional strife 
i appeal to all my followers to give up their armed struggle 
against the government and take to the democratic process to 
achieve our goals said rohana wijeweera the founder of the 
peoples liberation front in the broadcast 
wijeweera who was captured sunday voluntarily made the appeal 
for peace and sang like a bird about the whereabouts of his top 
lieutenants said a senior military source he and the fronts no 
2 and no 3 men were shot and killed within the next 18 hours 
according to government announcements 
the avowed marxist who used to have a beard and mustache was 
cleanshaven and the television clip showed him wearing a red beret 
and a white shirt he looked nervous but appeared to be in good 
health while making the sinhaleselanguage broadcast 
the government said wijeweera led security personnel to the 
groups colombo headquarters monday to question db herath the 
thirdranking leader of the front 
herath pulled a pistol and began firing at wijeweera and 
troops opened fire killing both of them said foreign minister 
ranjan wijeratne 
the fronts no 2 man upatissa gamanayake was killed while 
trying to escape capture monday the government said 
political leaders sypathetic to the front predicted more 
violence could follow the death of wijeweera whose personal safety 
had been guaranteed by president ranasinghe premadasa 
samuel dias bandaranaike leader of the sri lanka progressive 
front said the public would not believe the governments version 
of wijeweeras death 
the 31 bodies of suspected members of the group were discovered 
wednesday in the central hills and were likely killed by 
progovernment vigilante groups said the officials who cannot be 
identified under briefing rules 
more than 6000 people have been killed since august 1987 when 
the peoples liberation front started assassinating government 
officials and supporters the front professed outrage that the 
sinhalesedominated government was making concessions to the tamil 
minority and its battle escalated into a challenge of the 
governments right to exist 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
are mostly hindus and claim the predominantly buddhist sinhalese 
majority discriminate against them in jobs and education

growth of business inventories outpaced 
business sales in september the government said wednesday in a 
report that analysts said contained a warning of growing backlogs 
due to the slowing economy 
the commerce department reported that inventories held on 
shelves and backlots climbed 02 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
7918 billion after advancing 04 percent in august 
business sales on the other hand fell 03 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 5246 billion following a 3 percent gain the 
previous month 
the business activity produced a slight increase in the 
inventorytosales ratio to 151 meaning it would take 151 months 
to exhaust inventories at the september pace it was 150 in august 
at the moment the ratios do not appear excessive said 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co but they show the 
first signs of increases related to a declining business climate 
robert g dederick chief economist at the northern trust co in 
chicago agreed that on the surface the report suggests inventories 
are not yet a problem 
but there are some warning signals in it of some excess at the 
consumer level he said 
inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as 
output exceeds demand a process that could lead to production cuts 
and loss of jobs the economy has been experiencing sluggishness as 
the federal reserve tries to contain inflation by keeping a tight 
rein on credit 
retail inventories up 1 percent in september were of 
particular concern since an earlier report indicated they could be 
worse in october the commerce department said tuesday that retail 
sales fell a full 1 percent in october including a 51 percent 
decline in car sales 
manufacturers inventories which represent about 45 percent of 
the total slipped 01 percent and wholesale backlogs accounting 
for 25 percent of the total dropped 03 percent 
manufacturers sales on the other hand fell 16 percent in 
september retail and wholesale sales both were up 07 percent 
overall inventories were 64 percent above those of a year ago 
sales increased 67 percent over september 1988

the government wednesday denied it was 
trying to export capitalism to east germany but reiterated that 
its communist neighbor must undertake major economic reforms 
we do not export capitalism we export a lot of things but 
not capitalism chief government spokesman hans klein told the 
associated press 
klein also indicated chancellor helmut kohl may postpone a 
crucial summit with east germany until after an emergency dec 
1517 communist party congress that could choose a new party 
leadership 
economics minister helmut haussmann has proposed a massive 
economic aid program for east germany contingent upon concrete 
reforms in its statecontrolled economy 
east germany has promised sweeping economic reforms without 
elaborating on specific plans 
president mikhail s gorbachev has warned westerners not to 
gloat over the shaky condition of communism in the east bloc and 
cautioned that exporting capitalism could hurt the growing 
climate of cooperation in europe 
on saturday kohl said economic assistance to east germany 
cannot be successful unless the system of a stateplanned 
economy gives way to a socially responsible market economy 
klein rejected any suggestion that west germany wanted to impose 
its own type of economic system on its communist neighbor he said 
major economic reforms are needed if east germany expects to 
attract investors 
we say there must be market conditions which make it 
reasonable to invest there klein said 
but he shied away from stating flatly that a drastic economic 
overhaul in east germany was a precondition for financial aid 
volker ruehe general secretary of the christian democrats said 
there were some ways to help east germany soon including renewal 
of its telephone communications network and environmental projects 
but farreaching changes in the current economic system are 
needed for east germany to be able to attract desperately needed 
private investment ruehe said 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher a leader of the free 
democratic party said bonn should not set conditions for its aid 
he did say reform must show definite signals without 
explaining what the signals should be 
we must tell them we are ready to be helpful said juergen 
chrobog genschers chief spokesman 
at a news conference earlier in the day klein indicated kohl 
may postpone his summit with east german leaders until the end of 
december 
kohl initially said he would meet with east german communist 
party chief egon krenz either this month or in early december to 
discuss east germanys direction and possible financial assistance 
but kohls latest position is that the meeting will occur 
sometime this year klein said 
that left open the possibility the summit would be put off until 
after the communist party emergency congress 
rudolf seiters kohls chief of staff plans to fly to east 
berlin on monday to prepare kohls visit kohl on wednesday met 
with the heads of eight ministries to discuss the situation in east 
germany

the former guerrilla leader who is 
likely to become namibias first president promised wednesday to 
protect individual rights but said he might establish a oneparty 
political system 
sam nujoma leader of the leftist southwest africa peoples 
organization also said he would try to avoid dealings with the 
whiterun government in south africa which is ceding control of 
namibia after a 74year rule 
and he said english will become the sole official language of 
namibias government and schools with afrikaans the language of 
south africas dominant white group losing its official status 
swapo which began a guerrilla war for independence against 
south africa in 1966 was declared the winner tuesday of united 
nationssupervised elections for an assembly that will draft a 
constitution and declare independence 
swapo will have 41 of the 72 seats in the assembly which will 
convene next week at least 48 of the 72 members or twothirds 
must approve decisions by the assembly and swapo will have to 
bargain with at least some of the five other parties that won seats 
the democratic turnhalle alliance a multiracial coalition that 
favors a capitalist economy has 21 seats no other parties won 
more than four seats 
nujoma said at a news conference that namibians would not be 
pressured to join swapo but added if the namibian people chose 
to go oneparty and it is done at the polls democratically it will 
certainly be so 
asked about civil liberties under a swapoled government he 
replied certainly there will be freedom of the press freedom of 
assembly freedom of movement freedom of association and there 
will be also be freedom of religion 
we have no intentions of imposing our views on others and 
anticipate no serious disagreements nujoma said we stand 
ready to be guided by the democratic principles of open discussion 
and decision by the majority 
the last 1500 south african troops will be withdrawn nov 23 
said louis pienaar the territorys south africainstalled 
administrator most soldiers left by june and remaining units have 
been confined to two northern bases 
nujoma said his future government would demand that south africa 
surrender control of walvis bay a south african enclave which 
serves as namibias only deepwater port south africa says its 
ownership of walvis bay is upheld by international law but foreign 
minister pik botha on wednesday offered to negotiate terms of usage 
of the harbor 
i have always said there are two south africans one led by 
whiteminority settlers there that one we certainly will not deal 
with nujoma said but we respect nonracial south africa 
thats why we will deal with it 
swapo wants to declare independence as soon as possible but 
nujoma declined to set a date most observers believe namibia will 
become independent early next year as long as there are no serious 
hitches in writing the constitution 
during his 30 years in exile nujoma 60 and his movement were 
considered orthodox marxists since swapo leaders began returning 
to namibia earlier this year however they have taken a more 
moderate approach 
nujoma said swapo favors some government controls on the 
economy welcomes foreign investors and wants good relations with 
east and west he has repeatedly urged namibias 75000 whites and 
civil servants in particular to remain in the territory and help 
develop the emerging nation

abortion foes today savored their biggest 
victory since the us supreme court opened the way in july the 
pennsylvania legislatures passage of the most restrictive abortion 
law in the country 
its a very bright day for pennsylvanias national image 
said mary beliveau a leader of the pennsylvania prolife 
federation pennsylvania will stand out as a leader in the 
nation this legislation will be seen nationally as reasonable 
legislation 
the bill which bans most abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy 
and requires women to inform their husbands before getting an 
abortion cleared the senate 3317 on tuesday and goes to 
democratic gov robert p casey the house passed the bill last 
month 
im told the bill is in the same form as it was when it left 
the house casey said today if thats the case ill sign it 
abortionrights advocates after watching nine attempts to 
dilute or revise the bill fail warned that the legislature was out 
of step with national sentiment its a shame a national 
disgrace said sen vincent fumo a democrat 
some predicted abortion opponents would be voted out of office 
having failed to change their minds we will seriously commit 
ourselves to changing their faces on election day said chris 
niebrzydowski president of the state chapter of the national 
organization for women 
pennsylvania stands to become the first state to enact controls 
on abortion since the us supreme court in webster vs 
reproductive health services opened the way for new curbs the 
court upheld a missouri law banning the use of public funds or 
facilities for abortions and requiring tests after 24 weeks of 
pregnancy to determine whether the fetus could survive outside the 
womb 
the pennsylvania bill expands on earlier restrictions in banning 
most abortions in public hospitals it also bans abortions for the 
purpose of selecting the babys sex prohibits abortions after the 
24th week of pregnancy unless the mother faces death or 
irreversible harm establishes a 24hour waiting period after an 
abortion is requested and requires women to notify their husbands 
an unmarried woman would not have to notify the father 
the legislation also would require doctors to inform a woman of 
the age of the fetus before performing an abortion and explain the 
risks and alternatives it also would regulate the medical use of 
tissue from aborted fetuses 
what the bill does is put some sensible guidelines into law to 
try to protect the life of an unborn child said republican sen 
edward helfrick it doesnt prevent abortion it just restricts 
it 
republican rep stephen freind who drafted the bill and guided 
it through the house said its a big win its a big margin 
its great 
freind had said that the bill was designed as a direct challenge 
to roe vs wade and that he hopes it becomes the vehicle for the 
supreme court to overturn its 1973 decision establishing the right 
to an abortion 
passage of the bill puts the prochoice movement in a quandary 
forcing it to decide whether to challenge the law and risk losing 
roe vs wade 
doctors performing abortions after 24 weeks or because of the 
sex of the fetus could receive up to seven years in prison and up 
to 15000 in fines a husband could seek damages against a doctor 
who performs an abortion without a form showing that he had been 
notified 
rep gerard kosinski a democratic supporter of the bill said 
the bill seeks penalties against doctors because they have duties 
over and above what normal people would have 
the focus is not absolutely not on the woman having the 
abortion he said the woman should never be penalized for having 
an abortion 
pennsylvanias legislature has traditionally been antiabortion 
even though many polls show that most pennsylvanians are 
prochoice the state has a large rural conservative population 
and both sides agree that the antiabortion movement has been more 
efficient politically than the prochoice side employing 
picketing phone calls and mass mailings 
over the past decade the legislature has several times passed 
restrictions on abortion but some of the more extreme portions 
have been struck down by the courts 
passage of the bill comes after a series of victories elsewhere 
by the abortionrights side 
two weeks ago voters in new jersey and virginia elected 
governors with prochoice positions a special session of florida 
legislature last month ended with lawmakers rejecting every 
proposal to restrict abortions 
abortion foes in illinois abandoned their attempts to get more 
restrictions passed until next year after a bill stalled last month 
in a house committee 
the biggest antiabortion victory since the supreme court ruling 
came last month in michigan where the senate approved a bill 
requiring parental consent for a girl under the age of 18 that 
proposal is under house consideration

doctors exploring the body with tiny 
ultrasound probes say they have embarked on a fantastic voyage 
getting an inside view of the maze of blood vessels and the heart 
itself 
in scientific presentations wednesday doctors described 
experimental use of the devices to make live crosssectional 
pictures that help them see problems and guide tools to fix them 
its a fantastic voyage said dr natesa pandian its 
almost like you are traveling inside the blood vessels and looking 
around 
several other doctors working with the new technique also 
likened it to the exploits in fantastic voyage a 1966 movie 
starring raquel welch in which miniaturized doctors traveled 
through their patients bloodstream 
pandian and colleagues at new england medical center in boston 
are among about 20 teams around the world that have been testing 
the new technology over the past two years several progress 
reports were presented at the annual meeting of the american heart 
association 
ultrasound is already widely used to take pictures from outside 
the body in the new approach however ultrasoundgenerating 
crystals are put in the end of thin tubes called catheters and 
pushed through the blood vessels 
the result is a detailed inside look at the arteries as well as 
a crosssectional view of their walls 
its the only technology we have in which we can actually 
characterize whats in the wall of the blood vessel said dr 
carl j pepine of the university of florida 
in many people with heart disease fatty deposits clog the 
arteries that feed their heart muscle doctors say the new 
ultrasound probes should help them figure out the particular kind 
of material that makes up these lumps so they can pick the best 
tool to remove them 
its almost like live pathology as though we had taken a 
section of the heart or blood vessel stained it and looked at it 
under a microscope said pandian 
doctors can now use balloons that squeeze the fatty deposits out 
of the way cut them with miniature saws and burn them off with 
lasers 
one drawback of some of the artery cleaning devices is that they 
sometimes remove too much breaking through the artery wall with 
the detail revealed by the new ultrasound pictures doctors believe 
they will know when to halt before they do more harm than good 
it will make us a lot smarter said dr jeffrey m isner of 
st elizabeths hospital in boston 
isners team has also used the probes to look inside the heart 
while they fix defective heart valves eventually he said they 
might also be used to check the movement of the hearts walls and 
check it for clots 
among other studies presented at the meeting wednesday 
doctors from brigham and womens hospital in boston said an 
experimental test appears to spot the earliest stages of 
cholesterols damage to the blood vessels they found that when 
exposed to the nerve chemical acetylcholine healthy blood vessels 
expand but if they are damaged they contract they hope to use 
the test to spot early signs of trouble in heart transplant 
recipients who are at high risk for artery disease 
researchers from the medical college of wisconsin found that 
in some cases severely restricting salt in the diet may not be the 
best advice in a study of young men they found that half had no 
change or even a rise in their blood pressure while on a lowsalt 
diet the heart association said that despite these preliminary 
findings it is sticking with its recommendation that people limit 
their daily intake to one and a half teaspoons of salt 
doctors from the university of oslo in norway found that 
people with large numbers of bloodclotting cells called platelets 
are at unusually high risk of death from heart disease they 
followed 2014 middleaged men for 13 years and found that the 25 
percent with the highest platelet counts had about double the death 
rate of the other men

president bush and house leaders agreed today 
on a package of congressional pay raises and ethics reforms 
clearing the way for swift action before congress adjourns next 
week 
i am very confident the president will make a statement later 
today house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters 
the pay plan would bring house salaries from 89500 to about 
120700 in just over 13 months and impose new ethics rules on the 
amount and type of outside income members could earn 
the house plan would apply to top officials governmentwide 
except for the senate which was consiering a separate ethics and 
pay package 
the house would get a 79 percent raise by jan 1 as a 
costofliving adjustment for the two years since salaries were 
last increased a 25 percent raise would take effect a year later 
to coincide with the loss in income house members would suffer when 
a prohibition takes effect on accepting fees for speeches before 
interest groups 
the bill also would tighten rules for other outside income and 
gifts require more disclosure of personal wealth and make other 
ethics reforms 
on tuesday white house counsel c boyden gray told lawmakers 
their plan failed to impose enough ethics restrictions on 
legislative branch officials and their staffs similar to those 
governing the executive branch according to sources who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity 
house minority leader robert michel rill met with white 
house chief of staff john sununu today and settled the dispute the 
sources said 
the pay increase itself was supported by the white house because 
it also applied to federal judges and top officials in the 
executive branch 
house democratic and republican leaders had hoped to settle 
their discussions with the white house by days end tuesday they 
were forced to postpone until thursday party caucuses planned for 
today as the first step in the final push 
we want to make sure we can tell the caucus that we have an 
understanding said rep steny hoyer dmd chairman of the 
house democratic caucus 
to demonstrate for rankandfile members the bipartisan support 
for the pay raise foley and majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo plan to appear before the house republican conference and 
their gop counterparts minority leader robert michel rill and 
minority whip newt gingrich rga were going before the 
democratic caucus 
foley expressed confidence the house would approve the 
payandethics plan senate sentiment remained uncertain but foley 
said he had received very strong assurances from the leaders of 
that chamber that it would not block the plan 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he 
envisioned a different pay and ethics plan one in which senators 
would take only part of the pay raise and phase out speech 
honoraria more slowly 
but many house members expressed strong reservations about the 
senate saying they feared the other chamber would stick the house 
with the worst of all worlds a politically difficult vote 
recorded in favor of a pay raise and no pay raise 
the new pay raise proposal is more modest than the 51 percent 
raise with no ethics package that congress rejected last winter in 
response to a storm of public criticism 
instead of looking for ways to capitalize on the issue 
republicans and democrats lingered on the house floor discussing 
arrangements for mutual political protection so they both could 
vote for the pay raise 
its better than monte carlo out there said one democrat 
who insisted his name not be used

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir took his 
appeal against plo participation in mideast talks to president bush 
today after a twohour session with secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
both shamir and baker claimed some progress toward arranging 
talks between israel and palestinian arabs 
shamir said the discussions would have to be continued and 
baker stressed there was no reply yet from egypt which is acting 
as the surrogate for the palestine liberation organization 
white house and state department spokesmen said no deadline had 
been imposed 
its important not to become impatient when youre dealing 
with the middle east presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said two thousand years is the normal wait for things to 
happen 
as shamir met with baker fitzwater told reporters who asked if 
bush was frustrated the peace process has been going on for a 
number of years you keep working at it and keep plugging away 
you keep chipping away at it you keep trying to make progress and 
trying to move forward 
but fitzwater added you have to fight frustration because 
its just not a fast process 
shamir is appealing to bush against a plo role in the talks 
being arranged between israel and palestinian arabs the israeli 
leader does not want to legitimize yasser arafats organization 
which has conducted terrorist attacks against israel or be drawn 
into negotiations over territory 
although shamirs plan to visit washington surfaced two months 
ago the white house delayed until last week in arranging a meeting 
with bush this was interpreted in some reports as evidence of 
white house frustration with shamir 
the israeli leader on an 11day trip to the united states and 
europe wants to restrict the talks with palestinian arabs to 
arrangements for limited selfrule on the west bank and in gaza 
but the plo has not given its approval for the talks and bush 
and baker might weigh giving ironclad assurances to israel against 
risking plo disapproval 
it is generally assumed palestinians would not negotiate with 
israel without a green light from the plo and the organization is 
demanding a state carved out of territory held by israel 
shamir who arrived monday saw baker over lunch at the state 
department today before calling on bush on thursday the prime 
minister has scheduled meetings on capitol hill with members of the 
house foreign affairs and the senate foreign relations committees 
egypt is acting as a surrogate for the plo and has asked for 
clarifications of a plan by baker to get israel and 
palestinians together the israeli cabinet meanwhile is seeking 
assurances that the plo and its members would play no role in the 
talks 
baker telephoned egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid 
tuesday afternoon the state department declined to provide any 
information about their conversation 
in cairo abdelmeguid said baker gave me the us response to 
the palestinian request for clarifications and explanations that i 
had relayed last friday he offered no details 
the situation has grown complex even by middle eastern 
standards 
before the talks are held baker has proposed that he meet here 
with foreign ministers moshe arens of israel and esmat abdel meguid 
of egypt 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said the 
points raised by israel and by egypt for the plo would have to be 
ironed out before baker held the washington meeting 
weve always said you have to have acceptance on a 
framework she said 
ms tutwiler did not seem frustrated by the absence of an 
official response from egypt to bakers proposal for the 
israelipalestinian talks 
if at any point you get a positive reply its helpful she 
said but there is no time frame on it 
shamir was visited in his midtown hotel suite tuesday by 
officials from the american israel public affairs committee a 
lobbying and research group and from the conference of presidents 
of major american jewish organizations 
he also met with israeli ambassador moshe arad and other israeli 
embassy officials 
apart from some differences with the bush administration the 
prime minister has been getting conflicting advice from american 
jews who comprise the largest jewish community in the world 
some are urging him to be conciliatory others are trying to 
bolster shamirs resolve not to make territorial and other 
concessions before negotiations are held 
some 200 american rabbis signed a letter circulated by the 
american jewish peace lobby urging shamir to accept the principle 
before any negotiations that israel should relinquish land in 
return for peace with the arabs 
israel and its wellbeing are not only the concerns of the 
inhabitants of that country but touch the heart and religious 
feeling of every jew in the world rabbi jerome malino of 
danbury conn said in a statement we should be prepared to 
take the risk for peace we are so often prepared to take for war

president mikhail s gorbachevs top economist 
said wednesday that reformers must push a radical lastchance 
decentralization plan on a soviet public and parliament that may be 
waiting for a miracle 
instead of taking the bitter medicine of higher prices harder 
work and temporary unemployment in the next few years soviets 
expect those guys from ufos will come down and explain 
everything said deputy premier leonid i abalkin 
if they fail to embrace the program soviets face widespread 
rationing and the failure of reform he said 
abalkin spoke at the end of a threeday conference of academics 
and economic managers devoted to his plan of measured price 
increases dumping unprofitable staterun business expanding forms 
of ownership and developing a stock market 
it is the most detailed plan produced in more than four years 
it spells out what interim steps the country must take to develop 
more of a market economy and attain convertibility of the ruble 
the conference reached a general consensus on the need for 
change more radical than the government has tried so far abalkin 
said without giving details 
the plan will be presented to the 2250member congress of 
peoples deputies when it holds its second session dec 12 and is 
expected to serve as a blueprint for the government to measure 
several key pieces of economic legislation including one on varied 
forms of property ownership 
abalkin said he expects resistance in the congress which 
resembled a poorly organized debating society through much of its 
first session six months ago he said he was surprised by the mood 
of the academicians and economists 
the conservative mood was stronger than i thought before the 
conference he said 
the powerful pressure was mostly exerted from the conservative 
side abalkin said maybe that does reflect the general 
condition of the country 
most of the speeches from the conference have not been made 
public and abalkin would not specify what objections were voiced 
the economist said that after a summer of strikes by thousands 
of coal miners and worsening shortages of many food items the mood 
of the public appears to have gotten more conservative 
opening the conference monday he cited poll data that indicated 
54 percent of those questioned thought the countrys most urgent 
problem was to impose strict discipline and order another 40 
percent thought that the government should impose more price 
controls rather than gradually free up prices as called for in his 
plan 
abalkin vowed to fight to change public opinion and convince the 
congress of peoples deputies in september the economist was 
subjected to a blistering attack in the supreme soviet legislature 
by lawmakers who criticized the conduct of cooperatives the small 
private businesses allowed under gorbachevs reforms that many 
suspect of price gouging and racketeering 
if there is a shift to the right it will complicate 
implementation of the program but it wont make us go back he 
said 
without restructuring the soviet economy has no future he 
added 
economists have rejected proposals to impose widespread 
rationing which is popular with some soviets because it appeals to 
the sense of equality drilled in over more than 70 years of soviet 
power 
abalkin said his plan gives local authorities the power to 
impose rationing if they wish but it rejects rationing as a 
countrywide solution to shortages 
he warned however that failure to adopt a radical reform will 
lead to widespread rationing 
if something stands in the way of its implementation and we 
cannot stabilize the situation in the country this system will 
become unavoidable but it will mean an end to reform he said

a parttime soldier was injured 
wednesday when a letter bomb sent to his home near belfast exploded 
as he opened it police said 
the man a member of the territorial army reserve force escaped 
serious injury but was being treated in hospital for his wounds and 
for severe shock the royal ulster constabulary said 
the bomb was sent to the soldiers home in the rathcoole area of 
newtownabbey on the northern outskirts of belfast police said he 
was not identified 
lt gen sir david ramsbotham 55 commander of the british 
field army and inspector general of the territorial army was 
identified tuesday as the target of a botched car bombing in london 
no group claimed responsibility for either attack but suspicion 
fell on the irish republican army which is fighting to end british 
rule in northern ireland and unite the mainly protestant province 
with the overwhelmingly roman catholic irish republic 
home secretary david waddington earlier wednesday urged the 
public to be alert for bombing campaigns following mondays 
discovery of a car bomb outside ramsbothams house in londons 
fashionable kensington district 
scotland yard said the bomb containing a plastic explosive was 
placed under the wrong car and fell off because it probably was not 
attached properly it was seen on the ground by a painter working 
nearby who called police 
the car bomb bore the hallmarks of the ira police said 
i do not think the ira are respecters of our religions 
waddington said in a bbc radio interview i think there is just 
as much likelihood of there being a dastardly campaign at christmas 
as any other time of the year 
also wednesday the belfast to dublin railway line reopened 
after troops searched the track near lurgan county armagh 
following a bomb warning the security forces said nothing was 
found 
train service between the two cities has been disrupted more 
than 60 times this year because of bombs and bomb hoaxes blamed on 
the ira

police began registering residents semiautomatic 
assault weapons under a new city ordinance today with opponents 
threatening a court fight 
lawyer duncan cameron was the only person to register a weapon 
in the first hour 
i dont like registering my possessions but the law requires 
it said the former chief denver district attorney i feel more 
secure at night owning one of these 
police have received hundreds of calls from gun owners seeking 
information on the law owners have 60 days to register their guns 
the ordinance was introduced in the wake of growing gang 
activity in the city and mass killings around the nation by gunmen 
using such weapons denvers sensitivity to the issue was 
heightened earlier this year when a man with a submachine gun 
killed two people and wounded three in suburban littleton 
police checked the serial number on camerons ak47 lookalike 
rifle and ran a background check on him he then paid his 30 
license fee and left 
lt gary walter commander of the departments firearms bureau 
said he could not estimate how many guns would be registered 
maybe im optimistic but i think the majority of the people are 
going to comply he said if the majority of the people comply 
i think it will have an effect 
but cameron 48 said he suspected many gun owners wont 
register their weapons for fear the city council will declare them 
illegal in the future the ordinance specifically bans the sale of 
more than 30 models of semiautomatic assault weapons federal law 
controls ownership of fully automatic weapons 
failure to register a weapon already owned or possession of a 
registered weapon with a magazine having more than 20 rounds can 
bring fines of 100 to 999 and jail terms of 10 days to six 
months the weapon would be destroyed upon conviction 
a similar bill was defeated in the last session of the 
legislature 
gun owners turned out in force to lobby against the ordinance 
297 people signed up to speak against it at a hearing only 30 
asked to speak in support the city council passed the ordinance 
nov 6 on a 94 vote 
the firearms coalition of colorado announced it will file a 
lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance 
george nyfeler national riflemen associations field 
representative for colorado utah and wyoming said his major 
complaint with the ordinance is that it leaves too much 
subjective interpretation of what constitutes an assault 
weapon he said it also gives police unrestrained authority 
it scares the hell out of me and should scare the hell out of 
every citizen in denver nyfeler said tuesday 
not so said ordinance author and councilwoman cathy reynolds 
i am hopeful a majority of people in denver who currently own 
these weapons will understand the wisdom of getting these guns 
registered reynolds said 
it is a very strong conviction of mine that these weapons have 
no place in our community they are built as antipersonnel assault 
weapons we dont need them in an urban environment she said 
im convinced it is a technically good bill and can be enforced 
properly 
the ordinance specifies 23 models of rifles seven of pistols 
and three of shotguns and their variations it excludes most 
semiautomatic sporting firearms 
after the littleton shootings in march reynolds introduced a 
resolution declaring the councils intention to pass a law 
restricting or prohibiting the sale of semiautomatic weapons

the beijing government has ordered offices to 
intercept and hand over to authorities the reactionary 
propaganda being sent by fax machines from chinese dissidents 
abroad an official report said 
the report indicates that fax machines are being widely used to 
send into china accounts of the military crushing of the 
prodemocracy movement and of the subsequent crackdown on dissent 
that contradict government accounts 
millions of chinese supported the movement for freedom before 
troops shot their way into beijing on june 34 to break up the 
demonstrations killing hundreds if not thousands of unarmed 
civilians 
the government has called the prodemocracy demonstrations a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion and says the army heroically 
restored order to the chinese capital 
dissidents who fled to france have repeatedly used faxes and 
other communication tools to spread a large quantity of reactionary 
propaganda in our city according to the news service 
it did not further describe the material being sent into beijing 
the government order demanded that city offices companies and 
universities prevent the information coming over faxes from 
spreading throughout the population the official china news 
service said 
under the new order every work unit with a fax must appoint a 
person to carefully monitor the machine reactionary propaganda 
must be intercepted sealed and handed over to public security 
officials 
the order also stresses the need to explain to expatriate 
businessmen and other foreigners in beijing that disseminating 
propaganda against the communist party and government is illegal 
and unfriendly 
fax machines in beijing can be found in hotels joint ventures 
and companies that do business overesas they also have begun to 
appear in some government offices and academic centers but there 
are no official figures on the number of machines in the city 
during the spring demonstrations and subsequent crackdown 
overseas chinese used faxes to provide chinese outside beijing with 
accounts of events in the capital that were not reported in the 
official press or distorted by government propaganda 
the foreign ministry on oct 31 accused the french magazine 
actuel of an undisguised act of subversion against china for 
sending by fax imitation copies of the peoples daily written by 
yan jiaqi and other dissidents living in paris 
the ministry accused the french government of conniving at and 
supporting this hostile act against china in total disregard of the 
representations made by the chinese side

new york theatergoers have seen so many 
established actors jump into shakespeare and fall flat that failure 
has become the expectation 
therefore it is with unusual appreciation that one finds frank 
langella in the tempest playing prospero with poetry 
richvoiced grandeur and the wisdom accumulated and tempered by a 
sensitive elder statesman 
the tempest opened tuesday night at the offbroadway 
roundabout theater 
langella doesnt carry the play by himself bd wong in his 
next assignment after broadways m butterfly is the spirit 
ariel wong wearing only black bermuda shorts on his thin frame 
looks the epitomy of an otherworld sprite 
wongs ariel adores prospero and trusts that prospero will keep 
his promise to set him free 
langellas prospero who in the last scene forgives his 
enemies is neither an overbearing father nor a bookish recluse at 
the beginning he talks about his books but acts like a man who has 
already digested their contents and now is a person of informed 
action 
he loves his daughter miranda and hates to give her up he 
makes it clear though that he is putting obstacles in her 
relationship with her swain so their path to happiness wont be so 
easy that they fail to appreciate it 
angela sherrill has such an unclouded brow and innocent aspect 
that she looks younger not older than mirandas 15 miranda and 
ferdinand son of the king of naples fall in love at first sight 
john wittenbauer as ferdinand seems weak at first then his voice 
as sweet as a young tenors grows on one prospero has caused the 
tempest that shipwrecked on his island the king of naples a hearty

against prospero but whose personality is so loathsome that he

ringo starr won a permanent court order wednesday 
blocking the release of a 1987 album he says was made in an alcohol 
haze then testified that he never agreed to pay the producers 
studio costs 
the former beatle who sued producer chips moman and college 
park gabased crs records to prevent the release of the album 
was the first witness as the trial on the rest of the issues began 
wednesday in fulton county superior court 
starr said he went to memphis in february 1987 to work with 
moman and his part of the agreement was to do the recording 
sessions and pay for his plane fare and living expenses moman was 
to provide the studio and produce the recordings 
there was no formal contract starr said moman contends that 
starr owes him 146239 for studio costs and outofpocket expenses 
i felt some contractual agreement would be reached but it 
always hinged on if the album was a success starr testified i 
had no understanding that any studio time would be billed to me 
starr who has said in court documents that he was under the 
influence of alcohol during the recording sessions said after 
returning home to england and listening to the tapes he decided 
they needed more work 
starr sings on the recordings but did not play drums before he 
would approve the album he wanted to overdub his own drumming 
judge clarence cooper did not elaborate on his ruling wednesday 
to make permanent the temporary injunction against release of the 
album but court personnel said pretrial evidence indicated that 
starr all along had the right to block the record under certain 
conditions 
momans attorneys have said starr came to the producer in an 
attempt to revive his waning music career though acknowledging he 
had not had a hit record in several years starr testified he was 
not desperate when he first talked with moman 
it was just a move for your career he said i wasnt 
looking for chips and chips probably wasnt looking for me 
starr embarked on a successful us concert tour during the 
summer but according to testimony wednesday he refused a request 
by moman to include songs from the memphis sessions in his live 
shows 
starrs appearance drew several courthouse employees for a look 
at starr and his wife actress barbara bach after getting some 
laughs by asking is it on as he approached the witness stand 
microphone starr was serious during most of his testimony 
he appeared annoyed with some questions as his testimomy 
extended more than an hour asking the judge at one point can i 
speak plainly this yes and no is impossible for me

the state department said wednesday that the 
soviet union has shipped advanced mig29 aircraft to cuba a move 
it called wholly inconsistent with moscows stated desire to 
promote peace in central america 
we see no legitimate cuban need for such advanced aircraft 
and we do not consider this a helpful step said richard boucher 
the departments spokesman who confirmed a report in the 
washington times 
citing a need to protect intelligence data boucher refused to 
provide details on when the aircraft arrived in cuba how many 
planes had been shipped and whether moscow also provided trainers 
but the times said one hightech combat aircraft believed to 
be the first of a squadron was discovered in cuba late last 
month the mig29 was first photographed in crates by a us 
intelligence satellite after delivery to a cuban port the paper 
said it was identified as a mig29 after assembly 
we find the action wholly inconsistent with the soviet unions 
professed desire to cooperate in promoting the peaceful settlement 
of disputes in the region boucher said adding that cuba is 
under no threat from the united states 
we are making our concerns known to the soviets he said 
boucher said secretary of state james a baker iii knew about 
the mig29 aircraft earlier in the week when he criticized the 
soviets for continuing to support violence destruction and war 
in central america by shipping weapons and money through cuba and 
nicaragua 
soviet behavior toward cuba and central america remains the 
biggest obstacle to improving relations between the superpowers 
he said in a speech 
on tuesday president bush charged that cuba and nicaragua 
moscows clients in the region have aided and abetted the 
leftist rebels in el salvador who have mounted bloody attacks in 
that country this week baker said the rebels are using soviet 
rocketpropelled grenades 
bush said he would call on soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
to shut down the pipeline of weapons into the region when the two 
leaders meet dec 23 on ships in the mediterrean 
i hope maybe we can have some action from him that will help 
the democracies in this hemisphere bush said this will be 
very much on my mind

chinese authorities admitted wednesday that 
soldiers fired their guns near japanese golfers last weekend but 
said it was an accident unrelated to a death threat received by 
toyota officials 
officials of the public security ministry told japanese 
diplomats their investigation showed a few soldiers were 
testing their guns at a shooting range south of the beijing 
golf club on sunday japanese sources in beijing said 
the security officials said some bullets strayed onto the course 
near the ninth and 18th holes according to the sources who would 
not be further identified 
several japanese golfers reported hearing two bursts of machine 
gun fire and bullets whizzing by shortly before noon sunday they 
included three employees of toyota motor corp whose beijing 
office on nov 9 received a letter containing a bullet and note 
threatening to kill japanese in china 
the security officials were quoted as telling the japanese 
diplomats that while the chinese side took the shooting incident 
seriously it was unrelated to the death threat 
chinese authorities instructed related units to take measures 
to eliminate the uneasiness but did not apologize for the 
incident the sources said 
toyota which had considered withdrawing its staff from china 
following the letter and shooting incident decided to keep them in 
place toyota spokesman andy pfeiffenberger said in tokyo 
we decided the situation didnt call for them to be taken back 
to tokyo pfeiffenberger said we told them to be careful to 
be alert to things there but things are back to normal and work is 
going on as usual 
toyota has seven employees in beijing and six in canton 
guangzhou pfeiffenberger said 
he would not say if the note was signed or disclose its 
contents but the sources in beijing said it read now that the 
martial law troops have gone our time has come go back to japan 
from now we will kill japanese 
soldiers called in under martial law were stationed at major 
intersections and overpasses in beijing after the june 34 military 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement of this spring

remain at tiananmen square the focal point of the protests 
in july and august a group calling itself the bloodbright 
dare to die squad sent letters to several japanese firms 
threatening to kill japanese in retaliation for japans economic 
invasion of china 
japans trade surplus with china was 31 billion last year

customs service radar planes which have 
experienced problems with their sophisticated computer systems had 
mechanical failures this week that almost ruined a demonstration 
for the agencys new commissioner and the federal drug policy 
director 
normally the two lockheed p3 airborne early warning aircraft 
use their hightech radar to locate drugferrying airplanes but 
last monday the mission was different 
one of the planes was assigned to fly the new customs service 
commissioner carol hallett and william bennett director of the 
office of national drug control strategy from savannah ga to 
tampa fla for a conference 
on the way customs service officials were to demonstrate the 
computerized radar system designed especially for detection of 
drugsmuggling aircraft 
according to an account by customs service spokesman david 
hoover the difficulties began sunday night when one of the two 
aircraft left its base in corpus christi texas on a regular 
surveillance mission that plane experienced a failure in the radar 
system and returned home 
monday morning customs launched its other p3 to pick up the 
officials but a fluid pump in the cooling system failed in flight 
the system pumps vital coolant to the radar components which 
cannot be allowed to overheat 
the plane bound for savannah made an unscheduled landing in new 
orleans in an effort to fix the problem but to get the part 
customs officials had to fly the plane that was grounded sunday 
night to new orleans so the defective part could be switched 
the cooling system in the savannahbound plane was fixed but 
when the radar was turned on a spark knocked out the components 
that let the radar run on high power 
so when bennett and mrs hallett got their tour the radar was 
on low power meaning that its range was reduced from about 250 
miles to 80 miles 
it was picking up a multitude of targets hoover said 
there was no perceptible difference in the way the radar works 
between high and low power 
bennett spokesman don hamilton said bennett knew there was 
some concern about the radar but he had a great trip he enjoyed 
it he learned a lot of useful information

plymouth rock is on its way to becoming 
whole again and the mason who is doing the repair work for 1 says 
hell have the pilgrims historic landing spot back in shape for 
thanksgiving 
i dont look at it as a job i look at it as a privilege to 
preserve something that means a lot to people all over the united 
states said mason paul choquette 42 of south dartmouth 
choquette was hired to fix the rocks crack by the state 
department of environmental management after it put out bids for 
the work since monetary payment is required he bid 1 the work 
should take one day he said tuesday 
the rock which weighs about six tons and measures about 14 feet 
wide and 6 feet long is said to be the spot where the pilgrims 
first set foot on ground when they arrived from england in 1620 
the crack which first appeared in the 1770s was repaired in 
the late 19th century for 100 years that patchup job has stood 
up to the tides that occasionally submerge the rock which stands 
in a halfenclosed protective structure in the waters off this 
seaside town 
the original mortar used by that mason is deteriorating 
however town and state officials said they fear that when water 
seeps into the rock it will freeze and cause the crack to worsen 
it could happen soon it could happen in 10 years said 
peter oneil a dem spokesman 
we want to be cautious he said it would look terribly 
embarrassing if it split in half 
choquette said he would also fix a series of hairline cracks 
that have developed within the main fracture and in some other 
areas of the rock the smaller cracks were caused by the vibrations 
of the tourist buses that rumble over the road about five feet from 
the landmark he said 
choquette said he feels lucky to get the job 
it just makes me feel good he said its just knowing 
what it stands for its a symbol of freedom and how america 
supposedly started off 
the mason has been instructed not to use hightech glues or 
epoxy because scientists want to be able to undo his work without 
damaging the rock if more substantial repairs become necessary 
choquette said he will use a special mortar mixed to match the 
color and consistency of the 19th century repairs but he declined 
to reveal his recipe beyond small pebbles 
the rock will never be the same boulder the pilgrim landing 
party saw however the crack originated when the sons of liberty 
attempted to move the rock to the town square and dropped it 
breaking the rock in two 
they initially used the smaller piece for their town display 
but when tourists kept chipping away at the rock they decided to 
glue it back to its partner in 1880 and put it back in the water

a democratic congressman concerned about 
continued federal support for the arts said wednesday that 
conservatives are stirring up controversy over a few questionable 
art projects to kill the national endowment for the arts 
the right is using mapplethorpe as their new willie horton 
said rep pat williams dmont during a hearing of his education 
and labor subcommittee on postsecondary education 
willie horton a convicted rapist who committed more crimes 
after failing to return from a prison furlough in massachusetts 
was used as an issue in last years presidntial campaign against 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
congress banned federal financing of obscene art and reduced 
its 171 million appropriation for the nea by 45000 this year 
after learning that federal funds had helped support two artists 
andres serrano and robert mapplethorpe whose work was considered 
obscene 
that effort was led by sen jesse helms rnc 
williams whose subcommittee is considering legislation to keep 
the endowment operating said those who want to see nea unfunded 
are utilizing the unwillingness of congress to explain serrano to 
get their way 
he said members of congress would find it easier to take action 
against the nea than engage in complicated discussions with their 
constituents about the value of aid that sometimes supports 
questionable taste 
the endowment has given out 85000 grants and run into 
controversy on 20 of them said leonard garment an attorney who 
helped establish the nea 
he said that nea officials and panels have behaved overall 
with an admirable sense of responsibility 
bruce fein an attorney who opposes federal support of art 
argued there is no first amendment right to be subsidized by the 
government 
creative art does not need government subsidies to flourish 
he said 
but williams garment and attorney floyd abrams said government 
aid attract private donors and government refusal to fund art would 
lead them away 
there is a real problem that if corporate america begins to 
think of the arts as tainted the easy way out is to find something 
else

montanas hunters and ranchers will be free to 
kill bison that stray from northern yellowstone national park this 
winter and as many as 200 of the animals might be killed the 
states wildlife director said today 
last year more than 500 yellowstone bison were killed in montana 
after they roamed from the park that was an unprecedented number 
and prompted outcries from some environmentalists and 
conservationists

and officials of the national park service have agreed that the 
northern bison herd at yelowstone should be limited to about 200 to 
300 animals so they can be better managed

a previously unknown group calling itself 
the organization of just revenge claimed wednesday it has kidnapped 
an american and two naturalized west germans in beirut 
the claim came in a typewritten statement delivered to a western 
news agency along with photocopies of the passports and visas of 
the three victims 
the americans name was given in the documents as deborah 
fahrend 54 of san francisco the brief arabic statement said she 
is a publisherjournalist 
the documents identified two germans as mounir shamseddin sami 
39 born in lebanon and his 7yearold son danjel born in berlin 
the statement said the organization of just revenge announces 
its responsibility for kidnapping the west german mounir sami born 
in lebanon and his son danjel sami and american 
publisherjournalist deborah fahrend in beirut for their activities 
in lebanon 
there was no further elaboration in the poorly typed statement 
which failed to say when the abduction took place and made no 
demands 
one photocopy showed a visa issued for ms fahrend by the 
lebanese embassy in nicosia cyprus on nov 1 along with an entry 
stamp by the lebanese security department nov 3 
the two west germans also entered lebanon on nov 3 on similar 
visas issued by the lebanese embassy in nicosia on the same day 
ms fahrend got hers 
the kidnapping claim could not immediately be verified 
the american embassy in beirut has been closed since sept 22 
the west german embassy in beirut said it had no knowledge of 
the abduction before the statement was released after nightfall 
but the two victims could be naturalized germans from lebanese 
descent who are not registered with the embassy in beirut said a 
german official who answered the phone at the embassy he declined 
to give his name 
not counting the three people mentioned in the claim there are 
18 foreign hostages being held in lebanon including eight 
americans four britons two west germans two swiss an italian 
and an irishman 
the longest held is terry a anderson 41 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
most of the hostages are believed held by proiranian extremist 
factions

montanas hunters and ranchers will be free to 
kill bison that stray from northern yellowstone national park this 
winter and as many as 200 of the animals might be killed the 
states wildlife director said today

after they roamed from the park that was an unprecedented number 
and prompted outcries from some environmentalists and 
conservationists 
kl cool montanas director of fish and game said the state 
and officials of the national park service have agreed that the 
northern bison herd at yelowstone should be limited to about 200 to 
300 animals so they can be better managed

president mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday 
rejected claims that reform in eastern europe spell the demise of 
socialism and insisted the communist revolution was not a 
mistake 
speaking to a national student conference in moscow gorbachev 
also said the existence of two germanys has been recognized by 
the world community since the end of world war ii and even talk 
about reunification constitutes interference in the affairs of the 
two countries 
the soviet union in the past week has flatly opposed any 
suggestion that east and west germany should be rejoined 
noting that certain forces in the west try to create the 
impression that profound changes in socialist countries signify the 
failure of socialist ideas gorbachev said that this was wishful 
thinking according to the official news agency tass it did not 
specify which forces gorbachev had in mind 
in a televised speech that ran almost two hours gorbachev 
hammered home to students who he seemed to suspect believed 
otherwise that the october revolution was not a mistake 
using a persuasive emotional tone gorbachev extolled the 
ideology behind the 1917 bolshevik revolution and condemned 
people who are trying to find the roots of our troubles not in 
the distortions of socialism that took place but in its very 
nature and principles 
we cannot allow dissatisfaction with ourselves with how we 
live now to be transformed into attempts to question our 
indisputable universally recognized achievements and the choice of 
socialism itself he said 
that gorbachev felt the need to come to the defense of the most 
basic ideological postulates of soviet society indicated that they 
are coming under ever wider attack as the country struggles through 
economic crisis and sees east bloc neighbors moving toward 
multiparty systems 
in his remarks about east germany which were carried by tass 
but not shown on television gorbachev expressed for the second day 
in a row concern over western powers response to the democratic 
upheaval in eastern europe 
at a meeting tuesday with french foreign minister roland dumas 
he denounced calls for exporting capitalism to eastern europe 
and said it was useless to clamor about victory in the cold war 
about the disintegration of some or another social system tass 
reported 
the white house said wednesday it had no apologies for 
extolling capitalism as a remedy for the economic woes of eastern 
europe and said the us position should not be offensive to 
gorbachev 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said president bush views the 
freemarket economy of the united states as the pride of the 
world and as a good way to reform the economic problems that they 
are facing 
we certainly are proud of the capitalist system and the 
rewards that it has offered he added we hold it up as an 
example to all but we have not tried to dictate it to any of these 
countries 
nevertheless fitzwater said all the actions taken by the 
united states have been appropriate and not been offensive and 
have had the desired effect of offering our support without 
inciting revolution or other actions that would take the process 
backward we have no apologies or concern with anything that 
weve done at this point 
as for the reunification of east and west germany gorbachev 
said it is not a matter of topical politics talking about 
reunification would mean interference in the affairs of the two 
countries according to tass 
poland and hungary moved away from singleparty communist rule 
earlier this year east germany reshuffled its leadership this 
month and in the most striking reform opened up the berlin wall 
and allowed its citizens free exit czechoslovakia also liberalized 
its travel restrictions 
other top soviet officials joined their president in condemning 
western attempts to interpret the instability in the east bloc as 
signifying the failure of socialism 
in tokyo gorbachev adviser alexander yakovlev said he was 
surprised by western commentators who interpret the tumult in the 
region as demonstrating the failure of socialism and soviet policy 
this is an obsolete archaic way of thinking the politburo 
member told a news conference wednesday we would like to have a 
common european house based on freedom if someone interferes in 
that process we might go back to the time of the cold war 
gorbachevs speech to the students touched on the widespread 
alienation from the communist party among soviet youth and their 
slack support for the kremlins reforms 
his statements appeared at least in part to be a response to a 
recent poll published in the statecontrolled press that found 17 
percent of soviet students thought the october revolution was a 
mistake 
he reprimanded students for sleeping through the elections 
to the congress of peoples deputies this spring and warned them 
that allowing their youthful energy to lead them into pushing for 
more radical reform could lead to disaster 
despite his support for east germanys changes rumors that 
gorbachev would travel to berlin to participate in demolition of 
the berlin wall are false a foreign ministry spokesman said

about one in every two americans believes that 
garbage disposal problems rank among the three most pressing issues 
facing local governments exceeded only by fighting drugs and 
providing adequate education according to a survey released 
wednesday by the garbage industry 
the poll released by the national solid waste managagement 
association said 52 percent of the people surveyed nationally 
consider ensuring adequate garbage collection is a serious or 
extremely serious problem for their local officials 
that reflected a higher level of concern about garbage 
collection than for providing affordable housing or expanding 
police and fire protection said allen moore president of the 
trade group that represents waste disposal industry 
the survey was conducted by cambridge reports and included 
telephone or facetoface interviews of 3000 people during a 
fourmonth period this year there was a 3 percent margin of error 
the survey also indicated that public opposition to incinerators 
that turn garbage into energy is easing in most parts of the 
country amid increasing worries about finding places to bury solid 
wastes 
it said that 44 percent of those surveyed nationwide said they 
would favor locating such incinerator plants in their area 8 
percentage points higher than those reponding similarly in a poll a 
year earlier thirtysix percent of the people opposed such plants 
and 20 percent said they didnt know 
opposition to burning garbage continued to be greatest in the 
northeast where a new wastetoenergy plant was favored by only 36 
percent of those surveyed compared to 42 percent who opposed even 
in that region however those who favored a plant incrased by 5 
percentage points compared to the 1988 survey 
the northeast however had the largest percentage of people 67 
percent of those surveyed who considered garbage collection as a 
serious or extremely serious issue facing local governments 
ranking only behind the battle to curb drug abuse 
garbage collection issues were found to be of the least concern 
in the central part of the country where it ranked last among five 
areas of concern with only 37 percent of the people saying they 
considered it a serious local problem 
in other findings the poll indicated an increased interest in 
recycling programs but it said the public no longer considers 
recycling a simple magic bullet solution to the disposal of 
waste products said moore the trade groups president 
twothirds of those surveyed said they had participated in 
recycling cans bottles or papers and 44 percent said they would 
buy products containing recycled materials if given a choice 
according to the survey 
in a related report the trade group said that as of the end of 
september 38 states and the district of columbia have enacted some 
form of waste recycling laws although in many cases the full 
requirements do not go into effect until the early to mid1990s

veterans secretary edward j derwinski pledged 
wednesday that rural va hospitals in montana south dakota and 
other sparsely populated areas will remain open despite budgetary 
constraints 
i have no intention of closing and no intention of making 
changes that in any way would diminish hospital care in rural 
areas derwinski told the veterans affairs committee these 
kinds of locations must stay 
derwinski testified at a hearing into the delivery of health 
care to rural veterans other witnesses and western state senators 
complained that rural veterans suffer from a lack of medical 
personnel a lack of access to health care facilities and a lack of 
resources at the rural hospitals since most are unaffiliated with 
medical schools 
sen max baucus dmont complained that policy makers in 
washington are fundamentally oblivious to the needs of rural 
america they really dont understand the sense of space and 
distance he said 
although 95 percent of all veterans live within a 100mile 
radius of the nearest va facility according to the american 
legion in montana 83 percent of the veterans served by the miles 
city hospital live more than 100 miles from it 
baucus noted that los angeles has nine centers compared with two 
in montana and derwinski noted that in his native chicago three 
hospitals were within six miles from one another 
sen thomas a daschle dsd complained that veterans with 
nonserviceconnected disabilities and incomes above 16500 if 
single or 20000 if married are being denied va care because of 
service cutbacks over the last five years 
those class b and class c veterans are generally 
provided care when resources are available the poorer and 
serviceconnected disabled class a receive firstpriority 
care 
dr daniel winship of the vas medical division said there was 
no policy decision to cut out the b and c patients he said the 
demand for care by category a patients has virtually consumed 
the vas resources

the battlescarred sandstone columns of the 
brandenburg gate which were the backdrop for hitlers last stand 
and a workers uprising against communism in 1953 once again tower 
over the stage of history 
the 200yearold gate berlins most famous landmark has stood 
as the symbol of german division for 28 years 
with the berlin wall quickly crumbling the gate is being called 
the symbol of german unity it also has been the backdrop for much 
of the television coverage beamed around the world in the past week 
of fastmoving developments 
east germany has said it is considering opening a berlin wall 
border crossing at the brandenburg gate there was wide speculation 
in west berlin that an opening would be knocked through the wall 
thursday although there was no official confirmation 
the gate the size of a fivestory building remained on the 
eastern side when the berlin wall was built in 1961 the famous 
unten den linden boulevard ends at the gate 
on the western side the sprawling avenue that leads to the gate 
was renamed june 17 street after the date of the workers uprising 
in east berlin in 1953 that was bloodily crushed by soviet tanks 
east berlin workers angered by the nationalization and 
collectivization policies of the communist government began their 
street demonstrations at the brandenburg gate and tore down the red 
flag from the top of the gate 
in the closing days of world war ii soviet tanks rumbled by the 
gate as they closed in on adolf hitlers bunker in the chancellery 
only a few hundred yards away was the heart of hitlers government 
in a small complex on wilhelmstrasse which also served as the seat 
of the imperial government the reichstag also is not far away 
the brandenburg gate also marked hitlers rise to power nazi 
brown shirts staged a triumphant torch parade through the gate when 
hitler was named chancellor on jan 30 1933 
built from 1788 to 1791 by carl gotthard langhans the 
sixcolumn gate was commissioned by prussian king frederick wilhelm 
ii when it was built it opened the road to the region of 
brandenburg getting its name 
the gate was modeled after the acropolis in athens to reflect 
the kings intention to make berlin a city of learning and arts 
on top of the gate is a bronze chariot with the goddess 
victoria it was hauled away to paris when napoleon defeated the 
prussians at jena and auerstadt on oct 27 1806 he marched into 
berlin through the brandenburg gate 
the chariot was brought back to berlin after napoleons defeat 
in 1814 after the francogerman war in 187071 the victorious 
prussians made a triumphal return to berlin the new imperial 
capital again through the brandenburg gate 
the gate was heavily damaged in the last days of world war ii 
and marked the border between the soviet and british sectors of 
conquered berlin 
it was restored between 1956 and 1958 the chariot was repaired 
and paid for by west berlin under mayor willy brandt but east 
berlin authorities removed the prussian eagle and the iron cross 
from victorias staff before mounting it again 
in 1963 communist soldiers dropped huge red drapes over the 
gate to prevent president john f kennedy from looking into east 
berlin when he visited west berlin and delivered his ich bin ein 
berliner speech 
the gate the last of the 20 gates to berlin still standing is 
66 feet high 215 feet wide and 36 feet deep

a newly approved drug appears to be the first to 
slow parkinsons disease seeming to cut the destructive 
progression of the incurable brain illness in half a major study 
confirms 
the research conducted on 800 people found that the drug 
deprenyl helped people who were not yet sick enough to require 
levodopa the standard medicine for parkinsons 
the results are similar to a smaller study conducted on 54 
patients that was published in august 
it does not stop the disease said dr ira shoulson but 
it may well slow the disease this may be the first treatment for a 
neurodegenerative disorder that actually slows the disease 
until now levodopa has been the mainstay of parkinsons 
treatment easing symptoms but not slowing the underlying disease 
doctors usually reserve this drug until relatively severe symptoms 
develop 
the incurable disease attacks a region of the brain causing 
shuffling gait difficulty talking and other symptoms it typically 
strikes people in their 50s and 60s and affects about 500000 
americans 
the latest study began in 1987 and was scheduled to continue 
until late next year however researchers stopped the study in 
february because of indications of a dramatic effect from the 
medicine 
when the results were analyzed doctors found the treatment had 
reduced the need for levodopa by 57 percent 
over 12 years this might buy 50 percent more time of less 
impaired disability said shoulson who directed the study at the 
university of rochester medical center 
in their report the researchers wrote that the results 
translate into a delay in the development of disability of nearly 
one year over the twoyear study period and an extended capacity 
for fulltime employment 
the study was conducted by members of the parkinson study group 
at 28 medical centers in the united states and canada it was 
published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
in the study 399 people with early untreated parkinsons 
disease were given deprenyl while 401 others received another 
experimental medicine or dummy pills during the followup 97 of 
those who got deprenyl worsened enough to need levodopa compared 
with 176 in the comparison group 
at the start of the study peoples symptoms included mild 
tremors stiffness and slow movement by the time they needed 
levodopa they often had to stop working or had trouble caring for 
themselves 
the doctors are not sure how deprenyl works but they speculated 
that it somehow slows the underlying disease process rather than 
simply easing symptoms 
the drug sold under the brand name eldepryl was approved by 
the us food and drug administration for routine use in september 
the latest study will continue to test the effect of the 
medicine when combined with levodopa in people with advanced 
parkinsons disease 
the earlier study with the drug was conducted by dr j william 
langston of the california parkinsons foundation in san jose and 
published in the journal science 
in another report wednesday on parkinsons disease university 
of california researchers said they have found that implanting 
genetically altered skin cells in the brains of rats can reduce 
symptoms of parkinsons disease the skin cells were genetically 
altered to make them produce ldopa a chemical that is lacking in 
the brains of parkinsons disease patients 
the research does not portend a cure for parkinsons and is not 
ready for human testing but it may offer a possible alternative to 
fetal cell implants which have proved effective against the 
disease but which have become mired in political and ethical 
controversy scientists said 
the results of the study conducted by gage and colleagues at 
the university of california at san diego including dr theodore 
friedmann a pioneer in the development of genetically modified 
cells were to be published in the latest issue of proceedings of 
the national academy of sciences

more than 1000 guerrillas have 
attacked the eastern city of jalalabad and are peppering the city 
with rockets and heavy artillery the government said wednesday 
but the sovietbacked government denied guerrilla claims of 
capturing a strategic army stronghold in the mountains west of 
kabul whose only road to the soviet union remained closed for a 
seventh day the cutoff drove up prices of flour and gasoline 
government spokesman mohammed nabi amani said bands of the 
ussupported moslem guerrillas from a number of groups united to 
launch the attack on jalalabad the site of a failed rebel attack 
in march the governments bakhtar news agency reported that 
guerrillas were also shelling the road from jalalabad to kabul in 
an attempt to close it 
amani said the guerrillas were trying to take a military 
garrison at dolunta about 12 miles west of the city but he said 
government troops pushed them back 
on monday the government claimed 10000 guerrillas were 
preparing to attack the city they failed to take jalalabad earlier 
this year because they could not unite and lacked experience in 
launching conventional operations also government bombers proved 
successful at knocking out guerrilla positions diplomats have said 
amani said the afghan air force bombed rebel artillery in 
samarkhail and other villages near jalalabad he said guerrillas 
forces were preparing an attack on khost a strategic city south of 
jalalabad in paktiya province 
both cities are close to the pakistan border where the 
guerrillas have bases 
the government denied a claim that guerrilla forces had captured 
a government garrison in pajak 18 miles west of kabul in the 
mountains guerrillarun radio in pakistan claimed its forces took 
the stronghold late last week western diplomats in pakistan said 
the guerrillas were steadily chipping away at kabuls security 
perimeter and the latest battle linked forces west and north of the 
capital 
amani said the stronghold had not fallen and that military 
activity in the area was quiet soldiers with knowledge of the 
situation in pajak said fighting was fierce but that guerrilla 
forces had not succeeded in taking the garrison earlier this week 
the government fired several sovietmade scud rockets to the west 
along with dozens of smaller rockets 
soldiers with knowledge of the salang highway the main road to 
the soviet border said guerrilla forces near the salang tunnel 
about 60 miles from kabul had closed the highway for the last 
week they said more than 3000 trucks were waiting to come south 
to kabul carrying food gasoline and weapons 
witnesses from salang said guerrillas in the area claimed the 
government was trying to move 800 tanks down the highway in 
addition to food and fuel soldiers confirmed that tanks were being 
transported to military bases near the capital but said they did 
not know how many 
in kabul prices of flour went back up to 4 for a 15pound 
sack after falling to 350 last week when the road was open 
the government acknowledged the highway had been closed but said 
it was caused by damage due to mines rebel forces closed the 
highway for 10 days last month causing prices of flour and 
gasoline to jump 50 percent 
the soviet union completed pulling out its troops in february 
more than nine years after sending in forces to support a marxist

governing body to include the leader of its newest union the 
united mine workers 
umw president richard trumka was among five new members elected 
to the 141 millionmember federations executive council a 
symbolic gesture to cap the unions decision to rejoin the umbrella 
organization after four decades outside 
trumka 40 also adds young blood to a council made up 
predominantly of white men in their 50s 60s and 70s a woman and a 
black union leader also were elected wednesday but because of 
retirements the number of blacks on the 33member board fell from 
three to two and the number of women held at three that comes at a 
time when some contend that women and minorities are the labor 
movements best hope if it is to reverse its organizing setbacks of 
the past decade 
the federation elections came on a day when the convention 
delegates also heard from president bush and prepared for a debate 
thursday on whether the aflcio should endorse abortionrights 
resolutions 
a compromise struck this week will allow for debate on the issue 
thursday before the question which has divided many labor leaders 
at a gathering whose theme is solidarity is referred to he 
executive council for further study 
the elections of kirkland secretary treasurer thomas donahue 
and the new council members all were by unanimous vote but not 
before hispanic labor leaders protested about being excluded from 
the board at a time of mounting efforts to organize hispanics 
once again the hispanics have been excluded from the process 
and excluded from the aflcio said jack otero a vice president 
of the transportation and communications union this is an 
unhappy day 
added united steelworkers international representative oscar 
sanchez i leave this conventiom a disillusioned delegate but not 
a defeated trade unionist we will return 
kirkland in thanking the delegates for their support said 
i say to you without hesitation or reservation that this is 
the most exciting the most inspiring and the most enthusiastic 
time in modern history to be at the center of everything in the 
american trade union movement there is no place on earth i would 
rather be and there is nothing that i would rather do

president bush told the aflcio today that 
labor business and government should form a new alliance to be 
partners and activists for polands future 
he also told the labor federations biennial convention that he 
would discuiss the importance of trade unions in building a free 
country in his dec 23 shipboard summit off malta with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
steering clear of issues on which his administration and 
organized labor disagree bush lavished praise on solidarity leader 
lech walesa and praised the federation for its long active support 
of walesa 
walesa was present as the president spoke 
senate majority leader george mitchell speaking a few hours 
before bush at the labor federations convention accused the 
president of praising solidarity while working to undermine us 
labor unions 
american workers are entitled to as much support from an 
american president as workers in poland and other countries the 
maine democrat said 
he also criticized bush for refusing to intervene in the 
eightmonth eastern airlines strike 
but the president focused on solidarity and the changing face of 
eastern europe across eastern europe we see vindication of the 
aflcios refusal to deal with puppet unions controlled by either 
employers or governments he said 
the aflcio has fought for freedom around the world and i 
will carry that message to mr gorbachev i also want to talk with 
president gorbachev about the opportunities to move beyond 
containment in ussoviet relations to find areas of mutual 
advantage in our relationship 
congress is moving to provide more than a halfbillion dollars 
in economic aid for poland and hungary steps that have the backing 
of the administration 
but bush said i call on the american labor movement the 
business community and government to look for ways to support a 
partnership for progress in poland 
labor business and government can and should be partners and 
activisits for polands future he said 
earlier presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush is 
ready to sign a bill raising the minimum wage from 335 to 425 
by april 1991 a measure labor helped negotiate 
bushs speech came a week after the white house labor and 
congressional democrats struck a deal to raise the hourly minimum 
wage that has tempered somewhat the criticism of bush by labor 
leaders but praise for the president is hard to find among the 800 
delegates to the 141 millionmember federations biennial 
convention 
aflcio president lane kirkland was unanimously reelected today 
to a sixthtwo year term thomas donahue was the unanimous choice 
to continue as the federations secretary treasurer 
i am honored that you have moved to keep me on the bridge as 
we move into the last decade of the tumultuous 20th century 
kirkland said there is no place on earth that i would rather 
be 
many union leaders took the convention floor the past two days 
to criticize bushs stance on issues ranging from child care and 
national health care to the eastern airlines strike which bush in 
march refused to block by using his power to name an emergency 
mediation board 
congress last week gave final passage to a measure creating a 
congressional study of the strike designed to produce 
recommendations for a settlement and the labor leaders said a bush 
veto would end any pretense of cordiality between the aflcio and 
the administration 
he missed a golden opportunity air line pilots association 
president henry duffy said of bushs refusal to intervene in march 
hes got another chance now 
george leitz president of the transport workers union 
representing striking eastern flight attendants added that 
kinder gentler george better not veto this legislation 
moe biller president of the american postal workers union 
called on bushoward labor by lifting the ban on rehiring the air 
traffic controllers reagan fired in 1981 after they struck 
by any measure of justice these workers have paid the price 
for taking actions they felt necessary at the time biller said 
in a tuesday letter to bush i ask you to give us a sign 
wednesday that there is room for clemency in your 
administration 
the delegates broke into loud cheering and applause tuesday when 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said democratic congressional 
leaders planned to seek another increase in the minimum wage in 
1992 a presidential election year 
if he will not sign it then we well just have to get another 
president after 1992 who will kennedy said 
kirkland who recently referred to bush as reagan lite has 
tempered his criticisms of late in part because of the minimum 
wage compromise 
we have channels of communication that i think are superior to 
those that we had during the reagan years he said in an 
interview last week i think youd have to say any judgment is 
still pending 
no such uncertainty clouds labor relations with mitchell who 
has increased his stature among the union leaders by successfully 
fighting bushs effort to cut capital gains taxes 
i have considerable and growing admiration for sen 
mitchell kirkland said 
kennedy pledged to get a national health care measure to bushs 
desk next year 
that promise came as delegates approved an aggressive lobbying 
effort designed to sway congress and business leaders into a 
compromise agreement on such a plan

president bush should meet with the 
nato allies before not after his summit next month with 
president mikhail gorbachev the head of natos legislative arm 
said wednesday 
patrick duffy president of the north atlantic assembly said it 
was unthinkable bush would meet with gorbachev without first 
consulting the other members of the 16nation north atlantic treaty 
organization 
duffy a member of britains house of commons said the agenda 
for the dec 23 shipboard meeting off the island of malta was 
likely to be dominated by the dramatic changes in eastern europe 
particularly in east germany 
nato sources who demanded anonymity said a senior us 
official will meet with the allies in brussels on dec 4 to discuss 
the summit but it was not yet certain who that would be 
in washington administration officials have said bush was 
considering calling a nato summit in brussels after the gorbachev 
meeting to discuss new political and military strategy for the west 
the nato sources said contingency plans were being made for such 
a presidential visit 
french president francois mitterrand hurriedly scheduled a 
meeting saturday of all 12 leaders of the european community the 
common market trading bloc to discuss eastern europe 
some analysts believe the move was designed to give the 
community leaders a chance to discuss the developments before the 
bushgorbachev summit 
duffy reminded bush that the political atmosphere in europe was 
sensitive 
there is a great joy and genuine emotion but there is also a 
good deal of confusion and concern about where this process will 
eventually take us he said 
it is absolutely imperative he said that the us 
president demonstrates a true awareness of the current situation by 
offering reassurance and predictability to the european allies 
he said bush has a special responsibility and the 
international situation demands nothing less than he meet this 
responsibility 
duffy cautioned against a replay of the 1986 summit at 
reykjavik iceland between president ronald reagan and gorbachev 
which turned into a much more ambitious meeting than had been 
expected 
gorbachev arrived with sweeping arms control proposals that 
caught the americans off guard the allies were furious such 
discussions took place without consultations 
politicians of every stripe in europe are agreed there must be 
no more yaltas or reykjaviks duffy said the present system 
would be unable to contain a repetition along these lines 
yalta refers to the controversial 1945 meeting of president 
franklin d roosevelt soviet leader josef stalin and british prime 
minister winston churchill at which the shape of postwar europe 
was determined 
the north atlantic assembly is made up of legislators of the 
nato nations

calling cigarettes a form of death sen 
edward m kennedy proposed legislation wednesday that would give 
the government control over tobacco products and finance an 
antismoking campaign 
kennedy who was joined in a capitol hill news conference by 
former surgeon general c everett koop said he decided against 
including tough limits on cigarette exports and advertising to 
increase the chances that the bill would pass 
the tobacco lobby is still one of the strongest lobbies in the 
congress theres no question about it said kennedy dmass 
this is not an attempt to ban cigarettes he said i think we 
can get a greater degree of support with this approach 
the legislation which is still being drafted for introduction 
later would call for a total of 185 million in federal spending 
next year on an antismoking advertising campaign grants to 
states schools and businesses that promote antismoking programs 
and money to establish a new center for tobacco products 
the center would for the first time give the federal government 
regulatory control over the contents of cigarettes packs of 
cigarettes would be required to carry information either on the 
package or inside about the various tobacco additives many of 
which are carcinogenic kennedy said 
the tobacco institute the tobacco industrys main washington 
lobbyist said kennedy was proposing to waste public money to alert 
people about something they already know statistics across the 
board show that 99 percent of the american people are aware of what 
the surgeon general has to say about smoking said institute 
spokeswoman brennan dawson 
requiring cigarette companies to list ingredients on packaging 
would violate trade secrets dawson said and a provision of the 
kennedy bill that would lift a federal prohibition on 
statebystate regulation of advertising would create a 
crazyquilt of local advertising restrictions 
koop who was appointed surgeon general by thenpresident 
reagan noted how unusual it is for him to agree with kennedy 
its about time that the federal government stood up to be 
counted on a product that kills 390000 people every year koop 
said cigarettes are the only legal product in america which 
when used as advertised kills you 
kennedy said he would try to quit smoking cigars a habit he has 
maintained over the years i wish i had never started and ill do 
my best to give it up

the national park service said wednesday it 
will try to keep the bison herd in northern yellowstone national 
park from roaming into montana but conceded as many as 200 of the 
animals may be shot this winter if they enter the state 
the killing of nearly 600 yellowstone buffalo by montana 
ranchers and hunters last winter and spring prompted sharp 
criticism from environmentalists and conservationists 
kl cool montanas wildlife director said wednesday the state 
is trying to av300 animals so that they can be better 
managed and kept out of montana rangeland 
cool and bob barbee superintendent of the park briefed some 
members of congress as well as environmental and conservation 
leaders on the bison management plan but they conceded they 
havent figured out how the huge animals will be kept from roaming 
out of the park or how the size of the herd will be reduced 
on the long haul trying to herd a buffalo doesnt work 
buffalo are herded where they want to go said barbee adding 
that efforts will be made to keep the bison in the park by gentle 
hazing and whatever else might work 
cool said the state will maintain its policy of shooting any 
bison that cross onto montana state lands until the northern 
yellowstone herd is reduced to about 200 animals hunters and 
ranchers will be given license to shoot the animals under 
supervision from a game warden he said 
montana does not want to be viewed as being unrealistic or 
uncooperative he said but he said the state legislature has 
required that hunters be free to shoot the bison that roam into the 
state 
ranchers have complained vigorously that the buffalo cause 
damage to property and they fear that they will transmit 
brucellosis a disease the interferes with reproduction to their 
cattle blood tests have shown that more than half of the bison 
killed in montana last year had brucellosis he said 
most of the vast federallyowned yellowstone park lies in 
wyoming but its northern end extends into montana 
wyoming does not allow the shooting of stray bison 
yellowstone has about 2500 bison in three major herds on its 
more than 24 million acres but only the northern or lamar herd 
poses a concern to montana ranchers because of a series of mild 
winters and other factors the northern bison herd grew to more 
than 900 last year year and most of them roamed along the 
yellowstone river valley into montana where 569 of the animals 
were killed last winter and spring 
that number was unprecedented and prompted criticism from 
conservationists and environmentalists buffalo have roamed onto 
montana lands for years but not nearly in the numbers that left 
the park last winter 
according to montana officials 190 yellowstone buffalos were 
killed in montana in 1984 through 1988 
barbee said the park service will try to develop ways to better 
control the size of the northern herd to keep it below 300 animals 
but he said ways to do that havent been worked out he ruled 
out the possiblity that hunters would be allowed to hunt the bison 
within park boundaries

as many as 7000 east germans who fled to the west 
but became disenchanted are expected to return home a west german 
tv network reported wednesday 
in recent days there have been reports some from east germany 
about a possible large return of those who fled to west germany in 
september and october 
while those numbers have not been confirmed it is clear that 
some refugees are going home now that east germanys communist 
leaders have opened borders and promised reforms under increasing 
pressure for freedom 
communist leaders and opposition groups have urged their 
countrymen to stay home to take part in reforms they also have 
expressed hope some of the 200000 mostly young people who have 
fled to the west this year will return 
west germanys zdf television network said as many as 7000 east 
germans were expected to return 3000 less than predicted by east 
germany 
every day about 30 people knock on the door here and ask to 
reenter the german democratic republic said peter heyn deputy 
chief of a returnee center in east berlins northeastern buch 
district the climate in the federal republic west germany has 
gotten colder 
heyn predicted the centers capacity of 150 people would be 
reached soon about 60 germans disappointed with capitalist life in 
the west reportedly arrived at the center wednesday 
contrary to the past we are trying everything to simplify 
procedures for regaining east german citizenship heyn said 
a 48yearold warehouse worker said he left west germany a few 
days ago after four years feeling totally disappointed 
i was allegedly too old for a job he said requesting 
anonymity it wasnt for me i wanted to come back mainly because 
of the security which i missed quite a bit in the federal 
republic 
meanwhile the east german red cross which said it was bracing 
for a return wave of up to 10000 opened four reception centers 
along the border with west germany 
authorities in cities such as magdeburg and erfurt readied 
emergency shelters in military barracks schools and dormitories 
west german red cross officials in bonn said that while buses 
were on standby no major organized return was planned for the 
moment 
officials said a flow back to east germany would be difficult to 
document since many would simply return to their homes and most had 
become west german citizens meaning they are not registered when 
leaving the country 
a major outflow is expected from bavaria which borders on 
southern east germany east germanys official adn news service 
said 
east german officials say the government will loan each returnee 
150 marks in immediate aid and 15 marks for each day of 
unemployment the 150 marks is about onetenth of a workers

the state department expressed concern 
wednesday about recent fighting in cambodia and urged various 
factions to return to the negotiating table to seek a political 
settlement 
the statement came on the eve of a un vote on cambodias seat 
at the international body the united nations is expected to 
confirm retention of the seat by an opposition coalition that 
includes noncommunist factions backed by the united states 
there has been military activity by the khmer rouge and other 
elements in cambodia said richard boucher a department 
spokesman we regret the return to the battlefield in cambodia 
and we support all efforts to return to the negotiating table as 
soon as possible 
a comprehensive settlement which we think is still needed 
will require agreement among the cambodian facions and the other 
involved parties on the formation of an interim coalition 
authority he said 
last summer a paris peace conference on cambodia dissolved over 
the failure to reach agreement on the khmer rouges involvement in 
an interim government under leader pol pot the khmer rouge killed 
more than one million people before vietnam invaded cambodia in 
1978 
vietnam which installed a puppet government in phnom penh said 
its occupation troops have been withdrawn as of sept 31 last 
week britain became the first western nation to acknowledge that 
vietnamese forces are no longer in cambodia 
the chinese who have supplied the khmer rouge and the 
noncommunist opposition coalition contend vietnamese troops remain 
in cambodia disguised as cambodians 
in a related development congress is continuing restrictions on 
president bushs ability to send weapons to noncommunist factions 
according to congressional sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the restrictions adopted over the administrations objections 
prevent the president from using contingency funds from the cia to 
arm the cambodian guerrillas unless congress approves the action 
first the restrictions are contained in a secret appendix to the 
military appropriations bill

through what was called a miracle of 
international cooperation three of four fingers were reattached 
to a polish sailors hand more than two days after they were 
severed in a shipboard accident 
dr jimmy chow director of replantation and chief of the 
microvascular surgery team at the washington hospital center said 
wednesday the fingers were not reattached to the hand of zbyskyo 
kajowski for more than 54 hours 
this appears to be a record because the longest time previously 
known between this type of accident and reattachment was 39 hours 
said chow who coordinated the surgery 
the accident occurred aboard the greek freighter ss success on 
nov 6 some 500 miles off bermuda when kajowskis hand was caught 
under falling machinery doctors said 
kajowski 39 suffered what chow characterized as a severe 
crushamputation injury that severed the four fingers of the left 
hand where they meet the palm 
the ship captain received emergency advice from dr edward 
schultze head of the emergency room at king edward vii hospital in 
bermuda that included immersion of the digits in a saline solution 
and keep them cool but not frozen 
paramedics on the ship gave kajowski emergency firstaid and 
doctors on bermuda contacted the us coast guard which called 
chow the doctor said 
right then time was important chow said the ship was two 
days away from where it could meet a us navy helicopter that 
could take the sailor to bermuda it was a miracle of 
international cooperation 
once the freighter reached the rendezvous point kajowski was 
flown to bermuda by a navy helicopter 
kajowski received emergency treatment in bermuda and the greek 
shipping company authorized a private air ambulance to fly the 
sailor to washington 
the surgery performed on nov 8 took nearly 15 hours chow 
said 
all of the severed digits except for kajowskis index finger 
were able to be saved 
chow said the prognosis for a full recovery by his patient was 
excellent he said that although the sailor was still hospitalized 
he has made a fist and straightened his damaged fingers 
kajowski will be able to return to sea chow said and should be 
able to perform all the duties he could in the past

a new state law on child abuse has prompted 
arizonas largest school district to enact a policy requiring 
teachers and counselors to report to police the names of sexually 
active students 
the legislator who cosponsored the childabuse law said 
reporting sexually active students wasnt her intent and shell 
work to revise the measure 
we rewrote the law to bring the states child abuse reporting 
laws up to federal specifications said rep leslie johnson we 
never thought it could be construed as it has been in the mesa 
district 
in the meantime school officials say some students wont talk 
to them about such problems as pregnancy and sexually transmitted 
diseases knowing a police investigation might ensue 
the youngsters tend to clam up when we tell them we can no 
longer promise confidentiality said mountain view high school 
principal james curlett said they will turn to their friends for 
help and when it comes to advice about subjects like communicable 
diseases that would be disastrous 
dobson high school counseling director bob merlene said the 
policy probably will deter some students from seeking counseling 
this policy does more to scare than to help our students he 
said 
changes made this year in arizonas childabuse reporting 
statute require schools to report to police any student who they 
have reasonable grounds to believe has been a victim of sexual 
abuse sexual conduct with a minor sexual assault sexual 
molestation commercial sexual exploitation of a minor incest or 
child prostitution 
the previous law required reporting only in cases of sexual 
molestation 
however as interpreted by mesa schools and mesa police school 
officials must inform police of any and all sexual activity the 
mesa district has 61700 students and covers most of mesa parts of 
two other phoenix suburbs and the salt river indian reservation 
our interpretation of the law is that the school district must 
report all sexual activity among students and then it is up to the 
police to determine if it is a situation in which there is 
reasonable grounds to believe a minor has been abused said sgt 
mike hayes mesa police spokesman 
hayes said that if two 15yearolds are kissing and fondling 
each other under the bleachers and a teacher sees them the 
teacher is obligated under the new law to report the incident to 
police for investigation 
the number of child abuse reports to police by school officials 
hasnt increased since the district policy went into effect in 
september hayes said 
fred skoglund assistant superintendent of the mesa district 
said the problem is in the wording of the legislation 
we believe we are forced to comply with the letter of the law 
even though we do not believe it was the intent skoglund said 
however officials from the neighboring tempe and chandler 
districts said they interpreted the law differently they said 
their reporting procedures havent changed and that police are only 
called in instances of obvious abuse

it was like old times wednesday as former 
president reagan and wife nancy returned to the white house for 
the first time for the unveiling of their official portraits 
president bush referred repeatedly to his predecessor as mr 
president 
reagan called him george and in a tribute to bushs past 
role as understudy vice president bush 
bush confided that he had a little difficulty adjusting to their 
changed circumstances 
bush joked to the crowd of 100 former reagan administration 
officials and other vips gathered in the east room 
when the announcer here said mr president well i fell 
back to where i comfortably was for eight years it seemed most 
appropriate 
it wasnt the days only honor for reagan 
senate republicans named their campaign committees headquarters 
the ronald reagan republican center and reagan attending the 
capitol hill ceremony noted it wasnt the first time he had been 
so honored 
there is another building named for me its a saloon in 
ireland reagan told the outdoor gathering of 1000 gop partisans 
at the dedication ceremony 
at the conclusion of the ceremony reagan and wife were 
presented with a watercolor of the building now he said i 
can replace the photograph of the saloon 
the white house portraits of the reagans were painted by new 
york artist aaron shikler 
reagan is shown on a 50inchhigh canvas in a blue suit and red 
tie his fingers on his oval office desk a bookcase and a bronze 
cowboy statue behind him mrs reagan is depicted in a fulllength 
red gown standing in profile before the closed mahogany doors 
outside the state dining room 
both reagans beamed as bush showered them with praises saying 
their portraits will hang in the white house to remind future 
generations about two of its greats 
he called reagan one of the most beloved presidents in the 
history of the republic and said he deserves more credit than 
anyone else for the democratic changes taking place around the 
world 
the painting reflects the qualities that make him so special 
kindness gallantry decency and humor said bush 
he praised nancy reagan for her beauty taste and antidrug 
crusade and said over the years there have been many wonderful 
presidents and first ladies but thanks to you i dont believe 
this place has ever had a better team 
nancy dont fail to take a look quipped reagan when he got 
to speak theyre sure different than a lot of those cartoons we 
had to put up with 
the former president now living in retirement in belair 
calif called it a very special day in nancys and my life 
incidentally i want to say here with the very kind things 
that george was saying i think attention has to be called to the 
fact that whatever we accomplished vice president george bush was 
a major part of everything we did 
maybe its because my staff is a bit smaller now than it used 
to be but i cant really find the words to express how i feel to 
be back here in this house said the 78yearold reagan his 
graying hair back almost to regular length following surgery in 
september that caused him to shave it off 
there are really no words to convey what it means to nancy and 
me to be here to walk in these hallowed halls again reagan said 
the petrie foundation and the white house historical association 
commissioned the paintings and donated them to the white house 
shikler redid reagans portrait after mrs reagan expressed 
disappointment with the first 
shikler also did the white house paintings of the late president 
john f kennedy and his wife jacqueline 
reagans portrait will hang on the state floor with other 20th 
century presidents mrs reagans 44inchhigh canvass will hang on 
the ground floor corridor with portraits of other recent first 
ladies 
with the ceremony over as a marine band began to play outside 
the east room reagan returned to the microphone for one last 
anecdote 
he recalled how once at a state dinner for french president 
francois mitterrand and his wife nancy had escorted mitterrand off 
to her table but mrs mitterrand just stood there and said 
something to me in french which i didnt understand 
then the interpreter caught up with us and told me what she 
was saying i was standing on her gown

the san franciscooakland bay bridge 
reopens saturday restoring the key link between two cities 
battered by a major earthquake that forced harried commuters onto 
trains ferries and buses 
state department of transportation officials had hoped to open 
the bridge by friday exactly one month after a 50foot section of 
the spans upper roadway dropped onto the lower during the oct 17 
quake claiming one life 
they almost made it but two days of foggy nights created enough 
moisture to interrupt stripe painting on the 53yearold bridge 
which carried more than 260000 vehicles every working day prior to 
the quake 
vehicle traffic will start moving across the 85mile span as 
soon as possible after midnight friday according to burch 
bachtold regional director for the state department of 
transportation caltrans 
hikers will get a chance to try the bridge even earlier at 5 
each thousands are expected to take part thursday with proceeds 
going to pay for buses to take them to the bridge anything left 
over will go to quake relief 
although many are expected to return to their autos there are 
some who will continue to use mass transit 
ben scauzzo of pleasant hill about 30 miles east of san 
francisco switched to bart after years of using his car 
but no more he said on wednesday now im going to 
continue riding the train my biggest problem is figuring out the 
tickets 
but paul smith a federal employee is a commuter who thinks 
bart is too limiting 
bart only goes to certain places time is important to me i 
think with my car i can increase my work production time two or 
three times 
caltrans officials announced last week they hoped to reopen the 
bridge on nov 17 one month after the 15second quake struck 
northern california at 504 pm killing 66 people and causing 7 
billion in damage the earthquake also interrupted the world series 
between the san francisco giants and the oakland athletics an 
event symbolized by the bridge on tshirts and other memorabilia 
the department originally predicted the span would reopen around 
thanksgiving denny mcleod president of rigging international of 
alameda one of the repair contractors said planning alone for 
such a job usually takes a month 
here we had to do it right on the spot he said you have 
to make a lot of judgment calls fast and every one of them has to 
be right 
the first step was to make sure the damaged decks didnt fall 
through to the bay working 12hour shifts crews cut the damaged 
upper deck into two pieces then used a crane to lower them to a 
barge below 
mcleod devised a hydraulic jack to pull the bridge back 
together the quake had pulled the eastern approach about seven 
inches toward oakland the bridge moved back two inches after the 
shaking stopped 
we had to make it ourselves he said adding that the jack 
pulled about 10 million pounds of weight back toward san francisco 
the next major steps involved installing new girders placing 20 
new ibeams lowering 42 precast deck sections and then pouring 
concrete between them 
repairs were done using a technique first employed in the 1950s 
when train tracks were ripped from the lower deck 
that was when we first used prefabricated concrete sections

the bridge collapse forced thousands of commuters to abandon 
their beloved cars for bay area rapid transit trains a hastily 
assembled ferry fleet or buses commuters who insisted on driving 
added many extra miles taking roundabout routes over stilluseable

the 20foot obelisk known as the white 
supremacy monument was taken apart and moved wednesday from the 
foot of canal street to a warehouse 
the streets department says the monument erected in 1891 to 
commemorate a white uprising which overthrew the reconstruction 
government in 1874 is being moved on advice of engineers for 
traffic improvements 
the national association for the advancement of white people 
which founder and former ku klux klan imperial wizard david duke 
calls a white civil rights group initially objected to moving it 
it is inscribed with the names of 16 members of the white league 
who died in the 18minute battle an inscription praising white 
supremacy was added in 1932 and white supremacy groups have 
rallied near the monument for decades 
the naawp complained to state and national preservation 
officials who worked out an agreement under which the city may 
store the monument for 18 months but must put it back up by may 1 
1991 within two blocks of the original site

emptyhanded 
its great news jill fox douglas county schools 
spokeswoman said tuesday it really gives a strong picture of 
the teachers and administrators and the kids

high amount of drug use by young people outside the schools 
the sheriff recruited an undisclosed number of officers to 
mingle with students in the countys three high schools last spring 
and this fall 
the officers fooled students and teachers by doing homework 
going to football games and hanging out with students but they 
failed to make a single drug purchase officials said 
were not denying theres a drug problem but were saying 
were being successful at keeping it out of the schools walker

the government declared a 3month state 
of siege wednesday and rounded up at least 700 teachers and labor 
leaders a day after negotiations with striking teachers broke down 
three teachers were in critical condition after a 24day hunger 
strike and were rushed to private clinics where they were placed 
under intensive care 
many of the teachers and unionists who were arrested were sent 
to detention centers in the bolivian tropics said undersecretary 
of the interior raul loayza 
the state of siege allows police to arrest and hold someone 
without charge for 48 hours without a judicial order rules 
governing public meetings and other activities must be determined 
by state governments 
the centerleft government of president jaime paz zamora said it 
acted to guarantee peaceful local elections next month 
the hunger strike ended with the state of siege and most schools 
were open wednesday for final exams there was little police 
presence in la paz and other cities and business and commercial 
activity was normal 
power stations in la paz were guarded by soldiers but no 
violence was reported 
the move came a day after salary negotiations between the 
government and the union of education workers representing the 
countrys 80000 public schoolteachers broke down 
the teachers who earn 75 a month have been demanding a 103 
bonus to compensate for cost of living increases hundreds of 
teachers joined the strike to pressure paz zamoras government to 
provide the bonus 
the government says it cannot afford to pay the bonus because of 
the state of the economy education spending takes up 18 percent of 
the countrys budget 
in recent days teachers and students clashed with police in la 
paz and the government closed schools two weeks ago when tens of 
thousands of workers marched in support of the teachers 
paz zamoras government trying to maintain an austerity plan 
said in the state of siege decree that the illegal strike created 
a climate of social unrest with demands that the state cannot 
attend without risking the economic and financial stability of the 
country 
the decree said it guarantees the campaign activities of 
political parties for the municipal elections scheduled for dec 3 
and that the balloting must take place for which it is necessary 
to preserve the political rights of citizens and political 
parties 
the minimum monthly wage is 25 the cost of living meanwhile 
is one of the highest in south america with the prices of poultry 
and dairy products comparable to those in the united states and 
europe 
paz zamora who heads the social democratic movement of the 
revolutionary left pledged to maintain stability after taking 
office aug 6 and has continued austerity measures of the previous 
government 
the measures include a wage freeze and lower government spending 
to combat a 1985 annual inflation rate of 24000 percent the rate 
has since dropped to 12 percent and the economy is expected to 
grow by 25 percent this year after years of decline 
in response to a general strike the previous government also 
declared a 90day state of siege after 45 days in office

a policeman who fatally shot a black motorcyclist 
acted recklessly and in defiance of police regulations prosecutors 
said wednesday as the trial opened into two deaths that touched off 
racial violence in january 
defense attorneys said their client shot in selfdefense 
william lozano 31 faces two manslaughter counts in the slayings 
of the driver clement lloyd 23 and his passenger allan 
blanchard 24 who died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle 
crashed after the shooting 
assistant state attorney don horn told the racially mixed jury 
that lozano violated police regulations when he stepped into the 
street and fired at lloyd 
this shooting was not justified horn said at the time 
lozano fired the shot he was in no danger of being struck by the 
motorcycle 
testimony will show he said that lozano fired at the 
motorcycle as it was about to pass him not hit him 
it was not a lifeordeath situation it was not a 
splitsecond decision and he did not have to shoot the 
prosecutor said 
but defense attorney roy black said lozano acted not out of 
racism but in selfdefense as the speeding motorycle headed 
directly at him to escape a pursuing squad car he said no one the 
night of the shooting could see each other well enough in the 
overton neighborhood to determine skin color 
officer lozano did not shoot his gun because he is hispanic 
black said clement lloyd did not die because he was black 
lozano shot only because the motorcycle driven by a desperate 
lloyd was about to run into him the defense contends 
he had a second a half second to make a decision to save his 
life black said 
dade circuit judge joseph farina cleared the last barriers to 
the trial by rejecting defense contentions that the threat of 
violence hung over the trial and could frighten jurors into 
convicting lozano to avoid another riot 
the sixmember jury is made up of two blacks one hispanic and 
three whites the alternates are two hispanics and two whites 
the shooting took place jan 16 as the colombianborn lozano and 
his partner were stopped on a street in the predominantly black 
overtown talking to the victim of a minor crime as they talked 
another squad car was chasing down a speeding motorcycle driven by 
lloyd and carrying blanchard 
when the motorcycle turned onto the street where lozano was 
standing the officer fired one shot from his police weapon 
killing lloyd instantly and sending the motorcycle crashing into a 
car blanchard died later 
one of the prosecutions star witnesses eddie johnson 
testified later wednesday that he had been talking to lozano and 
his partner about his stolen license plate tag when the shooting 
occurred 
johnson said he spotted the motorcycle and called it to the 
attention of lozano who was looking for a theft form in the trunk 
of his police car 
he went a few steps and put his radio up said johnson he 
took a few more steps with his weapon he aimed it in that general 
direction i ducked when i ducked i heard the shot johnson 
said 
he estimated the motorcycle was going at 50 or 60 miles per 
hour but on cross examination by black johnson admitted he had 
given a higher speed in his initial statements to police and he 
also acknowledged telling police he could not determine if the 
motorcyle was heading directly for lozano 
within an hour after the shooting an angry crowd of overtown 
residents had gathered and began pelting officers with rocks and 
bottles the violence quickly spread into a threeday riot during 
the week leading up to the super bowl in miami 
the disturbances left one looter shot to death 11 people 
injured by gunfire and 13 buildings burned down 
lloyd was later found to have high levels of alcohol and thc 
the active chemical in marijuana in his bloodstream at the time 
of his death he also had 55 grams of marijuana and 1500 in cash 
in his pocket facts the defense contends shows he was a 
drugcrazed dealer desperate enough to run down a policeman to 
avoid arrest and more jail time 
the city later set up a commission to examine the roots of the 
racial disturbance the fourth to hit miami in the 1980s the 
previous disturbances were sparked by the killing of black men by 
officers or the officers acquittals on similar charges 
if convicted on both counts lozano faces up to 60 years in 
prison

police want to permanently barricade streets 
surrounding a 12block area in the san fernando valley plagued by 
drivethrough drug dealing and gang violence 
this would make this area a vastly safer community for the 
lawabiding people who live there police cmdr chet spencer said 
tuesday why should they be subjected to the danger and the 
shootings that go along with drug activity when there is something 
that can be done about it 
the blockade plans include a guard station to be built and 
staffed using donations by apartment owners in the sepulvedaarea 
neighborhood a meeting of residents and city officials is planned 
for january to try to work out details 
sawhorse barricades were first erected there last week and 
police increased patrols in the heavy drugdealing area limiting 
entry to residents and their guests 
the effort has been so successful at curbing crime that police 
want to make it permanent said capt mark d stevens 
the plan must first go to the city council which holds the 
authority to close city streets to the general public said john 
haggerty an assistant city attorney 
councilman joel wachs who represents the area about 15 miles 
northwest of downtown introduced a measure tuesday that would keep 
the temporary blockades in place as long as police see fit said 
rick kunz a wachs aide 
the council will consider wachs measure next week originally 
the blockades were allowed by a 30day permit obtained from the los 
angeles department of transportation because of police claims that 
there was an unusual danger to the public and property in the area 
police barricades on streets plagued by crime were first used in 
california three years ago on a threeblock stretch of road in 
northridge roadblocks have also curtailed drug dealing in the 
picounion area near downtown 
in miami shores fla police last year permanently barricaded 
several streets to limit access to the suburb they since have 
reported a noticeable reduction in the number of burglaries

increasingly the american public has come to 
believe there is political bias in news coverage a new survey 
finds 
despite that and a belief by 63 percent of the american public 
that news organizations fuel controversies a favorable view of 
those organizations is expressed by 82 percent for network tv news 
80 percent for local television news and 77 percent for daily 
newspapers said the times mirror survey released wednesday 
among network big names abc news anchor peter jennings is now 
the most highly regarded of the television correspondents 
according to the poll while his believability rating topped his 
network rivals it dropped five points from its 1985 level cbs 
dan rather lost 10 believability points abcs ted koppel 9 points 
and nbcs tom brokaw 7 points 
at the other end of the believability scale was geraldo rivera 
whose rating dropped 48 points between the two surveys 
the survey conducted among members of the public media 
government academia and business is the first work of the 
washingtonbased times mirror center for the people amp the press 
believability is down theres just no question about it 
said michael robinson an associate professor of government at 
georgetown university and associate director of the survey on 
the average news organizations lost nine points on a sale of 100 
in terms of believability he said 
the surveys rating scale includes four categories ranging from 
the top you can believe all or most of what the person says to 
the bottom believe almost nothing 
counting the percentages of respondents ranking news people or 
organizations in the top two categories the top of the list reads 
jennings 85 percent cable news network 84 percent the wall street 
journal 83 percent brokaw 81 percent and rather and koppel 79 
percent at the bottom is rivera at 26 percent 
other names and organizations include abcs diane sawyer at 75 
percent the associated press 74 percent abcs sam donaldson 71 
usa today 70 and columnist george will 59 
by comparison pope john paul ii gets a rating of 70 percent 
president bush 63 percent former president reagan 47 johnny 
carson 33 soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 29 and businessman 
donald trump 25 
the most interesting case bar none for me is cnn robinson 
said cnn is the only news organization that has sustained no 
decrease in believability 
the reason he said is that cnn concentrates on hard news it 
doesnt do a lot of interpretation doesnt do a lot of 
watchdoggery it just shows hard news particularly the sort of 
news the public is most interested in 
the los angelesbased times mirror cos holdings include the 
los angeles times new york newsday and the baltimore sun it also 
includes a cable television division 
pollsters said that since times mirror began its research 
program five years ago there has been a significant erosion of 
public confidence in the press as an objective reporter of the news 
and as an impartial observer of the political and social scene 
in 1985 53 percent of the american public believed news media 
favored one side in dealing with social and political issues that 
percentage remained in the 50s in five subsequent surveys and rose 
to 68 percent in the current one similarly those who believe news 
organizations deal fairly with all sides dropped from 34 
percent to 28 percent 
when the press respondents were asked whether news organizations 
merely report the news or fuel controversies by their coverage 46 
percent opted for the first and 49 percent for the second drive 
controversy also got the nod from 75 percent of the academics 80 
percent of business leaders and 77 percent of government leaders 
not surprisingly members of the news media 81 percent said 
they cover stories about the personal and ethical behavior of 
politicians very or fairly responsibly only 68 percent of the 
general public and 60 percent of government leaders agreed 
the percentage of people who think news organizations get their 
facts straight rose to 54 percent from a low of 40 percent a year 
ago and there was a slight increase in the percentage of those who 
believe the press respects peoples privacy from 14 percent last 
year to 23 percent 
the survey found that the media consistently overstate interest 
in news stories in eight of nine stories cited the media thought 
the public was more interested than the public said it was 
the greatest overstatements of public interest were on stories 
about pete rose the mike tysonrobin givens divorce and former 
house speaker jim wright the survey said news about the scandal 
at the department of housing and urban development was the only 
instance in which the press correctly gauged the very low level of 
public interest 
sixtyfour percent of the members of the public surveyed said 
they read a newspaper nearly every day while 67 percent said they 
regularly watched a network news show 
a total of 508 media telephone interviews were conducted aug 
3sept 29 while 275 interviews were conducted with leaders in 
business government and academia aug 3oct 6 
nearly 100 interviews were conducted with government leaders 
including 38 members of congress 12 senaors nine governors 21 
mayors and 16 senior bush administration officials there were 100 
interviews with presidents and journalism deans at major colleges 
and universities 
the gallup organization conducted a telephone survey of 1507

aids activists say ucla medical center was 
trying to profit from a governmentsubsidized research program by 
charging patients for aids drug studies in which participation is 
free around the country 
what ucla is doing is wrong said dr neil schram former 
chairman of the los angeles citycounty aids task force they are 
using this study as a way to make money and in my opinion that is 
inappropriate 
experimental drug treatment programs are federally funded and 
they are supposed to be free 
critics claim the medical school part of the university of 
california los angeles charged patients a 260 consultation fee 
to determine their eligibility for the study 
uclas aids clinical trials unit is one of 46 research 
facilities nationwide participating in the study conducted by the 
national institute of allergy and infectious diseases to examine 
the effects of experimental aids drugs such as azt and ddi 
federal health officials said research groups have the option of 
charging fees but believe that ucla is the only program that does 
ive never encountered it before said dr daniel hoth 
director of the aids program for niaid 
dr david hardy coinvestigator of the clinical trial group at 
uclas aids research center said the program charges fees because 
the screenings are part of a larger evaluation designed to 
determine options in treatment 
the time that we spend with someone in the clinic is not 
specifically for participation in the study he said we 
discuss much much more than just the study such as why they might 
want to continue taking azt or why they cant and we consider it a 
medical consultation 
he added that after candidates are chosen treatment is free 
to be eligible for the program a patient must test positive for 
the aids virus and never have been treated with ddi the program is 
composed of three separate studies to determine the effectiveness 
of ddi in comparison to azt 
ddi or dideoxyinosine and azt now known formally as 
zidovudine both inhibit replication of the aids virus 
aids activists claim the program should be free because patients 
put their health at risk by taking an experimental drug they also 
claim the fee excludes poor patients who could benefit 
there is already a problem with minorities and poor people 
getting experimental drug treatments and this will make it that 
more difficult to get access to those drugs said mark 
kostopoulos a spokesman for aids coalition to unleash power

a christian leader accused gen michel 
aoun on wednesday of obstructing peace efforts and the army 
commander replied that christians who support a syrianbacked plan 
should have their throats cut 
weve tried all means to liberate lebanon from foreign forces 
throughout the 14 years of war but we havent succeeded said 
george saadeh head of the rightwing phalange party the largest 
christian political group 
the national reconciliation charter is a peace offensive to 
liberate lebanon without bloodshed he said in an interview 
referring to a plan devised by legislators at a threeweek meeting 
in taif saudi arabia 
i dont understand why he aoun doesnt want to give peace a 
chance saadeh 57 said in his home village of shibtine 27 
miles north of beirut 
he was interviewed after aoun who commands lebanons christian 
army units declared those who support the arab solution deserve 
to have their throats and tongues cut we are not going to be 
lenient with them 
shiite moslem militias allied with iran and syria battled in 
beiruts southern slums for a second night wednesday police said 
two people had been killed and 11 wounded since fighting began 
tuesday between hezbollah a proiranian fundamentalist group and 
the more moderate amal allied with syria 
amal and hezbollah are rivals for supremacy among the 12 
million shiites the largest sect in lebanons 4 million people 
saadeh a maronite catholic like aoun also leads the lebanese 
front alliance of christian groups and is a member of parliament 
he was the main christian negotiator in taif last month on the plan 
to end the sectarian civil war which has cost more than 150000 
lives 
parliament ratified the accord known in lebanon as the national 
reconciliation charter on nov 4 during a session in 
syriancontrolled north lebanon that also chose rene mouawad a 
christian as president 
aoun rejected the taif accord because it does not include a 
timetable for withdrawal of the 40000 syrian soldiers in lebanon 
whom he describes as an occupation force 
syrian troops are in lebanon under an arab league mandate 
granted in 1976 the year after the civil war began they and 
aouns forces fought a sixmonth artillery war that killed hundreds 
of people nearly all civilians before the arab league arranged a 
truce in september 
the 54yearold general who had led a christian cabinet since 
september 1988 that competed with a moslem government decalred 
parliament dissolved in an attempt to stop ratification of the 
peace plan legislators convened in north lebanon because he 
threatened to shell the parliament building in beirut 
he also claimed mouawad was elected illegally but saadeh said 
wednesday the election of president mouawad is 100 percent in 
line with the constitution 
mouawad has designated sunni moslem politician salim hoss who 
led the moslem government in competition with aouns as prime 
minister to form a national reconciliation government on the basis 
of the taif accord 
a major goal of the peace agreement is to give moslems a greater 
share of power in lebanon where they now make up 55 percent of the 
population christians were in the majority when the country became 
independent of france in 1943 and have controlled the government 
judiciary and army 
in his capacity as caretaker finance minister hoss instructed 
the ministry and central bank wednesday to allow only mouawad to 
withdraw presidential funds which aoun had been using 
hoss told the associated press by telephone the order was 
intended to stop aoun from withdrawing from the presidencys 
account now we have a president he is the only one who has the 
right to control this account 
under an unwritten covenant observed since 1943 lebanons 
president is christian the prime minister sunni moslem and the 
parliament speaker shiite moslem 
saadeh said aouns government will cease to be a legitimate 
cabinet the moment president mouawad announces the formation of a 
new government 
the competing christian and moslem governments were formed when 
president amin gemayels sixyear term ended in september 1988 with 
parliament unable to agree on a successor hoss had been prime 
minister under gemayel 
we should have listened to the advice of those who cautioned 
us that aoun might become a dictator a military ruler saadeh 
said 
the interview was conducted as as delegations from villages in 
the northern province of batroun arrived at his home to 
congratulate him for supporting the peace accord 
an old man hugged and kissed saadeh who has represented batroun 
in parliament since 1968 and said peace ought to have a hero 
he is the hero of peace

pennsylvanias passage of the nations 
strictest abortion controls raises the possibility of a court 
challenge but abortion rights advocates were uncertain wednesday 
whether a lawsuit would help their cause 
the bill which gov robert p casey is expected to sign within 
days was drafted to conflict directly with provisions in the 
supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade ruling which established 
abortion as a constitutional right leading supporters have said 
abortion rights activists were in a quandary because an attempt 
to overturn the bills provisions might open the way for appeals 
that could weaken roe vs wade further 
in july the us supreme court gave states greater leeway to 
restrict abortions pennsylvanias law would be the first to take 
advantage of that 
were not going to waltz blindly into any traps at the same 
time were going to fight as aggressively as you could imagine to 
strike down the parts of this bill that violate womens 
constitutional rights said sue frietsche of the state american 
civil liberties union 
elizabeth hrendaroberts a spokeswoman for planned 
parenthoodpennsylvania affiliates predicted a suit would be 
filed but suggested it would be structured in a way that would not 
necessarily endanger roe vs wade any legal action was not 
expected for at least several weeks 
but abortion opponents said the abortion rights camp would take 
significant risks in challenging the new provisions 
the prochoice side is in a catch22 position if they allow 
the bill to stand weve got a good bill in pennsylvania if 
they dont challenge clearly other states will look at this 
legislation and say well at least get this much thats not in 
their interest said denise neary pennsylvania director of the 
national right to life committee 
the bill which the senate passed tuesday would represent the 
most restrictive abortion controls in the nation 
it would require women to notify their husbands if they plan to 
get an abortion prohibit abortions because of the fetus sex ban 
abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except in cases where 
the mother faces death or irreversible harm and establish a 
24hour waiting period 
also doctors would be required to inform a woman of the likely 
age of the fetus before performing an abortion and explain the 
risks and alternatives the proposal would regulate the medical use 
of tissue from aborted fetuses 
abortion rights advocates say the prohibition on sexselection 
abortions is in direct conflict with the supreme courts ban on 
restrictions during the first trimester of pregnancy another 
potential clash is the spousal notification which prochoice 
leaders have labeled unconstitutional a third area of dispute 
could be the 24week provision which would place a ban on 
abortions during a period that the court has permitted limited 
restrictions 
the purpose of the sexselection ban is to overthrow roe vs 
wade completely and allow state legislatures to ban abortion at any 
time for any reason and do away with the trimester system ms 
hrendaroberts said 
a leading prochoice legislator republican state sen james 
greenwood predicted that if provisions are challenged and upheld 
then the dam is open 
my instincts are that we are probably better off not having 
this becoming the case to challenge roe greenwood said on the 
other hand i think it is inevitable that the supreme court will 
in one way or another rule on all these matters its just a 
matter of time

the white house said wednesday the united 
states regards captialism as the best formula for curing the 
economic problems of eastern europe but said we have not tried to 
dictate it for any of these countries 
the statement came after soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
said the reforms in eastern europe do not spell the demise of 
socialism and denounced calls for exporting capitalism to the 
soviet bloc 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater noted that the united 
states has joined other western countries in providing aid to 
poland and hungary as they try to reform their economies into a 
freemarket system but we dont think thats a conflict with the 
concerns raised by president gorbachev he said 
fitzwater said president bush views the united states 
freemarket system as the pride of the world and as a good way to 
reform the economic problems that they are facing we certainly are 
proud of the capitalist system and the rewards that it has offered 
we hold it up as an example to all but we have not tried to 
dictate it for any of these countries fitzwater said 
he added we have no apologies or concern with anything that 
weve done at this point 
bush and gorbachev will meet for a summit dec 23 on ships in 
the mediterranean off the coast of malta fitzwater confirmed that 
bush is considering a stop in brussels belgium on the way home to 
brief nato allies on the talks 
fitzwater said he expected bush and gorbachev to make a 
commitment to progress on reducing strategic nuclear stockpiles and 
conventional arms in europe he stressed however that there would 
be no major agreements saying we will not be counting throw 
weights 
the press secretary acknowledged that the united states and 
soviet union are trying to manipulate public expectations of the 
summits outcome 
the soviets have a tendency in past summits to build 
expectations before a summit and we have a tendency to play them 
down he said i suspect the reality is somewhere in the 
middle but i would urge you to discount theirs a little bit on the 
top side 
fitzwater also said that despite prodding from democrats there 
is no real consideration being given to the idea of bush going 
to the berlin wall to salute its opening

an east german political group said wednesday it 
would make the first direct challenge to communist rule by asking 
parliament this week to end the partys 40yearold monopoly on 
power and predicted an easy victory 
communist officials spurned west germanys offer of an economic 
bailout they said they prefer their own course to recovery and 
hinted at reforms to encourage freeenterprise investment 
bild a masscirculation west german newspaper reported 
wednesday that chancellor helmut kohl would meet with party chief 
egon krenz after a communist party congress dec 1517 that is 
expected to make major changes in the east german leadership 
in west berlin hundreds gathered at the enormous brandenburg 
gate hoping the east germans would break through the berlin wall 
in front of the 200yearold symbol of unity a west german 
television network said up to 7000 east german refugees were 
expected to return to their homeland 
the east german constitutions guarantee of a leading role 
for the communist party will be challenged at fridays sitting of 
the increasingly independentminded parliament said manfred 
gerlach head of the liberal democratic party 
it was unclear whether a vote on the constitutional change would 
come the same day 
i figure it will pass with a large majority gerlach told 
west germanys ard radio network his party once closely allied 
with the communists has been at the forefront of calls for change 
in east germany 
the new speaker of parliament noncommunist guenther maleuda 
on tuesday urged a constitutional change to allow a true multiparty 
government 
the east german constitution specifies that constitutional 
changes must be approved a majority of the lawmakers in the 
500member parliament or peoples chamber 
despite gerlachs prediction a majority of the chamber is still 
believed to be made up of orthodox members likely to reject the 
measure 
parliament however has shown increasing signs of independence 
engaging in onceunthinkable debates and casting 26 votes oct 24 
against naming krenz as president oct 24 
for weeks gerlach has urged the communists to abandon their 
leading role but fridays motion will be the first direct 
challenge 
gerlach also predicted free elections as early as next year and 
said the communists would fail to win a majority krenz has 
promised free elections but has not set a date 
krenzs leadership on wednesday weighed the latest pledge of 
economic aid from bonn offered in exchange for sweeping political 
and economic reforms 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann on tuesday 
announced the offer of massive economic aid which he likened to 
the us marshall plan that helped rebuild western europe after the 
nazi defeat in world war ii 
there was no formal government response from east germany to 
haussmanns offer but officials have made clear they do not favor 
a full freemarket system 
the communistaligned national democratic party outlined 
measures to attract private investment 
deputy finance minister martin maassen called for tax breaks for 
east germans who want to privately produce goods and services to 
fill the nations vast consumer void 
east germanys staterun newspapers printed doubtful comments on 
the prospects for accepting handouts declaring no interest in a 
sellout of their socialist state 
economist karlheinz arnold told the communist party newspaper 
berliner zeitung that east germany can manage its own recovery an 
indication that bonns offer may be rejected 
the governmentrun bauernecho newspaper aimed at east 
germanys farmers warned against too much influence from west 
germany 
yes to unrestricted travel no to an east german sellout 
the newspaper said it deemed the two german states politically 
and economically too diverse 
west berlin mayor walter momper cautioned against excessive west 
german involvement in east german affairs 
east germany needs no patronage momper said in west berlin 
in washington a white house spokesman said the united states 
has no apologies for extolling capitalism as a remedy for 
eastern europes economic woes soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev had warned the west against gloating about the demise of 
socialism or attempting to export capitalism 
we certainly are proud of the capitalist system and the 
rewards that it has offered marlin fitzwater said we hold it 
up as an example to all but we have not tried to dictate it to any 
of these countries 
in tokyo gorbachev adviser alexander yakovlev said he was 
surprised by western commentators who interpret the tumult in 
eastern europe as demonstrating the failure of socialism and soviet 
policy 
this is an obsolete archaic way of thinking said yakovlev 
a politburo member we would like to have a common european house 
based on freedom if someone interferes in that process we might 
go back to the time of the cold war we are standing at such a 
juncture 
west germanys zdf television network said wednesday as many as 
7000 east germans were expected to return home because they had 
become disenchanted with life in the west the east german red 
cross has predicted 10000 could return

metropolitan fiber systems inc announced 
wednesday it has filed petitions with the justice department and 
federal communications commission to allow alternative 
telecommunications carriers to compete for local telephone access 
services 
this action is a logical extension of historical regulatory 
policy designed to generate competition in the telecommunications 
industry said anthony j pompliano president of mfs which is 
based in the chicago suburb of oakbrook terrace ill 
currently the regional bell and other operating companies 
provide local phone access for all longdistance carriers nearly 
50 cents of every dollar spent on longdistance services goes to 
the bell companies for access fees totaling about 20 billion a 
year 
pompliano said his company was asking the justice department 
to enforce the modified final judgment to require that local 
access be unbundled to the fullest extent possible to permit 
fair and equitable competition 
also he said we are asking the fcc to mandate that 
alternative local telecommunications carriers can costeffectively 
interconnect and locate equipment at bell facilities 
that means mfs and similar alternative carriers can install 
their equipment in bellowned switch sites and hook up to the user 
community via the bell network pompliano said 
commenting on the announcement a gray collins bell atlantic 
senior vice president for external affairs said metropolitan 
fiber is free to use bell atlantics services any way it wants and 
it is free to connect its own network with bell atlantics 
metropolitan fiber however is demanding more than this it 
is demanding collocation which is in effect the ability to set 
up their shop in our store bell atlantic has no legal obligation 
to do this but it has agreed to meet a number of metropolitans 
requests collins said 
bill mccloskey a spokesman for bellsouth said about the mfs 
action these petitions appear to propose more confusion in the 
telephone industry they do not appear to offer any new services 
that residential customers might use but instead appear 
designed to benefit only highvolume users of specialized 
business services 
bob jasinski public relations manager for nynex commented 
the announcement by metropolitan fiber systems simply confirms 
the fact that theres growing competition in the telecommunications 
markets served by the regional holding companies 
he added that nynex stands ready to consider any reasonable 
requests for interconnection that will help ensure customer demands 
are met 
mfs currently operates fiber optic communication networks in 
chicago philadelphia baltimore boston minneapolis and san 
francisco with networks in los angeles and houston to be completed 
by the end of this year the company also is planning to construct 
networks in pittsburgh dallas new york and washington 
pompliano said the problem with having a single supplier 
exclusively control the local access business is that the lack of 
competition provides no incentive to be responsive to customer 
needs offer new services or lower rates 
if alternative local telecommunications carriers like mfs are 
allowed to offer access services technology will improve ahead of 
current projections and the rates for local access will drop the 
mfs chief said

the top federal highway official asked 
congress wednesday not to pass a bill that would compel states to 
suspend drivers licenses of convicted drug abusers 
federal highway administrator thomas d larson asked a senate 
subcommittee to defer action on the proposal until more is known 
about its legal implications 
the bill would withhold a portion of federal highway funds from 
states that do not pass such laws 
sen steve symms ridaho called the measure legalized 
blackmail and said it would unduly extend the reach of the 
federal government but symms later said he was keeping an open 
mind because of his support for the goals of the bill 
its chief sponsor sen frank l lautenberg dnj said the 
measure would discourage drug use particularly among young people 
and make highways safer 
driving is a privilege not a right lautenberg said and 
if a citizen chooses to engage in illegal drug behavior he or she 
should lose that privilege 
larson said about half the states already have laws that allow 
suspension or revokation of driving privileges upon conviction for 
a drug offense although most do not make such action mandatory 
he said a law that suspends a drivers license for sex offenses 
was thrown out by the illinois supreme court some states have had 
difficulty tracking down drivers to obtain their suspended 
licenses particularly in large urban areas larson said 
while we support the goals of the program larson said we 
believe that more time may be helpful to consider the many complex 
issues involved 
lt robert robbins a new jersey police officer speaking for the 
fraternal order of police said the group supports the bill but has 
reservations about its possible impact in states where the loss of 
federal funds might affect money going to police departments he 
said rules are needed to prevent this 
new jersey attorney general peter n perretti said state 
officials believe their law that suspends drivers licenses has 
discouraged drug use among youths and middleclass offenders 
suspension of a drivers license is the most effective 
deterent next to jail perretti told the subcommittee

and unite the protestantdominated province with the overwhelmingly 
roman catholic irish republic 
earlier several hundred protestant demonstrators marked the 
fourth anniversary of the signing of the angloirish agreement by

organizers had predicted a turnout of 300000 people 
i recognize that the imaginative scheme did not capture the 
imagination of the ulster people said an organizer the rev 
martin smyth a legislator in the british parliament 
organizers blamed the low turnout partly on the absence of two 
protestant leaders the rev ian paisley who is visiting australia

the new state law which takes effect on the american cancer 
societys great american smokeout 
as they kick smokers outside many of the hospitals are offering 
programs to employees who are inspired to quit

cabinet ministers made plans wednesday for

from iraq and an official said they leaving for economic reasons 
not because of maltreatment 
in baghdad president saddam hussein of iraq called a meeting of 
egyptian residents and complained about cairo newspaper reports 
that the workers were being mistreated 
he promised to investigate any complaints but discounted claims 
that many egyptians have been killed maliciously in iraq he said 
they died naturally or from violence in numbers understandable in a 
group of about 2 million people 
rumors circulated wednesday among diplomats in cairo that nabil 
najm the iraqi ambassador had received a death threat embassy 
spokesman daoud farhan denied the reports and said the ambassador 
was not in egypt 
ahmed radwan secretarygeneral of president hosni mubaraks 
cabinet said the ministers were told the main reason egyptians 
were returning was that new fiscal rules in iraq reduced the amount 
of money alien workers could send home 
he said ibrahim ouf egyptian ambassador in baghdad told the 
ministers a manpower surplus had resulted from iraqs 
demobilization after the truce agreement of august 1988 in the 
8yearold war with iran 
ouf said iraqi employers were dismissing egyptians and giving 
their jobs to former iraqi soldiers according to radwan 
the cabinet official did not address reports by the newspaper 
alakhbar that more than 100 egyptian corpses were returned from 
iraq in october compared to an average of two or three in other 
months 
he did say however that ouf told the ministers iraqi 
authorities were prepared to present complete files on egyptians 
who die in iraq 
alakhbar has reported that iraqi death certificates attributed 
most of the egyptian deaths to violent causes 
on wednesday it said five bodies of egyptian men aged 2340 
arrived at the cairo airport the day before with documents

winston lord a former us ambassador to 
china told congress on wednesday that china is making a great 
leap backward and said the united states should withold full 
cooperation until a new more democratic regime is in place in 
beijing 
lord told the senate foreign relations committee that it likely 
will take several years before china reverses the course it 
embarked upon when it brutally cracked down on prodemocracy 
demonstrators in beijings tianamen square 
until such a reversal he said we must both sustain our 
condemnation of beijings actions and preserve the framework for 
future cooperation when chinas big chill is lifted 
for us to resume full cooperation will require a new regime in 
beijing he said 
lord who was ambassaddor in beijing from november 1985 to last 
april said he had been reluctant to comment on chinas problems 
until the crackdown in june 
such inhibitions have been swept away as beijings leaders 
proceded from intransigence to massacre to executions to 
repression roundups purges disappearances harassment 
surveilance orwellian groupthink rollback of reforms and extreme 
xenophobia all cloaked in a particularly brazen display of the 
big lie he said 
since june the trends have been bleak indeed as china seems to 
be making a great leap backward to the 1950s and 1960s lord 
said 
in this period he said the loyalty of the united states 
should be to the chinese people and the chinese officials some 
deposed many still in office who deplore such policies and not 
to the handful responsible for crushing chinese spirits 
the united states should do nothing he said to break the web 
of relationships that have been built since the united states 
normalized relations with china 
we cannot rip out all of these roots that we have so carefully 
nutured he said we must preserve the foundations for the time 
when a more cooperative relationship with china is once again 
possible 
above all he said the united states must realize that the 
chinese are responsible for the current impasse and it is up to 
them to break it

university of california researchers said 
wednesday they have found that implanting genetically altered skin 
cells in the brains of rats can reduce symptoms of parkinsons 
disease 
the study was the first to report behavioral effects from 
genetically modified cells grafted onto the brain the scientists 
said 
the research does not portend a cure for parkinsons and is not 
ready for human testing but it may offer a possible alternative to 
fetal cell implants which have proved effective against the 
disease but which have become mired in political and ethical 
controversy they said 
we have to see if we can increase the effects weve seen 
which are not as significant as the effects observed when fetal 
cells are transplanted said fred gage a neuroscientist at the 
university in san diego 
in their study the scientists genetically altered skin cells of 
the rats to make them produce ldopa a chemical that is lacking in 
the brains of parkinsons disease patients 
when these cells were transplanted into the rats brains where 
lesions had been induced to cause neurological abonormalities 
mimicing parkinsons disease an average 40 percent reduction in 
abnormal behavior was seen gage said in a telephone interview 
the results of the study conducted by gage and colleagues at 
the university of california at san diego including dr theodore 
friedmann a pioneer in the development of genetically modified 
cells were to be published in the latest issue of proceedings of 
the national academy of sciences 
an estimated 400000 people in the united states suffer from 
parkinsons disease a nerve disorder characterized by trembling 
muscle rigidity and difficulty walking and balancing 
in the study the scientists monitored general motor impairment 
in the rats and specifically rotational behavior in which the rats 
walk in circles as a result of their neurological damage 
gage said that fetal cell implants can reverse this disability 
100 percent while the genetically altered skin cells were only 
partially successful 
as it stands right now its nowhere near as effective as 
fetal tissue gage said 
however this new approach offers a possible alternative 
considering the current limitations on fetal tissue research he 
said 
the bush administration earlier this month extended indefinitely 
a ban on federal financing of research in which human fetal tissue 
from induced abortions is transplanted into human patients 
gage said the technique studied represents a merging of two 
technologies transplantation and gene transfer to create 
genetically modified cells that produce chemicals secreted in the 
brain to restore behavioral function 
the researchers took skin cells from rats and inserted genes to 
produce an enzyme called tyrosine hydroxylase which serves as a 
catalyst to make the cell produce ldopa these ldopaproducing 
cells were then grafted into the brains of rats 
gage said that because the skin cells can be taken from the same 
rat into which the modified cells are implanted the chances of 
immunological rejection can be decreased also by its very 
nature this sidesteps the fetal tissue issue he said

and the national archives to sponsor a campaign commemorating the 
200th anniversary of the bill of rights 
philip morris has bought the exclusive rights to the 
constitution which we entrusted to the national archives for the 
modern equivalent of 30 pieces of silver or 600000 said rep 
thomas a luken in a statement announcing a congressional hearing 
on thursday 
the ohio democrat heads the house subcommittee on transportation 
and hazardous materials which has jurisdictin over advertising and 
the federal trade commission 
rep john conyers dmich asked the general accounting office 
the investigative arm of congress to look into the matter 
the health research group a consumer organization wrote sen 
jeff bingaman dnm last week asking congress to revoke the 
agreement bingaman has written don wilson the archivist of the 
united states questioning how and why the agreement was made 
the twoyear agreement signed in august makes philip morris 
companies inc the nations largest cigarette maker a part of 
the official national archives bicentennial celebration of the bill 
of rights 
in a memorandum of understanding philip morris agreed to 
donate 600000 to the archives trust fund in exchange for being 
allowed to publish or broadcast announcements and promotional 
materials commemorating the bicentennial and referring to the 
archives 
critics have questioned whether the broadcast announcements 
constitute cigarette advertisements on radio and television which 
was banned by the federal government in 1971 
the philip morris ads are running on television and do not 
contain any health warning and apparently are a fragrant violation 
of the law prohibiting such video commercials said luken 
guy l smith philip morris vice president of corporate 
affairs said he didnt believe the companys announcements 
violated the advertising ban since there is no cigarette called 
philip morris 
in the same week that the berlin wall is being torn down that 
people in this country are being criticized for celebrating the 
bill of rights is very strange smith added in a reference to 
recent events in east germany 
the company plans to continue the campaign and send a 
representative to testify at thursdays hearing he said 
critics also have questioned corporate sponsorship of archives 
programs 
sidney wolfe director of the health research group criticized 
the commercialization of space in the building which houses the 
symbols of our nation 
congress not only permitted the agency to accept taxexempt 
donations to its trust fund but also specifically encouraged it 
to do so in order to enhance its archival and outreach 
activities said susan cooper spokeswoman for the archives 
while this the first large corporate donation to the archives 
trust fund cooper said it is not the first cooperative effort 
with private industry 
in addition she said philip morris sponsorship of an exhibit 
in the archives building is no different than when other companies 
underwrote receptions to celebrate the bicentenial of the 
constitution or when philip morris itself sponsored exhibits at the 
national art gallery

the navys top safety officer on wednesday 
compared a twoday safety standdown to a timeout in an athletic 
contest called to review the game plan and get back to the 
basics 
the exercise is a useful tool said capt ferguson norton chief 
of the naval safety center the standdown ordered tuesday is the 
most widespread in memory he said 
it was ordered after a rash of 10 accidents in the last three 
weeks killed 10 people and injured 71 
all navy units will spend 48 of 72 hours this week reviewing 
procedures and training looking at the work environment and 
reminding all hands of safety measures according to the standdown 
ordered by secretary of the navy h lawrence garrett iii and adm 
carlisle ah trost chief of naval operations 
a timeout also can be called to halt the momentum of the 
opponent in this case the string of mishaps norton said at 
a news conference 
the safety center analyzes all navy accidents worldwide in an 
attempt to prevent further problems 
safety is the product of sound operating procedures and good 
training norton said 
we want to leave no stone unturned to ensure that safety is 
uppermost in the minds of all hands at all times said lt cmdr 
steve burnett a spokesman for the atlantic fleet 
norton said the navys record of safety has been steadily 
improving over recent years 
there were 118 major problems during operations in 1984 that 
figure has dropped to 69 so far this year according to navy 
figures 
however the number of fatalities for 1984 was 64 102 sailors 
have been killed so far this year including 47 in the april 19th 
gun turret explosion aboard the battleship uss iowa 
norton said the centers analysis found no clear links between 
accidents of the last three weeks he also said there was no 
indication that pentagon budget cuts had any effect on accidents 
were got a tough business were expected to be able to 
go tomorrow anywhere in the world and be an instrument of national 
policy thats what the government expects and thats what the 
american people expect norton said 
meanwhile personnel at the norfolk naval station spent the day 
preparing for the standdown 
most of the units did not find out about the standdown until 
late yesterday the 72hour window gives them time to plan the 
rotations and wind down any missions they are on burnett said 
burnett said atlantic fleet ships at sea will not be called home 
for the safety drill 
ships at sea will standdown at sea those on shore will do 
their standdown there 
the most serious of the recent accidents occurred oct 29 when a 
jet pilot making his first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed 
into the uss lexington in the gulf of mexico he pilot and four 
others were killed 
on monday the destroyer uss kinkaid and a freighter collided in 
the malacca strait killing one navy crewman injuring five and

thousands of colombian judges and court 
workers ended a twoweek strike wednesday after the government 
promised to increase security for judges threatened by drug 
traffickers 
justice minister roberto salazar said in a meeting with union 
representatives that beginning next week the government would 
start providing the judges with bulletproof vests armored cars and 
bodyguards a union representative said 
the strike by the national association of court workers involved 
about 5000 judges and 12000 court workers 
salazar also pledged that the offices of certain judges would be 
moved to government buildings offering more security said consuelo 
herrera a union board member 
some judges offices are located in extremely dangerous 
neighborhoods mrs herrera said these are the ones that will 
be moved 
she said the union was satisfied with the governments promises 
but that their quick implementation was vital to keeping the courts 
open 
if the government does not act quickly to put the measures in 
place the union will call another strike mrs herrera said in a 
telephone interview 
the judges say the measures are necessary to prevent the 
decimation of their ranks by drug traffickers retaliating for a 
government crackdown on the countrys cocaine cartels 
the latest strike began nov 2 one day after a federal judge 
was shot and killed in medellin the hub of colombias cocaine 
trade no one claimed responsibility for the killing but 
authorities have blamed traffickers 
three judges have been killed in the last three months all 
presumably by drug traffickers 
president virgilio barco declared war on traffickers after they 
assassinated a leading presidential candidate on aug 18 six 
colombian drug suspects have been extradited to the united states 
as part of the campaign 
a terrorist group linked to the medellin cartel has promised to 
kill 10 judges for every trafficker extradited 
the united states wednesday announced it had provided additional 
aid for colombias judges the us embassy in bogota said in a 
communique that it had delivered to the colombian government 300 
bulletproof vests 12 bulletresistant cars 12 metal detectors and 
500000 for the purchase of other security equipment 
another load of weapons munitions and security equipment for 
judges reportedly arrived in the capital aboard a hercules cargo 
plane sent from britain a british embassy spokeswoman mary de 
castello said the embassy could neither confirm nor deny a radio 
report of the donation 
judges returning to work must face a huge backlog of criminal 
cases made even bigger by the twoweek strike before the strike 
ended prison officials had begun to release some prisoners because 
they could no longer detain them without setting a trial date 
the government has also promised to review possible salary 
increases for the judges who currently make about 400 a month

a noncommunist cambodian rebel leader 
said wednesday the men who led the brutal khmer rouge government 
more than a decade ago should accept exile in china to quiet fears 
that they will return to power 
son sann whose guerrillas are technically allied with the khmer 
rouge addressed a news conference on the first day of the annual 
general assembly debate on cambodia 
i invite pol pot and all other khmer rouge leaders who 
committed great crimes to prepare for their future in a pagoda in 
china he said 
he referred to reports that china embarrassed by pol pots 
record would offer him and his colleagues refuge thus eliminating 
a major obstacle to a cambodian settlement 
if you disarm and khmer rouge and all parties and let people 
vote they are not going to vote for the khmer rouge son sann 
told the reporters 
pol pot led the khmer rouge government that took over cambodia 
in april 1975 and killed or starved hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians before it was ousted by the vietnamese invasion of 
december 1978 the khmer rouge now is the strongest fighting force 
in the alliance of three guerrilla groups 
addressing the general assembly on behalf of prince norodom 
sihanouk the former cambodian ruler who leads the alliance son 
sann accused vietnam of trying to divert attention from what the 
rebels claim is its continued presence in cambodia by focusing on 
the khmer rouge threat 
vietnam says all its soldiers were withdrawn from cambodia by 
the end of september but the guerrilla alliance claims more than 1 
million remain disguised as cambodian troops and settlers 
son sann denounced hanoi for rejecting un supervision and 
verification of the withdrawal 
in order to divert the international community from the 
subterfuge of total withdrawal vietnam continues to brandish the 
threat of the return of the khmer rouge to power he said 
it keeps rejecting all effective and impartial measures to 
control its socalled total withdrawal and maintaining at all cost 
the regime it has installed in phnom penh 
he suggested a un presence in cambodia for five to 10 years to 
help safeguard civil rights verify disarmament of the fighting 
groups and make sure the khmer rouge did not return to power 
vietnamese ambassador trinh xuan lang said the two major issues 
in cambodia were vietnamese withdrawal and keeping the khmer rouge 
out of power 
all the vietnamese were gone he declared and the remaining 
key issue is the need to prevent the pol pot clique from waging 
civil war and reestablishing their genocidal regime in cambodia 
this is the 11th annual general assembly debate since the 
vietnamese invasion members are expected to give overwhelming 
approval to a resolution for a comprehensive political settlement 
and un validation of the vietnamese withdrawal 
the united nations recognizes the resistance alliance as 
cambodias legitimate government

the general assembly on wednesday passed 
an unprecedented joint ussoviet resolution urging nations to 
settle conflicts peacefully and respect human rights 
although the resolution passed unanimously japan and brazil 
expressed unease over whether the superpowers might use their new 
spirit of cooperation to stifle debate on issues not high on their 
agenda 
japans ambassador hideo kagami said any part of this 
resolution must not be interpreted to justify undue politicization 
of issues of the united nations under the name of peace and 
security 
brazils ambassador paulo nogueirabatista pointed out that the 
resolution stressed the role of the security council and general 
assembly but failed to mention the economic and social council 
which sets policy on social matters such as the environment aids 
and the antidrug fight 
brazil and japan both joined in the consensus on the resolution 
however 
the resolution urges all nations to obey the un charter and 
use un bodies to settle disputes but offers no specific 
proposals to end conflicts in central america afghanistan 
cambodia or elsewhere 
it calls on all nations to respect the principles of sovereign 
equality political independence and territorial integrity of 
states and nonintervention in foreign affairs 
it also calls on nations to refrain from the threat or use of 
force inconsistent with the charter which permits only 
selfdefense and to peacefully settle disputes 
nations should adhere to the principles of equal rights and 
selfdetermination of peoples respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms cooperation among states 
general assembly resolutions have no binding effect on nations 
but the superpowers have the ability to persuade their allies to 
resolve disputes peacefully when they wish 
earlier this month at a joint ussoviet news conference 
assistant secretary of state john bolton stressed that the 
resolution puts an end to the superpower rivalry that prevailed 
during the cold war years 
today it is an end to confrontation said his soviet 
counterpart vladimir petrovsky

president bush declared on wednesday that his 
summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev will not be a 
meeting to negotiate the future of europe 
only free and unfettered elections can satisfy the yearnings 
of free people bush told the aflcio he praised the labor 
movement for being the spark that ignited the fires of freedom in 
poland and elsewhere in eastern europe 
at malta i will work to advance the progress of reform and 
democracy he said everywhere you look in the world members 
of the aflcio are fighting to keep the door to freedom open for 
all 
bush saying let us join hands also used the occasion of 
solidarity leader lech walesas triumphant visit on wednesday to 
propose to the aflcio a parternship for progress to help 
poland restructure its economy 
steering clear of issues that have divided his administration 
and organized labor bush asserted that doors that the labor union 
helped to unlock throughout eastern europe cannot be locked 
again 
he also told the 141 millionmember federations biennial 
convention that he would discuss the importance of trade unions in 
building a free country in his dec 23 shipboard summit in 
malta with gorbachev 
bush asserted that he and gorbachev are not meeting to 
negotiate the future of europe the peoples of eastern europe are 
speaking their own minds about that future they are calling for 
democracy 
bushs comments came as gorbachev reaffirmed his opposition to 
german reunification and criticized westerners who suggested 
socialism had failed 
bush lavished warm praise on walesa who was present as the 
president spoke and who received enthusiastic applause when his 
presence was noted as labors son and democracys advocate 
the president told his audience you and i may have 
differences but he said there are times when the need for 
progress demands that we put differences aside where poland is 
concerend now is such a time 
the aflcio has been critical of bushs policies and those of 
his predecessor in fact former president reagan did not address 
the labor federation in his eight years in office 
bush was applauded during his speech but afterward chants of 
sign the bill sign the bill rang out throughout the standing 
audience labor is awaiting bushs decision on a bill to authorize 
a congressional investigation of the eightmonth eastern airlines 
strike and a large banner urging him to sign the eastern bill 
was displayed in the hall 
another bill one raising the minimum wage from 335 to 425 
an hour by april 1991 is also awaiting bushs signture 
however the fate o that legislation is not in doubt since the 
white house helped negotiate the final version with labor and 
congressional leaders 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said earlier in the day 
that bush would sign the minimum wage bill but that a time for the 
signing had not yet been decided 
even before bush took his term at the podium senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine called the presidents outspoken 
support of solidarity hypocritical claiming bush had worked to 
undermine the powers of us unions 
its ironic that so many who are willing to honor the 
solidarity union of poland are so hostile to the unions of 
america mitchell told 800 delegates and another several hundred 
guests at the convention 
however bushs praise of walesa who addressed the group the 
day before was enthusiastically received 
bush said he was calling on the labor movement the business 
community and government to look for ways to support a 
partnership for progress in polandlabor business and government 
can and should be partners and activisits for polands future 
bush did not spell out any specifics however he noted that he 
and walesa had discussed the importance of increased us 
investment in poland 
bush added that while he was pleased with tuesdays 
announcement of freedom of travel in czechoslovakia in that 
country where the tradition of democracy runs deep and in 
others freedom of travel is not enough 
change has a way of sweeping through like a fastmoving train 
no one and no government should stand in the way 
at the same time bush said that he had asked aflcio president 
lane kirkland who recently referred to the president as reagan 
lite to be part of a delegation that will go to poland nov 28 
dec 2 to help poland restructure its economy 
congress is nearing final approval of a package of about 800 
million in economic aid for poland and hungary steps that have the 
backing of the administration 
in accusing bush of trying to weaken us unions mitchell in 
particular cited bushs refusal to intervene and block the 
8monthsold eastern airlines strike bush has refused to use his 
power to name an emergency mediation board 
theyre all for labor unions as long as they are in poland or 
some other country anywhere but the united states mitchell said 
labor is awaiting word on whether bush will sign a measure 
calling for a congressional study of the eastern strike designed to 
produce recommendations for a settlement 
if he cant do that sign the bill i dont think labor can 
expect too much from him said susan bianchisand president of 
the association of flight attendants and newly elected member of 
the federations governing executive council i dont hold out 
hope that will sign it 
kirkland meanwhile was unanimously reelected to a sixthtwo 
year term thomas donahue was the unanimous choice to continue as 
the federations secretary

here is a summary of major provisions in the

the plan envisions top government pay scales increasing at least 
35 percent in the next 13 months 
house members federal judges and top executive branch officials 
would receive an initial 79 percent pay raise by jan 1 a catch 
up for two years without a costofliving adjustment or cola 
on jan 1 1991 the same officials would receive a 25 percent 
increase in pay on top of whatever governmentwide cola takes 
effect at that time at a minimum assuming no cola in 1991 the 
salary of rankandfile house members would go to 120700 
assuming a cola of about 3 percent salaries would be about 
124400 39 percent above current levels 
after that annual pay adjustments of up to 5 percent would be 
made automatically based on the governments index of 
privatesector wages and salaries 
the package would abolish the current federal pay commission 
which recommends top government salaries and replace it with a new 
11member citizens commission 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
house members officers and employees and other top executive 
and judicial officials would be barred from accepting honoraria or 
speaking fees beginning in 1991 for house members current rules 
limit such fees to 30 percent of salary for 1990 total 
permissible outside income for house members would be frozen at the 
1989 level 
once the ban takes effect payments for speeches which may be 
given to charity would have to be made directly to the charity and 
could not exceed 2000 and could not go to any charity from which 
the official or a relative receives a financial benefit however 
the house would not make public the name of the charity as it does 
now only the name of the donor 
income earned outside the house by members and top staff would 
be limited to 15 percent of congressional salary beginning in 1991 
officials could not receive directors fees legal fees or other

a year in gifts from anyone with a direct interest in 
legislation privately paid speaking trips would be limited to 
four days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the bipartisan house panel would be expanded from 12 to 14

president bush announced his support wednesday 
for a plan to raise salaries for house members and other top 
governmental officials by 35 percent or more while tightening 
ethics rules 
with the presidents endorsement democratic and republican 
house leaders formally unveiled their plan and said they expect it 
will pass easily in a vote thursday the senate is expected to vote 
on pay before thanksgiving maybe with a different level for itself 
the house package would depending on inflation raise its 
salaries by at least 35 percent and more likely 39 percent from 
89500 to an estimated 124400 in just over 13 months it could 
be more 
bush in a letter to the speaker of the house thomas s foley 
said 
issues such as the ban on congressional honoraria limits on 
gifts and travel increased financial disclosure restrictions on 
outside income conflict of interest rules and many other important 
reforms have been addressed 
in my view the bill would effect a tremendous change in the 
landscape of government ethics standards 
under the house plan raises would be given to top officials 
governmentwide except for the senate which was considering a 
separate ethics and pay package for itself 
the house package implements the pay raise in two stages on 
jan 1 members and the very highest paid officials such as 
federal judges and top executive branch officials would get a 79 
percent increase as a costofliving adjustment to make up for 
the two years in which they did not receive raises 
in 1991 another costofliving raise would take effect for 
members and the topmost officials under that adjustment which 
would be based on changes in the governments consumer price 
calculations members and high officials would get the same 
adjustment normally passed on to all federal workers 
the 124400 ultimate pay figure is based on an adjustment of 
about 3 percent 
also on jan 1 1991 an additional 25 percent raise would be 
put in place to accompany implementation of the heart of the ethics 
package a ban on lawmakers padding their income with speech 
honoraria and stricter limits on other outside income 
the inclusion of a costofliving increase in 1991 in addition 
to the 25 percent raise was disclosed by lawmakers for the first 
time on wednesday 
currently house members are allowed to keep honoraria up to 30 
percent of their income senators up to 40 percent the new rules 
would ban house members from accepting honoraria and limit other 
outside earned income to 15 percent of salary 
a house member would still be able to give a speech and have the 
host donate the money that would be paid to the member to a 
legitimate charity the destination of the payment would be kept 
secret by the house ethics committee 
if congress later votes to kill the 25 percent pay raise the 
ethics rules changes on outside income would automatically be 
rescinded costofliving raises would continue automatically after 
1991 but based on a government index of salary raises in the 
private sector 
other ethics changes in the bill include 
ending in 1993 the rule whereby house members elected before 
1980 can pocket their campaign treasuries when they retire from 
congress some members currently have more than 1 million stashed

tighten rules for accepting free travel and gifts from people 
other than immediate family 
several of the ethics changes were in response to the case of 
former speaker jim wright dtexas wright resigned last june 
rather than face charges that he accepted improper gifts and evaded 
limits on honoraria 
a 51 percent congressional pay raise with no attached ethics 
package was rejected earlier this year when wright was still 
speaker 
white house endorsement of the ethics package was delayed this 
week because c boyden gray the presidents counsel was not

congressional staff 
the differences were resolved early wednesday in a meeting 
between house republican leader robert michel rill and white 
house chief of staff john sununu

envisions a more modest pay package for senators perhaps providing 
only the costofliving adjustments and a more gradual elimination

a 10fold expansion of federal loan programs 
over the past 13 years now means the government has lent 
guaranteed or insured 5 trillion 20000 for every man woman 
and child in the country congressional auditors said wednesday 
the general accounting office said ultimate losses to the 
government would not reach that level 
while the government will undoubtedly not be required to 
provide financial assistance for its total exposure associated with 
these programs its continuing and growing exposure to losses 
cannot be ignored the gao said 
while huge losses already have manifested themselves in the farm 
credit bailout in 1987 and the savings and loan rescue this year 
the government is experiencing billions of dollars in losses from 
other credit and insurance programs as well the general accounting 
office said 
altogether the wide variety of loan guarantee programs has 
increased by 51 percent over the past five years to 550 billion 
but annual defaults on those guarantees have jumped 138 percent 
from 47 billion in 1983 to 112 billion last year the gao said 
the real situation could be worse gao cautioned for example 
just two months ago gao auditors found 42 billion in federal 
housing administration fha loan defaults in 1988 five times what 
the agency reported 
the full magnitude of the governments losses under its credit 
assistance and insurance programs is not known the gao said 
because of longstanding deficiencies in financial managements 
and inconsistencies in the application of accounting principles by 
federal agencies losses are not always being recorded or reported 
when they occur 
from 1985 to 1988 losses on direct loans written off by the 
government increased 1700 percent from 12 billion to 212 
billion and delinquent loans rose by 33 percent from 146 
billion to 195 billion last year 
but the loan guarantees adopted by the reagan administration as 
part of an effort to reduce direct government lending and the 
federal deficit pose even greater risks the gao said 
many newer guarantee programs such as those for education and 
energy conservation involve loans with little or no marketable 
property as security the auditors said 
others such as those for small businesses which cannot obtain 
credit in the private market otherwise can quickly turn sour upon 
industry downturns and other changes in the economy the auditors 
said 
as one example the gao cited the department of educations 
student loan guarantee program which has grown in size from 265 
billion in 1983 to 476 billion last year during that same time 
reported defaults on student loans have almost tripled from 486 
million in 1983 to more than 14 billion in 1988 
in addition to the outstanding 222 billion in direct federal 
loans and 550 billion in loan guarantees the government also is 
liable for 36 trillion in insurance commitments most of it 
covering deposits in banks sampls and credit unions outstanding 
loans by governmentsponsored enterprises such as the federal 
national mortgage association or fannie mae and the federal home 
loan mortgage corp freddie mac total 656 billion up from 15 
billion in 1965 
rep john dingell dmich who requested the study as chairman 
of the house energy and commerce commission said it indicates that 
the government is guilty of the same shell game that critics of 
banks contend is being used to inflate beyond their true value 
their loans to third world countries 
dingell did not question the value of the programs saying many 
of served worthy purposes such as enabling people to attend 
college buy homes and start businesses 
whats at issue he said is the publics exposure in the 
event of losses or defaults

the battle of san salvador 
tilted in the governments favor wednesday as troops drove 
guerrillas from workingclass neighborhoods in fierce combat while 
civilians fled or cowered in their homes 
but the insurgents in the fifth day of their most ambitious 
offensive in nearly nine years demonstrated remarkable staying 
power in other neighborhoods repelling repeated army assaults or 
regrouping after setbacks to strike again 
even so the armed forces air power and numerical superiority 
combined with a lack of insurrectional spirit in most workingclass 
neighborhoods to stall the massive guerrilla push 
what we have at the moment is complete control over the entire 
national territory and the terrorist delinquents have failed in 
their adventure said vice president francisco merino 
his claim made at a news conference appeared somewhat 
exaggerated as the insurgents were thoroughly entrenched in several 
zones in and around the capital and in the countryside 
also wednesday the government which on sunday decreed a state 
of siege suspending most constitutional guarantees tightened 
limits on freedom of expression with a directive sent to all local 
media 
the directive prohibits salvadoran media from publishing any 
farabundo marti national liberation front fmln communique or 
those of any group intending to disseminate fmln activities 
it also prohibits publication of information from foreign 
agencies or countries that maintain a clear opposition to the 
salvadoran government and people 
the directive too obliges local editors to consult with the 
official source on any warrelated news 
casualty figures from the fighting were inexact but surveys of 
hospitals and a tally based on several sources indicated more than 
500 people including civilians guerrillas and soldiers have 
been killed and more than 1000 wounded 
several hundred rebels including two top commanders were dug 
in at the northern capital district of mejicanos the scene in 
mejicanos differed from that of soyapango and zacamil other 
guerrilla strongholds in recent days in that most mejicanos 
residents have stayed on in their homes and many appear to be 
decidedly aligned with the rebels 
most of the civilians in soyapango and zacamil had fled the 
combat zones by wednesday afternoon 
helping los muchachos the boys makes us happy said an 
elderly man outside the local clinic it would be better to die 
struggling than let the sob soldiers kill us with impunity 
his words were punctuated by a ussupplied c47 warplane 
flying directly above and firing hollowsounding bursts from its 
50caliber machine guns at rebel positions 
the neighborhoods combative spirit was evident residents 
carried pots of soup from their homes to rebels seated on the 
clinic patio young men asked for and received instruction in the 
use of the rebels assault rifles barricades blocked roads and 
tracks 
facundo guardado a top fmln commander said the offensive had 
one of two objectives to oblige the government to negotiate 
seriously and responsibly or failing that to topple the 
rightist administration of president alfredo cristiani 
in geneva the international red cross called on both sides to 
arrange a ceasefire for the urgent evacuation of wounded 
merino characterized the idea of a truce as impractical and 
speculated that the rebels might take tactical advantage of such a 
measure 
residents of some of the workingclass neighborhoods north and 
east of this capital where fighting has been the heaviest began 
burning partially decomposed bodies in the streets 
rebels opened a new front in merliot on the capitals western 
outskirts they blocked the highway into the capital and 
established positions over several blocks 
but government forces counterattacked strongly with rocket and 
machine gunequipped helicopters heavy caliber strafing from c47 
warplanes and hundreds of troops 
the rebels were pushed out after two hours of combat but they 
regrouped on the lower slopes of the looming san salvador volcano 
and shortly before dusk struck back at government positions in 
merliot heavy fighting continued there at nightfall 
heavy combat also broke out shortly before dusk in zacamil on 
the capitals northern outskirts comunidad emanuel a small 
shantytown was set ablaze and a pillar of smoke from it rose over 
the northern zone 
ten rebels looking tired and anxious were confined to a rear 
alley of the conacaste section of soyapango their commander a 
tall lean man missing part of his left hand said they had run out 
of food 
juan alberto ponce a 30yearold construction worker said 
wednesday he had been trying to reach alley 4 where his family was 
holed up for three days without success 
heavy fire from assault rifles 30caliber machine guns and 
rocketpropelled grenades echoed deafeningly through the narrow 
alleys of onefloor cinderblock homes gunsmoke was so thick it 
reduced visibility to 15 feet 
residents evacuated two wounded civilians one a middleaged 
woman with her jaw blown off on improvised stretchers 
in zacamil only a few civilian familiesremained in the 
apartment blocks 
adriana garcia huddled in apartment 43 of block 111a with her 
family and maria zubarria 45 who has cancer and is two days past 
due for her cobalt treatment mrs zubarrias face forearms and 
ankles were swollen because of the delay 
please help get us out mrs garcia implored she said she 
felt herself a virtual hostage of the guerrillas 
we serve as their protection she said echoing the 
governments contention that the rebels were shielding themselves 
behind civilians 
rebel commander ana guadalupe martinez speaking on the 
insurgents clandestine radio venceremos said the guerrillas had 
declared more than a quarter of the massachusettssized country 
liberated 
she said local revolutionary committees had been set up in 
dozens of towns 
in the provinces conflicting claims by government and 
guerrillas were impossible to confirm but radio correspondents 
prohibited from broadcasting news by the state of siege said 
fighting continued in and around the provincial capitals of san 
miguel santa ana and zacatecoluca 
a 10yearold civil war between the fmln and a succession of 
usbacked governments has killed about 70000 people most of 
them civilians

securities and exchange commission chairman 
richard c breeden said wednesday that he supports pending new 
market regulation legislation even though it doesnt ban program 
trading 
breeden told a group of reporters at sec headquarters that the 
controversial computerdriven trading strategy is only a symptom 
of bigger market problems 
i think we need a close look at the whole issue of volatility 
and the factors that help produce it and the elements that may be 
at work id like to make sure that before we treat only the 
symptom that we also are aware of what the disease is he said 
critics of program trading in which enormous blocks of stocks 
are bought or sold in a wink of an eye through computerdriven 
entry of buy and sell orders say it can lead to excessive 
volatility sharp price rises and drops which in turn scares 
small investors out of the market 
and that say the critics makes it hard for us companies to 
sell securities and raise capital 
breeden said he supported recently amended legislation pending 
before the house energy and commerce committee that would allow the 
sec to curtail trading practices found to be manipulative or 
abusive 
i dont think it gives us the authority to ban program trading 
per se breeden said of the securities markets stabilization act 
of 1989 the thrust of this section is not to ban program trading 
as one practice in the marketplace but what it does allow us to do 
is to specify specific harmful practices including those 
associated with program trading 
if the bill was passed said breeden the sec could then 
define rules that would bar specific practices that we deem to be 
harmful and contributing to excessive volatility and those 
practices could include program trading 
originally the bill would have allowed the sec to intervene when 
it considered trading practices to be disruptive but members 
of the telecommunications and finance subcomitee argued that the 
word was too vague 
in a letter to the subcommittee robert r glauber an 
undersecretary of the treasury argued the word is itself 
disruptive 
glauber wrote that it could derail the chances for final 
passage of other important provisions included in this 
legislation 
the bill must be passed by the energy and commerce committee 
before going to the house floor congressional leaders have said 
they want to adjourn for the holidays next week 
a similar bill is slated to be considered by the seanate banking 
committee thursday

ohio plans to challenge a state appeals court 
decision wednesday that threw out criminal convictions of 
principals of home state savings bank whose collapse triggered a 
statewide thrift crisis in 1985 
lawyers for the state said they will carry their fight to the 
ohio supreme court against the ruling that reversed convictions of 
former home state owner marvin warnerr a millionaire and former us ambassador 
to switzerland 
and schiebel were convicted by a hamilton county common pleas court 
jury on charges resulting from the cincinnatibased thrifts 
collapse in march 1985 
both warner and schiebel have been free on bond while appealing 
their march 1987 convictions warner 70 had been sentenced to 3 
years in prison schiebel 58 was sentenced to six months 
warner said wednesday from his ocala fla horse farm that his 
reputation is still at stake 
i feel sort of like ray donovan donovan was found not guilty 
and he asked which office do i go to to get my reputation back 
thats about the situation im in he said referring to former 
reagan administration labor secretary who was cleared by a new york 
jury in may 1987 of fraud and larceny charges 
schiebel said i always knew id be vindicated 
a threejudge panel of the 1st ohio district court of appeals 
reversed the convictions on three securities counts charging the 
two men covered up home states precarious finances in circulars 
distributed to raise money for home state in 1984 that portion of 
the case was sent back to the lower court for a possible new trial 
home states collapse caused a crisis for 69 other privately 
insured ohio savings and loans institutions whose deposits were 
insured by the ohio deposit guarantee fund 
the appeals court upheld defense arguments challenging the 
seating of trial juror beth statt who had an account at another 
bank insured by the ohio deposit guarantee fund 
the appeals court also dimissed warners conviction on six 
counts that he oversaw unauthorized transfers of home state money 
to a trading partner esm government securities inc of fort 
lauderdale fla the court said the state did not present 
sufficient evidence 
r stan mortenson a lawyer for warner said warner cannot be 
retried on those counts 
home state collapsed four days after esm was declared insolvent 
the thrift lost 144 million through its securities transactions 
with esm 
the appellate court also threw out the lower courts order that 
warner pay 22 million in restitution to ohio and 250000 in 
prosecution costs and that schiebel pay 25000 in prosecution 
costs 
the court said the cost and restitution penalties were based on 
a statement of fees submitted by the state that had not been 
certified as correct and legal 
lawrence a kane jr ohios special prosecutor who obtained the 
convictions said the state will appeal 
the courts decision is based on technical procedural issues 
not the merits of the guilt or innocence of the defendants kane 
said 
before it collapsed home state had about 14 billion in assets 
and served about 92000 depositors in the cincinnati columbus and 
dayton areas 
the savings bank was sold and reopened in june 1985 gov 
richard celeste temporarily closed the other thrifts and ordered 
them to obtain federal deposit insurance or merge with companies

turned in his party card and resigned from the communist caucus in 
the legislature state television reported wednesday 
a report on the evening news said the deputy zdzislaw 
czernobilski had informed caucus leader marian orzechowski of his 
resignation in a letter 
czernobilski did not give any explanation in the letter why he 
was quitting the party but thanked his colleagues for their past 
cooperation the report said 
it is the latest setback for the beleaguered communist party 
which became the first in the east bloc to lose control of the 
government on aug 24 when former solidarity editor tadeusz

city of lodz 
thousands of party members turned in their cards after the

expected before a party congress scheduled for january

a scene in a parisian tavern that pablo picasso 
painted when he was 25 in exchange for free meals and drinks sold 
for 407 million at auction wednesday 
the 1905 painting au lapin agile in which picasso depicts 
himself as a harlequin is the most important 20thcentury 
picture to come up for auction said john l marion chairman of 
sothebys north america 
it goes to the annenberg collection marion said as he 
hammered down the sale southebys had predicted the work would 
fetch 35 million to 40 million 
the auction house said the painting will go to the private 
collection of walter annenberg of rancho mirage calif the 
philanthropist and former owner of tv guide magazine a close 
friend of former president reagan 
the painting was consigned by linda de roulet daughter of art 
collector joan whitney payson who acquired it in 1952 and hung it 
in her manhasset home mrs de roulet said in a statement she felt 
au lapin agile has become too valuable a painting to keep 
i plan to establish a foundation for medical research and 
education with part of the proceeds she added 
au lapin agile was painted four years after another famous 
selfportrait yo picasso which sold for 4785 million at 
sothebys in may that was a record for the artist and more than 
double its presale estimate 
the record for any work of art 539 million was set in 1987 
for vincent van goghs irises also from the payson collection 
several other paintings were on the block wednesday 
picassos the mirror one of a series of portraits of 
sleeping women done in 1932 was expected to bring up to 25 
million 
mere et enfant which dates from 1921 the year of the 
birth of picassos son is estimated at up to 15 million 
a renoir pastel young girls at the piano produced in 1892 
on a commission from the french government did not sell wednesday 
it had been expected to bring up to 30 million 
van goghs quarry near saintremy a landscape painted in 
1889 was estimated to bring up to 15 million 
major pieces by piet mondrian picasso paul klee willem de 
kooning claude monet and joan miro were being auctioned from the 
collection of the late edgar kaufmann jr the 21 pieces were 
expected to bring between 30 million and 40 million 
diane brooks sothebys president described au lapin agile 
as a large powerful serious painting one of the most important 
of picassos rose period 
in addition she said the subject has a story behind it 
done when he was 25 the painting shows picasso and a woman 
model germaine pichot standing at a bar brooding and obviously 
disenchanted with one another 
picasso blamed pichot as being the cause of his best friends 
suicide four years earlier 
the big question in the picture is whether or not at the time 
it was painted picasso was actually having an affair with this 
woman himself brooks said 
in the background is frederic gerard the owner of the tavern 
lapin agile sprightly rabbit and the paintings first owner a 
photograph from the period shows the painting hanging unframed in 
the bar

solidarity leader lech walesa saluted on his 
historic visit to congress with cheers whistles and four standing 
ovations declared wednesday that american aid to poland will not 
be wasted and will never be forgotten 
in an interview with the associated press a few hours later 
walesa said i am an optimist that the economic assistance 
promised by congress and president bush will enable the first 
noncommunist government in the soviet bloc to survive 
i think we will have enough time he said 
walesa made his remarks on a day in which bush hailed him as 
americas special guest he was treated exactly that way from 
his historic appearance before a joint session of congress in the 
morning to a private meeting with secretary of state james a baker 
iii in the afternoon and a dinner back in the capitol at the end of 
the day 
walesa left that dinner early saying that he was exhausted 
in his speech before congress he asked for more investment to 
help pull a bankrupt polish economy from the verge of utter 
catastrophe and said such assistance in peacetime is better 
than tanks warships and warplanes 
in an emotional speech recounting the nineyear struggle of his 
union to form a democratic government walesa gave thanks to 
congress and the american people for years of support and words of 
admiration 
these are appreciated but being a worker and a man of 
concrete work i must tell you that the supply of words on the 
world market is plentiful but the demand is falling let deeds 
follow words now said the mustachioed 46yearold former 
shipyard electrician 
in the interview he said he was uncomfortable when asked 
whether bush was doing too little to aid poland as charged by 
congressional democrats 
i lech walesa chairman of soldarity am happy glad with 
what president bush is doing now i am grateful for what he is 
doing and for his assistance in our reforms walesa said i can 
say in unequivocal terms he is a friend of soldarity 
but walesa said bush was very careful he is checking what he 
can do and first all his responsibility is to this country and 
nobody can have anything against that 
walesa who wraps up his visit to washington on thursday also 
made a joint appearance at the aflcio convention with bush who 
hailed him as americas special guest and promised more aid for 
poland 
clearly there are times when the need for progress demands 
that we put differences aside and where poland is concerned now 
is such a time bush said 
today i appeal to the unions and on the american labor 
movement the business community and government to look for ways 
to support a partnership for progress in poland for the sake of a 
nation and a people that need and deserve our help he said 
walesa addressing a joint meeting of congress drew resounding 
applause when he said that assistance extended to democracy and 
freedom in poland and all of eastern europe is the best investment 
in the future of peace better than tanks warships and warplanes 
an investment leading to greater security 
walesa arrived in washington on monday for a fourday visit 
marked by numerous awards and a torrent of praise as poland and 
other east european nations rapidly institute democratic and market 
reforms 
in more concrete action the senate voted tuesday to authorize 
657 million in economic aid to poland over three years and 81 
million for nearby hungary also dismantling its centrally 
controlled economy 
the house went further approving an initial oneyear 
installment of 533 million for the two soviet bloc nations 
the decision by the congress of the united states about 
granting economic aid to poland opens a new road walesa said 
for this wonderful decision i thank you warmly i promise that 
this aid will not be wasted and will never be forgotten 
the steps to send economic aid to poland have been accompanied 
by personal adulation for walesa he received the presidential 
medal of freedom from president bush on monday an aflcio human 
rights award on tuesday and on wednesday became the second foreign 
private citizen to address a joint meeting of congress the first 
since the marquis de lafayette in 1824 
the house chamber was packed with senators representatives 
members of bushs cabinet staff members journalists and even the 
soviet ambassador to washington yuri dubinin who carefully read 
walesas prepared text and applauded the delivery 
vice president dan quayle and house speaker thomas s foley were 
on the dais and the joint chiefs of staff and other dignitaries 
sat to one side 
walesa entered the chamber at 1104 est and received a 
fiveminute standing ovation punctuated by a few whoops and 
whistles as he flashed his trademark v for victory sign his 
remarks were translated by jacek kalabinski an emigre solidarity 
activist who was once accused of treason by the former communist 
government 
walesa clearly relished his warm welcome as a representative of 
polish democracy before congress which for many people in the 
world oppressed and stripped of their rights is a beacon of 
freedom and a bulwark of human rights 
he began his remarks with the opening words of the preamble to 
the us constitution we the people 
i do not need to explain that i an electrician from gdansk 
am also entitled to invoke them said walesa 
walesa said solidaritys success was attracting imitators 
throughout the communist world and inside the soviet union itself 
among hungarians russians the ukrainians people of the baltic 
republics armenians and georgians and in recent days the east 
germans 
we wish them luck and rejoice at each success they achieve 
he said 
walesa praised soviet reforms and said our task is viewed 
with understanding by our eastern neighbors and their leader 
mikhail gorbachev 
this understanding lays foundations for new relation

congress rushed a temporary spending bill to 
the white house on wednesday to keep government agencies from 
shutting down and falling victim to congress inability to finish 
its budget business on time

which later adopted the measure on a voice vote president bush was 
expected to sign the bill

which began oct 1 
so far five of the bills have been signed into law two have 
been vetoed by bush four are on the presidents desk awaiting his 
signature and congress is working on two others

rocks up a hill only to have those rocks roll back said rep 
silvio conte rmass ranking republican on the house 
appropriations committee 
congressional leaders hope to have finished work on all 13 
spending bills by monday if not yet another stopgap measure will 
be needed lawmakers hope to complete their work for the year by 
wednesday and adjourn until january 
the legislation is the third time in the last two months that 
congress has had to extend temporary spending authority lawmakers 
passed one measure sept 28 providing stopgap funds through oct 
25 and a second on oct 25 that measure expired wednesday

wilbert rideau and billy wayne sinclair 
convicted murderers with a bent for writing won fame in the late 
1970s and early 80s with articles in the louisiana state 
penitentiary magazine the angolite 
the writings that concerns them today include legal briefs filed 
in sinclairs 100000 federal lawsuit against rideau accusing him 
of plagiarism in a book he edited and of trying to damage 
sinclairs journalistic reputation 
everything in this book was done properly said rideau who 
still is editor of the angolite i didnt claim to write anything 
i didnt 
neither i nor anyone else has tried to damage billys 
journalistic reputation he did that to himself back in 1986 when 
he became an undercover agent for the fbi while he was working as a 
journalist 
sinclair 44 now jailed at the state police barracks in baton 
rouge said the lawsuit was a last resort the only thing i want 
is for the credit for my work to be protected and for wilbert 
rideau not to claim the things i did 
nobody putting together a book using that many articles from 
the angolite could help but assume some of them were mine 
sinclairs death sentence for a 1965 murder during a bungled 
holdup was commuted to life in prison after the us supreme court 
threw out louisianas death penalty law he left the angolite in 
1986 after going to the fbi when he was approached by a prison 
employee who tried to sell him a pardon in the ensuing scandals 
the head of the pardon board was sent to prison 
i had three choices sinclair said i could accept it 
ignore it or report it to officials if i had tried to report it 
within the system i would have been dead in 30 days if i had tried 
to report it as a journalist they would have tried to discredit 
what i did or lock me up 
after he cooperated in the investigation he was transferred out 
of angola for his safety he received a clemency recommendation 
from the state pardon board but gov buddy roemer taking a hard 
line on crime rejected it 
rideau 47 has been at angola since he was condemned to die for 
a 1961 bank robbery in which he killed a teller by slitting her 
throat his sentence was also commuted to life when the death 
penalty was thrown out 
sinclairs lawsuit centers on a university of southwestern 
louisiana text the wall is strong corrections in louisiana 
that rideau edited with burk foster a professor and another 
angolite editor ron wikberg the textbook is a compilation of 
newspaper and magazine articles and papers by the schools center 
for criminal justice research about half is from the angolite 
sinclair contends that four of the articles should have carried 
his byline 
rideau acknowledged that one should have 
he won the george polk award the silver gavel award from the 
american bar association in 1980 for a prison tragedy leaving 
his name off it was an innocent mistake hell my name was left off 
sexual jungle which i won the george polk award for there are a 
lot of mistakes in the book we had to put it together by phone and 
letters its not like we could take off and go to the printers 
every time we needed to 
no matter who wrote them rideau said ownership may belong to 
the state 
were prisoners we were sent to prison to work and to suffer 
billy was sentenced to hard labor he got a break and was sent to 
the angolite but he was paid for that work just as if he had gone 
anywhere else can the guy who makes license plates claim theyre 
his can the prisoner who picks cotton go to the warden and tell 
him how to use that cotton 
the book is sold only at the university bookstore at 2695 it 
is not expected to make more than a few hundred dollars foster 
said even if it does make a profit the money will go to the 
school 
rideau said he gets nothing from it but satisfaction tainted 
now by the suit he said reflects sinclairs bitterness at being out 
of the limelight 
meanwhile the angolite which was a finalist for the columbia 
school of journalism 1989 national magazine award and along with 
barrons received the american bar association award for 
journalism has rebuilt its credibility he said i have no war 
with billy and i dont want one i understand there has always been 
a certain resentment and jealousy on his part its sad when trying 
to be like someone turns to envy 
sinclair said he has no reason for envy just worry about his 
work 
we were very close at one time what wilbert did for me when i 
was in jail was brought to the attention of a lot of people and im 
very grateful this has never been a personal vendetta on my part 
hes the one that made it a vendetta when i read that book 
though i realized the only way i can protect my work is to go to 
court

jeanne sharp whose ancestors lived and 
farmed in this rural new york community before the american 
revolution is learning a hard lesson about rebellion governments 
often fight back 
sharp and more than 300 other residents who filed a lawsuit 
trying to block construction of a garbage incinerator are in turn 
being sued by lawmakers 
ive been thinking a lot about ethan allen said sharp i 
have some idea of what my ancestors went through to get here 
if they can put up with it so can i 
residents sued washington county and adjoining warren county 
last year over the proposed incinerator which is to be built in 
hudson falls about 40 miles north of albany to burn garbage for 
both counties they contend that local officials approved the plan 
without a proper public hearing 
the counties and their industrial development agency 
countersued seeking 15 million from 320 plaintiffs most of them 
washington county residents washington county later dropped out 
but warren county and the ida remain 
the residents recognizable around the area by the bright orange 
plaintiff bumper stickers affixed to their cars say the 
countersuit was filed to harass them into dropping their lawsuit 
environmentalists say it could have national implications for 
other citizen action groups that turn to the courts to challenge 
controversial projects the environmental movement even has a name 
for it a slapp suit or strategic lawsuit against public 
participation 
its a strategy to hush people up and stop them from speaking 
out said lois gibbs who led the fight over the love canal toxic 
dump in niagara falls and now runs the virginiabased citizens 
clearinghouse for hazardous waste 
this case stands out as the only one of its kind that i know 
of where government chooses to sue its own people said will 
collette citizens clearinghouses slapp suit expert 
other slapp suits which collete calls legal terrorism have 
been brought across the country by private companies involved in 
projects the idea is to squash the opposition 
people who bring slapp suits dont expect to win them he said 
they all get dropped they never go to trial warren county has 
no expectation of winning its case 
in washington county some supervisors told people they might 
lose their homes or cars as a result of the countersuit the 
plaintiffs claim 
theyre trying to harass us and intimidate us down to a 
handful of manageable troublemakers said melody brown who 
admits to being one of the more vocal incinerator opponents being 
sued 
the countersuit contends the citizens lawsuit was frivolous and 
that actions by the incinerator opponents during the sale of bonds 
for the project cost the counties 15 million 
at the original closing date for the bond sale there were 
committed purchasers as the result of the activities of the 
citizens those contracts were abrogated it was necessary to enter 
into new contracts and passage of time and a change in the market 
brought a 15 million loss said benjamin pratt a glens falls 
lawyer for the counties and ida that loss increased the cost of 
the project and with it the cost of burning garbage 
now the incinerator opponents want to add more litigation to the 
fray a federal civil rights lawsuit in response to the lawsuit 
against them theyve hired atlantabased civil rights lawyer 
robert remar 
the first amendment to the constitution gives all of us the 
right to freedom of speech freedom of association and the right to 
petition government for redress of grievances said remar when 
a government seeks to basically punish the citizens for having 
exercised those rights thats a violation of the constitution 
pratt said the counterclaim doesnt violate anyones civil 
rights 
they have the right to speak with respect to the proceedings 
and actions being taken by the government they have a right to sue 
their government if they feel that something is done improperly 
but they dont have the right to perform in such a fashion that 
they interfere with the contractual rights that the government has 
with third parties and cause a 15 million loss 
hammond robertson chairman of the warren county board of 
supervisors said he supports the counterclaim as has a majority 
of that board every time someone moves to drop it 
i have to recognize that people have some strong feelings on 
this issue said robertson but there are 110000 people in 
these two counties we have some obligation to the other 100000 
people 
while the lawsuits go on over the 80 million incinerator 
resolution isnt expected until some time next year excavation is 
nearing completion at the plant site next to the hudson river 
the main point of the original lawsuit whether there was a 
public hearing on the project is still in dispute while robertson 
said a hearing wasnt required pratt said the twocounty ida held 
one 
stephanie wenk another active incinerator opponent said the 
ida hearing lasted just 45 minutes and that everyone wasnt allowed 
to speak 
the public hearing was a sham said wenk who has been known 
to tie a gag over her mouth at supervisors meetings they let 11 
people speak out of 49 then they just banged the gavel and that 
was it

two elderly black men one an 
exile in france the other a faith healer from a tiny village are 
being heralded by south africas whitedominated art establishment 
as two of the countrys greatest artists 
by coincidence the first major retrospective exhibitions of 
gerard sekotos paintings and jackson hlungwanis sculptures are 
simultaneously on display this month in johannesburg critics have 
greeted both with superlative praise 
one reviewer described the hlungwani show as the most 
important sculpture exhibition yet held in south africa sekoto 
wrote another critic is one of the greatest figures of 
20thcentury south african art 
sekoto 75 lives in a home for retired artists outside paris 
and has not returned to south africa since going into selfimposed 
exile in 1947 his finest works critics agree are gentle scenes 
of black urban life painted in south africa in the eight years 
before he emigrated 
many of his paintings depict black and mixedrace innercity 
neighborhoods in cape town and johannesburg that later were razed 
by the government and reconstructed as whitesonly districts 
the exhibition of 138 of his works many of them loaned from 
private collections has drawn large crowds to the johannesburg art 
gallery the largest exhibition facility in the countrys largest 
city 
it has taken about as long for sekoto to attain public 
recognition in his own native country as it has for the 
johannesburg art gallery to wake up to the fact that whites can 
never carry the full weight of this countrys political economic 
and cultural selffulfillment said eskia mphahlele a friend of 
the painter and former professor of african literature at the 
university of the witwatersrand at the opening of the exhibition 
the new nation an antiapartheid newspaper said in its review 
that for decades sekoto was deprived of proper recognition 
because of the onesided focus which was placed on the work of 
white artists by galleries critics art historians and authorities 
blindfolded by apartheid 
hlungwani 66 is the son of a mineworker never had formal 
education has 12 children and lost a finger in an industrial 
accident when he worked as a laborer he says he decided to take up 
sculpting after experiencing a religious vision 
i do the work of god by carving he said in an interview 
earlier this year art comes from all my body 
most of his works are carved from wood found in the area around 
two improvised temples he has built in a village in gazankulu a 
black homeland near south africas northeastern border with 
mozambique his creations include angels crucifixes and many fish 
which he considers an important christian symbol 
more than 200 of his works are on display at a converted 
industrial warehouse in one of johannesburgs oldest districts 
his sculptures have transformed an ordinary old factory 
into a magical place of reverence wrote kendell geers a critic 
for the star the countrys largestselling daily the show 
certainly sets a standard for south african art for the future 
the new nation has devoted fullpage spreads to each of the 
shows 
its an exciting and joyful time for art lovers in 
johannesburg the newspaper said two current exhibitions both 
unforgettable are giving them the first comprehensive look at two 
of south africas greatest artists

still water runs deep for art garfunkel the 
high clear voice of simon and garfunkel and still water is 
the title of his new book of prose poems 
does it help to feel better about a painful memory by writing 
about it not really it doesnt have anything to do with it he 
said some of the 84 poems in the book concern the suicide of his 
girlfriend laurie bird in 1979 
it seems that the artists agenda is to be true to feelings 
and emotions fearlessly so that we can all recognize ourselves 
he said in an interview fearlessly is the key word 
we give ourselves a catharsis by recognizing the many colors 
of human nature including the darks my notion of such an artist 
is one who has the bravery to deal with the complexity of the human 
heart and psyche thats where im coming from to the best of my 
ability 
from 1983 through 1987 the poetry muse kept biting garfunkel 
then the pen dried up i know what the reason is in 1987 i 
started making the lefty album i was moving from the world of 
words to the world of music i guess i reorganized my creative 
impulses to a new direction 
garfunkels older brother jules urged him to take his poems to 
editor leslie wells who thought they should be a book which has 
been published by ep dutton 
the poems are in four categories thats how i look at them 
he said one is the spirit of traveling one is how i work 
poems 59 through 65 concern the animals christmas an album of 
songs by jimmy webb sung by garfunkel and amy grant in 1986 
one is philosophical speculations the fourth category is 
memory of laurie bird catharsis is a notion i find popular i 
dont know if i can connect with that had i never written about 
her would i have been more blocked i would have thought all these 
things my friends know how deeply i was affected by her when i 
loved her and when i lost her 
time makes things fade garfunkel said i love kim now 
the memory of laurie is mercifully fading it is giving me a break 
i have a chance to live life now when i wrote these in the 
mid80s is not really where im at now 
on sept 18 1988 garfunkel and kathryn kim cermak were 
married in the brooklyn botanical garden she had sung in the group 
lime worked as a model and currently is developing a solo show 
i had a real fear of marriage garfunkel said i was one 
of the real tough cases when it came to trust in that area only 
the great kathryn could have relaxed me on that with a lot of love 
and niceness 
im sure im the millionth person to fear the wonderful if 
something comes along that offers you a major increase in your 
life you say can i get back to you on this 
the day i said im going to marry kathryn was the day i 
clarified my life ive been so reclusive in the 80s ive 
been reclusive long enough 
that doesnt mean that hell start writing songs i once had 
seven or eight lines of a poem and i liked the way it laid i 
thought let me turn it into a song after two hours of laboring 
all the inspiration dried up 
but he may tour more 
in 1988 garfunkel toured with british musicians in england and 
japan this fall hes singing in europe im trying out a leaner 
musical line im going to try to work with one guitar and one 
piano often not playing at the same time on what i call the 
lessismore tour if i can be in really good voice let me clear 
out the backing so i can be heard in all my nuances 
in january hell do 12 shows in japan with a full band 
in the past he has done more recording than live concerts 
the studio has always been the fun for me youre working against 
your own perfectionism you can erase it till its right 
but ive cooled out when we simon and garfunkel were in 
junior high school we wanted a hit the desire to have a hit calms 
down after you have success 
garfunkel likes to travel 
i like to ventilate my intensity i want air elbow room and 
the sweep of nature as an antidote i like crossing the atlantic by 
ship after recordiing in a studio 
he also is walking across the united states a bit at a time he 
left his apartment one day crossed the george washington bridge 
walked for nine days and came home picking up later exactly where 
he left off in west virginia 
kim came along in west virginia and northern missouri i 
usually do it myself im now about 25 miles from lincoln neb 
he said 
i take the smallest paved roads i find in general human 
kindness goes up in the smaller areas in remote areas more people 
stop and offer a ride garfunkel always refuses 
he admits that his walk is the rich mans way to do it he 
goes with an assistant who rents a car when its dark the 
assistant picks garfunkel up and backtracks to the nearest motel 
garfunkel sent paul simon with whom relations have sometimes 
been strained a copy of his book simon said he liked it 
hes a man of integrity garfunkel said he could have 
avoided saying anything 
we went to a yankee game last summer kim sat between us it 
was really nice theres nothing like time it does its own sweet 
soothing thing

to a golfer a mulligan is a 
second chance an invitation to hit a bad shot over again and 
pretend the first one never happened golfing with republican 
governors vice president dan quayle said he didnt want one 
because mulligans are for democrats 
there are no mulligans in national politics where quayle might 
find one handy now and then in that arena any errant move is 
marked indelibly on the scorecard that means no mistakes go 
unpenalized especially for a political figure whose confidence and 
performance ratings are persistently low as quayles are 
that pressure doesnt let up one associate sees the stress on 
quayle as the vice president strives to boost his standing knowing 
that any slipup or misspoken word will be magnified into another 
dent in the image 
at the republican governors association conference this week 
even the praise pointed to the problem quayles friends were at 
pains to plug his performance and his potential as a national 
leader even when it didnt quite fit the moment 
gov carroll a campbell jr of south carolina introducing him 
at a casual sunday night reception said the vice president will 
make a very fine place in history republican national chairman 
lee atwater tossed into his remarks to the governors on monday the 
observation that quayle is doing a very fine job and could not 
have more confidence and support from the president 
in such situations some republicans are protesting too much 
after all quayle has solid backing where it really counts 
president bush has said flatly that quayle will be his 1992 running 
mate that gives the vice president seven years to do his job and 
enhance his standing 
in the changeable world of politics that is a very long time 
half again as long as quayles entire political career to date 
even though the adverse polls clearly sting quayle is up to a 
joke about his political standing 
a year and one week ago president george bush rode to victory 
on my coattails he told the governors 
he spoke of his wifes interest in disaster relief efforts 
marilyn has a lot of experience in disaster preparedness 
shes lived with me for 17 years 
but the banter isnt always easy in the face of public opinion 
surveys indicating that a majority of americans do not think quayle 
qualified to succeed to the presidency which is a vice presidents 
one crucial role and that nearly half think he should be replaced 
on the 1992 republican ticket 
president bush has said that will not happen making the 
commitment publicly hes doing a very good job an oustanding 
job exactly what i want him to do bush said in an interview 
with the dallas morning news early this month 
the vice president says unfavorable polls will not affect the 
way he does his job 
im not going to do anything differently no matter what the 
polls say quayle said monday in an interview with a group of 
reporters im going to work as i believe a vice president should 
work that is first and foremost with complete loyalty to the 
president for the advancement of his agenda in his interest and 
thats what im doing 
that job description does not preclude a more aggressive effort 
to strengthen his own standing and improve his own image quayle 
and his allies have maintained that his image problem stems largely 
from memories of the democratic attack on him during the 1988 
campaign but it has been over a year now and the numbers arent 
any better 
as a result some quayle advisers want him to raise his 
television profile appearing more frequently on the talk and 
questionandanswer programs those appearances have been held to a 
handful during the first year of the administration there may be 
more in the months ahead 
and there certainly will be more political outings in 1990 with 
34 senators 36 governors and the house of representatives all up 
for election campaigning for party candidates is a traditional 
assignment for vice presidents 
that means the voters will be seeing more of quayle theyll 
know him better his challenge is to convince them to like him 
better

the realignment of ford motors executive suite 
in which an older chief executive will replace a younger one and 
the four top positions will be held by men age 55 or older is 
almost unique in recent history 
it has upset patterns established over three decades 
conceivably put another one in motion and presented a challenge to 
those who analyze and seek to understand the executive suite 
it is the most unusual succession pattern of the 35 years in 
which i have audited executive mobility and succession in top 
corporations said professor eugene jennings an authority on 
such matters 
older executives have been favored over youth in the past 
jennings said but usually because directors lacked confidence that 
younger ones were ready or because a company was rebuilding and 
sought to avoid radical change 
he indicated this was not the situation at ford and speculated 
that a feeling developing on corporate boards that many companies 
are losing experience and wisdom through early retirements may 
have played a role 
in the ford realignment chairman and chief executive donald 
petersen 63 will resign early in 1990 and be replaced by vice 
chairman harold poling 64 
the chief executives office also would include philip e benton 
jr 60 as president and chief operating officer allan gilmour 
55 as head of worldwide automotive works and stanley seneker 58 
as chief financial officer 
jennings a michigan state university professor of management 
and a consultant to boards on succession policy said that over the 
past three decades the typical age has been 55 years for new 
chairmen and 48 years for new presidents 
in his view polings age presents him with a difficult 
situation in which he is denied the openended tenure that a 
new chief executive usually needs in which to make an imprint 
that situation could become more complicated jennings believes 
because history shows that in the rare instances in which 
corporations preferred age over youth the seasoning of younger 
executives was impeded and frustrated 
if petersen has indeed ushered in a cultural revolution at ford 
says jennings then now is the time to use some of these senior 
positions to grow future top management that is what 
conventional planning dictates 
noting that the chief executives office now will be filled by 
four financeoriented managers jennings observed it would be 
logical that a marketing or manufacturing executive be moved in 
among them to benefit from their knowledge 
in the past when older financial people remained in top 
positions said jennings it usually indicated the corporate 
directors felt the risk of change far outweighed the need for fresh 
ideas 
he noted that ford which earlier became the most profitable 
american automobile company recently suffered declines in its 
quarterly profits and that it might indeed feel the future demands 
financial wisdom and experience 
but jennings who pioneered in mobility studies during the 
1950s said the notion cannot be ruled out that ford might be in 
the vanguard of a new appreciation of age and competency

kathy thorpe wants a job she wants a 
place to live in a drugfree neighborhood where she and her two 
toddlers will feel safe and she wants to get off welfare 
ever since ive had these kids ive had this fear that id 
always be financially dependent said thorpe 28 these kids 
are depending on me and i dont want to let them down 
despite a failed marriage the lack of a job and no day care for 
her 2yearold daughter and 1yearold son she has a better 
chance to fulfill that goal now thanks to an experimental job 
training effort that rewards determination with cash bonuses 
i would love to get into computers thorpe said id like 
to try to be a word processor 
officials here in montgomery county frustrated by the lack of 
participation in jobtraining programs started a threeyear pilot 
program in july offering cash incentives of up to 1000 to 
motivate welfare recipients to go to school and get jobs 
its no longer good enough to just give people a welfare 
check said robert s caulk director of the department of social 
services for the county which borders washington dc weve got 
to do more to provide them with the wherewithal to get off of 
welfare to break that cycle of dependence 
the program which targets those who have been receiving aid to 
families with dependent children for at least three years and 
lowincome teenage parents is the first in the nation to offer 
cash incentives for job training caulk said 
participants who complete a goal such as consistently attending 
a training class or earning a high school equivalency diploma 
receive payments ranging from 25 to 200 with a limit of 1000 
per person per year the us departments of agriculture and health 
and human services agreed to waive requirements that would have 
deducted the incentive payments from welfare or food stamp payments 
the program will cost nearly 1 million in federal state and 
county funds caulk said but the annual savings in welfare 
benefits alone would be about 5000 for each threemember family 
that becomes economically selfsufficient he said 
social workers set up goals and payments taking into 
consideration each persons abilities and motivation level 
were trying to empower case managers to have the flexibility 
to say for this client just showing up five days in a row is an 
accomplishment he said that person would be rewarded at the 
end of five days somebody else may have a totally different kind 
of package they may have to score well in word processing or 
assembly or retail training others may get one payment to complete 
the class 
about 600 people will participate in the experimental program 
with half receiving cash incentives and the other half acting as a 
control group 
the federal government suggested we keep payments quiet so 
the control group wouldnt know others were receiving payments for 
completing the same tasks they did without pay caulk said but 
that is impossible because theyre all in the same classes and we 
want them to discuss their progress and encourage each other 
wealthy montgomery county has tried other projects in the past 
three years ago it gave welfare recipients vouchers worth up to 
250 to pay for food utilities or other bills in exchange for 
their participation in jobtraining programs the dropout rate was 
more than 50 percent 
the federal governments approach to the problem is to require 
certain welfare recipients to attend jobtraining classes to keep 
their public assistance checks coming 
but caulk said even the threat of losing payments they now 
receive has not helped motivate some welfare recipients to seek 
advancement 
last year congress passed the family support act requiring 
states to set up largescale education jobtraining and work 
programs to make welfare recipients selfsufficient 
maryland was the first state to implement the act in all 
counties said jc shay spokesman for the state department of 
human resources who added that state officials are optimistic 
about montgomery countys program 
were anxious to see how the cash incentives will impact on 
the welfare recipients participation motivation and continuation 
in the program he said 
federal officials are taking a waitandsee attitude 
were not in favor of the program or against it but if it is 
successful wed like to see it tried in other areas said peter 
germanis of the federal lowincome opportunity board which 
includes officials from several federal agencies who are working to 
improve the nations welfare system and if it were to succeed in 
several areas it could be used for reforming the national wefare 
system 
already the program has surpassed caulks expectations 
our goal was to have 40 people in the first jobtraining 
class so far 61 people have enrolled he said going on past 
experience we could lose half in the next month 
if the program works however the cash incentives would 
encourage them to stay he said 
this has never been tried before so if we find that the 
payments make no difference even that is worth knowing caulk 
said then we can sit down and think of something else to try 
thorpe said she is confident the program will work 
when people ask me what have you been up to i dont say 
oh nothin just hangin around i say ive been busy im 
going to school im going to get a job 
and although shed seek training even without being paid she 
said the money really comes in handy

for some teenagers its hard work not getting 
pregnant so hard they are being paid 1 a day for their efforts 
each thursday afternoon 13 teenage girls pick up 7 and snack 
on chips and soda at the la mariposa health care center a denver 
general hospital clinic in the lowincome largely hispanic 
neighborhood where most of them grew up 
twelve of them already have at least one child and many bring 
their babies along this is a program for girls who have gotten 
pregnant by age 16 and know the consequences of teen pregnancy 
firsthand 
its an incentive program and its a support group says 
margo daly assistant director of planned parenthood of the rocky 
mountains which sponsors the program 
in the past two years out of more than 20 girls weve had 
only two pregnancies thats really successful for the kind of 
group were dealing with 
the program has sparked interest around the country and spawned 
a similar program in san mateo calif daly says 
the girls use the weekly sessions to talk about childrearing 
school dating providing each other the support that they might 
otherwise try to find having another baby organizers say 
consciously or unconsciously they are addicted to motherhood 
says dr jeffrey dolgan a child psychologist at childrens 
hospital who thought up the dollaraday program several years 
ago after directing a home for troubled youths and seeing a steady 
stream of teen mothers come through 
their deprivation and emptiness their longing for something 
uniquely their own compels girls in their situation to get 
pregnant dolgan says that plus weak refusal skills and a 
passive understanding of their role as women 
dolgan says weekly support from others like them helps the girls 
overcome a psychological longing for a child the money and 
refreshments are added incentive a psychological ploy he says is 
too often overlooked in addressing the nationwide teen pregnancy 
problem 
the girls dont like seeing themselves as deprived but some 
agree they wanted to get pregnant 
my cousin had a baby and i felt i kind of lost her i felt i 
needed someone with me all the time said jo ann armijo 17 
holding her 5monthold son jose on her lap at one thursday 
afternoon session 
now she attends high school through the citys teen parent 
education network which provides some daycare she doesnt want 
to get pregnant again because she wants to become a veterinarian 
and to be able to provide for jose she said 
armijo said the money isnt the reason she and other girls come 
to the clinic each week although it gives them something to 
think about 
for her the session gives me a chance to let some of my 
feelings out or if i need to know something about the babies 
things like teething and heat rash or what to do when you want to 
go to school and cant find a babysitter 
planned parenthood estimates the program costs about 600 per 
girl annually paid for by donations daly says that makes it a 
cheap alternative to teen pregnancy 
last year gov roy romers initiative on teen pregnancy 
reported the cost to colorado totals over 200 million each year 
in aid to families with dependent children food stamps medicaid 
and other public assistance for families headed by women who began 
their childbearing as teens 
the state health department reported that one in 10 babies born 
in colorado in 1987 was born to a teenager and teenage 
pregnancies resulted in more than 5700 births and 3000 abortions 
maria olivia valdez 17 has come to the sessions since her son 
chris was born a year and a half ago for her its a welcome 
break in a week filled with high school a job at a grocery store 
and the responsibilities of motherhood 
i didnt want to get pregnant but i was happy because i like 
kids especially newborns she said 
she enjoys being with the other girls theyre your same age 
and they have babies too so they know how youre feeling 
a lot of girls think i might as well have another baby since 
i cant go out and work much with one child already here you 
realize itll be harder to take on another baby itll stop your 
career life you just wont feel right living off of your 
parents or your inlaws 
the girls as young as 13 can stay in the dollaraday program 
for two years or until they are 18 most take highschool classes 
and some have jobs counselor diane medina says 
seven dollars a week doesnt go far but can pay for diapers or 
a snack on the way home several girls said 
valdez unusual in the group in that she lives with her sons 
father another teenager said she used to spend the 7 a week on 
laundry and diapers but now saves it for her son

in the decade of the 1990s perhaps as never before human fate 
rests in human hands 
few periods in history have presented such clear choices between 
promise and peril and experts predict that civilization in the 
21st century and beyond may well be shaped by global decisions made 
in the 1990s 
human beings now have the power to control their own fate to a 
degree that theyve never had before said edward cornish 
president of the world future society 
unfortunately we do not know how to handle this power very 
well we dont have very well developed systems for managing the 
world as a whole 
the world future society an organization that monitors trends 
and forecasts their effects annually surveys the views of 
specialists on the major problems in years ahead 
topping the list of challenges for the 1990s environmental 
damage to the earths climate land water and atmosphere 
in 1986 the cluster of environmental problems was no 3 on 
this list of fears said michael marien editor of the survey 
now he said it has clearly become the leading problem area 
world watch an environmental research organization agrees with 
the assessment in its annual state of the world the 
organization calls the 1990s the turnaround decade and warns 
by many measures time is running out 
global warming because it affects all else is of the most 
concern to futurists and to many environmentalists 
scientists agree that human action principally burning fossil 
fuels and the slashandburn clearing of vast forest lands is 
increasing the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in what is called 
the greenhouse effect carbon dioxide and some other gases act 
like a global thermal blanket allowing sunlight to strike earth 
but trapping heat that otherwise would radiate back into space 
eventually the theory goes the planet will warm polar ice 
will melt climates will change oceans will rise agricultural 
patterns will be disrupted and food supplies will decline 
scientists disagree about whether the greenhouse effect is 
already causing the earth to overheat but it is accepted that only 
a determined effort to reduce fossil fuel use and halt destruction 
of forests will reverse rising levels of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere 
human actions also are thought to be causing the depletion in 
the stratosphere of the ozone layer that shields against 
ultraviolet solar radiation chlorofluorocarbons a widely used 
chemical family becomes a pollutant in the atmosphere destroying 
ozone molecules and weakening the uv shield this can lead to more 
skin cancer weaker plants and poorer harvests 
industry and governments already have recognized this problem 
and have signed agreements to eventually stop use of 
chlorofluorocarbons but atoms of this chemical can survive for 50 
years assuring that ozone depletion will be a problem well beyond 
the 1990s 
governments also are taking action against other environmental 
problems acid rain water pollution garbage disposal and the 
extinction of species how well these measures succeed is again 
an issue of the 1990s that will depend on human will 
worldwide economic turbulence is second on the list of impending 
worries according to the world future society survey 
the growing chasm between rich and poor between debtridden 
overpopulated third world nations and the vigorous economies of 
developed nations may sharply intensify in the new decade 
but for america experts see the 90s as an era of prosperity 
the 1990s will be a decade of solid economic growth and 
the us will continue to be the most influential nation in 
technology trade and political leadership predict economists 
austin h kiplinger and knight a kiplinger in their book america 
in the global 90s 
the trick said cornish will be in finding ways to allow the 
poorer nations to share in the good times 
nuclear war long considered the greatest threat to the worlds 
future is third on the list of future fears 
the specialists believe this concern has receded because of the 
cold war thaw but they warn that the missiles east and west are 
still poised and the road to a sure and certain peace is not in 
place 
fourth on the world future society list of problems for the 
1990s the epidemic of drug abuse in america a concern not even 
mentioned in earlier surveys by the society 
cocaine and its insidious first cousin crack have turned many 
urban neighborhoods into marketplaces for addiction with murder a 
nightly event and crimes routinely committed to support drug 
habits marijuana is grown illegally in many parts of the united 
states and heroin continues to hook the young 
president bush has pledged a war to shut down the illegal trade 
and other nations are battling powerful drug cartels the results 
are still uncertain and the effort is sure to extend into the 
1990s and perhaps beyond 
the futurists rank the aids epidemic as the fifthworst problem 
of the new decade although some medical experts would put it at 
the top

in a twoyear study that used mathematical models to project the 
course of the plague the hudson institute warned that acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome is a catastrophe sweeping over 
america 
the institute a distinguished think tank predicts that by the 
end of the 1990s more than 15 million americans will have died of 
aids and that unless new tactics are used up to 145 million 
americans will be infected with the aids virus by 2002 
nothing can totally avert this coming catastrophe the study 
says medical science can ease the suffering and slow the 
progression of the disease but no cure is on the horizon 
unchecked aids will kill more americans in the next decade than 
have died in combat in all of the nations wars 
aids has peaked in the homosexual community and is rampant among 
people who inject drugs but the study forecast that in the 1990s 
the disease will surge among heterosexuals becoming an 
overwhelming plague of the young and poor 
the study says that only through a major change in societys 
sexual patterns is there hope of reducing the toll of aids which 
is caused by a virus spread mostly through sexual intercourse 
thus aids as with many other problems of the 1990s can be 
controlled by human will 
despite the litany of concerns for the new decade the 1990s 
also offer great promise 
in medicine scientists are beginning to crack the genetic code 
and learn how to change the fundamental blueprint of life 
plant genes are being manipulated to improve yield and fight 
insects and disease promising more food untainted by pesticides in 
the new decade 
the complex human genome the complete set of genes also is 
being mapped and scientists are already finding specific genes 
that cause or facilitate disease eventually though probably 
beyond the 1990s medicine hopes to replace the defective genes of 
illness with the normal genes of health 
improved techniques and new drugs even now in testing will 
enable doctors in the 1990s to transplant virtually any organ and 
to even more vigorously combat heart disease and cancer ancient 
killers already in retreat 
a revolution in materials science is under way and is sure to 
accelerate into the 1990s lightweight but strong plastics and 
ceramics are replacing metals in airplanes cars and construction 
superconducters composites that can carry electricity without 
resistance are being developed at laboratories worldwide offering 
the promise of more efficient power transmission faster computers 
and highspeed rail transport 
in electronics a new wave of scientists matured in the 
generation of the silicon chip will apply their expertise to an 
already flourishing field theyll find new uses for the smart 
chip integrating it even more thoroughly into household gadgets 
automobiles and educational tools some experts predict that 
personal computers will perform hundreds of new jobs and become as 
essential to the home of the 1990s as the telephone 
supercomputers are being teamed with new mathematics to allow 
scientists to model even the most complex and random events this 
may hold the key to a fundamental understanding of the weather of 
earthquakes and of economic trends how does smoke from a stack in 
pittsburgh affect the weather in new zealand what does a change in 
ocean currents near peru mean to wheat harvests in kansas the 
improved science of math modeling may yield answers in the 1990s 
americas decade in space centers on construction of space 
station freedom an orbiting laboratory that will give astronauts a 
permanent place to experiment in weightlessness and to test systems 
for a prospective voyage to mars in the next century 
building the station still is an uncertainty depending on the 
determination of congress but the 1990s will still witness 
american space spectaculars 
two space probes magellan and galileo are already on their way 
to venus and jupiter carrying new more sophisticated instruments 
to explore those distant worlds in 1992 another probe will be 
sent to mars the hubble telescope to be launched next year will 
be able to study star galaxies 14 billion light years away looking 
farther back in time than ever before was possible 
wise use of promising technologies can help overcome many of the 
obvious problems of the 1990s but cornish said an international 
effort as never before will be necessary 
there are solutions for any of the problems but not quick 
simple and easy solutions he said they require international 
cooperation and we dont know yet how to get international 
cooperation 
we human beings are getting better at it he added and 
i think there are good reasons for optimism for the future 
but that future he said may well turn like a jeweled hinge 
on decisions made in the decade of the 1990s

forget what you know about hyundais just get inside the 
carmakers 1990 sonata 
otherwise youll spend 5 minutes walking around this roomy 
midsize car convinced someone stuck the wrong nameplate on the 
door 
the test car a hyundai sonata gls with leather interior and v6 
engine showed the south korean carmaker has considerable talents 
beyond the little lowend subcompact excel it has been selling in 
the united states since 1986 
the sonata felt big inside and acted big with a 3liter 
multiport fuelinjected sixcylinder engine teamed with 
fourspeed automatic overdrive transmission that delivered up to 
142 horsepower on demand rather smoothly i even made the tires 
squeal a few times when i really tried to gun it 
front seats were roomy and back seat space was impressive with 
the front seats moved up a bit i could even stretch out my legs in 
the back seat with the front seats back a bit i still had decent 
legroom headroom and shoulder space in back also were commendable 
in fact the sonatas 997 cubic feet of passenger space is 
bigger than that of some other sedans such as the toyota camry 
exterior styling on the sonata was subdued not exactly 
expressive but certainly the car has a nice look 
suspension and handling is capable the car does a good job of 
cushioning harsh bumps with its rather spongy ride 
inside the rearseat armrests offered storage space big side 
windows added to the roomy feel and the ventilation system was 
powerful the button to pop open the trunk was neatly tucked on the 
underside of the drivers armrest so you dont have to hunt for it 
in the glovebox as in some domestic cars 
best of all the base price for a 1990 sonata with manual 
transmission is 9999 making it a potent price competitor in the 
midsize sedan segment 
in contrast the mitsubishi galant sedan with manual 
transmission starts at 10989 and the toyota camry sedan with 
manual transmission starts at 11588 
at that toyota price youre close to the upscale sonata gls 
with manual transmission which starts at 12349 and the gls 
model includes tilt steering cruise control power door locks and 
windows and illuminated vanity mirror as standard equipment 
the gls test car with options that included leather interior 
air conditioning and premium radio topped out at 15849 
not bad for a roomy v6powered car that can comfortably and 
sensibly be used for family jaunts around town vacation travel or 
trips to work 
that should appeal to likely buyers of the sonata most of whom 
will be men 55 percent of buyers with a median age of 40 and 
married 70 percent of buyers according to the company 
thirtythree percent of buyers are likely to be collegeeducated 
and median income is expected to be 32000 
i did find a couple of annoyances in the test car the power 
antenna made five or six loud thumping sounds whenever it went up 
or down and as a passenger pointed out the openclose 
adjustments for the inside vents at each end of the dashboard 
didnt work properly the vents actually released more air when the 
levers were in the closed position 
but overall the sonata was a surprising car 
unfortunately sales have been surprising too surprisingly 
low since the sonatas introduction early in 1989 hyundai had 
looked to sell 80000 of the cars this year but sales totaled 
26150 through october as us car sales turned sluggish 
because the sonata is a new vehicle there is no owner report of 
trouble from consumer reports magazine

passion and commitment to her art drove georgia 
okeeffes painting which both illuminates her appeal and adds a 
compassionate dimension to the okeeffe legend according to a 
recent biographer 
roxana robinson author of georgia okeeffe a life said 
the artist endures because she painted emotion in the 20th century 
from the start of this century painting in this country has 
been done in the masculine tradition which has been either cold 
or angry okeeffes paintings are passionate tender and full of 
joy and specifically they refer to the female experience she 
said in a recent interview 
the findings by robinson aided in her study by cooperation from 
okeeffes family come in contrast to popular notions that 
okeeffe was detached even cool about her work and relationships 
she draws from okeeffes letters and interviews with her 
associates and relatives to trace the artists life from childhood 
on the wisconsin prairie in the early 1900s through her tumultuous 
marriage to new york photographer and art impresario alfred 
stieglitz 
georgia okeeffe a life harper and row 25 also examines 
okeeffes complicated relationship with juan hamilton a 
23yearold drifter who appeared on her doorstep looking for work 
in 1973 and stayed until her death the letters discount the 
persistent sexual interpretations of okeeffes work 
she was much warmer and more vulnerable than i expected 
said robinson a novelist and art historian she was also 
probably colder and more difficult too but doing the research i 
began to understand why 
okeeffes life on the prairie as the eldest daughter of a 
farming family with six siblings taught her the importance of 
selfsufficiency her independence was established early in life 
i am going to live a different life from the rest of you 
girls she said upon graduating from high school i am going to 
give up everything for my art 
her love for stieglitz who was nearly two decades her senior 
was strong and he not only was enamored with her but as a leading 
figure in new yorks art world he was also her greatest booster 
if you were a woman and a painter you were a woman painter 
and that was very different from being a painter robinson said 
it was important that she had somebody that was at least trying 
to get her work perceived as equal to men but he didnt promote 
her work as any better than it actually was 
stieglitz however was also okeeffes greatest source of pain 
but she never confronted him with his appetite for other young 
women again her family ethic of selfsufficiency allowed her to 
cope 
she demanded her solitude to work and began to spend about half 
the year apart from her husband painting in new mexico the 
okeeffe legend portrays her as a woman who just decided she was 
leaving one morning but okeeffes pain was deep 
at that period of her deepest grief and unhappiness she turned 
her energies toward her art instead of her anguish robinson 
said if stieglitz chose to make her unhappy her job was to see 
that she was not unhappy it was not to change his behavior 
okeeffe died in 1986 at the age of 98 
the research alone makes robinsons book worth reading although 
her prose is sometimes redundant and her own pronouncements on 
feminism often blunt the message okeeffes life so clearly 
illustrated 
the book does not raise the issue of okeeffes supposed 
bisexuality because robinson said she could not produce any 
corroborating evidence 
the sexual content of much of okeeffes bright and flowing 
flowers has long been debated most vehemently by the artist 
herself 
when you took time to really notice my flower you hung all 
your own associations with flowers on my flower okeeffe wrote 
to one critic and you write about my flower as if i think and 
see what you think and see of the flower and i dont 
for okeeffe the flowers were demonstrations of passion but 
not specifically representing genitalia or sexual objects robinson 
says 
okeeffes flowers were images drawn from a female 
perspective which made them both new and suspect robinson wrote 
similarly okeeffes later stark depictions of cattle skulls 
and bones she found on the desert of new mexico were often 
misinterpreted to symbolize death 
i have wanted to paint the desert and i havent known how 
she wrote in an exhibition catalog so i brought home the 
bleached bones as my symbols of the desert to me they are as 
beautiful as anything i know the bones seem to cut sharply to 
the center of something that is keenly alive in the desert even 
tho it is vast and empty and untouchable and knows no kindness 
with all its beauty 
robinson portays okeeffe as a leading example of the changing 
roles of women throughout the 20th century 
georgia okeeffe by her example gave permission to the 
following generations of women to give work priority in their 
lives to consider it crucial robinson writes 
her paintings were about something that had never been 
before so clearly revealed the female experience

forsaking african rhythms jazz arrangements 
and avantgarde electronics of previous talking heads and solo 
efforts david byrnes latest musical safari has brought him to the 
seductive beats of latin america 
its a little different maybe byrne said from the stage of 
the pantages theater to the bobbing concertgoers below but maybe 
not he quickly added springing into another congalaced tune 
those familiar with the hybrid tastes of byrne the lead singer 
of talking heads knew just what he meant although his new album 
rei momo is infused with merengues and sambas its about as 
traditional a record as any hes made 
im not trying to convert people or educate people or do any 
of that kind of stuff byrne said in an interview while stopping 
in los angeles during a national tour this fall for me its 
purely something im getting a lot of enjoyment out of music that 
i think is deep and fun its what i want to do its not as though 
im saying now i want to tell you about this you must sit down 
and listen 
unlike the contemplative occasionally downcast themes cascading 
through byrnes prior work rei momo carries both invigorating 
lyrics and beats in dont want to be part of your world for 
example he sings of children escaping an imperfect life to a place 
free from greed and hunger free from hate and war 
i think it is somewhat inherent in the culture the music 
the melodies and rhythms that it can give you a kind of tinge of 
something uplifting spiritual or whatever the 37yearold byrne 
said 
in brazil theres a vast difference between the rich and the 
poor the economy is in pretty bad shape and yet they have these 
incredible cultural resources the spirit of the people is very 
rich 
not only in brazil but also in a lot of latin culture in the 
barrios in new york and los angeles and texas music is filled 
with the spirit of life and you feel this is what is allowing 
people to go on 
the music seems to reflect their lives and add something to 
their lives rather than being the latest record thats foisted on 
them 
byrne is the latest american artist to use latin sounds in pop 
music in the 1980s others have included paul simon who has worked 
with brazilian star milton nascimento quincy jones and the 
manhattan transfer madonna recorded a song la isla bonita 
which had a latin flavor and linda ronstadt put out an album of 
mexican favorites taught to her by her father 
twentyfive years after brazilian music first caught american 
ears with the quiet strains of bossa nova a second brazilian 
invasion is occurring brazilian superstars such as djavan simone 
caetano veloso and nascimento have been signed to american labels 
and are touring the united states 
latin music has likewise grown in popularity with the arrival 
of crossover artists such as miami sound machine and reuben blades 
the cofounder of the 14yearold but now idle talking heads 
byrne has directed the film true stories acted in public 
televisions trying times and composed the scores for the 
twyla tharp dance the catherine wheel robert wilsons opera 
the forest and the movies the last emperor and married to 
the mob 
for the 1986 movie something wild he composed his first 
afrolatin single loco de amor sung by celia cruz the queen 
of latin music 
it was scarcely a radical departure in some of the 10 albums 
byrne has recorded with talking heads especially 1980s remain 
in light and last years naked his music has been laced with 
african sounds 
byrne refined his appreciation for afrolatin compositions while 
spending six weeks in brazil last year making a documentary about 
native dancemusic rituals for public televisions alive from off 
center in addition to rei momo he has assembled two 
compilations of brazilian hits beleza tropical brazil classics 
volume 1 which reached the no 1 position on cashboxs latin 
charts and the new o samba brazil classics volume 2 
because byrne enjoys a loyal following his current tour is 
attracting mostly capacity audiences rei momo debuted at no 
30 on the compact disc charts while the album was no 109 after two 
weeks 
yet the people attending the concerts given by byrne and his 
16piece band are largely white americans not the kind of 
audience usually seen at a concert where vocals arent always in 
english and the bandstand is filled with such instruments as the 
coro and sencerro cuban drums and guiro a percussion device 
what were doing will help the latin scene a lot said 
milton cardona a percussionist who appears on byrnes album and 
tour 
angel fernandez who plays trumpet and arranged several of the 
albums songs said thats part of the excitement to us its 
great to be bringing this music to a bigger audience and i think 
the public is ready for something new 
said byrne you dont have to understand it to enjoy it 
im encouraged by the audience but im still afraid about 
radio he said when radio stations hear that its a latin 
record they say whoa we dont play latin music we play the 
hits 
for both the album and the 20city tour that started in 
poughkeepsie ny in midseptember with plans for a south 
american and europe swing byrne gathered some of the nations 
leading latin musicians veterans of bands for ruben blades tito 
puente and cruz 
in assembling the record byrne attempted to build songs that 
satisfied both his perfectionist personality and the musics latent 
disregard for formality 
on the cumbia independence day for instance i had a drum 
set up for the recording session byrne said and the drummer 
came in and he hardly ever touched the drums he usually would 
play the side of one of the tom toms he didnt hit the snare drum 
once so it was everything exactly the opposite of what a rock 
drummer would do 
this was really different than recording with talking heads 
for each song wed kind of cast the players in a way if 
something was say a merengue there are musicians who specialize 
in that kind of rhythm and those kind of bass parts and wed get 
those musicians in 
while a few critics have accused the shy musician of 
international cultural vandalism byrne says hes only creating new 
music out of old as has been done for years 
if everybody plays the same stuff then nobody will listen to 
any of it he said 
i want to be free to do whatever i want to do i get 
accused a little bit of flirting around with different styles but 
i think a lot of them have an awful lot in common and that im not 
jumping around as much as it may appear on the surface

its been months since oscar hijuelos has looked 
at his novel the mambo kings play songs of love a nominee for 
the national book award 
he remembers love scenes and music but certain passages have 
slipped his mind picking up the book again will be like reading it 
for the first time 
it always works that way faces of old friends become blurred 
over the years listen to your favorite song 100 times and a note 
or turn of phrase will still surprise you only the most fanatical 
lucy fan can anticipate every joke 
memory music i love lucy they all matter in the mambo 
kings plays songs of love farrar straus amp giroux 1895 in 
which desi arnaz briefly drops in on the world of brothers cesar 
and nestor castillo and to their astonishment transports them to 
the living room of lucy and ricky ricardo 
arnaz was always one of the essential successful cubans 
said hijuelos the son of cuban immigrants he didnt have a down 
image when you think about how latins are portrayed in the media 
even today theyre either hoods or theyre cops 
he was a middleclass man very successful he had a 
whackedout life but he had a real relationship a real life and 
that image really enchanted me he also a slight melancholic 
streak he had a lot of qualities that i related to 
try to remember this i love lucy episode two cuban 
brothers old friends of rickys arrive at the apartment one day 
they exchange chitchat with the ricardos and later appear at the 
tropicana crooning beautiful maria of my soul with the 
bandleader himself joining the brothers on stage lucy naturally 
is upset because she wanted to appear in the show instead 
sound familiar well it never really happened but thats the 
point mambo kings is a song of invented memory a mournful 
melody of events distorted by nostalgia and loss 
the one thing you dont lose is memory and memory nags you 
hijuelos said look at jewish writers who write about things that 
have happened internally things go around and around and around 
if youre hung up on the past you cant move forward nestor 
tries to get courage from the american notion of discarding the 
past and move forward 
loss of youth love and country run through mambo kings in 
the late 1940s carlos gregarious and ambitious and nestor 
moody and romantic arrive in new york as aspiring mambo 
musicians the end comes 30 years later in a rundown hotel room 
where carlos drinks himself to death 
women inspire their songs and their songs inspire women love 
affairs for carlos are as intense and shortlived as the latest 
dance craze for nestor heartbreak is timeless a haunting ballad 
undiminished by repeated listenings 
and memories of home are inescapable for both castillos no 
amount of rum women and song can replace their simple easygoing 
life in cuba 
i think most immigrants are basically homesick hijuelos 
said you cant imagine losing something like your country unless 
youve really lost it its just a dream of something lost which 
you can never really retrieve 
you meet cubans in miami who have made a million bucks but 
they will never have what they had before 
hijuelos was born in 1951 and grew up on 118th street on 
manhattans upper west side a neighborhood remembered in his first 
novel our house in the last world published in 1985 
he first wanted to be a musician but was turned off by the rock 
n roll drug scene and drifted into writing in his mid20s 
hijuelos nearly quit that as well finding authors no more 
appealing than rock stars 
i went to a writers conference in 1978 and i found it the most 
sexist hierarchal opinionated prejudical place ive ever been on 
earth if you dont write their way you dont write if youre a 
woman and pretty you get invited to parties if not forget it 
meeting author donald barthelme who died recently provided 
hijuelos with a valued friend and mentor 
he sort of took me under his wing and pointed me in the right 
direction hijuelos recalled he wasnt narrowminded in his 
view of literature and exposed me to a lot of writers and even 
though i was writing quite differently from him he never held that 
against me 
he was a really nice man and a topnotch editorial adviser 
barthelme helped with mambo kings and arnaz and some 
notsofamous musicians provided inspiration hijuelos recalled 
working in a downtown office where the elevator operator would come 
up to his floor and sing a cuban musician who died in a london 
hotel room made a lasting impression 
and of course there were songs hundreds of them mambo 
kings is like a greatest hits album complete with hijuelos 
favorite dance songs boleros and ballads 
hijuelos urges readers to start where they wish open at any 
page like dropping the needle in the middle of a record or tuning 
in i love lucy at intermission and quickly filling in the plot 
barthelme was like that instead of thinking of a chapter as a 
chapter you think of it as an atmosphere a state of 
consciousness he said i wrote this book where you can open it 
up anywhere and get an idea of whats going on in the book

gospel songs 
i grew up singing christian music jones 55 said in a 
telephone interview from her home in beverly hills calif i was 
the youngest member of my church choir at age 6 
it has been synonymous with my singing its beautiful music 
and this project was a wonderful experience 
ive never really done a solo album ive done the movie 
albums and did some things for columbia with my husband jack and 
of course the partridge family 
in 197074 jones was shirley partridge in the popular tv comedy

of my repertoire for 30 years now when i think of the words during 
a distressing time it helps me through 
among other cuts on the album the musics gotta stop

the title cut silent strength is about trusting ones savior 
we spent five hours in my living room one sunday afternoon 
going through the music jones said we pored through music and 
talked about words and what was right for me i wanted to do 
beautiful ballads with beautiful lyrics and no rock n roll 
stuff 
she said shes at a point in her career where she accepts only 
projects that intrigue her im at a marvelous place in my life 
im not driven by my career but i never have been really i can 
pick and choose im able to do what i want to do which is sing

paramount communications inc the entertainment 
giant that made a failed bid for time inc this past summer said 
it plans to take a 140 million pretax charge on its publishing 
operations for its recently completed fourth fiscal quarter 
paramount said tuesday that as a result its publishing 
operations which include simon amp schuster prentice hall and 
pocket books will report a breakeven performance for the year 
ended oct 31 
the charge reflects a writedown in the value of some publishing 
assets and accruals for costs associated with improving publishing 
technology 
despite the charge the companys overall results are expected 
to be sharply higher it previously announced a 12 billion 
aftertax gain on the sale of its consumer and commercial finance 
business and a 12 million aftertax gain on the sale of two small 
prentice hall units 
paramount earned 3847 million or 321 a share on revenue of 
51 billion in fiscal 1988 
in late trading on the new york stock exchange paramount was 
off 212 a share at 54 
the publishing side is not doing as well as i thought it would 
be in the summer said andrew wallach who follows paramount for 
the investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
but he said it is not unusual for a company to take charges when 
it is also taking big onetime gains 
martin s davis paramounts chairman and chief executive said 
the charge against publishing earnings reflects changes in the 
marketplace affecting the entire industry such as sharply rising 
product development and marketing costs and shorter revision 
periods for textbooks 
he said the fundamentals of paramounts publishing businesses 
were extremely sound and should continue to represent an 
important source of earnings and cash flow 
we are confident that fiscal 1990 results will show 
significant improvement and provide a solid base for growth in the 
decade of the 1990s and beyond he said 
paramount previously announced that it expects to take an 80 
million charge for the costs of its failed bid for time 
time rejected paramounts 12 billion takeover offer bought 
controlling interest in warner communications inc and changed its 
name to time warner inc time warner expects to buy the remaining 
warner shares later this year 
counting both the publishing charge and the charge related to 
the failed buyout bid paramount said it expects little change in 
its earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 1989 rcompared 
with 1478 million or 123 a share in fiscal 1988

the importers of absolut vodka were nosed out 
recently by texas instruments inc in getting the first talking 
magazine ad to market 
but carillon importers ltd is back claiming a first for 
another of its brands a motorized magazine ad for grand 
marnier liqueur 
when the center spread of the fourpage ad is opened a 
cardboard cutout that shows two fanciful birds with oranges on 
their bodies gently swinging a bottle of grand marnier between them 
as if it were a bell 
the cutout is powered by a tiny battery embedded out of sight 
beneath the cutout 
the teaneck njbased importer said tuesday it had spent more 
than 1 million on the fourpage holiday ad that is to appear in 
selected copies of the dec 11 issue of the new yorker the ad will 
be included in the 200000 issues of the magazine that are sent to 
subscribers in california and new york state 
the ad is the latest example of the extra effort some liquor 
advertisiers take to make their ads stand out at christmastime 
absolut vodkas talking ad in selected copies of the december 
issue of vanity fair magazine delivered tinny holiday greetings in 
italian english and spanish 
but texas instruments ran an ad with a talking computer chip 
about two weeks earlier in business week magazine 
other holiday magazine ad spectaculars this year include a 
hologram from finlandia vodka an ad with pullup tabs from chivas 
regal scotch whisky and peeloff stickers from crown royal canadian 
whisky 
some advertising executives have criticized the ad spectaculars 
saying it detracts from the environment for their clients ads but 
others argue the unusual ads attract attention to a magazine and 
make consumers more aware of other magazines 
most people love to see this sort of thing in their 
magazines said steven florio president and chief executive of 
the new yorker magazine inc we thought this was innovative and 
creative and our readers would enjoy seeing it

for years few in the northeast were 
concerned about who owned the woods now preservationists worry the 
verdant expanse may fall prey to developers catering to their 
cramped clientele down south 
with nearly 26 million acres of forest extending from maines 
north woods to new yorks adirondacks there used to be little 
worry that hunters hikers and fishermen would lose access to the 
landscape renowned for its deer and bear habitat sparkling lakes 
and troutfilled streams 
but conservationists now are suspicious about the huge 
corporations trying to take over companies in the region and are 
wondering what they plan to do with the land some fear they might 
be seduced by the lucrative development of the isolated terrain 
into vacation home tracts 
people realized there was a change in the value of the 
lands said ted rankin of the us forest service one of the 
authors of a congressionally mandated study on forest preservation 
for decades most forest land transfers involved swaps of 
acreage from one paper company to another with both companies 
valuing the land largely on the basis of timber production rankin 
said 
only recently came the realization that development potential 
could far outstrip the value of the trees 
public awareness of that change came after corporate raider sir 
james goldsmith bought diamond international corp and liquidated 
its assets including 17 million acres of timberland mostly in 
the northeast 
one of the most spectacular parcels was the nash stream valley 
in northern new hampshire its sale last year to developers who 
planned to subdivide it as vacation tracts goaded the state into 
buying the 45000 acres for 13 million giving the developers a 
tidy profit 
last month georgiapacific corp proposed a takeover of great 
northern nekoosa corp which owns 21 million acres of timberland 
in maine and is the states largest landowner the proposal renewed 
conservationists fears of a forest sellout that could spur 
development and reduce public access 
assurances from georgiapacific that it has historically been a 
buyer not a seller of timberland failed to allay fears it might 
be forced to sell much of the great northern acreage to ease its 
takeover debt 
while we may not have agreed with the way great northern has 
cut its land and its forest practices they have shown very little 
interest in development and were pretty much dedicated to managing 
the land for timber production said michael cline policy 
director of maine audubon society 
with georgiapacific its pretty much an unknown and its 
difficult to say whats going to happen whether theyll sell out 
or decide to develop certain areas or continue in the mold of great 
northern cline said 
in the meantime the outcry over nash stream prompted congress 
to spend 250000 on the yearlong study of the regions forests to 
assess ownership patterns forest managment strategies and public 
access 
the purpose of the study was to develop ways to encourage 
private owners to keep trees growing on their lands rather than 
cash in on its potential value for house lots and vacation retreats 
the vast majority of the land is privately owned most of it by 
multinational pulp and paper companies that also operate the mills 
which provide some of the regions bestpaying jobs 
over the years the companies have had few qualms about 
permitting public recreational use of their lands although 
recently some have instituted gate fees to defray the costs of 
maintaining large networks of private roads 
to local residents public access has long been regarded as a 
birthright part of the regions way of life 
its a strong feeling among the folks here in new england 
said richard schneider vice president for woodlands for great 
northern paper co in millinocket its something that has 
developed over many generations 
as the most heavily forested state other than alaska maine 
accounts for most of the territory encompassed in the congressional 
northern forest land study also included are new yorks 
adirondacks and tug hill region and small sections of northern new 
hampshire and vermont 
the report released last month offers alternative forest 
preservation strategies including tax incentives conservation 
easements landuse planning and federal and state acquisition a 
series of public forums is being held across the region and the 
final report is scheduled to be presented to congress in late march 
or early april

as wendys international inc celebrates 
its 20th anniversary today its founder pledges to renew a 
dedication to customers that he believes the fastfood chain lost 
somewhere along the way 
we forgot who the customer was founder and former chairman 
r david thomas said in an interview this week but in 1989 
were working hard on customer satisfaction and clean restaurants 
the high school dropout opened the first wendys in downtown 
columbus on nov 15 1969 naming it after his daughter he stuck 
to a limited menu of hamburgers and chili that he believed was the 
only way to maintain quality 
today the chain has grown to the nations third or 
fourthlargest depending upon the criteria used behind no 1 
mcdonalds and no 2 burger king and possibly behind hardees it 
rakes in 3 billion in annual sales with a menu that has mushroomed 
to include pizza salad pasta two types of chicken sandwiches 
burritos baked potatoes and chocolate chip cookies 
thomas who owns 8 percent or 40 million of wendys stock 
said in a 1978 interview that he wanted wendys to be bigger than 
mcdonalds corp 
asked about that on monday he said we still just want to be 
the best the cleanest restaurant the best prices the best food 
well be as big as we want to be 
thomas who retired as chairman in 1982 now stars in his own 
folksy television ads for wendys which is based in nearby dublin 
industry analysts say wendys started on the fast track and grew 
quickly establishing 1000 stores in nine years and becoming the 
no 3 fastfood chain before its recent slide 
they developed a unique niche targeting the adult fastfood 
segment of the hamburger industry with a tightlyfocused menu 
said analyst jeff stein of mcdonald amp co in cleveland 
but wendys seems to have lost some of its focus as it tried 
to expand its menu and diversify into breakfast which was not 
successful and spent a lot of money upgrading its restaurants 
he said theyve seen their market share erode along the way 
thomas said the diversification was necessary 
in 1979 we had a real problem with beef and the price went 
way up and the word nutrition started appearing so we put in 
the salad bar competition was getting keener so we added a lot of 
things i dont think we could have the same menu as we did in 69 
and be successful he said 
average sales at wendys 3762 restaurants rose 24 percent to 
759000 per store last year breaking a threeyear decline 
hardees food systems inc reported average sales of 920000 at 
its 3200 stores last year 
perunit sales at wendys were highest in 1984 at 871000 
that was the year of clara pellers commanding performance in the 
wheres the beef commercials 
advertising is an important part of the business but its not 
a cureall said analyst howard hansen of kidder peabody amp co 
in new york 
it may raise levels of awareness and bring customers in but 
unless youre giving a hot hamburger to a customer in a clean place 
and quickly all the advertising in the world isnt going to amount 
to a hill of beans he said 
hansen pegged wendys share of the fastfood market at about 48 
percent trailing 55 percent for hardees mcdonalds has about 
189 percent hansen said 
to help boost sales wendys last november started installing a 
system allowing customers to pay for food with a visa card tests 
show people spend more when they use credit cards the company said 
earnings for the third quarter totaled 87 million or 9 cents 
a share on revenue of 2962 million compared with the same 
profit on revenue of 2752 million for the same period last year 
thomas said that for now the company will continue a strategy 
of making existing stores more profitable and opening new units at 
a slower pace about 100 a year 
weve got to take business from competition business from 
anyone thomas said weve got to take care of the customers 
just like we did 20 years ago

disappointing sales and earnings growth is 
threatening to put southland corp in violation of its credit 
agreements forcing the parent of the 7eleven chain to consider a 
restructuring less than two years after a 49 billion leveraged 
buyout 
the dallasbased company said tuesday that current projections 
indicate it will not be able to meet its debt payment obligations 
in 1991 despite betterthanindustryaverage increases in average 
store sales 
financial analysts for months have been expressing concern that 
southland faced problems with its huge debt although the company 
until now maintained it could meet its obligations but southland 
said sales projections at its 7eleven convenience store chain the 
nations largest had not been met 
although president jere thompson said southland would meet its 
225 million principal payment due next month given the 
convenience retailing environment southland believes its working 
capital may not be sufficient in 1991 to meet its principal and 
interest obligations and other requirements of the business 
we are absolutely committed to improving our operating 
results said thompson a member of the founding family that 
bought the company to avoid corporate raider sam belzberg 
in addition we feel it is only prudent to consider financial 
restructuring alternatives well in advance of the time this cash 
shortfall could occur 
he said one alternative might be a comprehensive 
recapitalization in a recapitalization a company alters its 
levels of debt and equity 
the company has been selling assets since the leveraged buyout 
to help pay off its debt and announced tuesday an agreement to 
sell its 58 hawaiian stores to seveneleven japan co ltd for 75 
million cash the deal is expected to close by the end of the year 
last week southland said it agreed to sell its remaining 50 
percent interest in citgo petroleum corp to venezuelas 
stateowned oil company for 675 million the sale should be 
completed by the end of january the company said 
proceeds from both transactions will be used to reduce the lbo 
debt the company said 
thompson said the company also continues to explore selling 
other assets including its five distribution centers and six food 
processing centers 
the last public projections we had were october 1988 and the 
operating numbers that we were projecting have not materialized 
said company spokeswoman markeeta mcnatt our sales and margins 
are still extremely good but they have not met our own 
projections 
the company projected inflationadjusted sales growth of 2 
percent however ms mcnatt said inflation had been higher than 
anticipated and real growth amounted to only less than 1 percent 
during the first nine months of this year 
the summer was disappointing for the entire convenience store 
industry it was a cold wet summer for most of the country 
especially our major markets ms mcnatt said 
despite the softness and competition from convenience stores 
operated by oil companies ms mcnatt said southlands average 
store sales are continuing at 1988s strong levels when they 
increased 46 percent compared with an industry average of a 21 
percent decline 
also tuesday southland reported a thirdquarter loss of 6337 
million compared with 468 million in the same quarter last year 
revenue rose to 223 billion from 218 billion 
for the first nine months of this year it lost 24376 million 
compared with a loss of 1792 million in the yearearlier period 
the loss this year included a 56 million charge from exchange of 
debt ninemonth revenue rose to 629 billion from 602 billion

the sales slump in domestically made cars and 
light trucks continued in early november prompting speculation 
that automakers will bring back incentives to attract buyers 
the hard thing to read is which of the big three is going to 
move quickly next to reinvigorate sales with new incentive 
programs analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton inc 
said tuesday after sales figures were released 
the eight major automakers with us plants said they sold cars 
and light trucks at an average daily rate of 26194 during the nov 
110 period compared with a 32833aday pace during the same time 
last year 
car sales dropped 231 percent while sales of light trucks fell 
153 percent during the period compared with early november last 
year in october domestic car and truck sales tumbled 116 percent 
from the rate of october 1988 
the drop in us car and truck sales last month pushed down 
october retail sales by 1 percent the first decline in eight 
months 
we are in the midst of an automotive recession said analyst 
scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co in new york for anybody in 
this economy these types of numbers today are not funny 
its scary he said i dont think they are going to 
continue i hope they wont continue 
one of the ways automakers have accelerated auto sales recently 
is through cash rebates or cutrate financing the companies had 
incentive programs on a wide variety of 1989 models but have less 
extensive programs now 
merlis and phillippi said that could change 
any one of them the big three has a good reason to increase 
them phillippi said merlis said he expected bigger incentive 
packages to be combined with production cuts a move analysts have 
been expecting for months 
you need more than just incentives to get inventories in 
line he said this is an oldfashioned cyclical downturn with 
a very sad effect on the general economy 
sluggish car and lighttruck sales during october and early 
november have pushed the yeartodate sales rate down 26 percent 
compared with the same time last year car sales are down 36 
percent and truck sales are off 08 percent 
general motors corp said its early november combined domestic 
car and truck sales were down 263 percent compared with last year 
with car sales dropping 291 percent and truck sales falling 209 
percent 
sales of vehicles made in north america by ford motor co were 
off 199 percent in early november as car sales fell 235 percent 
and truck sales dropped 143 percent 
at chrysler corp car sales during the period were down 225 
percent and truck sales were down 99 percent combining for a 166 
percent drop in the early november vehicle sales pace

a bill giving the securities and exchange 
commission limited authority to control program trading in market 
emergencies has cleared its first hurdle 
the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee after a 
sometimes heated debate over whether it was too much too soon 
voted tuesday to send the bill to the full energy and commerce 
committee for consideration possibly as soon as thursday 
congressional leaders have said they want to end the current 
session before thanksgiving 
im not convinced its something we should have such a rush to 
judgment said rep thomas tauke riowa we all know were not 
going to get this through congress and down to the white house 
before the end of the year anyway he added 
but rep ron wyden dore said i think it would be 
unconscionable to leave this congressional session without sending 
a message to the markets 
the bill known as the securities markets stabilization act of 
1989 would give the securities and exchange commission new 
authority to suspend or constrain practices that could cause market 
volatility sharp price rises and drops 
chief among those controversial practices is program trading 
the almost instantaneous computerdriven transactions involving 
huge blocks of stock 
the proposed legislation also 
would give the sec authority after consulting with the 
president to halt all trading in the securities markets in the 
event of an emergency like the 1987 stock market crash 
require large securities transactions to be reported 
require the parent and affiliated companies of securities and 
investment firms to verify their financial stability with the sec 
another provision that calls for coordinated clearing and 
settlement of transactions among the sec and other government 
agencies was moved into a separate bill the coordinated clearance 
and settlement act which also passed the subcommittee 
a similar bill is pending in the senate but senate leaders have 
expressed doubts that they can add a program trading provision and 
still get it passed before the holiday break 
the provision giving the sec modified authority to halt program 
trading was approved only after the panel agreed to an amendment by 
rep matthew rinaldo of new jersey the subcommittees ranking 
republican limiting the description of practices the sec could 
halt or prohibit 
this language does not ban program trading and it does not 
direct the sec to ban program trading said rinaldo it allows 
the sec to use its discretion in limiting or curtailing disruptive 
trading strategies 
opponents of program trading are particularly critical of one 
form index arbitrage in which speculators try to take advantage 
of inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets by 
simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other 
critics claim index arbitrage leads to wild price swings which 
drives small investors out of the market and that makes it harder 
for us companies to raise capital through the sale of securities 
they claim 
originally the bill sought to prohibit manipulative abusive 
or disruptive practices but several panel members complained that 
language was too vague 
when rep edward markey dmass the subcommittee chairman 
offered his assurance that he would hammer out suitable compromise 
language before the bill went to the full committee rep wj 
tauzin dla said what i dont think what we ought to do is 
move on language we cant agree upon 
other members complained that they needed more time to review 
the most recent changes in the bill some of which were added just 
the night before 
in the waning days of the session said rep thomas manton 
dny i think were moving rather fast 
that sparked an outburst from markey we have had hearing 
after hearing after hearing he said noting that several big 
wall street securities firms that oppose program trading were 
repeatedly invited to testify at those hearings but they turned 
us down every time 
rinaldos amendment deleted the word disruptive from the 
bill which seemed to satisfy opponents pending further 
negotiations on appropriate language

the senate has voted to extend through june 30 
a dozen targeted tax breaks that are expiring including 
employerfinanced education assistance 
the extensions most of them for six months were approved by 
voice vote tuesday without debate and added to a bill authorizing 
aid to poland and hungary that measure is subject to further 
consideration by the house 
each of the extensions had been approved by the house as part of 
other legislation 
among the extended provisions are those offering tax reductions 
for up to 5250 per year of employerpaid education aid received 
by a worker a limited amount of employerfinanced group legal aid 
businesses that increase spending for research and experimentation 
investment in rental housing for lowincome families selfemployed 
people to help cover the cost of health insurance employers who 
hire lowincome people and investors in bonds targeted to help 
lowerincome families buy a first home 
most of the tax breaks are due to expire dec 31 the deduction 
for employerfinanced education assistance expired last dec 31 
the amendment adding the provisions to the polandhungary bill 
was written by sen john c danforth rmo 
if we allow them to expire real damage can be caused 
danforth said he cited for example the lowincome housing credit 
as about the only federal aid now available for that sector if 
we decide it is just going to go away for however long it takes 
until we can reenact it there can be some real damage to 
lowincome housing he said 
the cost of the extensions an estimated 12 billion would be 
made up by accelerating the rate at which large corporations must 
turn over to the government the taxes they withhold from workers 
paychecks

thousands of mostly elderly victims lost their 
savings through lincoln savings and loan after federal thrift 
regulators undercut a securities and exchange commission case 
against its owner say witnesses before a house committee 
four of the victims some in tears told the house banking 
committee on tuesday how lincoln officials led them to believe junk 
bonds in the thrifts holding company american continental corp 
purchased with their converted savings were federally insured and 
safe 
all of them blamed american continentals chairman charles h 
keating jr and five senators they tagged the keating five who 
accepted a total of 13 million in political contributions from 
the phoenix millionaire 
up against the likes of charles keating and the influence he 
was able to buy from elected officials and others in high office 
we didnt stand a chance said shirley lampel a partially blind 
widow from tustin calif who lost 30000 
the five senators alan cranston dcalif donald riegle 
dmich dennis deconcini dariz john mccain rariz and john 
glenn dohio are subjects of inquiries by the senate ethics 
committee and the fbi 
officials are investigating whether the senators improperly 
intervened on behalf of keating in april 1987 with thrift 
regulators who were considering seizing lincoln on grounds it was 
unsound despite a formal recommendation a month later recommending 
just that the federal home loan bank board waited until april 1989 
to seize lincoln 
all of the senators have denied any wrongdoing in the lincoln 
fiasco which is expected to cost taxpayers up to 25 billion and 
22000 bondholders like mrs lampel a majority of them retirees 
another 250 million 
sec chairman richard breeden who as a white house aide to 
president bush designed the 200 billionplus taxpayer bailout of 
the sampl industry said the experiences of mrs lampel and others 
has convinced him the banking laws need to be rewritten again 
to be allowed to sell junk bonds of your parent company in 
the lobby of a financial institution with the sinecure of federal 
protection is something that congress perhaps ought to prohibit 
breeden said its a little bit like having the requirement you 
cant sell liquor within so many yards of a polling place 
while mrs lampel and the others were being encouraged by 
lincoln officials to move their money out of federally insured 
deposits into the highrisk uninsured bonds the sec was trying to 
determine if the holding company had filed false financial 
statements 
breeden said a may 20 1988 memorandum of understanding 
between the federal home loan bank board and lincoln accepting the 
thrifts accounting on 135 million in disputed transactions gave 
the parent company a powerful legal tool to resist the secs probe 
the regulator of the subsidiary institution said in essence 
that financial statements were all right he said 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the bank board now called the 
office of thrift supervision said the memorandum in no way could 
have impeded the sec investigation theyre independent 
theres nothing we can do to get in the way he said 
breeden also said the sec has turned over some of the evidence 
in its probe to a federal grand jury in los angeles considering 
possible criminal charges against keating and his associates 
keating and m danny wall the bank boards chairman and now 
head of the office of thrift supervision have been subpoenaed to 
testify before the house committee next week 
while the committee has focused on wall the victims directed 
much of their anger at cranston who raised more than 970 million 
from keating for his own and other democratic political causes 
connie wickman 78 of west hills calif said she and her 
husband were heartbroken when they learned their 25000 in 
retirement funds had been lost 
i had no idea this man could be so corrupted said mrs 
lampel what alan cranston did here was not only foolish it was 
cruel it was dishonest it has devastated people and it has 
devastated me 
murray flander a spokesman for cranston said the senator has 
nothing but compassion for these people 
among other lincoln developments tuesday 
the house committees chairman rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas said he intends to investigate other failed thrifts 
beyond lincoln including silverado savings in colorado on 
whose board neal bush the presidents son once served 
riegle the senate banking committees chairman acknowledged 
through a spokeswoman that in march 1987 he visited a lavish resort 
keating was building in arizona with lincoln funds to give a speech 
to american continental employees 
breeden said former sec commissioner barbara thomas an 
appointee of former president carter had called the agencys top 
enforcement official as a character witness for keating 
a former top bank board official testified last week that ms 
thomas had approached her about obtaining for keating an early 
examination audit of lincoln by regional thrift regulators 
documents obtained by the house panel show that ms thomas as of 
early this year had an outstanding unsecured loan of 250000 from 
lincoln

every time the national football 
leagues stars butt heads on network television julie nimmons 
says her company is being thrown for a loss 
she is president of schutt athletic sales co which had 
supplied 40 percent of the helmets used by nfl players until this 
year when the nfls licensing arm signed an agreement with her 
prime competitor chicagobased riddell inc 
in an agreement with the nfl riddell is making helmets 
shoulder pads and other gear available to the leagues 28 teams for 
free if 90 percent of a teams players use its helmets players who 
wear helmets by other companies must conceal those companies logos 
that agreement has landed the two companies in the chicago 
courtroom of us district judge james zagel where lawyers for 
schutt argued at a trial in september that riddell has violated 
federal antitrust laws a decision is pending 
other people want to emulate their heroes mrs nimmons 
said they will use what their heroes use 
she said her central illinoisbased company could be forced out 
of business by the agreement which she says hurts its sales of 
helmets to college and high school football teams 
but david kagan an attorney for riddell said football helmets 
arent impulse items that coaches or equipment managers would 
buy after glimpsing the helmets during televised nfl games 
no one has ever tried to advertise football helmets on tv like 
you would dishwashing detergent or bubble gum because no one is 
interested in that sort of thing kagan said you would no more 
advertise a football helmet than you would a b1 bomber 
no money is involved in the riddellnfl deal riddell is gaining 
exposure that might help the company launch a line of running shoes 
and sportswear kagan said 
mrs nimmons contends that exposure is worth 750000 a game or 
12 million a season the amount her company would have to pay for 
television advertising during nfl games to match riddells air time 
that is more than her companys annual gross receipts from 
helmet sales she said 
schutt the nations secondlargest manufacturer of football 
helmets is privately held and mrs nimmons declined to provide an 
exact sales figure 
fortune magazine estimated riddells annual sales at 20 million 
for 1988 riddell officials did not return repeated phone calls 
frank vuono vice president of nfl properties which handles the 
leagues licensing rights said the nfl hooked up with riddell 
because the company has been a licensee of nfl properties for 
years a licensee has the right to market helmets with clubs names 
on them 
riddell has always provided good service to the clubs and 
its not much of a change in the status quo he said 
in the last 10 years the number of major football helmet 
companies has dropped from 18 to three because of lawsuits over 
helmet safety mrs nimmons said the other major manufacturer is 
bsn corp 
that trend has helped drive helmet prices higher said john 
horan editor of sporting goods management news 
a coach is probably paying 120 for a helmet that taking away 
the insurance and given a competitive situation would probably 
cost a fraction of that horan said 
deals like riddells will only push the price higher mrs 
nimmons said 
the cost of providing all those free goods will be borne by 
the consumer she said all of a sudden the poor guy is paying 
for the rich guy to get free stuff

great northern nekoosa corp has stepped 
up its defense against an unwanted takeover offer from 
georgiapacific corp 
we have no interest in anything but staying independent at 
this stage great northern chairman william r laidig told a news 
conference tuesday after meeting earlier for 45 minutes with state 
attorney general james e tierney 
what we have asked him to do is look to our record and see how 
we have handled our resources in maine to weigh it in his 
consideration about how he would proceed in court laidig said 
georgiapacific has offered 313 billion to take over great 
northern which owns 21 million acres of forest lands in maine 
part of the atlantabased georgiapacifics merger strategy 
involves an attack on maines antitakeover law 
on tuesday great northern responded in us district court in 
portland to lawsuits by georgiapacific challenging the 
antitakeover law and the companys bylaws containing socalled 
poison pill provisions to thwart hostile suitors 
great northern a major producer of pulp and paper is 
incorporated in maine although its headquarters are in norwalk 
conn 
tierney said tuesday that he does not want to take sides in the 
merger dispute but rather hopes to ensure the best deal possible 
for maines mill employees and the environment 
i feel that the current management of this company is 
committed to our state and making sure maine will be an integral 
part of their operations tierney said 
georgiapacific has also attempted to persuade maine officials 
that its buyout plans would be good for the state 
in a letter to gov john r mckernan georgiapacific chairman 
t marshall hahn jr called the deal the oldfashioned kind of 
transaction that benefits everyone but he stopped short of 
offering any guarantees about what georgiapacific will do if it 
wins the merger fight 
environmentalists have raised concerns that georgiapacific 
might try to sell off valuable recreation lands to developers to 
pay for its acquisition 
the governors office on tuesday released a copy of hahns 
letter which says if special circumstance arise such that land 
had to be sold for unforeseen reasons i assure you that the land 
for maines future board would be given the right of first refusal 
on such sales for two years 
in its court response great northern disputed allegations that 
the antitakeover provisions of its bylaws were designed to 
entrench management at shareholder expense saying it was ironic 
that georgiapacific itself has a shareholder rights plan and 
supermajority voting rules similar to the ones it is challenging in 
court 
great northern also said tuesday it had filed a petition with 
the interstate commerce commission challenging an exemption granted 
last week to georgiapacific corp so it could take over great 
northerns railroads as part of a buyout attempt 
they cut corners in an attempt to circumvent the commissions 
jurisdiction great northern spokesman stephen m hill said in a 
statement this is simply another example of georgiapacifics 
use of questionable tactics to further their own ends 
great northern attorney fritz kahn of washington said that 
georgiapacific got the icc approval by eliminating on paper a 
trucking franchise that could have blocked the railroad 
acquisition then getting its exemption a day later the company 
kept its trucking fleet and can still use the trucks for 
transporting its own materials kahn said 
georgiapacific issued a statement defending the companys 
tactics and said there was no merit to great northerns icc filing

delta air lines will buy up to 260 new jets from 
mcdonnell douglas corp and boeing co in a transaction valued at 
more than 10 billion the carrier announced 
the planned purchases of md90s and boeing 737300s over the 
next 11 years is in addition to 13 billion in orders announced 
previously delta now has 519 new jets on order as part of its 
drive to expand service and replace older aircraft 
atlantabased delta ordered 50 boeing 120passenger 737300 jets 
and took options for 50 more the first planes arrive in 1993 
delta ordered 50 of mcdonnell douglas corps new 150seat md90 
jets and took options to buy 110 more but 60 of those options were 
originally placed last year for md88 aircraft and converted 
tuesday to md90 options delta said 
deliveries begin in 1994 
a year ago delta ordered 10 billion worth of mostly 
internationalrange jets for expansion in asia and europe 
in all delta now has 182 orders and 337 options for new jets 
worth 23 billion 
delta is putting a lot of financial effort into keeping a 
modern efficient fleet as we continue to grow chairman ronald 
w allen said at a news conference tuesday 
allen said delta expects to expand capacity by 5 percent to 7 
percent per year over the next decade 
delta has the youngest fleet of any major us carrier and 
allen said the airline hopes to maintain an average aircraft age of 
about 8 years by retiring older dc9s boeing 727s and 737s 
this will give delta the ability to go either into a heavy 
fleet replacement program or depending on the market a heavy 
growth plan said paul karos of first boston corp 
allen said delta expects to pay for the new planes primarily 
with operating revenues he said the airline which earned a record 
4609 million last fiscal year is committed to keeping its debt 
low 
allen said the purchases wont mean fare increases because a 
modern fleet saves money in the long run i dont think our fare 
increases will exceed the consumer price index in coming years 
he said 
the md90s have a list price of 40 million each while 737300s 
cost about 29 million each allen declined to say how much of a 
discount delta will get he also wouldnt say how much of a down 
payment delta must make 
the md90 is an updated version of mcdonnelldouglass popular 
md80 series jet it is five feet longer than the md88 with eight 
more seats and has quieter more fuelefficient engines delta is 
the first to order an md90 
allen said the 737300s will have 120 seats eight fewer than 
the 13 737300s delta already has with fewer seats there will be 
more leg room and bigger galleys and closets

hank aaron has returned to the city where he 
hit most of his 755 home runs as a professional baseball player 
but this time hes traded his baseball garb for an entrepreneurs 
attire 
aaron has opened three arbys fastfood roast beef restaurants 
in the milwaukee area and is contracted to open 12 more by 1991 
sales at his arbys outlets are expected to reach 2 million this 
year 
aaron a member of the professional baseball hall of fame and 
the major leagues alltime career home run leader attributes his 
business success to favorable location courteous service and 
competent management 
he said he chose to begin his business in milwaukee because of 
low property costs and his attachment to the city where he spent 12 
years as a professional baseball player aaron played for the 
milwaukee braves from 1954 to 1965 and for the milwaukee brewers in 
1975 and 1976 
no matter how many places i go milwaukee always seems to be a 
part of me aaron said the people have always been very kind 
to me and ill always remember that 
repaying that kindness is one reason why aaron tries to impress 
upon his employees the importance of good service 
the most important thing that i want all of us to understand 
is that we are serving the public he said whether customers 
buy one coke or 15 sandwiches theyre all going to be treated the 
same way with a smile and a thank you 
aaron visits milwaukee about four times a year but spends most 
of his time in atlanta where he is vice president of player 
development for the atlanta braves 
fred fiorito who manages aarons wisconsin operations said a 
strong economy in milwaukee and good consumer response to arbys 
roast beef sandwiches account for much of the restaurants success 
theres just been a real good reception for arbys in 
milwaukee and wisconsin as a whole fiorito said 
arbys sells roast beef sandwiches and other hot specialty 
sandwiches many consumers see as a welcome alternative to 
hamburgers 
aaron said at a grand opening celebration for one of his three 
locations that an elderly woman thanked him for bringing arbys to 
a community that had offered nothing but hamburger joints 
aarons stores have added a nice component to arbys

leading researchers into superconductivity 
said wednesday some progress was coming faster than expected but 
many problems remain in a scientific field that may revolutionize 
the use of electricity 
about 700 scientists including some 70 from the united states 
europe and elsewhere outside japan are in tsukuba a university 
town outside tokyo for three days of lectures papers and 
discussions on the latest research into superconductivity which 
has obsessed thousands of scientists since a breakthrough in 1986 
i think the development goes faster than i thought said k 
alex mueller who won the nobel prize for the 1986 breakthrough at 
ibm laboratories in zurich switzerland 
superconductors are materials that carry electricity without any 
loss of energy from resistance the phenomenon was first seen at 
extremely low temperatures but since 1986 scientists have 
developed a series of materials that work at somewhat higher 
temperatures raising the possibility that the phenomenon will 
occur at temperatures that dont require baths of liquid nitrogen 
superconductivity could make the use of electricity much more 
efficient reducing the need to burn so much fossil fuel and 
opening the way for magnetically levitated highspeed trains 
electric cars better batteries small supercomputers and many 
other uses 
competition among scientists is intense and cries of alarm have 
been raised in the united states that japan is investing more 
heavily in research and thus may make key commercial breakthroughs 
there are many of the same parallel activities going on in the 
two countries arthur w sleight of oregon state university a 
featured speaker in the symposiums first session told a news 
conference the effort is somewhat better organized in japan but 
there is progress in the united states 
people have many of the same objectives and are working 
toward those objectives 
mueller said the european attitude is to remember that it took 
20 years to develop a practical transistor the important thing 
is to have sustained effort he said

an insurance company has reimbursed the 
pittsburgh postgazette 2 million of the largest libel judgment 
ever paid by a newspaper leaving the papers publishing company to 
absorb 270000 of the judgment 
i can tell you that its a load off my back postgazette 
publisher william block told the newspaper staff 
the newspaper reported today that pg publishing co received the 
2 million tuesday from national surety corp a subsidiary of 
firemens fund insurance cos national surety agreed to pay the 
amount in a settlement approved tuesday 
pg publishing had sued national surety in may after the company 
refused to pay the libel claim under the newspapers 
excessliability policy national surety argued that state law 
prohibits an insurer from paying punitive damages which are 
intended to punish and to serve as a deterrent 
richard disalle a former judge had sued the newspaper over a 
1979 article about a disputed will he handled as a lawyer the jury 
awarded disalle 200000 in actual damages and 2 million in 
punitive damages the award came to 277 million with the addition 
of 561000 in interest 
the newspaper paid disalle in july after its primary insurer 
mutual insurance co ltd of bermuda agreed to pay the 1 million 
limit of its coverage half that amount went to disalle and the 
rest covered attorneys fees 
even with insurance covering the bulk of the libel award the 
newspaper will suffer economically block said 
a hiring freeze and other costsaving measures implemented in 
response to the award will remain in effect until at least the end 
of the year business manager raymond burnett said 
we will look at 1990 as a year when we get back to full 
staffing burnett said 
the postgazette said the judgment was the largest paid by a 
newspaper and the secondlargest libel judgment upheld by us 
courts the largest was a 3 million award last year against cbs 
the us supreme court refused to review the disalle libel award 
last june 
national surety attorney robert luddy said the settlement was 
not an admission that the companys position on punitive damages 
was incorrect 
some of these cases are better settled than litigated this 
happened to be one of them he said our position hasnt 
changed

the chairman of a house panel today called for 
stronger measures to protect private pension fund assets so workers 
do not lose their retirement savings to fraud and mismanagement 
we must develop greater safeguards to adequately protect the 
nations private pension fund assets rep bill hughes dnj 
said as he opened a hearing by the house subcommittee on retirement 
income and employment 
our workers and retirees have a right to expect that the 
pensions they have worked so hard to earn and which they are 
counting on to meet basic living expenses during their retirement 
years are not eroded away by waste fraud and corruption he 
said 
the hearing stemmed from reports issued by the labor 
departments inspector general office which pointed to the 
vulnerability of 2 trillion in assets of pension plans covering 76 
million americans 
the latest inspector generals report obtained tuesday by the 
associated press says billions of dollars in private pension money 
is not being fully audited because the money was invested in such 
instiutions as savings and loans 
some labor department officials dispute the extent of the 
problems saying the departments acting inspector general raymond 
maria has exaggerated the potential for fraud maria has likened 
the potential to the recent savings and loan crisis which some 
estimates say will require a 100 billion taxpayer bailout 
david george ball assistant labor secretary for pension and 
welfare benefits told the hearing the pension system by any 
objective measure has never been healthier 
maria in his testimony said our goal is not to unnecessarily 
frighten people but to stimulate concern where such concern is 
needed and to avoid potential future crisis 
he said inadequate regulations and reliance on civil rather than 
criminal remedies have created a window of opportunity for those 
who would embezzle and steal from plan participants 
michael s gordon a member of the labor departments pension 
advisory council said in an interview that not everything in the 
private pension system is peaches and cream but he added that 
the inspector generals office has inspired unnecessary fear and 
anxiety 
either way hughes said there is reason for concern i heard 
the same sectors saying the savings and loan situation wasnt 
serious five years ago he said it seems to me we should have 
learned from history 
concern about the pension system has grown with discovery of a 
number of multimilliondollar skimming schemes and with financial 
difficulties encountered by the federal pension benefit guaranty 
corp which insures private pensions the pbgc is 15 billion in 
the red and that deficit could balloon if the agency loses a 
supreme court case involving ltv corp 
hughes said the pbgc deficit suggests to me we might have a 
more serious problem than the department of labor led us to 
believe 
the hearing by the house subcommittee on retirement income and 
employment was billed as a review of the us department of 
labors efforts to prevent fraud and abuse the subcommittee also 
was to review the latest inspector generals report which 
recommends full audits on a wider array of private pension and 
health programs 
in an earlier study marias office reported that 187 million 
in misused plan assets and administrative violations were found in 
plans examined in late 1987 
but under the employment retirement income security act of 1974 
known as erisa some plans are subject only to partial audits the 
plans must be reviewed annually by private accountants but those 
audits do not cover what happens to the money when it is invested 
in institutions such as savings and loans 
the assumption was that since sampls are subject to their own 
federal inspections pension plan assets invested with them need 
not be audited separately 
but following the savings and loan crisis the new report says 
the current system provides inadequate protection to working 
ameicans whose retirement savings are invested in such plans 
the wellpublicized problems in the savings and loan segment 
of the industry further illustrate the problems that can occur 
the report says 
the report examined 279 audits completed by private accountants 
it found that almost half were not subject to full review 
the result was that in our audit universe 42 billion out of 
98 billion in plan assets 43 percent were never audited the 
report said we believe that 43 percent of employee benefit plan 
assets escaping audit scrutiny is unacceptable 
marias office is asking that congress amend erisa to require 
private accountants to conduct full audits and report infractions 
directly to the labor department it also wants the department to 
lean more heavily toward criminal rather than civil enforcement

desktops 
but from onepound palmtops to 20pounders theres no doubt 
about the sales portables are racking up or the attention they are 
drawing at this years comdex convention the worlds biggest 
computer show 
the overall personal computer market is growing about 10 percent 
a year but sales of portables are expected to triple that growth 
rate for the next three years and sales of machines in the 
8by11inch notebook format will more than quadruple 
predicted tim bajarin executive vice president of creative 
strategies international and a leading silicon valley consultant 
about 300000 portables were shipped in the united states in 
1983 the first year true portables were available he said at a 
panel discussion 
bajarin expects shipments of 14 million this year and 25 
million by 1992 
perhaps hottest of all at the show are compaq computer corps 
sixpound notebooksize lte and lte286 machines they are the 
first of their size to accept 3inch floppy disks which are now 
standard for desktop computers 
compaq officials say their new models are more convenient than 
other machines which use tiny memory cards or smaller disks 
although makers of other models contend the cards are tomorrows 
technology 
compaq officials say they have struggled to meet demand in the 
month since they introduced the two machines the lte begins at 
about 2400 the lte286 which runs on a faster 80286 
microprocessor lists for 3900 to 5000 
among the competing highperformance notebooksize computers are 
the toshiba t1000se and necs ultralite a pioneer when it was 
introduced a year ago the ultralite weighs just 44 pounds has a 
bigger screen than the ltes and costs about the same storage of 
information is on memory cards 
also hot are the onepound minimachines known as palmtops or 
breast pocket computers ataris portfolio which operates on two 
aa batteries for 48 hours fits in a jacket pocket and sells for 
400 not intended to rival its bigger and more expensive cousins 
it has five simple builtin programs 
at about 2000 poqet computer corps palmtop offers a bigger 
screen and keyboard all within the tiny package 
our computer now uses about the same amount of power as a 
single christmas tree twinkle light meaning it can run for 100 
hours on two aa alkaline batteries said poquets president stave 
prodromou 
near the other extreme is dolch computer systems portable 
that uses intels new 80486 microprocessor the hottest most 
powerful chip in the world for personal computers 
the industriallooking dolch weighs nearly 20 pounds but the 
company says it can compete in performance with very highend 
desktop computers and work stations its price is hefty too about 
13000 to 18000 
also on display was a laptop called gridpad it uses a penlike 
device to write on a documentsized screen allowing forms to 
be filled out and even signed on a computer screen 
cyberspaces laptop does away with a screen in favor of headgear 
that projects a hologramlike image that seems to hang in the air 
in front of the user its pitched as a boon for the 
securityconscious no one can look over your shoulder and see what 
youre writing or reading

the chicago board options exchange is 
investigating the possibility that stockindex options were 
manipulated as part of programtrading activity a published report 
says 
the exchange is looking at trading in standard amp poors 100 
stock index options during the oct 13 stock market plunge as well 
as other volatile trading days the wall street journal reported in 
todays editions 
the cboe is the fourth exchange to search for programtrading 
abuses the new york stock exchange and two other chicago exchanges 
are conducting a separate probe of computerassisted program 
trading in stocks and stockindex futures 
cboe president charles henry told the journal that the exchange 
is looking at sources of volatility including trades programs 
or otherwise that may have involved manipulation or other forms of 
rulebreaking 
we are looking at all volatile days henry said we have 
been in touch with the sec frequently about the events and they 
are well aware of the review that is being conducted 
exchange officials did not immediately return telephone calls 
seeking comment 
for years the cboe has been a source of rumors and suspicions 
about programtrading abuses the journal said those suspicions 
partially result from the complexity of optionsrelated 
programtrading strategies that are only understood by the most 
sophisticated traders 
additionally traders say program trades in sampp 100 stock index 
options have moved the market in the past the newspaper said 
program trading is the rapid buying and selling of stocks by 
computer to take advantage of temporary price differences a stock 
option is the right to buy or sell the underlying value of a stock 
index such as the sampp 100 at a specified price within a specified 
time 
the unique feature of stockindex options is that they are 
settled by payment in cash not with delivery or receipt or stocks 
also sampp 100 options can be exercised at any time before their 
expiration date 
the sec reported that the sampp 100 options market reemerged as a 
popular programtrading vehicle after the 1987 crash 
a june 30 sec memo said sampp 100 stock index options were often 
the secondmost heavily used derivative product for index arbitrage 
from november 1988 to april 1989 
program trades involving the sampp 100 options accounted for 8 
percent to 19 percent of total index arbitrage volume for the 
sixmonth period the commission said

as the end of the year approaches financial 
advisers are issuing warnings about a trap that can spring on 
anybody who buys shares of mutual funds 
if you are thinking about getting into a fund or making a 
substantial addition to an existing fund holding before yearend 
they say you should do a little extra research 
the subject of that inquiry is the fund about to declare its 
annual distributions of dividends and capital gains 
if the answer is yes the experts say you might seriously 
consider waiting to invest your money until after the record or 
exdividend date for those distributions and thus miss sticking 
yourself with an unnecessary tax obligation 
the trap works this way 
to qualify for status as investment companies that dont 
themselves have to pay taxes most mutual funds must pass through 
substantially all of their investment income to their shareholders 
each year 
these distributions then become taxable as dividends or capital 
gains to the shareholders 
the typical moneymarket fund or income fund investing in bonds 
declares its dividends daily or at least monthly so it doesnt 
matter much what time of year you choose to invest in these 
by contrast many stock funds or others that might earn capital 
gains for example a fund investing in highyield junk bonds 
that can fluctuate a great deal in price make all or a big chunk 
of their distributions once a year 
the effective date of the distribution is often set between 
middecember and the end of the year for payment a few weeks later 
if you buy fund shares just before the record date you put 
yourself in the position of having some of your capital returned 
almost immediately to you burdened with a tax liability before it 
has had a chance to earn you any real return 
you have acquired a share of the other stockholders 
profits says sheldon jacobs in his handbook for noload fund 
investors 
suppose for illustration purposes that a funds net asset 
value stands at 20 a share when you buy it just before the 
exdistribution date then a 2 distribution is declared lowering 
the net asset value to 18 
presumably you dont want this income in cash you just 
put the money into the fund but even if you have it automatically 
reinvested in new shares you cant duck the tax liability 
no such problem arises if you wait until after the record date 
whatever amount you had set aside to invest will buy 
proportionately more shares at 18 than it would have at 20 
stock funds distributions tend to be especially sizable in bull 
market years such as 1989 
information about a funds plans should be readily available 
through a simple phone call to the fund before you decide to buy 
of course if the investment is being made in an individual 
retirement account or other program that shelters it from current 
taxes the timing of distributions doesnt matter 
but among taxable investors those who show up at the wrong time 
are presented with a share of the bill for a party they didnt 
attend

in the private and mysterious world of 
highpowered jewelry dealing arthur groom stands out like a 
diamond in the rough 
groom 39 whose firm sold 12 million worth of diamonds and 
colored stones last year frequently travels to jungles cavernous 
mines and other remote spots in asia and africa in a constant 
search for the worlds rarest rocks 
like the sailing merchants of centuries past groom will barter 
and trade for many of his stones he recently swapped a shipload of 
cement for 1 million worth of diamond roughs from the african 
nation of sierra leone 
groom seeks stones in dangerous striferidden nations such as 
burma where he says he is only the third american since 1962 to 
gain the rights to deal in rubies most recently groom closed a 
deal to become the sole distributor of american soft drinks in 
burma 
and while most diamond dealers prefer to keep their actions 
cloaked in secrecy groom whose manner is outspoken and friendly 
seeks the spotlight he employs his own media publicist who pitches 
groom as a modernday indiana jones 
there have been very few dealers who are so public said abe 
michael shainberg executive director of new yorks exclusive 
diamond dealers club considered the worlds most important diamond 
exchange the average diamond dealer for security reasons does 
not want such publicity hes an honest and honorable man his 
publicity is good for his business and good for the rest of us 
too 
sitting in a small office at his fashionable store in ridgewood 
groom proudly showed off stones with 100000 price tags the 
shirtsleeved new jersey man who wore no jewelry smiled and 
insisted he is not indiana jones 
no intrigue he said but i do have a message 
groom says american business can exert a positive influence 
throughout the world he is convinced the world respects the 
american system but americans must also understand and respect 
other cultures 
in many cultures the american way does not hold up he 
said how dare we have that attitude that ours is the only way 
grooms story however is the stuff of the american dream he 
left a successful job as a stockbroker for merrill lynch amp co 15 
years ago after his friends father urged him to take a gem course 
that left him absolutely fascinated with precious stones 
groom said he struggled at first working 15hour days in a 
oneroom enterprise as his friends climbed their respective 
corporate ladders arthur groom amp co in ridgewood and his american 
trading co in new york slowly grew into a business with offices 
around the globe 
groom doesnt just cut deals on the telephone he hops on planes 
and goes directly to faraway mines to pick out his own stones and 
diamond roughs one of the few dealers who sells both diamonds and 
colored stones groom is the consummate frequent flyer logging 
more than 150000 miles each year 
i wanted to do things differently he said i think 
running just a single jewelry store is boring 
avoiding boredom means taking risks 
amid a treasure trove of jewelry in the vault at his store is an 
envelope that bears the remnants of a dramatic failure it was a 
diamond that at the final stages of cutting in his new york 
operation exploded the diamonds glitter was suddenly 
replaced by a dull mist 
it was my fault he said explaining that he had failed to 
check a crucial stress point in the rock its absolutely 
worthless now it would have sold for 80000 eighty thousand 
dollars down the drain 
groom said he draws energy from his work 
theres a science to picking stones in the jungle he said 
then you go to the diamond dealers club and pull up your shirt 
sleeves and wheel and deal some saturdays ill simply work the 
floor of this stoor helping an old lady who needs a 10 soldering 
job on a broken chain 
groom said he has changed since his younger days 
i have mellowed groom said once there was pure 
aggressiveness the hardball selling technique now i have a 
different philosophy we went through a period when we did things 
just for money i dont do it for the money i can go to sleep 
every night knowing we do things with integrity

perestroika has hit switzerlands 
oncemoribund watch industry a recently launched wristwatch has a 
hammer and sickle for hands and a red dial with russian lettering 
the perestroika model illustrates how sharp marketing with an 
eye for fashion have helped restore swiss power in world watch 
markets 
swiss watchmakers are headed for their third straight year of 
record revenue buoyed by the success of the plasticcase swatch a 
quartzcontrolled timepiece in trendy designs sixty million have 
been sold since 1983 
we are the only ones to show we can hold off the japanese in 
mass production says nicholas g hayek board president of 
switzerlands main watchmaking conglomerate smh which accounts 
for threequarters of industry exports 
he warns against complacency cost control and product 
development are the bywords in countering asian competition in the 
fight for an estimated 500 million customers annually 
new mediumpriced swiss models some using stylish hardwood or 
stone cases also recaptured ground from japanese manufacturers 
the luxury watch trade a traditional swiss preserve is booming 
in the 1970s far east producers rose to dominance the swiss 
industry unable to match their cheap digital watches and facing 
high labor costs posted big losses 
nowadays it has trouble finding enough qualified workers 
with the major economies prospering consumers will pay for 
watches that are fashion accessories not just timetellers 
swatches come in seasonal collections that now total several 
hundred models 
but a competitive swiss industry reemerged only after its 1970 
workforce of 76000 shrunk to about 30000 and twothirds of the 
factories shut down 
the crisis spelled doom for scattered small shops making the 
more than 100 parts for a fully mechanical watch neat but disused 
plants still dot western switzerlands watchmaking belt 
hayek was tapped in the mid1980s by commercial banks propping 
up an ailing industry in which they were key shareholders 
they said we have no more possibilities to fight japanese and 
hong kong lowcost production wed better stop making watches 
hayek management consultant by trade said in an interview at smh 
headquarters 
we came back with a report saying the contrary 
ernst thomke who conceived swatch and now is smh chief 
executive named the problems in 1982 near the peak of the crisis 
he charged watchmakers had not pulled together and knew little 
about their foreign markets where more than 90 percent of swiss 
watches and movements are sold 
consolidated automated and infused with talent the industry 
last year reported sales of 31 billion a third more than the 
onceleading japanese another 20 percentplus increase is expected 
this year 
hong kong is the top swiss market reexporting most of the 
shipments the united states italy and west germany follow 
every brand has a message it has to be clear understandable 
and unique says hayek 61 who wears three swiss watches on his 
arm 
swatch grabbed us and european buyers with pop colors designs 
including seethrough models and numberless faces and a relatively 
low price about 31 in switzerland a conservative touch there 
are no digital versions didnt hurt 
enterprising swiss soon launched other novelties such as a 
clipon watch 
hayek born in beirut to a lebanese mother and american father 
has run up enough successes in switzerland to be able to operate 
with maverick flair 
until recently he says the watchmakers had been doing things 
the same way for 200 years in a society where people are not 
used to overcoming challenges 
hayek outlines the challenge of the 1990s 
our worry is that the swiss watch industry does not make 
enough efforts to sell more watches he says not only more 
expensive watches but more watches 
industry leaders warn still more must be done to massmarket 
swissmade a new push is on in japan where costly advertising 
copied from the us market had failed to generate major swatch 
sales 
thomke warns hong kong is stealing the show by focusing on 
the united states until very recently switzerlands top export 
market 
but hong kong producing at twice the swiss rate is running 
minimal profits earnings in japans currently reorganizing 
industry also are flat analysts say 
smh has diversified into telephones and other electronics 
fields group profits rose 36 percent last year to 66 million and 
hayek is looking for us investment possibilities 
you have to keep your armies motivated all the time hayek

the rhetoric is heating up as georgiapacific 
corp pursues its spurned bid to buy great northern nekoosa corp 
for 31 billion though both forestproducts companies deny any 
nasty intent 
great northern earlier this week rejected the georgiapacific 
offer in a pair of sharply worded letters one to its shareholders 
and the other to t marshall hahn jr georgiapacifics chairman 
georgiapacific responded with a statement to the media that 
bluntly questioned the motives of great northerns management in 
turning down the 58ashare offer 
georgiapacific announced today that it has lined up commitments 
for 45 billion from 19 domestic and international banks to fund 
the takeover the company said bank of america its primary bank 
since the 1950s has agreed to provide 125 billion of the amount 
also tuesday great northern announced it was challenging a 
ruling by the interstate commerce commission that cleared 
georgiapacific to include great northerns four railroads in the 
proposed acquisition 
norwalk connbased great northern said the icc approved the 
clearance in one day when the process usually takes months 
georgiapacific cut corners and engaged in questionable 
tactics to get the ruling great northern said 
but great northern chairman william r laidig told the atlanta 
journalconstitution that he did not mean for his letter to hahn to 
seem sarcastic or harsh 
and georgiapacific president ronald p hogan said in an 
interview at his companys atlanta headquarters tuesday that he saw 
straightforwardness not anger in great northerns statements 
hogan also said he did not expect georgiapacific which he once 
described as a company of nice people to get nasty as it 
tangles over the offer 
i would hope not he said if you come and offer me 50 
percent or more profit for more of my assets i would think 
youre an awfully friendly guy and i would probably embrace you 
for doing that 
so i dont see how offering a company 50 percent or more 
premium for what its assets have been selling for for the past two 
years would be considered unfriendly he said 
hogan said georgiapacific plans to continue its pursuit of 
great northern but declined to discuss strategy 
hogan said all aspects of the proposal are negotiable though he 
said the offer as it stands provides excellent shortterm benefits 
for great northern shareholders and good longterm prospects for 
his company 
hogan also dismissed concerns raised by great northern about 
antitrust implications of the proposed deal he said he was not 
worried either about an antitakeover regulations in maine where 
great northern is incorporated that some say could block the deal 
hogan said various conditions georgiapacifics confidence in 
the strength of the industry the companys ability to handle the 
debt from a takeover and the compatibility of the two companies 
made the time right to launch the bid 
a takeover of great northern would be one of the largest 
acquisitions ever for georgiapacific a company that has often 
used buyouts to grow over 62 years 
georgiapacific started in 1927 as a lumberyard in augusta when 
founder owen cheatham made a 12000 investment to start a hardwood 
wholesale business known originally as the georgia hardwood lumber 
co 
the company soon began to manufacture hardwood lumber too 
during world war ii it was the largest supplier of lumber to the

after the war in 1947 the company made its first west coast 
acquisition a plywood plant in bellingham wash a string of 
acquisitions followed over the next 10 years 
it was during the 1950s too that the company changed its name 
to georgiapacific and moved its headquarters to portland ore 
where it remained until coming to atlanta in 1982 
the companys roster of acquisitions continued to grow in the 
60s and 70s purchases from coast to coast included paper mills 
a gypsum company chemical plants a kraft pulp mill timberlands 
sawmills and an oil company 
last year the company spent 841 million on acquisitions 
georgiapacific also decided about 1983 to focus more narrowly 
on its pulpandpaper and building products businesses that 
resulted in the divestiture of some of its underperforming assets 
notably the commodity chemicals business which became georgia gulf 
corp 
great northern as georgiapacific sees it fits right in with 
the companys growth pattern it explains why georgiapacific is 
not worried about a white knight riding in to win great 
northern in a bidding war hogan said 
we believe that through the strategic combinations of the two 
businesses great northern is more valuable to georgiapacific 
than it is to any other company hogan said 
great northern had 1988 sales of 36 billion the company owns 
35 million acres of timberland and has 20000 employees at mills 
and factories in arkansas colorado georgia maine mississippi

sears roebuck and co today announced it has 
reached agreement with a boston property investment firm to 
refinance the sears tower the worlds tallest building and the 
retailers corporate headquarters 
the 850 million refinancing deal delays a sale of the 110story 
skyscraper in downtown chicago for at least 15 years 
aew partners a limited partnership managed by aldrich eastman 
amp waltch inc will finance a 15year mortgage on the tower and 
related properties and have an option to buy the building sears 
said in a news release 
the deal will produce net proceeds of 815 million for sears 
the nations largest retailer which had contemplated selling the 
chicago landmark sears said it expects to close the deal by the 
middle of next summer 
the company said that as a result of lower interest rates and 
the positive longterm prospects for the commercial realestate 
market this financing transaction offers more net cash and 
attractive features than alternative structures 
just over a year ago sears announced its intention to sell the 
15yearold tower as part of a corporate restructuring designed to 
halt a slide in its profitability 
the restructuring which brought major changes in the retailers 
merchandising and pricing policies also included moving sears 
retail division headquarters from the tower to an office complex 
that will be built in suburban hoffman estates 
sears began exploring the refinancing option in september after 
a prospective sale of the 1707foot building to canadian developer 
olympia amp york developments ltd collapsed the two reportedly 
couldnt agree on which party would pay the increased property 
taxes certain to result from a reassessment of the property after a 
sale 
the failed deal with olympia amp york was reportedly for 1 
billion when sears first announced plans to sell the building 
realestate experts had speculated it would fetch 12 billion to 
2 billion

the nations only offshore port for 
supertankers hasnt had a serious spill in eight years of 
operation but it hasnt had a profit either 
the clean but poor louisiana offshore oil port is touted as a 
savior of the environment by some and a financial failure by 
others leaving uncertain whether it will be a model for other 
ports around the country 
known as loop the louisiana offshore oil port sits 19 miles off 
the coast in 115 feet of water deep enough for the biggest 
tankers in the world to tie up and unload their crude cargo 
when it was proposed in 1972 supporters said it would cost 250 
million create tens of thousands of jobs and stimulate onshore 
investments 
environmentalists fought the idea warning that it was had the 
potential for oil spills that could devastate louisianas fragile 
wetlands 
both sets of predictions were confounded 
loop cost more than 700 million and has yet to make a profit 
however it has been so clean that interior secretary manuel lujan 
thinks building more deepwater ports around the country would help 
avoid spills like one in alaskas prince william sound 
the loss of oil has been just a thimblefull from every barrel 
thats been through there he said after a visit to the port in 
september 
and it confirms my original thought that the way to avoid oil 
spills is to make sure that tankers dont run aground thats 
whats happened in all our oil spills 
loop looks like a threedeck offshore oil platform around it 
1 miles away are three buoys like floating 42foottall bird 
cages tankers tie up to those buoys while they pump oil through 
long hoses attached to concrete bases on the ocean floor 
the five owners in order of the size of their stakes are usx 
corps marathon oil co texaco inc royal dutch shells shell 
oil co ashland oil inc and murphy oil corp the consortium is 
responsible for paying off the bonds for the project which were 
issued by a state agency to qualify for taxexempt status 
former gov edwin edwards told reporters in 1974 shortly before 
taking office the projections are that it could pay for itself 
in less than 10 years 
instead loop after eight years of operation still owes 565 
million on 731 million in bonds said controller paul simoneaux 
it is handling about half the projected 63 million gallons of 
crude oil a day it lost money until last year when it broke even 
for the first time 
will it make a profit this year 
id rather not comment on that said rc thompson 
president of loop inc a consortium of five oil companies which 
own and operate the platform 
loop depends on strong demand for imported oil and backers were 
stunned when americans responded to the 1970s jump in oil prices by 
conserving 
us imports of oil rose far less than expected in the 1970s and 
actually fell into the mid1980s 
loops prospects have improved now that oil imports are rising 
again nationally imports averaged about 8 million barrels a day 
for the first 10 months of 1989 
loop is geared to oil hauled from the middle east in 
supertankers behemoths which cannot get into most us ports 
ironically for loop to be successful you have to import 
foreign oil lujan said earlier this year 
oil imports are up around the country that makes me believe 
that oil ports would be successful in other places lujan said 
loop has been almost squeaky clean thompson estimates that out 
of 15 billion barrels of oil brought ashore since 1981 850 have 
spilled that works out to about a teaspoonful for every 2300 
gallons moved 
three gallons spilled in all of 1987 
loops location eliminates the threat of groundings and lessens 
the chance that a spill could come ashore radar keeps a continuous 
sweep over a 36squaremile safety zone and special mooring masters 
guide the big ships to and from loops buoys 
exxon said its going to cost them 15 billion to clean up 
prince william sound and the surrounding area wouldnt it be 
better to spend 15 billion to prevent oil spills than to spend it 
cleaning it up lujan said 
environmentalists arent convinced that superports are the 
answer alternatives could include building tankers with double 
hulls improving traffic control and reactivating coast guard 
stations said lisa speer senior scientist at the natural 
resources defense council in new york 
in addition said speer construction and maintenance of such 
ports also could hurt the environment and beaches can be affected 
by spills 20 miles away 
in rhode island within a few hours you had a spill that had 
covered 25 square miles she said offshore spills can still 
impact the shore 
and 15 billion is a drop in the barrel of possible costs for a 
system of offshore ports such as lujan envisions with deepwater 
ports off of houston los angeles philadelphia and alaska 
to replicate loop would cost more than 800 million and probably 
more than 1 billion by various estimates sean connaughton 
marine transportation associate with the american petroleum 
institute said hes seen estimates as high as 2 billion 
on top of that oil users such as refineries that now get direct 
deliveries would have to hook up to a network of asyetunbuilt 
pipelines building those could be even more expensive than 
building the ports connaughton said

smirnoff vodka will be pitching a literacy 
campaign rather than bottles of booze this christmas 
tobacco beer and consumer products giant philip morris 
companies inc is spending 60 million on ads celebrating the bill 
of rights 
burger king corp dumped its regular fastfood ads over the past 
month and aired commercials appealing for money for disaster relief 
efforts 
whats going on here have these companies lost their heads 
shucking the pursuit of profit in an altruistic frenzy egged on by 
president bushs vision of a kinder and gentler society 
or have they discovered that there is prestige to be gained 
attention to be grabbed and money to be made by linking their names 
to fashionable causes 
the answer may lie somewhere in between although some marketing 
experts warn that companies who try to use altruism as a screen for 
seamier bottomline objectives risk a consumer backlash 
there is a limit to how much you can wrap yourself in the 
flag said mike hughes vice chairman and creative director at 
the martin agency an advertising agency based in richmond va a 
lot of consumers are already coming away with the start of a 
cynical viewpoint of this thing 
companies have been associating themselves with noble causes for 
years 
companies want to get the positive association the ruboff 
benefit of whatever institution or cause they are linking 
themselves to said stephen a geyser professor of marketing at 
the harvard business school 
dozens of companies lined up for instance to sponsor events 
tied to the restoration of the statue of liberty the olympics 
offer an opportunity for companies to cash in every four years on 
nationalistic fervor 
members only went further dropping its pitches for stylish 
clothes three years ago and spending all its advertising money on 
antidrug messages even without product advertising its sales 
have risen 22 percent to about 100 million since taking the new 
tack in the fall of 1986 
but getting a sales lift is rarely the immediate objective of 
spending money on good causes more often companies simply want to 
improve their image 
allen rosenshine chairman and chief executive of the 
advertising agency bbdo worldwide said companies promote good 
causes so consumers see them as having a social or community 
conscience 
that is particularly important he said in an era where 
competing products or services in many areas are viewed as being 
essentially the same 
a shopper deciding which beer or burgers to buy may 
understandably be swayed to the company that has shown in its 
advertising that it shares the same values 
it helps differentiate them from the competition said john 
philip jones chairman of the advertising department at syracuse 
universitys newhouse school of public communications 
critics warn the dogood approach has its limits and that savvy 
consumers could turn on companies who use altruism as a screen for 
selfserving efforts to boost market share or to ward off the 
regulators 
companies have to recognize they are on thin ice here said 
martin agencys hughes if they pretend they are doing it only 
for the cause it casts a shadow on everything they do 
philip morris has come under attack from some consumer and 
health groups who say the company is using the 200th anniversary of 
the bill of rights in a cynical effort to reinforce its cigarette 
units campaigns for smokers rights 
the critics are further enraged that philip morris struck a deal 
that allows it to associate itself with the national archives in 
ads that include views of the capitol rotunda and voices of former 
presidents and other leaders 
philip morris said it backed the campaign to draw attention to 
an important national anniversary and to its own corporate 
diversification and denies that the ads were designed to help 
protect the cigarette business from further regulation 
the marketers of smirnoff vodka are spending their entire 1 
million holiday ad budget this year on ads for literacy volunteers 
of america a nonprofit group based in syracuse ny that 
recruits volunteers to teach adults how to read 
help smirnoff end illiteracy in america the ads say the 
smirnoff logo appears in the corner 
charles traynor a marketing executive for the heublein inc 
division that sells smirnoff said smirnoff felt a causerelated 
campaign would help its ads stand out without resorting to the 
gimmicks such as musical computer chips that other liquor 
brands have used in their christmas ads he said backing a cause 
would also appeal to smirnoff drinkers traditional values 
smirnoff is contributing 100000 outright paying for ads that 
solicit donations and setting up special displays with a canister 
in liquor stores for contributions 
two of the groups 370 chapters in baltimore and charleston 
wva declined to participate 
its a hard choice to make when you are desperate for money 
admitted baltimores sister mary judith who heads a community 
group affiliated with literacy volunteers 
miamibased burger king had already begun promoting its bk 
double hamburgers when an earthquake struck the san francisco bay 
area last month 
chief executive barry gibbons told his admakers that burger king 
should give something back to communities struck by earthquakes 
and hurricanes the ads pledge to donate 25 cents to the red cross 
for each bk double sold through nov 23 
the appeal raised 3 million in the first two weeks of the 
fourweek promotion 
still the approach doesnt sit well with critics like hughes 
while what burger king was doing was good it wasnt 
completely noble when they told me i had to buy a whopper he 
said

two twin cities radio stations say they have 
made deals to acquire small pieces of the berlin wall and will give 
them away to listeners 
a third station called the idea pretty tacky 
kdwbfm made the first offer monday morning when announcer steve 
cochran invited listeners to win a piece of the wall by calling the 
station the 25th caller wins 
kjjofm expects to start its promotion friday it will give away 
its 40 small pieces by asking listeners to call when they hear 
songs with wall in the titles 
already capitalism is working said tony powers operations 
manager and program director of kjjo 
mike boen general manager at ktcz said he was noncommittal 
when a radio syndicate offered his station pieces of the wall 
my reaction was the same as my program directors some people 
will sell anything boen said 
the promotion trivializes the whole episode he said it 
kind of hit us as pretty tacky 
powers said he received a call friday from the jameson group 
which syndicates programs to stations around the country jameson 
had acquired a section of the wall from a german affiliate and is 
using a stonemason to make these little cubes powers said 
the price was 500 for 40 pieces sealed in plastic and 
accompanied by signed certificates 
cochran said he didnt think the giveaway cheapens the event 
its a way of bringing it home he said

the us postal service announced wednesday 
that it has become an official sponsor of the 1992 olympic games 
postmaster general anthony frank cited three reasons for the 
action improving the image of the agency generating increased 
revenues and supporting the olympics 
being a worldwide sponsor of the olympics will cost between 10 
million and 15 million said assistant postmaster general peter k 
eichorn 
but it is expected to generate 300 million to 400 million in 
increased revenues for the service through added business in the 
small parcel and express mail business and the sale of special 
olympic goods to collectors he said 
every dollar in increased revenues is a dollar that doesnt have 
to be obtained from higher postage rates frank said 
the sponsorship costs will be shared by many other national 
postal services which will become subsponsors of the worldwide 
olympics and like the us postal service sponsors of their 
national olympic teams costs will be divided according to the size 
of each country and its mail volume 
those sponsorships include the right to use olympic symbols on 
equipment and products including stamps issued on connection with 
the event 
the 1992 winter games will be held in albertville france and 
the summer games will be in barcelona spain 
twentytwo other national postal services have already signed on 
as subsponsors of the 1992 olympics eichorn said 
they are australia austria belgium brazil canada cyprus 
france west germany hong kong ireland israel italy japan 
south korea mexico netherlands new zealand nigeria portugal

britain faces a difficult year in 1990 with 
continued high inflation and a slowdown in economic growth to 125 
percent chancellor of the exchequer john major said wednesday 
last years economic growth rate of 44 percent will be cut by 
more than half to 2 percent this year he said 
but the economy must slow down to bring surging inflation 
decisively down and keep it down major said in his first 
autumn statement to parliament outlining the governments public 
spending plans 
the new treasury chief made it clear that he has little 
intention of easing tight monetary or fiscal policy leaving the 
prospect of continued high interest and mortgage rates and tight 
control on government spending 
but major announced expenditures above the expected rate of 
inflation in some key and politically sensitive areas the 
national health service public transportation higher education 
and the homeless 
majors statement three weeks after he replaced nigel lawson as 
treasury chief caused little stir on financial markets and was 
welcomed by industry chiefs it was a realistic prognosis of hard 
times said bill martin chief british economist at ubsphillips 
and drew ltd 
but john smith the opposition labor partys treasury spokesman 
told the house of commons that the governments economic 
miracle had been revealed as a hollow sham 
the british government considers inflation its top economic 
problem and has raised base lending rates from a low of 75 percent 
last year to their current 15 percent level in an effort to choke 
inflationary pressures 
the annual rate of inflation rose to a peak of 83 percent in 
june and currently stands at 76 percent among the highest of 
western industrialized nations 
i expect it to remain high for some months before falling to 
575 percent in the last quarter of 1990 major said 
inflation is running at a far higher level than lawson forecast 
in the march budget when britains revenueraising plans were 
unveiled lawson had predicted a 55 percent rate in the fourth 
quarter of this year dipping to 45 percent by the second quarter 
of next year 
our main priority must be to bring inflation decisively down 
and keep it down major said to achieve this the economy must 
slow down for a while this does mean that 1990 may not be an easy 
year but the economy enters the 1990s in incomparably better shape 
than it entered the 1980s 
the chancellor forecast a steep rise this year in the countrys 
current account deficit which includes invisible trade such as 
overseas investment earnings as well as merchandise trade 
the deficit will soar to 20 billion pounds or 316 billion in 
1989 from last years 146 billion pounds or 23 billion this was 
a 38 percent increase over lawsons march forecast of a deficit of 
145 billion pounds or 229 billion this year 
major projected a 1990 deficit of 15 billion pounds or 24 
billion as the economy braked and the demand for imports shrank 
lawson had said that a widening current account deficit this 
year shouldnt be of significant concern maintaining it was due to 
heavy investment in british industry and was not chiefly the result 
of consumer spending 
major however linked the shortfall to unanticipated growth in 
consumer spending but he said that he anticipated improvement in 
1990 due to growth of already strong exports and a reduction in 
domestic demand 
as domestic demand slows import growth should moderate 
major said at the same time the strong rise in exports which 
has been one of the most welcome developments in 1989 is forecast 
to continue 
britain will enjoy a budget surplus of 125 billion pounds or 
198 billion in the current fiscal year ending march 31 but 
major said it will be lower than lawsons forecast because of less 
income than expected from the privatization of nationalized 
industries

the senate today refused for the second day in 
the row to shut off debate on president bushs proposed 
capitalgains tax cut killing the issue for the year 
the vote was 5147 nine short of the 60 required to limit 
debate the margin was the same on tuesday 
in the end we will win this battle next year sen bob 
packwood rore said after the first vote 
congressional leaders had agreed in advance that the two days of 
senate debate on the proposal would put the issue to rest until 
next year 
at the white house earlier today presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater told reporters we consider yesterdays vote just the 
beginning 
bush promised a capital gains cut in last years presidential 
campaign as a way to encourage investment and create jobs the 
proposal has dominated debate over budget issues for several months 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine pleaded for 
democratic loyalty and assailed bush for spending so much effort to 
win the cut a reduction mitchell said would bloat the deficit by 
tens of billions of dollars in the long run and serve up a major 
tax windfall for the nations richest people 
this amendment evinces no concern about investment or with the 
future mitchell said it is concerned only with the present 
and the political benefits that may flow from cutting taxes 
given our circumstances when so many in our nation are 
without decent housing cannot afford an education lack health 
insurance it is a travesty that the senate should now be seriously 
considering a huge tax cut for the very wealthy with no evidence 
that it will assist the economy mitchell said 
economists estimate that 80 percent of the benefit of a cut in 
taxes on capital gains profits from the sale of investments 
would go to people with incomes above 100000 a year those with 
incomes above 200000 would get tax cuts averaging 24000 
republicans accused opponents of engaging in classwarfare 
rhetoric 
this is a situation where everyone gains said packwood 
contending a tax cut would benefit investors while producing 
increased revenue for the government to spend on social programs 
you dont get many deals better than that 
the house with backing of one of every four democrats approved 
a different capital gains cut in september 
present law fully taxes capital gains at the same rates that 
apply to wages and other income 
the packwoodroth plan would mean lower taxes for capital gains 
the longer an asset was held the less of the profit from its sale 
would be taxed 
only 95 percent of the profit from the sale of an asset owned 
more than one year would be taxed that percentage would increase 
by five points for each additional year up to seven only 65 
percent of the gain would be taxed when property owned more than 
seven years is sold 
investments in smaller companies would get an even better break 
up to 50 percent could escape taxation 
the senate proposal written by packwood and sen bill roth 
rdel would combine a capital gains tax cut with expanded 
individual retirement accounts unlike existing iras which permit 
some workers to avoid tax on contributions of up to 2000 a year 
the new version would simply exempt from tax any inerest earned on 
an ira 
in addition a worker could make penaltyfree withdrawals from 
the new iras for paying medical or education expenses

an increasing number of residential properties are 
being sold on the auction block as the regions slumping real 
estate market prompts foreclosures on homes and developments that 
have trouble attracting buyers 
we are seeing some foreclosures in our area where there used 
to be one or two now there seems to be more carol sager 
coowner of century 21 sager real estate in lowell said wednesday 
the state land court in boston has seen a steep increase in 
foreclosures and auctions of all kinds across massachusetts 
although banking officials say owners of singlefamily homes have 
not been hit as hard as condominium developers 
in 1987 253 foreclosure filings culminated with an auction 
meaning no one stepped in to pay off the mortgage last year the 
number rose to 546 and this year the total already has reached 
1100 
charles trombly recorder for the court said the figures are 
not broken down into specific categories 
its everything he said its condos its people who get 
laid off at wang who get in over their heads 
banking officials blame much of the trouble on a real estate 
boom earlier this decade that led to an oversupply of building 
space especially in condominiums 
robert eisenberg president of new england financial resources 
inc in boston which manages assets for banks said some of the 
outlying areas from boston have been particularly troublesome for 
developers trying to sell condominiums 
i think its very clear in southern new hampshire there was a 
bit more optimism exhibited than there should have been 
eisenberg said certainly there was not a lot of sober thought 
given to some of these projects 
the foreclosures have accelerated at an accelerating pace 
he said bankruptcy is a growth industry and unfortunately 
there is a lot of human suffering 
such an example came earlier this year when andrew lane of 
southborough the states largest housing developer headquartered 
in massachusetts filed for bankruptcy protection lane blamed the 
regions slow real estate market for his companys problems 
bankruptcy filings in new england are up about 50 percent from 
last year and more than half are related to real estate projects 
said virginia greiman us trustee whose office monitors 
bankruptcy cases for the new england region 
greiman said many people file for bankruptcy protection from 
creditors to buy time in the foreclosure process 
you have developers with all these condo projects and no one 
buying them so they have no cash flow to meet their expenses 
she said 
while condominium developers have been hit hard bank officials 
say owners of singlefamily homes have not had as much trouble 
foreclosures on houses correlate less directly to the real estate 
market and stem more from general economic conditions such as 
unemployment which result in people having trouble paying their 
bills 
despite a wave recent layoffs in the high tech industry 
regional unemployment remains relatively low so forecasts of a 
recession have not yet translated to a surge of foreclosures on 
houses said bill jones vice president at bancboston mortgage 
corp a subsidiary of bank of boston 
jones said that about 16 percent of his banks residential 
loans are delinquent compared with about 15 percent at the same 
time last year 
firms that conduct auctions nonetheless report that some 
homeowners are losing their houses to foreclosure 
mark enik president of us auction inc in hyannis said many 
of these people bought second homes such as around cape cod and 
now are having trouble making payments 
these people also have trouble selling the homes because they 
were bought when prices were peaking and the houses end up being 
auctioned 
they thought they can always sell the property in the worst 
case enik said but a lot of them cannot sell

the value of farmland in the midwest 
continues to rebound and agricultural bankers in five states expect 
interest in the land market to be active through this winter a 
federal reserve bank analyst said wednesday 
a new survey of 500 bankers by the federal reserve bank of 
chicago said the value of farmland in the midwest rose 17 percent 
during the third quarter of 1989 
weve had quite a sharp rebound in farmsector earnings and 
that has been an important factor in the increases in farmland 
values said gary benjamin analyst for the reserve bank 
in addition peoples expectations of the future have improved 
and one factor is the uptrend in farm exports benjamin added 
people think that trend in exports will continue 
farmland values in the midwest peaked around 1981 and then began 
a decline that lasted more than five years and cut the price of 
some farmland in half 
benjamin said the recovery began late in 1986 
many of the bankers expect the farmland market to remain 
active this fall and winter with continued interest by both farmer 
and nonfarmer investors he said 
there was some variation in farmland values among the five 
midwest states during july august and september 
wisconsin farmland values rose 36 percent during the third 
quarter while illinois and iowa posted gains of about 2 percent 
there was virtually no change in indiana and michigan from the 
second quarter 
on an annual basis farmland values in the five states are up 8 
percent from a year ago illinois and indiana logged the biggest 
increases with 9 percent increases the smallest gain was 
michigans 4 percent 
benjamin said nearly 32 percent of the bankers surveyed expect 
the value of farmland in their areas to rise during the fourth 
quarter of this year 
interest rates on realestate loans which had risen over a 
twoyear period ending early this year have recorded two 
consecutive quarterly declines benjamin said the average rate at 
the end of the third quarter was 1134 percent 
many bankers expect both farmers and other investors to buy more 
farmland in the midwest through early spring 
more than a third of the respondents stated they expect the 
volume of farmland transfers over the next six months to be higher 
than the comparable period of a year ago while an additional 53 
percent expect no change said benjamin 
more than 36 percent of the bankers surveyed said they expect 
the demand for farmland to increase among investors who are not 
currently farming he said

sears roebuck and co removed the for sale 
sign wednesday from the worlds tallest building saying it had 
decided not to sell sears tower but to use it as collateral for an 
850 million loan 
sears said it expected to sign by midsummer a 15year 
convertible mortgage agreement with aew partners a limited 
partnership formed by aldrich eastman amp waltch inc a pension 
fund realestate investment manager based in boston 
the deal will provide sears with 815 million after expenses and 
give aew an option to buy the 110story downtown chicago landmark 
at the end of the loan period said douglas fairweather a sears 
spokesman 
if aew chooses to take possession of the 1707foot building 
rather than accept repayment of the loan fairweather said the 
partnership would be required to pay sears the balance of the 
towers full 1989 value as well as a portion of its appreciated 
value 
chicagobased sears the nations largest retailer and a 
financialservices leader announced just over a year ago that it 
would sell its 15yearold headquarters building as part of a 
corporate restructuring designed to halt a slide in its profits 
but after a prospective sale of the tower to canadian developer 
olympia amp york developments inc fell through in september sears 
decided to take advantage of a drop in interest rates and refinance 
the tower which it owns free and clear 
when sears announced plans on oct 31 1988 to sell the 
building we said that what we wanted to do was take out the 
appreciated value of this asset to invest in our core businesses 
and repurchase 10 percent of our shares fairweather said 
while a sale seemed to be a better way to achieve our 
objectives when we made this announcement by the time we did this 
deal financing the building was a better alternative he said 
interest rates on longterm loans for prime real estate such as 
sears tower have fallen by as much as a full percentage point to 
about 9 percent in the past year said john oharenko managing 
partner in the chicago office of cushman amp wakefield inc a 
commercial realestate firm 
commercial realestate loans typically reflect up to 80 percent 
of a propertys fair market value he said 
fairweather said sears will use proceeds from the tower deal to 
pay down debt incurred through its repurchase over the past year of 
about 40 million shares of its stock at about 40 a share and to 
invest in its core businesses which include the sears retailing 
division dean witter reynolds brokerage services allstate 
insurance and coldwell banker real estate 
sears restructuring also includes a plan to move its retailing 
headquarters from sears tower to a yettobe built office complex 
in suburban hoffman estates by the end of 1992 
some of chicagos commercial real estate experts have said the 2 
million square feet of office space to be vacated by the retailing 
division is badly in need of remodeling both to modernize the 
facilities and to subdivide it into smaller areas 
fairweather indicated that sears would be doing some remodeling 
in the tower 
even though its a worldclass building were aware of the 
fact there are opportunities to enhance its value and well be 
doing that he said

desktop video for personal computers is finally 
getting past the hype stage many computer experts say 
new computers and software let users knit writing and sounds 
together with graphics video and animation in a package that lets 
the user control the images and talk back 
interactive multimedia or desktop video the jargon phrases for 
all this is like desktop publishing three years ago according 
to sam albert a longtime executive for international business 
machines corp who now runs a consulting business in scarsdale ny 
this thing is exploding very rapidly albert said wednesday 
the third day of the huge comdex computer convention in las vegas 
tim bajarin a strategic planning consultant to ibm apple 
computer inc compaq computer corp and other companies has 
compiled the names of 350 people already producing multimedia 
sample uses worker trainees watch a master repairman in action 
rather than read a boring manual a salesman calls up video images 
of swatches of cloth and suggested configurations of desks and 
chairs for buyers of office furniture 
the recreational possibilities are also amazing with the 
potential for home computer users to integrate the functions of 
stereos videocassettes and compact disks 
the promise of the technology was blasted home to 
conventiongoers monday by keynote speaker george h conrades 
senior vice president at ordinarily conservative ibm and a pretty 
fair drummer back in his college days 
in a presentation that was more show than speech conrades 
pulled out his drumsticks and started blamming away on synthetic 
drums as part of an extravagant demonstration of controllable sight 
and sound 
at a touch conrades summoned images of swooping eagles 
careening roller coasters and bridges that collapsed at whatever 
speed he chose or whatever speed a structural engineer might 
choose which was the point he was making 
opportunity is everywhere conrades said noting that 
despite the maturing of the computer industry 90 percent of the 
businesses in the country are still without computers 
training education and sales are vast and obvious markets with 
applications from the mundane to the sublime 
john mccloskey of leader systems showed off a program that 
explains the complexities of insurance with specifics on various 
plans available at a touch 
ucla music history professor robert winter uses multimedia to 
teach beethoven a click of the mouse controlling his macintosh 
produces biographical tidbits another click might produce a 
musical theme or additional fragments to show how its developed 
because desktop computers have become so powerful they can now 
hold and manipulate enough information fast enough to produce 
controllable television images with breathtaking resolution 
pictures far sharper than on a conventional tv 
that could mean for example that images of every picture in 
the louvre can be stored for retrieval by art lovers or students 
who could zoom right in on mona lisas smile clear as a bell 
experts said at a panel discussion involving officials of ibm 
apple and commodore international ltd which makes the amiga 
with addons to funnel sound video and text in and combine them 
with computergenerated graphics and text multimedia can now be 
done for perhaps 5000 compared with 50000 just a few years 
ago the experts said 
david archambault director of project marketing for commodore 
used an amiga to generate an impromptu commercial that combined 
pictures of the computers music and a swirling animated company

archambault said that 2 billion is spent every year in the 
united states on computers for education alone 
we feel multimedia is deliverable to a number of these niche 
markets today he said

jerry samuels an energy broker at shearson lehman hutton inc 
said the latest production and inventory report from the american 
petroleum institute showed higherthanexpected heating oil stocks 
reflecting slack demand 
it is going to get cold here one day but there isnt much

the chicago board options exchange is 
investigating reports of programtrading abuses to determine 
whether rules were violated during days of hectic trading exchange 
officials said wednesday 
the worlds largest options marketplace is looking at trading in 
standard amp poors 100 stockindex options during the oct 13 market 
plunge as well as on other volatile trading days said cboe 
president charles henry 
the cboe is the fourth major exchange to search for 
programtrading abuses the new york stock exchange the chicago 
board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange are conducting 
separate probes of computerassisted program trading in stocks and 
stockindex futures 
those three exchanges have tightened surveillance measures and 
imposed stiff fines after longterm federal scrutiny resulted in 
numerous indictments and convictions 
henry downplayed the cboe investigation saying the exchange has 
routinely monitored days of heavy trading since 1987 
we have an ongoing study he said in a telephone interview 
we also make sure participants in our market behave as they are 
supposed to 
program trading is the rapid buying and selling of stocks by 
computer to take advantage of temporary price differences a stock 
index option is the right to buy or sell the underlying value of a 
stock index such as the sampp 100 at a specified price within a 
specified time 
the cboe is looking at sources of volatility including 
trades program or otherwise that may have involved manipulation 
or other forms of rulebreaking henry said 
for years the exchange has been the subject of rumors about 
programtrading abuses rumors prompted partly by the complexity 
of optionsrelated programtrading strategies 
program trading involving stockindex options commonly called 
oex has also been blamed as a contributor to stock market 
volatility 
tom bond cboe vice president pointed to three particular days 
of heavy trading that are under scrutiny 
one was oct 13 when the dow jones industrial average fell 
19058 points its second biggest oneday point loss ever the 
second was oct 16 when the dow rallied 8812 points the third day 
was oct 24 when the dow jones industrials dropped 80 points 
before rallying to finish the day with a 369point loss 
the cboes scrutiny of trading practices may date back to a 
classaction lawsuit filed against the exchange after the october 
1987 stock market crash 
a group of more than 1000 investors contend in the lawsuit that 
the cboe and floor traders responsible for making markets in 
certain options on the sampp 100 violated federal law and the 
exchanges own rules by charging inflated prices for options 
contracts 
in may the securities and exchange commission censured the cboe 
for failing to enforce its own rules on trading manipulation 
involving stocks and options on standard amp poors 500 index 
program trades involving the sampp 100 options accounted for 8 
percent to 19 percent of total index arbitrage volume between 
november 1988 and april 1989 the sec noted

moneylosing eastern airlines is keeping cutrate 
fares to florida this winter in an effort to bring back passengers 
officials said wednesday 
what were really doing is generating revenue said george 
brennan easterns vice president for marketing we know a lot 
about florida and how to stimulate travel we have an awful lot 
of seats coming into florida this winter 
the existing fare structure is a fare structure that is 
doing nothing to stimulate travel into florida brennan said 
our objective obviously is to make money 
the fares with relatively few restrictions are effective 
immediately for travel between nine florida cities and 45 other 
us cities 
they are significant because the airline industry usually boosts 
winter season fares to vacation points eastern officials said the 
majority of fliers to florida are discretionary or leisure 
travelers brennan said spurring eastern to offer incentives to 
them 
a miamitonew york fare based on roundtrip purchase would be 
99 each way midweek compared with a current fare of 139 in many 
cases eastern is maintaining backinbusiness discount fares 
aimed at regaining business lost since the airline was hit by a 
strike on march 4 and entered chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
five days later 
passengers must make reservations before dec 15 and purchase 
their tickets if space is available seven days in advance the 
tickets are fully refundable brennan said although the fares are 
part of a winter promotion reservations can be made for anytime in 
the future he said and will be honored with sevenday advance 
purchase 
the fares require twonight stays but the nights dont have to 
be on a weekend he said blackout dates on which normal fares 
apply are southbound into florida dec 2126 and northbound out 
of florida jan 13 
a fare structure effective jan 6 will continue to offer 
discounts below industry averages but about 20 each way higher 
than easterns bargain fares 
miamibased eastern is flying 335 flights in and out of the nine 
florida cities miami fort lauderdale west palm beach tampa 
orlando daytona beach sarasota fort myers and melbourne 
easterns announcement came after last weeks thirdquarter 
report showed a net loss of 1852 million amid indications the 
airline has informed its major creditors of a 200 million cash 
shortfall 
it is used more as a marketing tool to attract attention 
said robert joedicke an airline analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york its calculated to create a loss but 
its calculated to regain critical mass or market share eastern 
must be particularly active to win people back 
eastern officials trying to rebuild without the unions have 
said the airline will emerge from bankruptcy early next year at 
nearly 90 percent its prestrike size eastern is back to 775 daily 
flights compared with nearly 1100 before the ongoing strike began

ronald holzer a vice president and chief dealer for harris

is that it would show a narrowing of the deficit to between 8 
billion and 9 billion

weakness particularly by showing a decline in us exports the

payments principal payments were deferred several years ago 
argentinas debt to foreign commercial banks governments and 
agencies like the world bank amounts to about 60 billion plus 
about 45 billion in overdue interest 
citibank which is operated by citicorp is owed about 15 
billion more than any other us bank except manufacturers hanover 
trust 
reed said foreign bankers approve of president carlos menems 
program of economic austerity and structural reform

silver futures prices soared to sixmonth highs wednesday while 
gold and platinum the recent leaders of the surging precious 
metals group fell back 
on other commodity markets pork futures prices rose sharply 
amid talk of further food aid to poland grains and soybeans were 
mostly higher and energy futures were mixed 
silver futures settled 13 cents to 151 cents higher on new 
yorks commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in 
december at 5538 a troy ounce the highest price for a nearmonth 
silver contract since may 12

39280 a troy ounce platinum settled 520 to 530 lower on the 
new york mercantile exchange with january at 52040 a troy ounce 
precious metals prices have risen broadly since oct 13 when a 
190point plunge in the dow jones industrials average triggered a 
rush of investment dollars to the perceived safety of the metals 
but the silver market has lagged behind gold and platinum 
possibly because silver is in greater supply from oct 13 through 
tuesday gold prices had risen by 75 percent platinum by 69 
percent and silver by just 49 percent 
silver played catchup on wednesday pushing its gains since 
friday the 13th to 78 percent 
i view it as the rubberband effect said bernard savaiko 
senior metals analyst with painewebber inc in new york platinum 
and gold had already had good moves and investors veiwed silver as 
too cheap relative to gold 
some traders express the silvergold price relationship in terms 
of the number of ounces of silver it would take to equal the value 
of one ounce of gold a ratio in excess of 70to1 is often 
interpreted by professional traders as a signal to buy silver and 
sell gold said james steel an analyst with refco inc 
at the close of trading tuesday the silvergold ratio was about 
73to1 and it approached 74to1 early in wednesdays session at 
that point steel said the logical thing was to switch into the 
silver market 
pork futures prices skyrocketed on the chicago mercantile 
exchange after white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
united states probably would send more food aid to poland 
the government already has committed to send 10000 metric tons 
of pork bellies to poland as part of a foodaid package 
firm cash markets also supported the pork and cattle markets 
live cattle settled 23 cent to 55 cent higher with december at 
7497 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 45 cent higher 
with november at 8330 cents a pound live hogs were 30 cent to 
137 cents higher with december at 4927 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 72 cent to 138 cents higher with february at 6387 
cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the chicago 
board of trade paced by strength in the wheat market linked to 
dryness in us winter wheat growing areas 
the agriculture departments confirmation of new sales of wheat 
to egypt and the philippines 50000 metric tons apiece also 
helped the wheat market as did a report of frost damage to wheat 
in argentina 
wheat settled 2 cents to 4 cents higher with december at 405 
a bushel corn was cent lower to 2 cents higher with december at 
239 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents higher with december 
at 145 a bushel soybeans were cent lower to 4 cents higher 
with november at 579 a bushel 
wholesale home heating oil prices fell on the new york

unusually warm weather on the east coast crude oil and gasoline

west texas intermediate crude oil settled 08 cent lower to 17 
cent higher with december at 1967 a barrel heating oil was 05 
cent to 61 cent lower with december at 5713 cents a gallon

members of the senate judiciary committee 
accepted 146 million in contributions from lobbyists trying to 
weaken antiracketeering laws consumer activist ralph nader said 
wednesday 
the committee on thursday is to consider a bill changing a 
provision in the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
rico which permits civil plaintiffs to recover triple damages 
from whitecollar criminals 
public citizen a group founded by nader told a news conference 
that trade groups representing accountants savings and loans 
securities and commodities firms banks and insurance companies 
showered the 14 members of the senate panel with contributions from 
1983 to 1988 
nader took particular aim at sen dennis deconcini dariz who 
accepted 213450 and is the sponsor of the reform bill 
deconcini and four other senators have come under fire for 
meeting with savings and loan regulators on behalf of phoenix 
ariz millionaire charles h keating jr a heavy contributor to 
their campaigns 
keating is chairman of the parent company of lincoln savings and 
loan association of irvine calif the institutions failure is 
expected to cost taxpayers up to 2 billion 
in an attempt to recover some of the loss regulators have filed 
a 11 billion civil rico suit against keating and his associates 
now the ringleader of the keating five clearly the most 
shamelessly shameless of all senators sen deconcini would 
weaken the very law used by regulators and victims of corporate 
crime against his friend charles keating nader said this has 
to be the acme of congressional presumption 
deconcini in a statement responded that he supported narrowing 
rico because it has been misused to target legitimate businesses 
his bill specifically permits bank regulators to seek triple 
damages and would not benefit special interests he said 
the senator said his original bill would have applied to pending 
lawsuits such as the one filed against keating but has been 
changed so that it affects only suits filed after the legislation 
passed 
a coalition of business labor and civil liberties groups 
backing rico changes issued a statement saying it was appalled 
that public citizen would personally attack deconcini and labeled 
the news conference a last ditch effort to stop a vote on rico 
reform legislation 
ramona e jacobs a glendale calif woman who lost 11000 in 
the lincoln failure complained at the news conference that 
deconcini who conducted a hearing on his bill in june would not 
allow her to testify on behalf of fraud victims 
without triple damages in such civil suits wrongdoers will 
quickly find out that crime particularly against defenseless 
citizens pays said ms jacobs who said her loss included an 
insurance settement from an automobile accident that left her 
daughter brain damaged 
colorado securities commissioner philip a feigin speaking on 
behalf of the north american securities administrators association 
said the deconcini bill represents a concession of colossal 
proportions and the emasculation of the single most potent 
weapon against whitecollar crime 
according to public citizen the other senators on the judiciary 
panel in addition to deconcini and the contributions they 
received from 1983 through 1988 from the targeted trade groups were 
arlen specter rpa 240632 charles grassley riowa 
219250 howell heflin dala 157400 orrin hatch rutah 
128600 gordon humphrey rnh 117903 patrick leahy dvt

the labor department on wednesday sought to 
quell fears about private pension fund fraud telling congress the 
system has never been healthier but a house panel chairman 
said there is reason for concern 
david george ball an assistant labor secretary appeared before 
the house retirement income subcommittee to dispute warnings from 
his departments own inspector generals office about the potential 
for fraud 
at the same hearing the acting inspector general raymond 
maria said lax auditing and enforcement have created a window of 
opportunity for unscrupulous managers to pilfer americans 
pensions 
rep bill hughes dnj chairman of the subcommittee on 
retirement income and employment said the public need not panic 
but cautioned ignoring a situation where such large sums of 
money are subjected to few effective outside investigations 
combined with the minor penalties which are often imposed for those 
who have misused funds seems to me to be asking for trouble 
the private pension system holds 2 trillion in assets and 
covers 76 million americans concern about the plans wellbeing 
has been heightened by discovery of several multimilliondollar 
pension skimming schemes and financial problems in the governments 
pension insurance program which is 15 billion in the red 
following the hearing hughes said his is asking the general 
accounting office the congressional investigator to look into the 
labor departments handling of investigations 
ball assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare 
benefits said that despite those problems the pension system by 
any objective measure has never been healthier 
in an earlier interview hughes expressed skepticism about such 
assurances i heard the same sectors saying the savings and loan 
situation wasnt serious five years ago he said 
maria an outspoken former fbi agent stayed away from dramatic 
comparisons in his testimony wednesday and said our goal is not 
to unnecessarily frighten people but to stimulate concern where 
such concern is needed and to avoid potential future crisis 
he said inadequate regulations and reliance on civil rather than 
criminal remedies have created a window of opportunity for those 
who would embezzle and steal from plan participants 
maria also used the forum to air inhouse fighting in the labor 
department which led to a justice department opinion in march 
barring his office from directly investigating private pension 
plans that job is handled by the departments pension benefits 
welfare administration which has 300 inspectors to police the 
nations 870000 private pension programs 
over the past five years more than 25 percent of the plans 
audited by the agency had violations of the 1974 employee 
retirement income security act known as erisa but the pwba on a 
yearly average investigates less than 1 percent of the nations 
pension plans 
the inspector generals office wants the law changed to require 
private accountants who audit pension programs to report any 
violations to the labor department it also says the labor 
department should pursue more criminal cases against violators 
rather than relying largely on civil suits 
ball responded that the departments enforcement policy is 
designed to deliver the biggest bang for the buck and affecting 
the most participants possible 
he said the labor department concentrates on plans covering more 
than 100 employees and targets its investigations on plans which 
we believe have a high chance of violating the law 
marias office in a report released to the house subcommittee 
said billions of dollars in private pension money is not being 
fully audited because the money was invested in such institutions 
as savings and loans the assumption was that money in federal 
institutions was subject to other examinations 
the american institute of certified public accountants in a 
statement received wednesday agreed with the inspector generals 
office saying congress should change these regulations to give 
auditors a fighting chance to do a thorough job 
in an earlier study marias office reported that 187 million 
in missed plan assets and administrative violations were found in 
plans examined in late 1987

united airlines says its pilots union is bound by 
federal law to fly two new jumbo jets but the pilots say that 
unless they have a new contract by a nov 22 deadline those planes 
will be grounded 
lawyers for the company have told the air line pilots 
association that its members at united must continue to fly two new 
boeing 747400s alpa spokeswoman kathie hardin said 
joe hopkins a spokesman for uniteds parent ual corp declined 
comment on the issue 
the planes purchased last summer fly from los angeles to the 
australian cities of sydney and melbourne within the next few 
months united plans to acquire a third 747400 for its san 
franciscohong kong route 
the united pilots originally refused to fly the planes in a 
dispute over the size of cockpit crews 
they later reversed their position as part of concessions 
granted during negotiations for a pilotmanagement buyout of ual 
and also agreed to fly four extra hours a month without pay 
but after the pilotmanagement group failed to get financing for 
its 675 billion buyout proposal on oct 13 the pilots threatened 
to ground the planes on nov 22 unless there is sufficient progress 
toward a revised employeeled buyout or toward a contract 
settlement 
the united pilots have been working without a contract since 
april 1988 
alpas executive board is scheduled to discuss uals position on 
the new jetliners thursday and friday as well as a contract 
proposal submitted by the company on monday ms hardin said 
alpa rejected as a piece of trash a ual proposal offered 
last week the first since the buyout effort collapsed 
grounding one of those new planes for a year could reduce 
uniteds revenue by about 50 million industry experts say 
ual contends that alpa which represents the 7000 united 
pilots would violate the federal railway labor act by refusing to 
fly the planes ms hardin said in a telephone interview 
uniteds taking the position that although it chose not to 
argue the point last summer our not flying the 747400s is 
illegal she said 
we say that theres no language in our existing contract for 
747400 flying 
ms hardin said she did not know what provision in the federal 
law would be applicable to the pilots union 
an official at the national mediation board in washington dc 
said the law used in negotiating airline industry contracts 
generally requires pilots to abide by terms of their contracts 
which commonly specify the types of planes they will fly 
ual might argue that the 747400 is a derivative of an existing 
plane that is covered in the pilots contract said the official 
who asked that he not be identified by name 
but he said the airline would have to go to court to determine 
whether the laws provisions apply to the new planes 
such an action would be sure to damage the improved relationship 
between ual management and pilots that resulted from participation 
in the failed buyout bid

investor t boone pickens expanded his attack on 
japanese business practices wednesday accusing toyota motor co of 
coercive and anticompetitive practices 
pickens based his complaints on reports toyota is threatening to 
reduce its relationship with koito manufacturing co if boone co 
pickens investment company succeeds in gaining seats on koitos 
board 
i see these reports as direct threats against koito that 
blatantly expose toyotas coercive and anticompetitive 
practices pickens said 
toyota is koitos largest customer for automobile lighting parts 
toyota has something to hide pickens said in a statement 
they dont want me or any outsider looking over their control and 
influence of koito 
hajime sakaguchi a toyota spokesman in tokyo denied that 
toyota plans to reduce its relationship with koito he said 
thursday he did not know which reports pickens referred to since he 
had not seen any reports concerning toyota and koito in major 
japanese newspapers and us newspapers he checked recently 
our companys position on the issue remains unchanged the 
koito issue is one between koito and mr pickens we are not in a 
position to make any comment sakaguchi said 
pickens is the largest shareholder in koito with 26 percent of 
the outstanding common stock but has been thwarted in his attempts 
to gain seats on the board of directors 
pickens claims toyota which owns 19 percent of koito has three 
of koitos 20 board members toyota and koito deny the three men 
are toyota representatives but are former toyota employees 
koito claims pickens is engaging in greenmail the practice of 
buying a large stake of a companys stock and forcing the company 
to buy it back at a steep premium 
pickens has used such tactics in the past in runs on such us 
firms as phillips petroleum co and gulf oil corp 
the texas oilman and investor has attempted to enlist the us 
government in his battle with koito testifying before 
congressional committees and persuading 15 us senators to ask 
trade representative carla hills to include the dispute in ongoing 
talks with the japanese 
americans have to have the right to invest and share in the 
management of japanese companies if the japanese are going to do 
the same in the united states pickens said
