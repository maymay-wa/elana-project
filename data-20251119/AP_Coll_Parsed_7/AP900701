in the tumultuous aftermath of the cold war 
president bush and his nato colleagues gather in london this week 
to chart the political and military future of europe 
it is a meeting that none of them could have envisioned when 
nato leaders last met 13 months ago to toast the 40th anniversary 
of the military alliance four decades of keeping the soviet 
threat in check 
but drastic changes in eastern europe have wrought dramatic 
alterations in the wests military federation as well 
the central issue of the meeting slated for thursday and 
friday strikes at the very heart of the atlantic alliance 
how can nato after four decades as a military alliance poised 
against the warsaw pact transform itself into a mostly political 
organization following the collapse of communism in eastern europe 
on a related front the leaders must deal with soviet anxieties 
about east germany leaving the warsaw pact to join with west 
germany as one nation within nato bush is floating the idea of a 
nato statement of nonaggression toward nations of eastern and 
central europe 
and at the prompting of france and germany they will debate 
whether america and her allies should prop up soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and his crumbling economy bush does not like 
the idea of economic aid but leaders of the 12member european 
community already have agreed in principle to provide some form of 
financial help 
the politics of perestroika helps us all declared west 
german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois 
mitterrand said gorbachevs success is in the interest of 
everyone 
bush told a news conference on friday it is hard for the 
american people to say why put xbillions of dollars of money into 
the soviet economy when its not reformed when theyre spending 18 
percent of their gross national product on military and when 
theyre spending an estimated 5 billion annually in cuba some 
of our allies might be as concerned about that last point as we 
are 
the heavy agenda of the nato meeting will spill over from london 
to houston where a smaller group of world leaders will meet at the 
annual economic summit of the seven largest industrialized nations 
eastwest relations and particularly the question of a 
financial bailout for moscow will dominate the threeday houston 
meeting trade disputes and environmental problems also will be on 
the agenda 
japan is expected to urge an easing of sanctions against china 
but the united states opposes that now an administration official 
said beijing must relax its stand against prodemocracy forces 
before any adjustment is warranted 
but it is the dramatic changes in europe that will dominate the 
london and houston agendas 
the berlin wall has fallen free elections have replaced most of 
the totalitarian leaders of eastern and central europe and red 
army troops and tanks are preparing to go home 
secretary of state james a baker iii said such change brings 
in its wake not only great hope but also great uncertainty and some 
danger 
bush is concerned that nato keep up its military guard albeit 
with reduced firepower as the soviet threat diminishes yet bush 
rejects the idea of getting rid of all nuclear weapons 
i dont want to make europe safe for conventional war baker 
said echoing comments by bush 
the secretary said nato would not abandon its longstanding 
flexible response strategy of threatening to fire nuclear 
weapons first in response to a major soviet attack with 
conventional forces 
the leaders are expected to order a review to develop a 
negotiating position for reducing shortrange nuclear weapons in 
talks with moscow the kremlin suggests that those negotiations 
begin this fall but nato insists that they take place only after 
an agreement to reduce tanks artillery and other conventional 
forces in europe 
nato chiefs are expected to nudge negotiators from the east and 
west to wrap up the slowmoving conventional arms talks and pledge 
to make even deeper cuts in a later round of discussions 
to ease moscows fears west germany has proposed to keep nato 
forces from what is now east germany for awhile and to allow the 
red army forces to remain during that transition period 
west germany also is offering moscow 3 billion in bank credits 
and urging the west to contribute funds toward an even bigger 
assistance package 
the funds are viewed by some as a payoff to the soviets to let 
east germany go this is ransom but its a very good way to do 
business said michael mandelbaum senior fellow at the council 
on foreign relations 
west germans credit gorbachev with kindling eastern european 
reforms particularly the longsought goal of german unification 
and they are concerned that a sinking economy might sink gorbachev 
as well 
the us view is that it would be a waste of money to pump funds 
into an ineffective statecontrolled economy baker suggested that 
the summit partners in houston should develop principles and 
guidelines for awarding aid to moscow but he acknowledged that 
some countries may not be satisfied with that 
it may be a case of each country going its own way baker 
said

the us embassy said sunday that 
communist rebels had kidnapped an american peace corps volunteer 
and were holding him on the central island of negros 
last week the united states recalled the 261 peace corps 
volunteers in the philippines after intelligence reports indicated 
that communist rebels might try to kill or kidnap the volunteers 
american authorities had said previously that all the volunteers 
were accounted for the volunteers began leaving the philippines on 
friday 
us officials identified the missing man as timothy swanson 
26 of cheyenne wyo who had been in the philippines since 
february 1988 
a retired roman catholic bishop said swanson had been friendly 
with new peoples army guerrillas 
a peace corps spokeswoman in washington speaking on condition 
of anonymity said i have absolutely no information about the 
kidnapping 
i just cant comment she said its a very new 
situation 
embassy spokesman stanley schrager it was believed the volunteer 
was abducted june 13 he said the embassy had made unsuccessful 
attempts to contact swanson when the withdrawal of the peace corps 
volunteers was announced 
rev antonio fortich the retired roman catholic bishop of 
negros said in a telephone interview that swansons filipino wife 
told him rebels had taken the volunteer from his home in the 
village of patag she said she was told to say nothing about the 
matter he said 
last week he said swansons wife received a letter from her 
husband saying he was all right and asking her to send some items 
president corazon aquinos press secretary tomas gomez said he 
had no information on the abduction but said it might have been 
avoided if the united states had consulted philippine authorities 
on security 
schrager said the embassy had dispatched diplomats to the negros 
city of bacolod negros about 300 miles southeast of manila is a 
stronghold of the rebel new peoples army which has waged a 21year 
insurgency and seeks to establish a marxist state 
on may 29 rebels on negros kidnapped a japanese aid worker 
fumio mizuno and are believed holding him in remote mountains near 
bacolod 
schrager said the embassy was convinced that the kidnappers were 
communist rebels but refused to say what contacts if any had 
been made with the kidnappers 
the us decision to withdraw the peace corps volunteers had 
drawn criticism from philippines officials who said the united 
states was overreacting to the alleged threats 
the us decision to withdraw the peace corps volunteers had 
drawn criticism from philippines officials who said the united 
states was overreacting to the alleged threats 
on saturday gomez the presidents press secretary said the 
decision to pull out the volunteers could be an obstacle in 
forthcoming talks on the future of us bases in the country the 
bases lease expires in september 
gomez said sunday that us authorities had not shared 
information about the reported rebel threat 
they refused to listen to a security briefing gomez said 
maybe if they did that we could have prevented it 
mrs aquino suggested before the kidnapping was dislosed that 
us officials should have consulted with philippines officials 
about the withdrawal of the volunteers 
perhaps had they consulted us we could have readily 
identified the areas that could be classified as highrisk 
lowrisk and no risk she told reporters friday and they could 
have remained in the norisk areas 
communist rebels are believed to have killed eight americans 
since april 1989 but they had made no public threat against the 
peace corps 
when the withdrawal was announced last week us ambassador 
nicholas platt said the united states planned to return volunteers 
as soon as possible 
us officials also said the peace corps office in manila would 
remain open as a sign that the withdrawal was temporary

nelson mandela wrapped up his first visit 
to the united states by promising to return in october for a look 
at the problems of american indians 
two american indians said they delivered a onepage invitation 
and gifts to a mandela representative as the south african black 
nationalist leader arrived at oakland international airport for a 
rally saturday 
the letter outlined several problems and said it has been 500 
years since the first nonindians came to this land and began the 
destruction of our culture said one of the women betty cooper 
who is the director of the native american alcoholism program in 
oakland 
mandela told 58000 people at oakland coliseum that he was 
disturbed by what he read he said he will visit the indian 
areas of the country for a look at the struggle of american 
indians 
the rally speech was one of the first occasions mandela spoke 
about the plight of ethnic groups in the united states 
chief among the concerns american indian leaders would like to 
tell mandela about are poverty unemployment and the lack of health 
care plaguing indians on reservations and in cities cooper said 
we told him in the letter that we share many of the same 
problems of his country and would like to have the opportunity to 
share them with him she said 
mandela 71 said he would have looked into the problems before 
he completed his eightcity tour in the united states but 
unfortunately my schedule is very tight but i can assure the 
leaders of the american indian community that i will return in 
october 
cooper and sally gallegos executive director of the 
oaklandbased consortium of united indian nations said they 
approached mandela at the airport but were kept away they handed 
the letter and gifts to a mandela representative instead 
the gifts included a sacred blanket and a shawl for mandelas 
wife winnie and some indian medicine 
roger wilkins national coordinator of the mandela tour said 
mandela already had planned a return visit before he received the 
invitation 
the letters from the native americans were not the proximate 
cause of his decision to come back but since he was coming back 
he would look into the issue wilkins said 
mandela and his wife left oakland on saturday for ireland via 
canada earlier saturday he took a stroll through downtown los 
angeles streets he stopped several times to shake hands with 
admirers including a homeless man in a wheelchair

jubilant east germans set off fireworks 
drank toasts and flung the currency of their old communist state 
into the air sunday as the two germanys united their economies 
banks were open for special sunday hours and thousands of east 
germans lined up to get their new currency west german marks 
stores in west berlin and in border villages in west germany were 
bracing for a crush of shoppers on monday morning 
the new treaty merges the two nations into a single economic 
entity and sets east germany on the path to a freemarket economy 
also all remaining border controls between the two nations were 
officially eliminated 
for many germans both east and west sunday ranked in 
significance with the fall of the communist government in october 
last year and the opening of the berlin wall a month later 
the economic unification marks the effective end of east german 
sovereignty and the most important step toward a single germany 
the german states now will work on a political treaty that will 
likely result in common elections and the creation of a single 
nation in december 
one of the thousands of east germans who lined up to collect the 
new currency was hansjoachim corsalle 41 who delivers coal for a 
living he withdrew the equivalent of 1200 in west german marks 
from his account to take his family on vacation 
im used to standing in line he said yesterday for 
instance i waited in line for five hours to get enough gas for the 
vacation 
alexandra meier 19 saw the day as the beginning of prosperity 
i hope that well never have to stand in line again she 
said hopefully well be able to buy whatever we want 
east german stores were closed during the weekend as workers 
remodeled the former stateowned shops and stocked them with 
truckloads of western products that stand to dominate the newly 
opened consumer market 
east germany is expected to face widespread joblessness as its 
newly independent factories and businesses are forced to compete 
with the west 
prime minister lothar de maiziere urged optimism and criticized 
those who dwell on predictions of massive unemployment 
there will be problems and hardships but from now on things 
will improve for us he said in remarks prepared for an address 
to the nation on sunday 
thanks to west germany we have opportunities no other east 
european country has he said lets take advantage of them 
in an interview with the west german newspaper bild am sonntag 
de maiziere said prosperity will come to east germany within five 
years 
it will happen because it must happen he said now is the 
time to roll up our sleeves and work hard and we will do that

germany still has two names two governments 
two armies but to many east germans sunday was the day the two 
nations became one 
the wall is falling the borders are open now we have west 
german money said east berliner marita schulz 43 after she 
withdrew 1000 new marks from her bank account 
to us this is it 
during the next few months politicians in both nations will 
work out the constitutional mechanics of holding common elections 
and forming a single government by years end 
but many east germans saw the opening of the door to western 
commerce and cash as the culmination of last autumns 
demonstrations against communism when the hunger for western 
prosperity was an engine that helped drive a revolution 
the capital was calm and quiet on sunday the day the economies 
and the social welfare systems of the two german states were 
officially merged 
east germans did not flock to banks to withdraw their money and 
officials were not predicting a spending spree when stores now 
filled with western products opened on monday 
many east germans planned to make one longdelayed purchase 
such as a car or vacation but the average amount withdrawn was 
only expected to be 800 marks 490 
the fear of mass unemployment as east germany tries to quickly 
shift to a free market has brought an air of caution to the country 
during the day sunday east berlin was positively placid 
compared with the raucous new years evestyle scene that greeted 
the coming of the currency union at midnight 
thousands of midnight celebrants poured into the citys main 
square alexanderplatz where mass demonstrations last fall helped 
bring down the former communist government 
west germanys deutsche bank in a publicity stunt that 
backfired opened the doors of its new branch on the square at 
midnight to mark the arrival of the currency union 
it was believed to be the only bank in the country to open 
before 8 am 
thousands of people stood in line thousands of others crowded 
around them and a writhing mass of people packed the door which 
was eventually broken 
ambulances took two people away when they became faint 
the first man in line and the first person in east germany to 
withdraw his new west german marks was hansjoachim corsalle 41 
a coal delivery man from east berlin 
he took out 2000 marks 1200 and planned to use it to take 
his family on vacation he got a gift basket and a 100mark bonus 
for being the first east german in line 
never saw a line this long except for the line at elvis 
presleys funeral he said 
corsalle showed up about four hours before the doors opened in a 
modest bid for immortality 
before i came here i told my wife this is going to enter the 
history books he said and it will 
anke kirchner 24 a teacher thought the currency union was the 
grimly realistic flipside to the exuberant idealistic 
demonstrations that brought down the berlin wall 
she was at the historic brandenburg gate a symbol of old 
berlin when the wall was first breached nov 9 that celebration 
was fun and spontaneous she said but the line at alexanderplatz 
was instead a pushing shoving crush for cash 
i thought it would be nice to come here and be part of the 
action she said but this was rather depressing

the government has come up with a novel 
approach for handling bad economic news it has decided just to 
stop reporting it 
the statistic in question is the annual assessment of americas 
global investment standing which in the past few years has shown 
that the united states has gone from being the worlds largest 
creditor nation to being the largest debtor nation 
the government says the figure is no longer reliable critics 
say the bush administration is playing politics by not releasing it 
the report for 1989 the us net international investment 
position was scheduled to be released monday but last week 
the government let it be known that because of concern over the 
data the report would not be released this year 
the commerce departments bureau of economic analysis said a 
scaleddown version of the investment flows would be made public 
but without the key bottomline figure 
at the end of 1988 the us debt burden stood at 5325 
billion up 41 percent from the previous year the bea reported 
last year 
that figure reflected the imbalance between what americans owned 
overseas and what foreigners owned in this country 
based on information contained in other reports private 
economists expected that americas net debtor position probably 
rose by around 110 billion in 1989 pushing americas net debt 
close to 650 billion 
but the bea release on monday will not have a figure on 
americas net debtor position there will be enough data provided 
on the component parts that make up the figure so that interested 
parties will be able to come up with their own unofficial estimate 
but the number will not appear in the report 
the bea reasoning the net debtor number as presently calculated 
has so many flaws that it is no longer reliable bea officials said 
they hoped to have a revamped report with more accurate figures 
ready for release in a year 
some critics arent persuaded 
the reason they are not publishing the number is that it shows 
the united states in an unfavorable light said jeff faux head 
of the economic policy institute a laborbacked think tank 
the united states was the worlds largest creditor country as 
recently as 1983 when it had an investment surplus of 89 billion 
that surplus fell to 33 billion in 1984 and disappeared 
altogether in 1985 the year the country became a net debtor for 
the first time in 71 years 
the plunge from largest creditor to largest debtor was caused by 
the huge merchandise trade deficits the united states piled up 
during the 1980s as americans transferred billions of dollars into 
the hands of foreigners to pay for such things as imported cars and 
television sets 
foreigners now have reinvested those dollars in the united 
states in everything from corporate stock and us treasury bills 
to hollywood movie studios and iowa farmland 
that has set off an alarm bells from city hall to congress over 
the buying of america with dire warnings that the united 
states was in danger of losing control of its economic destiny to 
foreigners 
allan young head of the bea denied that he was under any 
political pressure from the bush administration to halt publication 
of the net debtor figure 
i am an economic statistician and i decided the number is 
inappropriate because of the way it is put together young said 
the problem has been increasingly recognized by us and by 
others 
there have been complaints for a number of years that americas 
debtor position was being overstated because the report measured 
many of the assets at the historical purchase price 
that undervalued the worth of us assets in foreign countries 
many of which were purchased decades ago in comparison with 
foreign holdings in the united states many purchased in the 1980s 
the bea is working to produce a report that will give an 
uptodate current value on all assets both foreign and us 
holdings 
while applauding this effort at statistical consistency private 
economists said they believed the final result will still show the 
united states as a net debtor with the amount of debt growing at an 
alarming rate 
economist c fred bergsten who is completing a book on 
americas net debtor position said that while the current report 
does understate the value of americas holdings overseas it also 
understates foreign holdings in the united states because of errors 
in gathering data on foreign ownership 
our view is that both the asset and liability numbers are 
substantially understated and as a result the bottomline figure is 
probably about right said bergsten who is head of the institute 
for international economics a washingtonbased think tank 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill said the debate 
over the exact valuation of the net debtor figure misses the more 
important point of americas growing dependence on foreign capital 
to run the us economy 
it was a scare number but people ought to be scared he 
said it is a very serious problem and it is one that we arent 
doing anything about

just as mikhail s gorbachev gets his change to 
radically overhaul the communist partys rusty political machine 
conservatives are challenging his plans to rewrite the rules on who 
runs the soviet union 
conservative delegates will dominate the 28th communist party 
congress which opens monday and gorbachev may not win approval of 
the sweeping changes he envisions 
some conservatives even are demanding that he leave the top 
party job 
originally gorbachev viewed the congress as a means of cleaning 
out the kremlins old guard and last year he won approval to hold 
the congress a year early to hasten changes 
among the main tasks of the congress will be rewriting party 
rules to revamp what have traditionally been the most powerful 
soviet institutions 
the rules affect all 19 million members of the communist party 
down to local bosses and the rank and file and gorbachev says he 
wants changes to give the party a second wind 
the proposed changes include 
replacing the general secretary with a party chairman and 
first secretary 
renaming and expanding the partys top body the politburo 
thus diluting the power of each member 
nominating multiple candidates for party jobs 
restricting elected party officials to two terms 
the proposed rule changes were published thursday and gorbachev 
is expected to offer more details when he opens the congress monday 
with a threehour report 
he also wants to press his drive to redirect the partys energy 
from managing the economy toward more general policysetting and 
to transfer management responsibilities to the government 
but because gorbachev has introduced a measure of democracy into 
the party he has lost some control over its decisions 
conservatives can push their own agenda yegor ligachev a 
politburo hardliner has said renewal means the fixing of 
boundaries and the cleansing from the party of all those who are 
destroying it who are engaging in a factional oppositional 
struggle and who are participating in antisocialist movements 
the most important proposed rule changes would affect the 
249member central committee the partys policymaking body the 
committee is a bastion of conservative holdovers elected under the 
late leonid i brezhnev party chief from 19641982 
the congress will elect a new central committee gorbachev had 
one previous chance to win control of the committee at the 1986 
congress but had been in office only 11 months and did not have 
enough power 
politburo member lev zaikov has said 90 percent of the central 
committee members should be replaced by younger people 
the soviet weekly arguments and facts analyzed the committee in 
february and found that 61 percent of the members were at or beyond 
retirement age 60 more than half the members were elected from 
1961 to 1981 just 29 workers and peasants sit on the committee 
despite the partys claim to represent those those classes 
there are sizable blocs of military and government ministry 
officials a largely conservative group and almost half the 
members have served more than two terms in central party bodies 
did the party have any right to expect that it the central 
committee would manifest dynamism revolutionary energy 
flexibility and exceptional thinking arguments and facts asked 
rhetorically 
gorbachev has called for the congress to trim the committee and 
transform it into a standing body that meets almost continuously 
with members chosen from the general pool of party members 
under current rules the central committee has no fixed number 
of members meets irregularly and consists of officials 
automatically included by virtue of their regular jobs 
major changes are also expected in the politburo like the 
central committee it also decides policy issues but it meets much 
more regularly it also recommends decisions to the central 
committee and sometimes makes decisions on its own 
the politburo now has 12 full and seven nonvoting members 
gorbachev has eased some conservatives off the body already and 
shifted some of its decisionmaking functions to popularly elected 
government bodies 
ligachev has complained the politburo was not consulted about 
gorbachevs controversial plans to shift the soviet economy to a 
marketoriented system or about soviet policy toward german 
unification 
the draft rules call for the politburo to be replaced by a 
presidium 
although the rules offer no details of its makeup officials 
have said the presidium would have about 30 members including the 
heads of the communist parties of the 15 soviet republics workers 
peasants intellectuals servicemen and party veterans to be 
elected by the central committee 
the proposed rules also call for splitting the general 
secretarys job now held by gorbachev into a chairman deputy 
chairman and first secretary 
it is not clear which post gorbachev will seek but he has made 
it clear he wants to retain a top party job in addition to the 
national presidency to which he was elected for a fiveyear term 
in march

leaders in east and west said difficulties lie ahead 
east germans cheered honked horns and set off fireworks to 
welcome their new west german money which put fancy cars and 
vacations to brazil within reach many suddenly had thousands of 
dollars worth of the longcoveted currency 
at border crossings that once were impenetrable smiling 
families walked drove and bicycled back and forth without a 
policeman in sight 
more than 200 people were killed as they tried to escape over 
the same borders during communist rule erich honecker the 
hardline former leader who was toppled last october is now the 
target of a murder probe into the killings 
in berlin sunday officials reopened eight subway ghost 
stations that hads been shut down by construction of the berlin 
wall in 1961 another major step toward unifying the city 
still there was sobering talk from officials sunday especially 
in light of the possibility that east german businesses will start 
filing for bankruptcy as early as monday strikes are also expected 
as the pressure from western business builds 
one east german company the elektrowerk electronicon of gera 
announced onequarter of its 5000 workers would work reduced 
shifts beginning monday 
there have been predictions that up to 4 million east germans 
could be put out of work as the country struggles to rebuild an 
economy ravaged by decades of communist mismanagement and 
inefficiency 
a majority of the houses were built before the turn of the 
century shortages of materials have left towns in sad disrepair 
and basics like roads and telecommunications are falling apart 
it will take hard work until we have reached unity and 
freedom prosperity and social balance for all germans west 
german chancellor helmut kohl said in a televised address sunday 
evening 
many of our compatriots in the german democratic republic 
east germany will have to get accustomed to new and unfamiliar 
living conditions and also to a transition period that certainly 
wont be easy kohl added

networks which also reach more than 80 percent of the households 
in east germany 
calling for national solidarity kohl also assured fellow 
west germans that they will not be at a disadvantage as the two 
nations join 
there has been increasing concern in west germany over the high 
cost of unification it will cost hundreds of billions of dollars 
to bring east germany up to full western standards 
also sunday west germany scrapped a 40yearold program of 
government subsidies and handouts for resettlers from east germany 
more than half a million east germans had benefited from the 
program since the beginning of last year culminating in the 
dramatic exodus of east germans to the west last fall 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere delivered his own 
television address in which he urged the countrys 166 million 
people not to be led astray by the difficulties but rather to 
recognize and use the opportunities 
the prime minister like his political ally kohl said the 
transition time certainly will not be easy 
many have predicted a hot autumn as east german workers 
return from vacations to find they have no jobs 
east germans already are being tempted by everything from 
furniture salesman to travel bureaus including one offering 
special tours to rio de janeiro and the caribbean 
west german economics minister theo waigel who traveled to east 
berlin for the start of what he called an economic adventure 
assured east germans that everything is under control he 
predicted inflation would not jump 
his east german counterpart finance minister walter romberg 
emphasized there were certain risks in merging the

mongolias ruling communist party expelled seven 
men who once were among the countrys most powerful and feared 
officials and disciplined six others a chinese report said sunday 
chinas official xinhua news agency quoted the mongolian party 
newspaper unen as saying those expelled had violated party 
discipline and tarnished its reputation 
all were hardliners and associates of ousted dictator 
yumjaagiyn tsedenbal who for decades maintained tight party 
control in all spheres of life in this sovietbloc nation 
tsedenbals three decades of rule ending in 1984 have been 
reevaluated since the start of a democracy movement in december 
that produced mass demonstrations mongolias first opposition 
parties and a pledge by the communists to allow free elections and 
market reforms 
the communist party formally called the mongolian peoples 
revolutionary party stripped tsedenbal of his honors this spring 
and set up a committee to investigate his surviving associates the 
committee was ordered to report by saturday and its findings 
apparently led to the expulsions 
among the seven was bugyn dejid who was widely feared when he 
was in charge of internal party discipline and sat on the partys 
decisionmaking body the politburo he retired in the late 1980s 
jambyn batmonh who was mongolias president and party general 
secretary until this spring was listed among six other officials 
put on probation because of their failure to fulfil their 
duties according to xinhua 
the brief report did not explain the terms of probation or the 
nature of their failings 
batmonh 64 was prime minister for a decade under tsedenbal and 
succeeded him as party head in 1984 when he also became president 
in the past two years however following the example of the 
soviet union batmonh made tentative moves toward political and 
economic reform 
he stepped down voluntarily from both posts this spring after 
months of demonstrations in ulan bator by mostly young 
welleducated noncommunist activists demanding democracy the 
opposition groups paid him the tribute in april of seeking to 
pressure the ruling party to keep batmonh on as president saying 
they considered him an honest man 
also disciplined was dumaagiyn sodnom 56 who resigned in april 
as prime minister after six years in office sonomyn luvsangombo a 
former candidate member of the party politburo who was fired as 
head of the state construction committee in 1989 amid accusations 
of allowing shoddy work batochiryn altangerel a former politburo 
member paavan damdin a former party secretary and gelegiyn adyya 
also among the seven expelled were former politburo members 
tumenbayaryn ragchaa demchigiyn molomjamts and damdiny gombojav 
bandzragchiyn lamjav a former candidate member of poliburo who 
succeeded dejid in handling party discipline 
all had retired from their party and government posts in the 
past few years 
mongolia is preparing to hold its first multiparty elections 
ever july 29 with five noncommunist parties contesting the 
communists monopoly on power 
the opposition groups have complained in recent weeks however 
that local election commissions were set up without opposition 
participation that the ruling party continues to receive state 
funds and that the media remains under ruling party control 
the government has rejected their demand that international 
observers be allowed to attend the elections 
mongolia a landlocked nation of herdsmen has been ruled by the 
communists since they seized power with soviet help in 1921

since the supreme courts righttodie ruling 
americans by the thousands have begun heeding the advice of 
physicians lawyers and deathwithdignity advocates to draft a 
living will 
weve had to get volunteers to help us man the phone lines 
said doron weber a spokesman for the society for the right to die 
thats the magic word right now living wills 
living wills allow people to spell out in writing how much 
medical care if any they would like to have in the event they 
ever become critically or terminally ill and are unable to speak 
for themselves 
the urgency of such advance planning was brought home last week 
when the supreme court barred the parents of a 32yearold comatose 
woman nancy cruzan from ordering removal of the feeding tube that 
is keeping her alive 
doctors say the missouri woman is irreversibly unconscious in a 
permanent vegetative state that could last for years her parents 
wanted to have her feeding tube removed but the court said no 
the court said states may block family members from ending the 
lives of permanently comatose relatives who have not made their 
wishes known the justices indirectly supported living wills by 
saying the constitution guarantees a competent person a right to 
refuse medical treatment 
this decision affects just about every member of our 
society weber said 
the american medical association estimates that 70 percent of 
all people will be involved in some way at some time in a decision 
on whether to prolong or terminate life support 
the society for the right to die has become a sort of national 
clearinghouse for living wills 
were getting thousands of calls every day the vast majority 
from individuals who want living wills weber said in an 
interview last week 
interest in the issue was lively even before the ruling in the 
cruzan case before last weeks decision the american association 
of retired persons had received more than 100000 requests for its 
booklet health care powers of attorney produced by the 
american bar association 
the society for the right to die distributes the appropriate 
forms for the 41 states and the district of columbia that have 
livingwill laws 
for people in the nine states that dont have a law the society 
has general forms those states are massachusetts michigan 
nebraska new jersey new york ohio pennsylvania rhode island 
and south dakota 
for people in all states however the society advises that 
individuals be as specific as possible 
its a very important document weber said you should say 
everything you want to say whatever your personal instructions 
are you have to make your wishes known 
the american bar association approves of living wills but 
recommends that people also give someone they trust what is called 
durable health care power of attorney 
this is done in a written document and gives the person named 
the authority to make health care decisions for an individual in 
the event that individual becomes unable to speak for himself or 
herself 
this allows people to cover more contingencies than may be 
possible to outline in a living will and to provide more guidance 
for decisionmaking 
medical technology changes by the year if not by the 
minute said nancy coleman director of the abas commission on 
the legal problems of the elderly 
a living will provides a certain measure of protection for your 
wishes to be carried out she said but it doesnt give anyone any 
alternative decisionmaking for you 
if you forgot something or something new lifeprolonging 
medical technology is available that you didnt anticipate you 
could be in nancy cruzans situation she said 
while all states and the district of columbia recognize durable 
power of attorney some states also recognize this power 
specifically for health care decisions 
but the interpretation of most attorneys who practice in these 
areas is that you can use durable power of attorney for most health 
care decisionmaking she said 
whether in a living will or in designating power of attorney 
coleman advises people to say whatever they want to say as 
strongly as possible 
when drafted these documents should be given to family members 
friends physicians religious advisers and anyone else you would 
want to speak on your behalf weber said 
you dont want to stash it away in a safe deposit box he 
said

people in yugoslavias largest 
republic voted sunday on whether to hold free elections before 
adoption of a new constitution that would give it more power over a 
southern province 
turnout was light on a hot sunday morning in belgrade which 
serves as both the seat of the federal government and the capital 
of the serbian republic voting will continue monday and results 
are to be released tuesday 
serbian communist president slobodan milosevic announced the 
referendum june 25 for serbia the largest of yugoslavias six 
republics 
it was preceded by a barrage of propaganda in the state media 
calling on voters to support a delay in free elections until after 
enactment of a new constitution for which no date has been set 
serbias communist authorities in the past have rejected 
westernstyle pluralism 
the northern yugoslav republics of slovenia and croatia in 
contrast held the first free elections this spring in 45 years for 
local legislatures both elections were won by centerright 
parties which trounced the communist parties that called the 
elections 
yugoslavias other three republics are scheduled to hold free 
elections later this year 
milosevic claims that multiparty elections cannot be held in his 
republic because ethnic albanians who make up 90 percent of the 
17 million inhabitants of serbias southern kosovo province will 
vote for separatists advocating the regions secession 
at least 60 ethnic albanian protesters have been killed since 
february 1989 when the republic set strict limits on kosovos 
autonomy and demonstrations resulted 
the possible elimination of the kosovo parliament through a new 
constitution would make ethnic albanians a small minority in the 
serbian parliament ethnic albanians do not necessarily want 
independence but do want their previous partial autonomy restored 
the ethnic albanians seek restoration of the broader autonomy 
they enjoyed under a 1974 constitution that was amended in march 
1989 serbia said the changes were needed to protect the serbian 
minority in kosovo from alleged harassment by ethnic albanians 
the serbian parliament previously adopted unspecified new powers 
to amend measures passed by kosovos administration in a further 
extension of serbian control 
serbian communists claim full ethnic albanian autonomy is the 
first step toward kosovo seceding from yugoslavia and joining 
neighboring albania 
a coalition of serbian opposition parties described as 
national traitors by the government media have insisted 
kosovos problems have been caused by the ruling communists and 
that they can only be resolved after a democratically elected 
government takes over in serbia 
opposition leaders were attacked and beaten by police when they 
tried to stage a protest in front of belgrade television to demand 
equal access to the media 
no opposition representatives were present at any of the voting 
stations visited by a reporter but communist officials claimed 
they would be allowed to observe the proceedings if they wished 
ethnic albanian leaders in kosovo have called on people in 
kosovo to boycott the referendum 
nothing can be decided without albanians in kosovo anymore 
said azem vlasi a former communist leader in the province said in 
an interview with the nedelja weekly

the cabinet on sunday approved a request by 
housing minister ariel sharon for emergency regulations to 
speed the construction of homes in israel for soviet immigrants 
sharon who also serves as coordinator of immigration had 
requested the measure to allow the purchase of 3000 prefabricated 
houses either locally or abroad 
the prefabricated units are to be set up near nine israeli 
towns most in the galilee in the north and in the southern negev 
desert 
the measure which is to last for three months is to be debated 
monday by the parliament the likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak 
shamir to which sharon belongs commands a majority in the 
parliament 
israeli contractors have opposed the move arguing that it will 
hurt the local construction industry 
sharon has said israel will need to build 7000 new housing 
units a month to accommodate the flood of soviet immigrants that 
began in the spring of 1989 after the soviet union eased exit 
permits israels current rate of construction is about 1660 units 
a month 
a shortage of housing has sent rents skyrocketing and sparked 
protests by young israelis who say they are being priced out of 
the market 
sharons request for emergency regulations has stirred fear 
among some politicians that he may try to assume powers currently 
delegated to municipal planning councils and zoning boards 
as defense minister sharon led the 1982 israeli invasion of 
lebanon and was later charged by critics with giving incomplete 
information on his military plans to the government 
the governments legal adviser state attorney yosef harish 
approved the cabinet decision only after he was saw the motion 
would carry according to justice ministry spokeswoman eti eshed 
harish doesnt think emergency regulations are needed at this 
point she said but sharon convinced the others and harish 
decided not to oppose the decision 
more than 63000 soviet jews have arrived since 1989 and a 
total of 150000 are expected this year 
also sunday parliament member yossi sarid of the leftwing 
citizens rights movement charged that onetenth of 
governmentfunded construction was going to the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip he did not include funding for arab east jerusalem 
which israel annexed after its capture from jordan in the 1967 
middle east war 
sarid noted there has been widespread criticism in the united 
states and europe to israels continued settlement of jews in the 
occupied lands 
israeli officials in response to the criticism have pledged 
that soviet immigrants will not be directed to the territories 
this is another attempt to lie to the world said moshe 
horovitz a spokesman for sarids party 
the policy doesnt direct immigrants to the territories but 
people are thrown there without choice because they have nowhere 
else to live

abortion foes are hoping to get 
floridas first black supreme court chief justice off the bench in 
the november elections because of their disagreement with his 
rulings on abortion 
leander shaw officially became the second black chief jurist of 
a states supreme court on sunday the first black state chief 
justice was pennsylvanias robert nix who has held his states 
highest judicial post for 6 years 
the collision between two of societys hottest issues race and 
abortion isnt lost on the 59yearold shaw but he doubts florida 
right to life and other antiabortion groups are trying to defeat 
him because he is black 
i think those who want to defeat me have set florida up as a 
bellwether state said shaw 
i think they would have picked out any justice on this court 
running at this particular time he said it works out that if 
they needed a lightning rod i was going to be it 
shaw who has served on the court seven years was named to a 
twoyear term as chief justice by a vote of his fellow justices in 
march the term began sunday 
he is the target of antiabortion groups because of a decision 
he wrote in october the ruling invalidating a state law that 
prohibited single minors from obtaining abortions without 
permission of their parents a legal guardian or a judge but the 
ruling went much further saying that the righttoprivacy 
amendment to the state constitution meant that government may not 
interfere in abortion decisions 
the justices split 43 on the parental permission ruling and 
voted 61 in the ruling that the privacy amendment applied to the 
abortion issue 
the ruling came only days before the florida legislature met to 
consider a number of antiabortion bills proposed by republican 
gov bob martinez the session ended with the resounding defeat of 
martinezs legislation as thousands protested outside the capitol 
the disappointing loss led antiabortion forces to train their 
guns on shaw the only one of the justices to face a retention 
election this year 
under florida law supreme court justices are initially 
appointed by the governor but at sixyear intervals voters get to 
decide whether to retain them no supreme court justice has been 
ousted since the merit retention system began in 1974 but if shaw 
loses it would give martinez a chance to appoint a conservative 
replacement 
thats the message going out at churches conservative political 
gatherings and anywhere else people opposed to abortion can be 
found said florida right to life president ken connor 
all of this effort to elect a prolife governor will go for 
naught if we dont have people on the court who reflect values such 
as the sanctity of the family said connor 
he said shaw has shown an utter disregard for the right to 
life and an utter disregard for the rights of parents over their 
children he is a classic judicial activist who is making the law 
rather than interpreting the law 
the sophisticated organization and fervor of the antiabortion 
forces has shaw worried he said last week that he will probably 
spend 300000 to keep his seat 
they would like to beat me because that would certainly give 
them something to take around the country and say look what we 
did in florida we unseated a supreme court justice he said 
i take them very seriously i think they are sincere it is a 
very visceral issue with them 
but shaw who has five children of his own and has been involved 
in youth groups rejects the charge that he is antifamily he said 
voters must look at his overall performance not just one issue 
and said groups that pressure judges to vote their way on one issue 
or face ouster are abusing the merit system 
martinez himself has stayed on the sidelines in the shaw 
campaign when shaws selection as chief justice was made in march 
the governor had nothing but praise saying it was a testament to 
the progress florida has made over the years in providing equal 
opportunity for all its citizens 
shaw agreed that progress has been made in race relations 
despite occasional flareups particularly in miami with its 
volatile mixture of hispanics and blacks 
the ethnic diversity of florida necessitates that you have to 
make progress in race relations or destroy yourself shaw said 
i hope i can be a positive role model i think people could look 
at me and say well leander shaw did it i can do it too

paramilitary police and army troops 
patrolled the streets of lusaka sunday a day after mutinous 
soldiers mounted an aborted coup to oust president kenneth kaunda 
authorities insisted repeatedly that no one was hurt saturday 
but diplomats and witnesses said at least three civilians were shot 
dead by guards near kaundas residence after they joined crowds 
celebrating his reported overthrow 
the capital and other cities and towns were calm sunday after 
five days of studentled rioting over food price increases the 
students also demanded a return to westernstyle democracy 
kaunda 67 flew back to lusaka saturday night from the central 
copperbelt province city of ndola facing the gravest political 
crisis since he led the british colony of northern rhodesia to 
independence in 1964 with promises of a better life for all 
before he left ndola a visibly shaken kaunda said he would not 
budge on his decision last month to more than double the price of 
corn meal a staple 
he also said he would consult the central committee of the 
united national independence party the only legal political 
movement in zambia since a oneparty state was imposed in 1972 on 
the fate of the coup plotters 
kaunda indicated he might act more harshly than in the past when 
his foes have been detained imprisoned or rebuked 
im beginning to ask myself whether we have been right in 
this whether we shouldnt take a different stance he said 
an army lieutenant who identified himself as mwamba luchembe of 
the signals corps was detained by soldiers at dawn saturday after 
making several broadcasts on state radio that kaunda had been 
toppled in a coup 
luchembe was being held at chamba valley high security prison 
outside lusaka government sources said he was identified as a 
member of the bembas zambias biggest tribe from the northern 
luapula province near the border with zaire 
bembas wield most economic political and military power but 
like other zambians many have become disenchanted with rising 
unemployment steep inflation and toplevel corruption 
about the same time as the broadcast troops in armored 
personnel carriers cruised lusakas streets with loudspeakers 
saying a new president had been installed 
while kaunda has referred to coup plotters since then 
official spokesmen and the government media have reported only two 
arrests 
in addition to luchembe police in ndola also placed in custody 
antigovernment activist peter bwalya for allegedly organizing 
protests after the broadcasts 
state television reported that at least two other soldiers were 
with luchembe when he made the announcements their fate was not 
known 
at least five fellow officers were detained later saturday 
security sources told the associated press they spoke on condition 
of anonymity and their report could not be independently confirmed 
the failed coup followed five days of the bloodiest urban 
violence in zambias history triggered last monday by student 
rioting 
at least 23 people were slain most of them looters according 
to officials at least 34 students were detained

west germany was the worlds biggest exporter 
for the first three months of 1990 regaining its leadership over 
the united states the international monetary fund reported sunday 
west germany increased its exports to 998 billion up more 
than 18 percent over the first quarter of last year the us 
increase of nearly 10 percent brought its total to 972 billion 
in 1989 the united states regained first place with 364 
billion worth of exports compared to west germanys 341 billion 
west germany first forged ahead in 1986 
experts say the economic unification of west germany and east 
germany which officially began sunday could put the united 
germany ahead of the us as the worlds biggest exporter for years 
to come the fund gave no figures for east germany which is not 
among its 151 member countries 
japan trailed in a distant third place with 274 billion worth 
of exports for 1989 and 68 billion for the first quarter of this 
year 
the united states remained by far the worlds biggest importer 
with 125 billion in foreignmade goods coming into the country in 
the first quarter of the year that compared with 118 billion a 
year earlier west germanys imports also increased to 78 billion 
from 65 billion 
west germany had a 22 billion surplus of exports over imports 
for the quarter compared with a us deficit of 28 billion 
japan striving to reduce complaints about its big export surplus 
was the only one of the seven major industrial countries to report 
a drop in exports for the quarter it still had a 12 billion 
surplus for the period second only to west germanys 
the 22 countries that the fund classifies as industrial had a 
total deficit of 32 billion in trade with the rest of the world 
for the first quarter of 1990 that was up from 24 billion in the 
first quarter of 1989 
adding up annual surpluses and deficits for the first time the 
fund reported that the industrial countries had an aggregate trade 
deficit with the rest of the world in 1989 of 110 billion up from 
80 billion in 1988 
italy along with west germany reported the most rapid gains in 
both imports and exports for the quarter but because of changes in 
exchange rates italy increased its deficit to 73 billion for the 
quarter compared with 71 billion in the first quarter of 1989

lithuanias sole oil refinery was back in 
operation sunday after the kremlin eased its embargo on the baltic 
republic 
lidia cheblakova a duty officer said the mazhiekiai refinery 
in northwestern lithuania was receiving 25000 tons of oil a day 
compared to the normal preembargo level of 45000 
soviet officials resumed pumping oil to lithuania on saturday 
starting to fulfill its promise to lift the 10week blockade in 
return for a moratorium on the republics declaration of 
independence 
the soviet government cut off shipments of all oil most natural 
gas and numerous other items to lithuania on april 18 in attempt to 
force it to rescind its march 11 declaration of independence 
the lithuanian parliament accepted a compromise friday that 
traded a 100day moratorium on the declaration for an immediate end 
to the blockade and the start of negotiations 
the subject of lithuanias came up in pope john paul iis 
prayers in rome on sunday while he didnt comment on the dispute 
over independence the pontiff prayed that conditions would improve 
for lithuanian catholics and that there would be a victory of the 
cross in the soviet republic 
ms cheblakova said in a telephone interview the full supply of 
oil will be resumed as soon as the refinery is ready to receive it 
just one of mazhiekiais two plants was operating because there 
are not enough workers available many were released on vacation or 
laid off when the blockade started she said 
officials said refined oil from the mazhiekiai plant the only 
one in lithuania would not reach consumers for at least two weeks 
for technical reasons it refines about 12 million tons of 
petroleum products a year a quarter of it used in lithuania 
the refinery employs 2000 people who were thrown out of work 
by the cutoff the plant processed its last oil april 23 as the 
blockade exhausted reserves that came from the single pipeline 
feeding the plant from the russian city of polotsk 
the huge plant provided much of the gasoline and industrial fuel 
for lithuania latvia estonia the russian city of kaliningrad and 
parts of byelorussia before it shut down for lack of oil 
lithuania and its 38 million people are entirely dependent upon 
the soviet union for its oil and gas which it receives at highly 
subsidized prices 
lithuania and its baltic neighbors latvia and estonia were 
independent from moscow between the two world wars but were 
forcibly absorbed back into the soviet union by josef stalin in 
1940 
all three are seeking to regain their independence although 
estonia and latvia have taken a slower approach to separation from 
the soviet union than lithuania 
in his homily the pope noted that lithuanian bishops recently 
celebrated a special mass in which they implored the crucified 
christ to shorten the days of difficult testing to which lithuanian 
believers continue to be subjected 
may the lord give them this grace assuring the victory of the 
cross the polishborn pope said 
the pontiff speaking at a mass at the lithuanian college of san 
casimiro in rome said the cross has become the special symbol of 
the lithuanians of the people of the families of the communities 
and all the society 
soviet authorities in the past have refused john paul permission 
to travel to lithuania which is overwhelmingly catholic

nelson mandela arrived to a rapturous 
irish welcome sunday urging that sanctions against south africa be 
kept up so that apartheid is ended not tomorrow but now 
the irish staunch supporters of the black south african leader 
thronged dawson street in the center of the capital as mandela 
arrived from the united states for a ceremony giving him the 
freedom of dublin 
it was a highly symbolic moment at the mansion house seat of 
the citys government dublin made mandela an honorary citizen two 
years ago the first capital city to do so but had to wait until 
now for him to get out of prison and accept the honor 
for the irish already geared up to give an ecstatic welcome to 
their national soccer team on its return from the world cup in 
italy it was a doubly joyous day 
is this not the greatest day ireland has ever seen yelled 
the master of ceremonies to the crowd outside the mansion house 
a double bill the irish team coming home and nelson mandela 
coming to the mansion house 
mandela seated beside his wife winnie inside the mansion 
house quickly picked up the spirit 
congratulations to your wonderful football team he said to 
applause from the dignitaries 
i have a hope please allow me to say so that they did so 
magnificently because they knew that in spirit i was amongst them 
underdog ireland which had never before qualified for the world 
cup got to the quarterfinals before losing to italy 10 saturday 
mandela immediately called for the maintenance of sanctions a 
stance likely to win support here but face opposition in britain 
his next stop prime minister margaret thatcher wants sanctions 
lifted in recognition of south african president f w de klerks 
reforms which included releasing mandela after 27 years in prison 
at a european community summit last week ireland which holds 
the ec presidency helped make sure the communitys embargo on 
imports of south african coal steel and gold coins remains firm 
in his speech mandela acknowledged de klerks reforms but 
added 
apartheid still remains in place it is our common duty and 
responsibility to ensure that apartheid is ended not tomorrow but 
now we call for the maintenance of sanctions against south 
africa and solidarity with our struggle 
at the airport he ignored a question about his attitude to the 
irish republican army which is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and is outlawed in both ireland and britain 
the iras legal political wing sinn fein strongly supports 
mandela 
among the guests at the mansion house was paul hill one of four 
irish people who served more than 14 years in a british prison 
until a judge freed them this year accepting that they had been 
wrongly convicted 
hill said he felt a comradeship with mandela who was jailed for 
plotting the violent overthrow of the white regime it was the 
affinity of a prisoner with another prisoner who was enduring what 
i was enduring he told a reporter 
ireland gained its niche in the annals of the antiapartheid 
campaign in 1984 when 11 supermarket workers were fired for 
refusing to handle south african fruit they picketed the store for 
nearly three years until they won a court case for unfair dismissal 
mandela was expected to meet with some of the group 
the mansion house where irelands first independent parliament 
sat in 1919 symbolizes irish liberation from centuries of british 
rule 
others who have been made freemen of dublin are playwright 
george bernard shaw pope john paul ii and us president john 
kennedy 
on monday mandela will talk with prime minister charles haughey 
and address the irish parliament before flying to london

television producers say warren beatty is 
losing some of his mystique as he heavily promotes his role in the 
movie dick tracy 
i would imagine the wegottohavehim attitude is somewhat 
diminished jack riley executive producer of abcs good 
morning america said in the july 7 issue of tv guide 
but actually now that hes gotten into it hes a far better 
interview than he has been he said 
beatty had stonewalled seasoned interviewer barbara walters 
early on and producers were wary of the once elusive star 
donahue senior producer lorri benson said she was 
pleasantly surprised by beattys openness when he appeared on 
the syndicated show there were no preconditions and no taboo 
subjects and beatty spontaneously agreed to appear on the show a 
second time she said 
riley also was leery of scheduling a beatty interview he had 
previously dealt with the star when he was touting his megabomb 
ishtar beatty taped a segment for good morning america 
but later made so many demands that the producers dumped the 
whole thing riley said 
the only constraint in the interview for dick tracy was that 
11yearold costar charlie korsmo be on with him

two million moslems stood in prayer 
sunday on arafat the mount overlooking mecca where the prophet 
mohammed delivered his last sermon 14 centuries ago as the annual 
moslem pilgrimage reached its high point 
for the first time since 1986 the moslem pilgrimage called the 
hajj has been free from terrorist attacks 
only a small fire at mina the tent city five miles from arafat 
marred an otherwise calm pilgrimage season 
witnesses said that on their descent from arafat they spotted 
smoke from a distance one said they were told it was at mina but 
it did not appear to be a large blaze fire can be a danger during 
the hajj because some pilgrims bring kerosene stoves to cook in the 
tents 
terrorism blamed on iranian or shiite moslems has occurred in 
the past three years 
the worst incident was in 1987 when iranians clashed with 
security forces leading to the death of more than 400 pilgrims 
the year before the saudis confiscated large quantities of 
explosives from members of the iranian contingent 
the saudis have since set a quota of 1000 per million of 
population for each islamic nation angered by the quotas the 
iranians have boycotted the hajj since 1988 
last year some small bombs went off during the hajj killing 
one pilgrim and injuring 16 the saudis tried and convicted kuwaiti 
shiite moslems and beheaded 16 of them 
saudi authorities this year reported a growing number of 
pilgrims for the hajj the saudis said 827236 pilgrims arrived 
from around the world about 52000 more than last year and some 
30000 more than 1988 
they were joined by about half a million pilgrims from saudi 
arabia and its large expatriate community an additional half 
million people were needed for servicing tasks 
the deputy governor of mecca region prince saud ibn 
abdulmohsen who is also deputy chairman of the central hajj 
committee said the ascent of pilgrims by car and foot over the 
55mile route from mina to arafat was perfectly organized and 
the flow of traffic was very smooth 
he said a few cases of heat fatigue were reported but were not 
serious temperatures reached 111 degrees 
he said the pilgrims used umbrellas and awnings for shade and 
that 87 million flasks of iced water were distributed a pet 
project of the saudi monarch king fahd 
the stand at arafat is considered the peak of the rituals and 
anyone who misses it will not be considered to have performed hajj 
the day is spent reading the koran the moslem holy book and 
praying 
dawn prayers monday mark the start of the threeday eid aladha 
or feast of sacrifice when sheep are slaughtered by the pilgrims 
and moslems everywhere to commemorate prophet abrahams offering of 
his son to god abraham is revered by moslems as well as by jews 
and christians 
the hajj is a pillar of the islamic faith moslems who are 
healthy and can afford it are required to perform the hajj at least 
once in their lifetime

vincent a buddy cianci jr 
convicted felon media personality former mayor is trying to 
become mayor again 
and if the 49yearold independent candidate wins in november 
it will be a journey cianci says will make him a better leader 
a lot of people say they didnt like me as mayor but they 
liked me on the radio cianci said the radio station made me 
listen and made me aware that there were other points of view 
its kept me sharp and its kept me current 
elected in 1974 he was forced out of office 10 years later 
after he attacked his estranged wifes lover with a fireplace log 
an ashtray and a lit cigarette he pleaded no contest to two 
assault charges and in april 1984 he received a fiveyear 
suspended sentence and probation 
after his ouster cianci wanted to run in the special mayoral 
election and complete his fouryear term in the states largest 
city with 160000 residents but the state supreme court ruled that 
his conviction barred him from doing so the ruling applied only to 
the special election and does not prevent cianci from running today 
in march 1985 cianci took up a career as a radio commentator 
with whjjam his threehour afternoon talk show a combination 
interview and callin show was the states most popular talk show 
until he gave it up to run again he also did political commentary 
for two tv stations 
rhode island political junkies discussed a cianci return for 
months even president bush joined in asking a providence 
journalist in march how about buddy cianci talk about a guy 
who liked to mix it up 
cianci maintains he didnt make a final decision until 
wednesday the day he announced his bid on the air 
as proof he points to his lack of money and staff on the other 
hand he also notes that dollars are not vital to him at this early 
stage i certainly dont need to get my name known 
darrell west of brown universitys public opinion center said 
that a crowded ballot could work to ciancis advantage besides 
cianci theres another independent in the race plus democratic 
and republican candidates to be chosen during primaries in 
september 
it could be a good race from buddys point of view west 
said if theres a fourperson race that probably means 35 to 40 
percent is going to win 
its not as if buddy has to convince the majority to become 
mayor a lot of people accept that hes got 20 to 25 percent so he 
only needs another 15 percent 
cianci who puts his core of supporters at 30 percent managed 
to upstage both state political parties with his announcement he 
filed his papers the day of the democratic and republican 
conventions effectively stealing their thunder in the next days 
newspapers and broadcasts 
state rep paul jabour whos among the five democrats vying for 
mayor poohpoohed ciancis candidacy saying a voter is one 
thing and a fan club is another 
but state rep frank fiorenzano opined if it wasnt for the 
problems he got himself into theres probably nothing he could not 
have obtained i wish i knew what it was i would like to get 
it and bottle it and give it to myself 
state sen victoria lederberg another mayoral hopeful 
suggested a new slogan for her campaign lets keep buddy on the 
air 
still she said he would definitely liven things up 
i tend to get bored with the race she said with buddy in 
the race im not bored 
ciancis not bored either he said his past ordeals and the six 
years of public penance have made him more willing to be held 
accountable 
id probably be the only officeholder in the state under the 
most public scrutiny and i welcome that it doesnt bother me 
he said the city of providence and the people of providence owe 
me nothing i owe them everything

nelson mandela saluted californians for 
taking economic sanctions against south africa and pledged to help 
american indians when he returns in october 
mandela announced saturday he would return to the united states 
to visit indian reservations and exchange views as to what i can 
do to help them in their struggle 
the indian people have written to me and explained their 
problems and it is but natural that i should respond to that by 
seeing them as i proposed to do mandela said at a brief news 
conference before he left oakland finishing his 11day whirlwind 
trip through the united states 
the announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by the american 
indians including rep ben nighthorsecampbell the only american 
indian in congress 
indians and south african blacks face some similar background 
problems said the colorado democrat 
the difference i think is that nobody is intentionally 
preventing indians from becoming part of the legislature he 
said in south africa they virtually lock black people out of 
running from office 
hundreds of mandelas supporters were disappointed when he cut 
short by a day his visit to oakland in order to make an appointment 
with irish prime minister charles haughy 
im not mad but it is dismaying to get so close just to be 
disappointed said ethelou talbert of oakland 
mandela and his wife winnie had to cancel a reception for 
winnie a 100aplate dinner and a 2500percouple reception 
the events went ahead and organizer sandre swanson said she did not 
expect to make many refunds 
people were giving for the cause to free south africa not 
just to see nelson and winnie mandela swanson said 
mandela 71 deputy president of the african national congress 
was freed in february after 27 years in a south african prison for 
plotting sabotage to overthrow the nations white government 
mandelas representatives said they considered canceling the 
entire oakland visit but rep ron dellums who represents oakland 
in congress intervened to save mandelas soldout speech before a 
crowd of 58000 at the oaklandalameda county coliseum 
during his 20minute coliseum speech mandela hailed 
californians for their role in the movement to persuade 
institutions to sell off stock in companies doing business in south 
africa 
we salute the state of california for having such a powerful 
political stance on divestment he said praising students at the 
university of california for pressuring officials to divest we 
salute the longshoremen for refusing to unload the ship with south 
african cargo in 1984 
supporters waved black green and gold anc flags beat on drums 
and stood to roar their support for the black south african hero of 
the antiapartheid movement 
we are at a true historical junction we cannot turn back 
said mandela thrusting his trademark clenched fist in the air 
we will not turn back 
oakland was the final stop on the grueling eightcity 
fundraising tour of the united states one of 14 countries on a 
roundtheworld trip 
although final fundraising figures will not be available until 
next week mandela said the us visit has succeeded beyond our 
wildest dreams 
total tour estimates range from 3 million to 7 million 
according to organizers more than 900000 was raised at oakland 
events according to mark mosher of the osborn group the public 
relations company handling media coverage of the visit but that 
figure does not include informal hatpassing and other spontaneous 
donations he said 
for mandela the trip bolstered more than the anc bankroll 
i feel like an old battery that has been recharged he said 
upon his arrival at oakland international airport

china on sunday launched its largest census ever 
mobilizing 7 million people to count the worlds most populous 
nation 
for the next 10 days census takers throughout the country 
from the crowded coastal cities to its desolate western regions 
will be knocking on doors to get the latest count of chinas 
estimated 11 billion people 
censustakers arrived at 9 am at zhongnanhai the redwalled 
compound housing communist party headquarters and homes of the top 
leaders the evening tv news reported 
the report showed two young census workers interviewing 
communist party general secretary jiang zemin and premier li peng 
running through the standard questions of name age and address 
even though in their cases the answers are common knowledge 
census workers also arrived early at the homes of ordinary 
citizens 
they didnt stay very long just asked their questions and 
left said a 50yearold worker from central beijing who gave 
only her surname kang this was actually their last visit not 
their first theyve come several times already getting ready for 
the census 
since spring officials have been making checks to confirm that 
household registrations are up to date census workers have also 
staged practice runs visiting families and filling out 
questionnaires 
to ensure the accuracy of the head count china is sending its 
census takers doortodoor for the first time previously 
residents were asked to visit census stations for the three 
censuses conducted since the communists came to power in 1949 
publicity for the census has been ubiquitous since the spring 
billboards and banners remind citizens that a successful census 
requires their cooperation and newspaper editorials explain why 
its necessary to count the nations people 
for the past two months government notices posted on a low 
green fence in kangs neighborhood have kept residents informed of 
the census proceedings 
its a very necessary task said another resident who did 
not give his name its just like a family how can you take 
care of your family if you dont even know how many of you there 
are and what everyones doing 
kang and others noted that the 21item questionnaire was more 
detailed than that of the previous census in 1982 
most however said they didnt mind answering questions about 
each family members name age education level and occupation as 
well as about household features and childbearing conditions for 
women 
but the same questions strike fear in the hearts of china 20 
millionstrong floating population who have moved to cities 
without permission and among those who have had children in 
violation of chinas strict family planning policy 
in beijing census workers headed out saturday evening to count 
the floating population many of whom work during the day and 
return home late said zhu yilin head of the municipal census 
office 
initial results of the census will be published in october but 
it will take nearly two years to process the data they collect

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki offered 
sunday to meet this week with lech walesa to ease the bitter 
political war that has torn the solidarity movement 
an aid to walesa said the solidarity chairman was aware of the 
offer and that arrangements for the meeting would probably be 
announced soon 
mazowieckis peace gesture came at a meeting of local solidarity 
citizens committees called by his backers in the conflict walesa 
has accused his former ally of moving too slowly to implement 
political and economic reforms 
members of citizens committees from around the country met 
saturday with walesa and then sunday with mazowiecki to discuss 
what direction the solidarity union movement should take 
mazowieckis backers failed to win enough support to create a 
nationwide federation of citizens committees behind the government 
instead the issue was postponed until a conference july 21 
sundays meeting passed a resolution urging the solidarity 
leader and mazowiecki to cooperate 
taking the floor earlier mazowiecki told the local activists 
meeting in the parliament building that he was always willing to 
talk with walesa even though he had been attacked by him 
he said he would call walesa on condition that the conversation 
would be conducted as a full partnership and not as mazowiecki 
paying a serfs homage 
i think that certain issues should be toned down mazowiecki 
said i am proposing to mr walesa to talk this coming week 
mazowiecki said they should talk not to remove all differences 
between us because that would not be true but to talk so that 
disputes and battles proceed in a way that does not destroy the 
common good of poland and solidaritys legacy 
asked later he declined to elaborate on specific topics for 
discussion 
walesa aide krzysztof pusz reached at home in gdansk said 
walesa was aware of mazowieckis proposal 
i think the details should be worked out this week pusz 
said 
the walesa and mazowiecki factions were competing for the 
allegiance of the grass roots during the weekend meetings and the 
fight seemed to end in a draw 
delegates were not enthusiastic by the call from the mazowiecki 
faction for creating a national federation that would act as a base 
of support for the government 
but in a straw poll sunday they also rejected walesas proposal 
that the citizens committees be opened to members of other 
political groups 
the question of the committees role is important because they 
constitute easily the countrys strongest political force in last 
years parliamentary elections and last months local elections 
virtually all candidates endorsed by the solidarity citizens 
committees won 
walesa argues that the local committees should admit supporters 
of other budding political parties and become forums for discussing 
public issues he also says they should be free to criticize the 
government 
otherwise he said solidarity could itself become a monopoly 
and eventually be taken over by people with dictatorial tendencies 
supporters of mazowiecki accuse walesa of demagoguery they want 
the local committees to band together to create a national 
federation to defend mazowieckis government which is carrying out 
difficult economic reforms 
the 9monthold government has introduced radical economic 
reforms but it has taken a gradual approach to dismantling the old 
communist power structure and dismissing communist holdovers 
arguing the alternative would be witch hunts and chaos 
the prime minister told the meeting sunday that there is need 
for political support for this cause taking place in poland 
the question is should we slacken and withdraw he said 
or go further knowing it will be difficult 
at a meeting june 24 of ranking solidarity members 63 of 
walesas oldest advisers broke ranks accusing him of trying to 
make the citizens committees into a tool of his widely expected 
campaign for president

the hard work starts for donald trump once the 
bankers finish his 65 million bailout plan the developer will 
have to restructure his empire and probably sell some of his vast 
holdings to raise cash 
the banks hope that by deferring about 800 million of his 2 
billion bank debt for up to five years trump will gain time to 
sell his assets in an orderly way 
the banks believe the assets he possesses are valuable enough 
to be sold over time at respectable prices and are certainly enough 
to keep his operation viable said a source close to the 
negotiations 
a rush sale would have meant low prices that would have kept 
trump from meeting his debt obligations to the banks the source 
added 
as it is the value of his assets has been depressed by the 
sagging real estate market and the increasingly stagnant atlantic 
city gambling market 
the developers properties include trump tower whose marble 
shopping arcade has become a big tourist attraction the ritzy 
plaza hotel the trump shuttle with its fleet of 17 aircraft and 
casinos in atlantic city 
trump will have to sell some of his assets to raise cash 
unless the atlantic city operations begin to support his 
debt record and thats the wild card said edward s gordon 
president and chief executive officer of the commercial real estate 
firm bearing his name 
bankers hope the paperwork for their 65 million loan to trump 
will be completed within 30 days about 70 banks on tuesday lent 
trump 20 million immediately so he could meet a midnight deadline 
on a 43 million payment on bonds backing one of his casinos 
in a statement tuesday trump said the bailout deal reflects 
and confirms the inherent longterm value of our assets including 
trump tower the plaza hotel the atlantic city hotels and the 
trump shuttle 
trump has has discussed selling his east coast air service and 
the trump princess the 282foot yacht he bought for 30 million 
business week reported last month that he is also listening to 
offers for trump castle his worstperforming casino and 
according to real estate sources thinking about selling the plaza 
hotel which trump likes to call it the ultimate trophy in the 
world 
last week the daily news in new york quoted an unidentified 
banker close to the trump negotiations as saying that trumps share 
in alexanders department stores would probably be among the first 
assets he would sell 
trump paid nearly 70 million for a 27 percent stake in the 
retailing company and planned to develop its real estate holdings 
into huge commercial and retailing centers 
also among his assets is trump city 76 acres of undeveloped 
land on manhattans west side that was the site of an unused rail 
yard he paid about 100 million in 1985 and wants to build the 
worlds tallest building luxury apartments and a shopping mall 
there 
the plan has been presented to the city planning commission but 
is not yet in the often lengthy land use approval process it has 
been held up in part by community activists who oppose the 
project for environmental reasons 
forbes magazine says trump values the property at 650 million 
though forbes puts its worth at 200 million and business week says 
it would sell for only 160 million

northwestern coast killing 25 guerrillas military officials said 
sunday 
one soldier was killed and 25 wounded in saturdays operation 
the officials said on condition of anonymity 
the loss of the base in the village of marichchukkaddi 115 
miles north of colombo is a major blow to the rebels officials 
said 
they said it was hidden in dense forest and close to the sea 
making it an ideal point for transporting men and weapons

the defense minister said sunday that the military 
must help build housing for the tens of thousands of soldiers and 
their families returning from service in the formerly communist 
countries of the warsaw pact 
dmitri t yazov told the government newspaper izvestia that the 
housing crisis facing returning troops was the issue of issues 
confronting the soviet military 
more than 25000 soldiers and their families are on their way 
back to the soviet union from neighboring czechoslovakia and 
hungary yazov told izvestia another 173600 were already waiting 
in dormitories and hotels for permanent housing he said 
the soviet military along with local government councils 
should above all sharply increase the pace and volume of private 
construction of new housing to ease the crunch he said 
yazov said that 440000 apartments are scheduled to be built 
within the next five years 
already this year 43000 troops and their dependents have 
returned from czechoslovakia poland and hungary adding to the 
27000 withdrawn from east germany and hungary 
the overthrow of communist rule in all of the east bloc 
countries except bulgaria has accelerated plans announced two years 
ago by president mikhail s gorbachev to bring back more than 
500000 troops from eastern europe 
demands by hungary and czechoslovakia that the withdrawal of all 
120000 soviet troops from their territory be completed by mid1991 
have accelerated the pullout and the pressure to find housing 
for strategic reasons most of the troops are being stationed in 
the ukraine byelorussia and russia the slavic republics on the 
soviet unions western border 
there is already a critical housing shortage in some areas of 
byelorussia because of the need to relocate thousands of people 
whose land was irradiated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster 
in addition some local groups apparently are not happy about 
the prospect of becoming garrison towns 
yazov said that informal groups in ivanofrankovsk in the 
southwestern corner of the ukraine near the border with romania 
had blocked construction of military housing 
it is shameful to hear such things as that yazov told the 
newspaper 
the united states and soviet union have both agreed to trim 
their forces in central europe to 195000 each except for 30000 
us troops to be left in britain and southern europe the united 
states has about 310000 troops in europe including 250000 in 
germany 
the soviet union has about 380000 troops in east germany and 
moscow is pressing west germany to help finance housing 
construction once the troops are pulled out 
bonn has expressed a willingness to help and the issue is 
likely to be discussed when chancellor helmut kohl vi sits moscow

a man whose daughter died in the december 1988 
bombing of pam am flight 103 said sunday he smuggled a fake bomb 
past security officials at heathrow airport and checked it aboard a 
flight to the united states 
in an interview with british broadcasting corp radio dr jim 
swire said he took the bomb aboard an airliner several weeks ago 
but declined to name the airline 
swire said the device was made to resemble the bomb that 
exploded on the flight killing 270 people including his daughter 
flora 
the bomb is believed to have had a barometric trigger designed 
to detonate at a specific altitude the boeing 747 bound for new 
york was at more than 30000 feet over the town of lockerbie 
scotland when it disintegrated 
swire said his device was packed inside a radiocassette 
recorder but used marzipan icing instead of semtex plastic 
explosives 
we actually took marzipan icing because thats pliable and 
feels like semtexand looks similar on xray he said 
in addition it had a dummy detonator which would have shown 
up on xray an extra printed circuit board extra batteries 
pressure transducer and so on all wired up in a form that would 
have worked if the marzipan had been replaced with semtex swire 
said 
our flight was selected for what they call special security 
and our cases were opened and searched in front of us the 
radiocassette recorder was picked up and i was asked whether i 
had taken the batteries out and i correctly replied yes i had 
taken the batteries out it was then replaced in the suitcase and 
is now in america 
swire heads a group of british relatives of disaster victims 
called uk families flight 103 
transport secretary cecil parkinson said he would call for a 
full investigation and swire would be invited to meet with 
department officials monday to give details 
we are already conducting a series of regular tests at 
airports all over the country parkinson said 
a spokesman for heathrow airport said airport officials are 
responsible for screening passengers and carryon luggage but 
individual airlines are responsible for screening checked baggage

striking workers began shutting down oil 
fields sunday after last minute talks failed to settle a labor 
dispute the union said 
the norwegian federation of oil workers said in a statement it 
saw no end in sight to the strike which began midnight saturday 
norways north sea fields produced 163 million barrels a day of 
oil and 18 billion cubic meters of natural gas a month in april 
norway and great britain are europes largest petroleum producers 
municipalities minister johan j jakobsen acting head of 
government while prime minister jan p syse is abroad summoned 
union leaders and business representatives large saturday to urge 
continued negotiations 
he asked them to keep talking because roughly 25 percent of 
norways national income comes from petroleum and a strike could 
be grave for our economy said kjell finnerud a spokesman for 
the ministry 
news reports estimated up to 31 million a day in lost income 
negotiations resumed but quickly deadlocked because the 
norwegian confederation of business and industry had nothing to 
offer anyway the 6000 member union said in its release 
the union said the 25 percent pay raise offered by the business 
confederation was less than half of its demand 
the confederation said the unions members average annual wage 
of 49000 is already 85 percent higher than the average wage in 
mainland industry

the victory of former communists in 
bulgarias first free elections has polarized this balkan country 
rather than uniting it 
students have begun a nationwide protest that may swell into a 
major movement 
the students first occupied sofia university june 11 a day 
after a first round of elections indicated the socialist party 
formerly the communists would triumph over the union of 
democratic forces opposition coalition 
over the next few days students at major universities in sofia 
and several other cities joined the sitin strike 
on sunday about 15000 students and supporters attended a 
downtown rally in sofia organized by a national strike committee to 
back the protesters demands 
at first the media the socialists and even the democratic 
forces ignored the students but now they and their supporters are 
taken increasingly seriously as a potential grassroots revolt in 
bulgaria 
striking students claim they have collected 130000 signatures 
on petitions in their support while a rival movement of students 
for democracy says it has gathered 50000 signatures from strike 
opponents 
the union of cooperative farms an association of agricultural 
cooperatives has threatened to block the main roads to sofia with 
tractors and other vehicles unless the students end their strike by 
july 11 
even the protesters agree that change wont come swiftly 
the lackadaisical air that accompanies much bulgarian activity 
prevails at the university a few hundred of the 12000 students 
are actually taking part in a sitin most lolling on scorched 
lawns in the balkan summer heat 
the students began their strike to force disclosures of what 
they claim were irregularities in last months elections the 
countrys first multiparty balloting in 58 years 
their goals have since expanded to get the state tv director to 
resign for alleged bias in reporting and to investigate president 
petar mladenovs alleged consideration of using tanks against 
antigovernment protests last winter 
behind these aims however is a larger goal of creating a 
changed society 
the strike has shown the bulgarian population that some people 
can think differently and that it is their right to demand 
things said nevyana nikolova an assistant english professor on 
strike at sofia university 
it forces people to take sides something the bulgarian has 
lacked over the years said her colleague julia stefanova we 
dont want a new government we want a new system 
the end of hardline communist rule in bulgaria came not as in 
romania czechoslovakia and east germany through street protest 
but in a communist party coup in which some comrades ousted party 
chief todor zhivkov 
the communists reorganized as socialists after peaceful 
demonstrations by the fragmented but quickly growing opposition 
the socialists initiated negotiations that led to the june 
elections 
in sofia a democratic forces stronghold nearly everybody 
including most western diplomats was shocked by the socialists 
211seat victory in the parliamentary elections the democratic 
forces won 144 seats 
most people in sofia have a tale to tell about what they call 
manipulations by the socialists to secure votes in the 
villages there are allegations the peasants were warned theyd 
lose their pensions agricultural supplies or other benefits if 
they voted for the democratic forces 
cooler heads recognize the democratic forces concentrated too 
much on urban areas that the party probably would have carried 
anyway 
whatever the reason for the loss it has pitted rural areas 
against towns old against young worker against intellectual 
fear of the known and fear of the unknown prevailed said 
stefanova referring to the oppositions fear of the socialists 
past and the voters fear of changes to come 
ironically the outcome also complicated life for the victors 
socialist premier andrei lukanov has indicated his reluctance to 
head a oneparty government preferring a coalition that might have 
more chance of attracting sorely needed foreign investment 
but the opposition is currently adamant it wont help the 
socialists solve the growing economic crisis created by their 
mismanagement 
the new parliament will serve a twoyear term and write a new 
constitution 
amid the anxieties political intrigue and consumer shortages 
the shadow of romanias street violence looms large 
sofia residents look with apprehension at pictures of the miners 
that terrorized students and other government opponents in 
bucharest and hope the violence will not travel south 
sofia is not yet bucharest reads the caption on a 
frontpage picture in the weekly sofia news inside the paper 
journalist krassimira ikonomova voices a more widespread sentiment 
we are afraid she writes because we are not yet free 
people we are afraid that the first shy steps toward democracy 
could fail as happened in romania

a relief agency distributed 40 tons 
of supplies to earthquake survivors in iran on sunday but the 
official in charge of the shipment said it was embarrassing how 
little us aid had gone to iran 
a cargo plane with the supplies arrived in tehran sunday morning 
and relief workers spent about six hours unloading it said stephen 
norman vice president of americares a new canaanbased relief 
organization 
the plane the second loaded by americares left bradley 
international airport on saturday tacked to the supplies were 
small signs reading humanity is one body in english and persian 
an americares flight last weekend was the first us relief 
effort to reach iran in 11 years us government relief supplies 
were sent a day later 
doyt conn americares project director said it was 
embarrassing that more us supplies were not going to iran 
its saddening its a shame conn said 
americares has an abundance of supplies to send some were left 
behind on saturdays flight but needs nearly 250000 to charter 
the cargo planes for each trip conn said 
if we can continue to raise the money to send these planes we 
will continue to do this he said 
susan myrick the mayor of charlotte nc and charleston 
sc mayor joseph riley have appealed to the nations mayors to 
raise money for survivors of the quake that killed at least 40000 
people in iran two weeks ago 
the concern i have is that people are not really willing to 
reach out to the people of iran because of longstanding tensions 
with the united states said myrick who was present saturday for 
the departure of the shipment 
these people are just like us they cant control what their 
government does myrick said her city has raised about 1500 in 
donations an amount she says is not nearly enough

kindness was revealed the iranians were stunned then they said 
you are welcome said katherine osullivan an americares

israel freed more than 400 palestinian 
prisoners from detention centers sunday to mark the upcoming moslem 
holiday of eid aladha 
freeing arab prisoners is traditional on religious holidays but 
the timing of the release raised speculation it may be related to a 
report that a western hostage may be freed in lebanon or to 
israels efforts to make peace with palestinians 
at megiddo prison in northern israel site of the biblical 
armageddon the first dozen of so arabs were released in the early 
afternoon many flashed v for victory signs from the bus 
windows 
by sunday night the army said 416 palestinian inmates had been 
freed from facilities in the gaza strip the ketziot detention camp 
and megiddo 
in the hostage report from tehran the sunday correspondent of 
london quoted sayed hossein mosavian an iranian foreign ministry 
official as saying a western hostage could be freed soon without 
any concession by the west 
however mosavian also told the newspaper that the united states 
and other western nations should exert influence on israel to free 
its many lebanese shiite captives 
in iran interior minister abdollah nouri said sunday western 
nations sending aid for victims of the june 21 earthquake that left 
40000 dead should not expect political benefits 
asked whether iran wanted better relations with the united 
states one of the countries to send aid nouri said no 
it was not clear if israels lebanese christian militia allies 
in lebanon also intended to free prisoners for the moslem holiday 
which starts monday the israelifinanced south lebanon army 
militia holds hundreds of shiite prisoners at the elkhiam 
detention camp in southern lebanon 
while israel also holds lebanese shiites within its own 
territory it appeared most of those being released sunday were 
palestinians arrested in the 30monthold uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
the eid aladha holidary or feast of sacrifice commemorates 
abrahams offer to sacrifice his son for god in moslem belief the 
son is ishmael in jewish tradition isaac was the son offered by 
abraham 
dozens of arab families from the occupied west bank waited 
outside megiddo prison for husbands sons and brothers to be 
released but many complained those being freed were almost at the 
end of their sentences 
subhi abu schedem 18 from hebron waited outside the prison for 
his brother nader 16 
he said nader had nine days left of a sixmonth sentence for 
stonethrowing and added they only release prisoners who have 
two or three days left and not those that have 10 months or more 
this is obvious propaganda 
dan naveh a chief aide to defense minister moshe arens said 
the release of arab prisoners is part of arens plan to coax 
palestinians into peace talks by easing daily hardships 
naveh said friday that prisoners being freed will have served 
the majority of a first sentence for participating in riots and 
would include juveniles under the age of 14 
according to army statistics israel held 10430 arab security 
prisoners as of friday 
of these 4341 have been convicted and 1038 are being held 
under emergency regulations allowing suspects to be detained up to 
a year without charge or trial the others are awaiting charges or 
trial 
also sunday a new leaflet by the proplo leaders of the 
uprising called for palestinians and arab countries to boycott 
usmade goods to protest american policies in the middle east 
in the gaza strip town of rafah masked palestinians fatally 
stabbed an arab suspected of collaborating with israeli authorities 
the victim was identified as zaher elhoul 30 the army 
confirmed the death and said police were investigating 
elhouls death raised to 229 the number of palestinians killed 
by fellow arabs since the uprising began in december 1987 most 
were suspected of collaboration or of dealing in drugs or 
prostitution 
a total of 721 palestinians have been killed by israelis since 
the revolt began and 45 israelis have died in the violence

a 165yearold state law requiring that 
children get a minimum share of their parents estate the only law 
of its kind in the nation was officially repealed sunday 
a parent can now disinherit a child for any reason or none 
as long as the child is over 23 and physically and mentally able to 
handle his affairs 
proponents say it was about time louisiana residents enjoy the 
right to dispose of their property as they see fit but critics 
claim that in an era of divorce and remarriage the new doctrine 
will remove an ancient protection for neglected children 
moreover they say the change will provoke intrafamily warfare 
and stir up years of litigation in the courts 
this looks like a lawyers dream and a courtrooms 
nightmare said attorney catherine soutullo 
for 165 years louisiana has carried forward the philosophy of 
frances napoleonic code demanding that children get some portion 
of their parents estate 
one child was guaranteed at least a fourth two or more shared 
at least half parents could cut their children off for only 12 
reasons ranging from failing to ransom parents from captivity to 
failing to communicate with a parent for two years 
tulane law school professor cynthia samuel said the new law will 
expose state courts to ugly lawsuits by children trying to 
invalidate a will on grounds that a beneficiary unduly influenced 
the parent 
she also predicted more people would make wills which they must 
do to take advantage of their new power to disinherit 
youd be amazed how much interest there is out there among 
some people whove followed this very closely and whove been 
waiting to do this samuel said 
although samuel acknowledged the old law sometimes forced 
parents to bequeath wealth to adult children who did not need it 
she is more concerned about the loss of protection for children who 
did need it 
the legislature changed the forced heirship law last year 
primarily at the urging of chalin perez the former plaquemines 
parish president who has been feuding with the children from his 
first marriage for a decade

thousands of residents gathered at the 
statehouse on sunday to protest a new package of higher taxes 
taunting gov jim florio and president bush with chants of 
florio bush read our lips no new taxes 
the villain for most of the estimated 4500 protesters was 
florio the democratic governor who proposed a higher and expanded 
sales tax a higher income tax and increased taxes on items such 
as cigarettes and liquor

of more than 1 billion provide 11 billion in added state aid to 
public schools and ease some property taxes all but the income tax 
took effect sunday 
the state sales tax which increased from 6 percent to 7 
percent is the second highest in the country behind connecticuts 
which is 8 percent the increased tax also was expanded to include 
some previously exempt items such as alcohol cigarettes telephone 
bills soap and disposable paper goods 
many in the crowd chanting recall recall and florio 
must go held up rolls of toilet paper one of several items to 
be taxed for the first time 
but the rally organizers stressed their anger toward a 
democratic governor did not mean they supported republicans who 
this week attempted to make political hay out of the rally as a 
prelude to next years legislative elections 
they make promises and they dont keep them said john 
budzash 39 a postal worker from howell who helped organize the 
rally we cant take these tax increases but the republicans are 
as much to blame as the democrats 
budzash said the organizers calling themselves hands across 
new jersey want the tax hikes repealed and a complete audit of 
state government to see where our money goes he said by august 
the group wanted to give florio a petition with the names of one 
million people against taxes 
the protest began when budzash made a telephone call to radio 
station wkxw and called for a statehouse rally other listeners 
responded and the station which serves most of the state

government traffic safety experts in their 
neverending effort to curb highway speeding hope to use an old 
weapon in a new way they believe will convince some heavyfooted 
drivers to ease up on their accelerators 
federal officials are looking for ways to get stationary radar 
units at highway construction sites dangerous curves and other 
areas the idea is that speeding drivers who use radar detectors 
will slow down not realizing that the nearest trooper might be 
miles away 
jeffrey miller deputy director of the national highway traffic 
safety administration said the plan would require federal 
communications commission cooperation he said it could turn radar 
detectors into safety tools 
but advocates for radar detectors which are owned by between 12 
million and 15 million drivers say the gadgets are the best 
defense motorists have against radar errors and unwarranted tickets 
radar detector opponents including the government and insurance 
companies categorize the devices with burglary tools both they 
say are used by lawbreakers 
brian oneill head of the insurance institute for highway 
safety said a study conducted in maryland and virginia showed that 
one out of every eight cars has a radar detector while nearly a 
third of big trucks have them 
the study showed that 22 percent of cars without the units 
exceeded the speed limit while more than 40 percent of those with 
detectors drove faster than the posted limits 
the study revealed as many vehicles with radar detectors in 
virginia where they are illegal as in neighboring maryland where 
they are allowed 
laws banning radar detectors in virginia connecticut and 
washington dc date back to the 1960s the only recent statute 
is a scheduled new york ban of the units in commercial vehicles 
in california state police must pace speeders the old fashioned 
way because that states legislature refuses to allow them to use 
radar however some local police use it 
some insurance companies have tried to avoid accepting customers 
with radar detectors but the government employees insurance co 
geico has found it tough to defend its refusal of insurance to 
radar detector users in march a maryland court ruled against the 
practice and surcharges for detector users have been struck down 
by insurance company regulators in several other states 
were not interested in people who tell us up front theyre 
planning to speed were not interested in lawbreakers geico 
spokesman august alegi said 
in 1986 congress rejected a move to force states that raise 
speed limits from 55 mph to 65 mph to outlaw radar detectors 
it unleashed such a torrent of irate letters and telegrams 
that so far as i know nobody in congress has mentioned the 
subject since said the nhtsas miller 
when something is that widespread and popular its difficult 
to attack it successfully he said 
miller said speed has been underestimated as a major national 
safety problem with the focus on seat belts and antidrunken 
driving efforts 
the nhtsa is backing an experiment on the capital beltway the 
busy freeway that circles washington dc in which a photograph 
is taken of a speeding vehicle and a ticket mailed to the owner 
the system in which no tickets will initially be issued has 
raised the concern of the american civil liberties union the 
american automobile association and other groups 
there goes due process out the window said chuck terlizzi 
maryland coordinator for the national motorists association 
government and private safety advocates also are using or 
considering other ways of catching speeders including devices that 
employ laser beams or measure speed without emitting a radar beam

communist rebels have kidnapped an 
american peace corps member but us authorities said sunday they 
learned of the abduction only after other volunteers were ordered 
to leave last week 
timothy swanson 26 of cheyenne wyo was taken by gunmen june 
13 from his home in patag a remote village in the mountains of 
negros island philippine and us sources said 
swanson was believed the first peace corps volunteer kidnapped 
by the rebels and the first american held by the new peoples army 
since nine airmen were detained briefly in 1986 
in kennebunkport maine where he was vacationing president bush 
called the kidnapping a sign of the age of the terrorist 
weve been very much worried about this he said 
embassy spokesman stanley schrager said american officials 
learned of swansons disappearance saturday after trying to contact 
him as part of the evacuation of peace corps volunteers from the 
philippines 
but bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft told 
reporters we first heard about it maybe a week ago close to a 
week ago 
last week the united states recalled the 261 peace corps 
volunteers in the country after intelligence reports indicated that 
communist rebels might try to kill or kidnap them 
american authorities had said previously that all the volunteers 
were accounted for the volunteers began leaving the philippines on 
friday 
schrager said american officials rushed to negros to discuss 
ways to win swansons release but said the united states would not 
pay ransom for the peace corps workers freedom 
on sunday the retired roman catholic bishop of negros the rev 
antonio fortich said swanson had been friendly with new peoples 
army guerrillas 
swansons father leonard said in an interview in cheyenne on 
sunday that his son knew rebels in the area where he worked on a 
reforestation project but that he never considered them a threat 
he tried to be friendly with all the folks in the village and all 
who he encountered swansons father said 
i was dismayed of course to learn of the kidnapping he 
said i guess here in cheyenne we would ask for peoples 
prayers 
according to fortich four to eight armed rebels came to 
swansons home in the negros mountains last month and told his 
filipino wife merly they were borrowing her husband the 
couple were married may 29 in a ceremony attended by swansons 
parents leonard swanson said 
fortich said the wife received a note from her husband last week 
saying he was well but asking for his glasses reading materials 
and clothes she left the items in a bag outside their home and a 
rebel courier retrieved it at night fortich said 
swanson asked his wife not to notify authorities and she did so 
only after hearing of the order to evacuate peace corps members 
president corazon aquinos press secretary tomas gomez said 
the embassy notified philippine officials of the disappearance 
saturday gomez said the kidnapping might have been avoided if the 
united states had consulted philippine authorities on security 
they refused to listen to a security briefing gomez said 
maybe if they did that we could have prevented it 
schrager said the embassy had dispatched diplomats to the negros 
city of bacolod negros 300 miles southeast of manila is a 
stronghold of the rebel new peoples army which has waged a 
21yearold insurgency and seeks to establish a marxist state in 
the philippines 
on may 29 rebels on negros kidnapped a japanese aid worker 
fumio mizuno and are believed holding him in mountains near 
bacolod fortich has been trying to negotiate mizunos release 
the us decision to withdraw the peace corps volunteers drew 
criticism from philippines officials who said the united states 
was overreacting to the alleged threats 
although the move was expected to have little impact on 
international aid programs the withdrawal was embarassing to the 
aquino government which is increasingly sensitive to its 
international image 
communist rebels are believed to have killed eight americans 
since april 1989 but they had made no public threat against the 
peace corps 
us officials also said the peace corps office in manila would 
remain open as a sign that the withdrawal was temporary

a fight erupted after mass at the local 
cathedral sunday when traditionalist roman catholics shoving the 
vicar aside tried to move in to celebrate their own service in 
latin 
punches were thrown the organ sounded and candles went flying 
down an aisle as the estimated 60 traditionalists tried to take 
over the main altar at the st maclou cathedral following regular 
sunday mass 
a policeman tried to mediate the brawl which continued for more 
than an hour ending when the rev andre berrere agreed to say his 
latin mass in a side chapel 
the incident began about 1130 am when the group of 
traditionalists organized by the militant committee saint 
genevieve of argenteuil marched to the main altar of the cathedral 
in this northern suburb of paris 
the cathedral vicar the rev jeanmarie human surrounded by 
altar boys and other faithful blocked the way to the main altar 
considered by church law the symbol of ecclesiastical authority in 
the diocese 
several times the traditionalists tried to shove aside the 
vicar according to witness accounts at one point human sounded 
the organs in protest as defenders moved into the choir area 
witnesses said 
by 1 pm the traditionalists gave up the idea of using the 
main altar for their mass they left after celebrating a latin mass 
in a side chapel 
no one was seriously injured in the melee 
the attempted takeover of the cathedral was the fourth such 
effort since the start of the year by the committee which is 
pressing the pontoise diocese to put an unused chapel at their 
disposal for latin masses 
the second vatican council 196265 suppressed the use of the 
16thcentury version of the latin mass and established the use of 
the local language the reform was intended to make the ceremony 
more accessible to the faithful 
some catholics dislike the new mass and have joined the 
traditionalist movement of french archbishop marcel lefebvre he 
was excommunicated two years ago for consecrating four bishops in 
defiance of papal orders 
two years ago pope john paul ii urged bishops to provide a 
full and generous use of a 1984 decree allowing use of the 
tridentine mass under special circumstances his order was an 
attempt to reach out to people uncomfortable with the new mass

security was intensified in the capital 
sunday after the government extradited two suspected drug 
traffickers to the united states the first such extraditions in 
three months 
additional army checkpoints were set up in downtown bogota and 
patrols were increased apparently out of fear that terrorists 
working for the traffickers might try to retaliate

united states for three months officials gave no explanation for 
resuming the extraditions

60 were flown to the united states on a drug enforcement 
administration plane early sunday morning 
they were turned over to us authorities at the bogota

the continued determination of the colombian government to battle 
the colombian drug cartel and to bring these drug dealing 
suspects to justice

arraignment in new york city on charges of distributing and 
conspiracy to distribute cocaine

region since january

to tap the phone line of anyone suspected of having links to drug 
traffickers

emergency measures adopted last week to fight drug terrorism el

no one knows exactly what is 
attacking bathers along a 60mile stretch of floridas atlantic 
coast but the socalled sea lice has left beachgoers with 
nasty red welts on their bodies 
despite the name health officials arent certain that insects 
are to blame 
jack nolan of the palm beach county public health units 
epidemiology group said all officials know is the rash occurs most 
often between april and july when the water temperature varies 
between 78 and 82 degrees 
each spring and summer for the past decade unsuspecting 
swimmers from deerfield beach to jensen beach have returned home to 
have their bodies erupt in welts that look like insect bites and 
itch like poison ivy 
its itchy its uncomfortable and my daughter ran a 
temperature with it said mary morgan of boca raton we do like 
the beach and wed like to go back but were a little leery until 
we know what this is 
the county and several beach patrols have commissioned studies 
to find the culprit and the cure for the ailment also known as sea 
bathers eruption and gulf coast itch 
pharmacists and beach patrols suggest remedies ranging from 
calamine lotion to benadryl to a bath in wet oatmeal

the leader of striking chiquita 
employees said sunday he was optimistic after officials from the 
us fruit company joined talks on worker demands for their first 
pay increase in six years 
the situation has improved mainly because chiquita is now at 
the negotiating table with us union president rene ayestas said 
the union represents chiquitas 10000 workers in honduras 
ayestas said there have been no results from the talks which 
began saturday but added that anything could happen if there is 
flexibility on both parts 
company officials had no comment 
chiquita workers went on strike thursday and company officials 
immediately branded the strike illegal and said they would not pay 
higher wages 
thousands of other workers including those at honduras only 
oil refinery struck in solidarity the workers are still on 
strike and honduras is likely to run out of fuel early this week if 
the labor dispute is not resolved 
business and political leaders have voiced fears the spreading 
strike could destablize honduras the poorest nation in the 
hemisphere after haiti and president rafael leonardo callejas last 
week dispatched a mediating commission 
the commission and union officials have been talking for a week 
but the company only joined the negotiations saturday 
the workers who make an average of 1532 a day have asked for 
a 60 percent raise their last pay increase was in 1984 after a 
10day strike last october the company agreed to review wages but 
has taken no action 
there is a lot of distrust on both sides and they are asking 
for many guarantees to any accords said congressman mariano 
gonzalez a member of the presidential mediating commission but 
what is important is that they are negotiating directly 
the cincinnatibased chiquita formerly united fruit has been a 
major power in honduras since the early part of the century it now 
controls about 60 percent of the nations banana exports a 
subsidiary of new yorkbased standard fruit controls most of the 
remainder of the trade 
bananas are the leading export of this tennesseesized nation of 
48 million honduras was the first central american nation to be 
dubbed a banana republic after the immense power wielded by 
us fruit companies

lost treasure international intrigue a lone 
adventurer 
the script for a hollywood movie nope this is a job for willi 
a kotre an investigator who followed a trail of musty documents 
cold war secrets and just plain luck to discover the lost treasure 
of the quedlinburg cathedral in east germany 
but please dont call me indiana jones the softspoken 
german said 
the 36yearold kotre a researcher for the prussian cultural 
heritage foundation in berlin in may pinpointed a local bank as 
the place where a dead former us army officers heirs were 
keeping the missing gifts of germanys earliest kings 
now the arts original owner the lutheran church of 
quedlinburg is suing the family of former lt joe t meador for 
return of the treasures meador died in 1980 bequeathing the 
artwork to his brother jack meador and sister jane cook 
lawyers for the church contend meador stole the treasures in the 
final days of world war ii mailed them to the us and kept them 
in his hometown of whitewright about 60 miles north of dallas 
german officials want to bring the artwork home as a symbol of 
german reunification 
it is very difficult to take a historical account and 
successfully trace a missing item to an individual korte said 
usually you need some kind of postwar event like someone 
trying to sell the art and then you have a case 
thats what happened here 
an east german who helped in the case gunter wermusch told the 
dallas morning news in a telephone interview from berlin that nazi 
officials hauled the cathedrals treasures into the cave as allied 
troops approached in early 1945 
soon after kortes search began a london book dealer offered 
one of the missing treasures a 9thcentury illuminated manuscript 
to the researchers employer 
officials said the 9 million offer was rejected in late 1988 
because of the price and potential problems from buying art taken 
from another country but it provided a clue that the dealer 
apparently worked for a us resident they said 
korte said he began looking for detailed accounts of army units 
near quedlinburg in april 1945 spending months in the national 
archives records tracing us operations he then went to the 
national personnel records center in st louis the militarys 
service records repository 
more than 1000 names of soldiers assigned to the area were 
found by korte in over a week of research he then turned to east 
germans and medieval art experts for further clues 
bavarian manuscript dealer heribert tenschert in february was 
offered the illuminated manuscript which had been in europe 
without a buyer for two years the newspaper said 
tenschert said he relayed the offer to the foundation of the 
states a private german cultural group the foundation paid 3 
million to houston attorney john t torigian in april for the 
manuscript said aoachim fischer a foundation director 
torigian termed himself a proxy for an unnamed us client 
fischer said 
dealers left out of the sale immediately began talking said 
korte 
eventually i learned the name of the bank and it was short 
work once i had that he said 
in may korte went to the first national bank of whitewright 
which was holding the artwork for the meador family bank president 
john farley said he talked with korte but gave him no information 
about the treasures 
checks of his lists and a call to a grayson county veterans 
group produced joe meadors name said korte the germans 
negotiated in successive weeks with the bank and torigian who 
represents the meador family the foundation said 
but talks stalled on june 16 when word surfaced of a second 
manuscript in switzerland that was offered for 500000 
a dallas judge has barred movement of the artwork

senate republican leader bob dole said sunday 
he does not expect president bush to propose increased income tax 
rates as part of a program of revenue enhancement 
rather the kansas lawmaker said he expects bush to seek to 
raise oil import fees and taxes on alcohol and tobacco 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny said such an approach 
clearly would not boost federal income enough to reduce mountainous 
budget deficits 
moynihan said democrats were ready to precipitate a 100 billion 
forced spending cut next oct 1 as required by the grammrudman 
deficit spending law if bush does not increase income taxes and 
reduce the social security payroll deduction 
new york gov mario cuomo said meanwhile that he believes the 
top tax rate should be raised from its present level of 28 percent 
to reduce the budget deficit 
while the democratic governor and prospective presidential 
contender was not specific he cited 33 percent and 35 percent as 
targets for a new top tax rate 
dole and moynihan commented on the abc television program 
this week with david brinkley cuomo was interviewed on 
nbctvs meet the press 
on the cbstv program face the nation republican political 
pollster linda divall said bushs apparent reversal on the tax 
issue had angered many republicans 
theres been a lot of outrage this week i dont recall a time 
where ive seen more anger within the republican party over how a 
president has led on a very important topic she said at the 
same time i think many people are saying he must know something 
more than we do what comes next 
she said it was apparent that the administration had 
miscalculated potential public reaction to talk of taxes 
i think they underestimated how clearly that no new taxes 
mantra rang throughout the country how much people wanted to 
believe that she said 
dole acknowledged that the presidents new willingness to 
consider tax revenue increases is not popular 
but i think there are enough of us in congress to put a 
package together even though it will be tough to pass he 
said 
moynihan said he believes a fiveyear agreement should be 
reached that includes putting social security back on a 
payasyougo basis and stop using that regressive payroll tax 
moynihan is proposing reducing the social security payroll tax 
while stopping the government from using surplus social security 
revenues to pay for other programs and allegedly to hide the true 
size of the budget deficit 
asked if bush is now committed to tax increases dole replied 
i think the president will not go along with an increase in tax 
rates 
dole said most americans believe a tax hike has occurred when a 
larger bite is taken out of their pay check 
he said he believes the increased tax revenue will come from an 
oil import fee or from sin taxes such as those on tobacco 
products and alcohol 
asked if he believes bush is committed to such tax increases 
dole replied oh hes committed no question about it 
you cant get there that way bob moynihan said 
dole was asked if bush would veto an increase in income tax 
rates at any bracket 
im not saying he would veto it dole said the president 
now in a statesmanlike way has said ok lets take a look at 
revenues now the democrats are coming back and saying oh good 
we got him on revenues now lets take a bigger chunk out of 
defense 
moynihan was asked if democrats will be the first to propose an 
actual specific tax increase 
no he replied 
our proposal is to cut social security and give every working 
family in this country an extra thousand dollars in income he 
said after that we can talk about other issues 
addressing dole directly moynihan appeared to speak for other 
democrats when he said 
you have a right to tell the president this if hes as 
committed as you think hes headed for a crisis hes headed for a 
sequester 100 billion on the first of october and close down 
the national airports 
moynihan was asked if it is not more likely that the 
grammrudman requirements will not merely be loosened and 
liberalized before the oct 1 deadline 
i would have to say to my friend bob dont count on us to 
change the number moynihan said 
he was asked if the democrats were ready to play chicken to 
go right for the cliff 
if you want to call it that yeah moynihan replied

monika pein mailed a letter to a 
friend in the united states sunday describing the incredible pace 
of events in the two germanys and stamped it with a commemorative 
imprint from the post office 
i have just written in the letter that i really cannot grasp 
that we germany will again be together said mrs pein who was 
born near what is now wroclaw poland her husband was born in east 
germany near halle 
we think about this every day i really cannot believe this 
she said i had not thought that in my life im over 50 i 
would live to see this 
chancellor helmut kohl called the economic merger of the two 
germanys that took effect sunday the decisive step on the way to 
the unity of our fatherland a big day in the history of the german 
nation 
but not everyone shared the enthusiasm and the day marking the 
first and most difficult step to unification passed with little 
fanfare in this west german capital 
the post office kept special hours so people could have their 
mail stamped with an oval commemorative imprint noting july 1 as 
the day economic monetary and social union between east germany 
and west germany took effect 
but a postal worker said it was publicized too late to attract 
many people and only about 80 people had stopped by in the first 
few hours 
reaction among west germans to the economic merger with east 
germany and eventual full unification was varied some like mrs 
pein are realizing a dream others say it is happening too fast 
and worry what it could cost still others especially younger 
people feel little kinship with their brothers to the east 
manfred brocker a 43yearold native of bonn who says hes 
documented political changes over the years with stamps collected 
one more for this historic day but had mixed feelings 
basically its good he said of the economic merger and 
upcoming unification but people are only talking about east 
germany and not at all about the west germans nobody knows what it 
will cost us or if it will be good with the currency 
one worries that its happening much too fast he said 
complaining there was too little information from the government 
over what problems might result 
and he was also not sure how alike the germans were after 40 
years of separation 
its a completely different generation he said perhaps 
in 20 years the differences will be blurred he said but not 
so fast 
detlef bloss born in weimar the small east german town that 
was capital of germanys first attempt at representative democracy 
said he was worried a catastrophe in east germany could result 
because of the large numbers of expected unemployed 
experts have predicted that anywhere from 500000 to 4 million 
east germans could lose their jobs as state subsidies fall to a 
market economy onethird of all businesses are not expected to 
survive 
i dont know that its right its all so sudden said 
bloss who fled to west germany in 1978 the mentality is 
different and the two economic systems are different 
the people in east germany are very greedy toward western 
money but they dont know what the future will bring that is the 
problem that is the worry i have
