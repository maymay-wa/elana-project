the army overcharged its personnel for 
temporary lodging and diverted the money to projects like the 
renovation of a vip house and two custom throw rugs costing 3600 
congressional investigators say 
the general accounting office in reviewing the daily fees 
assessed to soldiers staying at special housing during training 
found that from 1985 to 1989 two army commands amassed more than 
70 million from inflated charges assessed against the per diem 
allowance given soldiers 
the gao the investigative arm of congress estimated that the 
amount could rise to more than 100 million after calculating 
figures for the fiscal year that ended sept 30 
some army installations have overcharged soldiers for 
transient lodgings and used the procees to subsidize morale 
welfare and recreation activities officers clubs golf courses 
arts and crafts facilities and lodging for visitors the gao said 
in a report released last week 
the agency blamed the problems on the absence of effective 
controls and inadequate management attention 
in one instance the army used the additional money to fully 
renovate a fourbedroom house that serves as distinguished 
visitors quarters among the costs were about 144000 for 
customized furnishings drapes and carpets including two throw 
rugs that totaled 3600 
the army installation also planned to spend about 272000 for 
special stationery and landscaping but when questioned by the gao 
it lowered its cost projections to 81600 
the gao did not specify at which installation the renovation 
occurred but its study examined domestic facilities 
the agency said the training and doctrine command and forces 
command accumulated the inflated charges the money comes from the 
billions of dollars the army spends each year to train its 
personnel with a portion for the per diem paid to soldiers 
undergoing training 
in another case the gao found that a large office space in 
transient quarters was converted into an exercise room with 
equipment even though a fully equipped gym was across the street 
according to installation officials the exercise room was 
provided to meet commercial hotel standards and to ensure that 
guests were not inconvenienced the gao said 
in a response included in the report the defense department 
said it has taken steps to review and correct the problems 
identified by the gao it said it also is studying current 
transient housing policies 
it should be noted that the identified problems occurred 
during a period of major policy transition in which the department 
adopted practices to operate nonappropriated fund programs and 
facilities in a businesslike manner said christopher jehn 
assistant secretary of defense for force management and personnel 
the gao also found that the army paid for more expensive 
offbase lodgings for personnel when there were vacancies at the 
designated transient quarters during one month at an installation 
the lodging office authorized offbase per diem for 146 personnel 
for a total of 1939 days 
but during the same period 206 reservations were canceled or 
never claimed amounting to 5040 days available to house 
personnel 
the gao recommended that the overcharges be returned either to 
the original appropriations or to the us treasury the pentagon 
which generally agreed with the gaos suggestions did not concur 
on returning the money 
the defense department proposed disbursing the money based on a 
department legal interpretation of the issue 
rep john murtha dpa chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on defense requested the report

without complaint george phelan 
left his family and his law practice to do his military duty as a 
reservist in operation desert shield 
he missed the first birthday of his daughter asia nov 6 he 
celebrated his 40th birthday sept 4 at gas mask school with his 
army buddies at fort devens mass 
his fathers handling mortgage payments and monthly bills 
because phelans japaneseborn wifes english isnt good enough to 
take care of things 
before he left for active duty phelan had two days to find 
another lawyer to handle his pending cases 
he didnt have time to tell all his clients he was leaving so 
he wrote them letters and took out a newspaper ad saying hed be 
away for an indefinite time 
and the switch from civilian to military pay has meant a 
substantial cut in income 
but despite all the disruptions you wont hear any gripes from 
phelan of fall river mass 
when your country calls you to defend it and defend its 
interests i think its a small sacrifice to pay said phelan a 
us army major in the 46th judge advocategenerals detachment in 
saudi arabia the first reserve unit activated in the persian gulf 
crisis 
its my duty to be here youve got to put the inconvenience 
aside and put your mind to your work he said as simplistic 
and naive as it might sound im proud to be over here 
the callup is the first of reservists and national guard in 20 
years and the largest since the 195053 korean war 
more than 34000 citizensoldiers have been called to active 
duty for a minimum of 90 days more will follow under president 
bushs announcement that up to 150000 reinforcements will join the 
230000 american troops confronting saddam hussein following his 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
like phelan the reservists were plucked from the civilian life 
as part of their military obligation 
its something youve got to be willing to do even though it 
might be unexpected and certainly inconvenient from a business and 
personal point of view the softspoken phelan said 
he left the modest ranch home he bought last year to sleep on a 
cot in a tent pieced together with ponchos shelter halves and 
plywood boards 
instead of lawyerly blue suits he wears desert camouflage 
fatigues instead of handling civilian cases he advises military 
commanders on disciplinary matters 
the money parts going to hurt but you can always make the 
money up in the long run phelan said 
he admitted tht the longer im away from the practice the 
more difficult itll be to revive when i get home 
but he stressed the thing that eats at me is not being able 
to enjoy things ill never be able to recapture like my daughters 
first birthday the first teeth walking for the first time saying 
her first words those things you cant get back because they only 
happen one time 
back home phelan had more than 500 clients a year in his 
oneman law practice he also provided legal services to about 500 
elderly people 
hes only had one contact with the attorney now handling his 
cases and it would be impossible to run his affairs while 
soldiering in saudi arabia 
for the most part reservists are putting their hardships aside 
we obviously had to do some juggling said col kevin 
murphy 44 of hanover mass whos also a reservist lawyer 
specializing in financial planning were making sacrifices but 
its something were doing willingly 
for people used to the freedoms of civilian life theyve had to 
adapt to communal showers waiting in line at smelly latrines 
eating military chow and taking what spartanlike recreation they 
can 
the physical discomforts can be overcome what affects them most 
is whats missing in their personal lives 
the biggest battle is within ourselves keeping our minds 
right said staff sgt paul boyd 37 of murfreesboro tenn a 
national guardsman assigned to the 130th rear area operations 
center 
one of the things ive learned here is whats important its 
not a house a boat a car none of the material things mean 
anything its my loved ones that count he said 
i despise the united states army its the most screwed up 
disorganized organization ive even been associated with 
national guard sgt gerald mccormicks wife is expecting their 
first child in december missing the birth is more of a loss than 
the financial consequences of switching from being a financial 
planner to a soldier 
its just lost time you wont ever make up said mccormick 
of nashville tenn 
when he gets home he said ill never complain about living 
conditions again

a fire that destroyed a house tuesday 
apparently started when a 3yearold boy set his pet dog on fire 
with a cigarette lighter fire officials said 
district fire chief paul hemmeter said the boy told a paramedic 
at the scene what happened 
the little boy told her toto was bad toto bit me i set 
fire to totos tail hemmeter said 
the boy his grandmother and two other children were in the 
house when the fire started shortly after midnight all escaped 
without serious injury he said the small longhaired dog was not 
found hemmeter said he believes the pet died in the fire 
hemmeter said the grandmother had fallen asleep on a couch while 
watching television when the boy apparently used a cigarette 
lighter to set the dogs tail on fire 
its possible that the boy simply set fire to the bedclothes 
as he was setting fire to the dog hemmeter said but from the 
amount of fire they had the dog probably ran from place to place 
setting fires 
he said all the evidence supports the boys version of how the 
fire started and no family members contradicted his account

winstonsalem nc ap a woman charged in the 1986 
arsenicpoisoning death of her boyfriend administered repeated 
doses of the poison to her two husbands one of whom died a 
prosecutor charged monday 
in closing arguments the defense said the state had failed to 
prove that blanche taylor moore killed her boyfriend raymond reid 
mrs moore 57 is on trial for firstdegree murder in the death 
of raymond reid 
she also is charged in the death of her first husband james 
taylor in 1973 and with two counts of assault in the near lethal 
arsenic poisoning last year of her nowestranged husband the rev 
dwight moore she will be tried on those charges later 
prosecutors used those poisonings in the fourweek trial in an 
effort to establish a pattern that pointed to mrs moore 
when you combine all the evidence what hits you directly in 
the face forsyth county district attorney warren sparrow asked the 
jury 
there was arsenic in mr taylor repeatedly administered 
sparrow said what about dwight moore the same thing the 
fundamental picture is repeated doses of arsenic 
this is not circumstantial this is direct and powerful 
scientific evidence that points unerringly at the defendant he 
said 
prosecutors have said they will ask for the death penalty if 
mrs moore is convicted 
defense attorney david tamer said the states case was nothing 
more than circumstantial saying that at no point did any witness 
testify about a specific time when mrs moore poisoned reid 
the issue in this case is to identify the person who is 
responsible tamer said that question is the one on which this 
case turns just because they had elevated arsenic levels does not 
identify her as the perpetrator 
mrs moore testified last week that she didnt poison reid and 
lovingly cared for him during his stay in hospital before he died 
i know arsenic was found in these three people but i know 
that i didnt do it she said ive never physically harmed 
other people to physically harm a person no i did not do that 
defense attorneys say the real attacker confessed his crime in a 
letter to mrs moore 
handwriting experts differed over whether the letter could have 
been written by mrs moore or who defense attorneys say penned it 
deceased acquaintance garvin thomas

the military instructor stabbed the dummy 
in the heart with a commando knife and snapped at a group of iraqi 
popular army recruits this is your weapon to kill 
one by one the men dressed in camouflage fatigues lined up and 
stabbed the dummy in what was supposed to be handtohand combat 
training at a suburban baghdad soccer ground 
after iraqs millionmember regular army these men and women 
are saddam husseins second line of defense in the confrontation 
with the usdominated multinational force 
every day the iraqi authorities organize marches through 
baghdad and other cities by popular army recruits among them 
elderly grayhaired men and guntoting women some with heads 
covered by scarves in the islamic tradition 
teenage boys clutch rocketpropelled grenade launchers and 
chant down down bush 
iraqi officials boast that 8 million men and women have 
volunteered for the popular army in a wave of patriotic fervor 
supposedly sparked by saddams aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but western and asian military experts in iraq estimate that the 
forces strength is probably closer to 600000 personnel a 25 
percent increase over its preinvasion numbers 
we train on all weapons but the emphasis is on closecombat 
weapons and handtohand fighting said abdul amin jamil one of 
the instructors 
my sons in the army and im getting trained so that i can 
fight alongside him said 51yearold karim ali holding an ak47 
assault rifle in one hand and patting a dagger hanging from his 
webbing belt 
i may be needed to defend my country said fersan hamid a 
15yearold schoolboy im willing to go to kuwait and fight 
officials claim the volunteers reported to be flocking to join 
the militia include palestinians egyptians syrians sudanese and 
other arabs 
state tv regularly shows zealous recruits chanting undying 
allegiance to saddam and military officials handing out guns to 
young and old to defend the republic 
diplomats question how far the average iraqi is prepared to go 
to defend a government as repressive as saddams still the 
popular army is everywhere guarding banks embassies hotels and 
government buildings 
with the prospect of war looming the militia is reported to 
have been deployed in some numbers across kuwait occupying 
abandoned homes and government buildings 
popular army cadres are trained for two months two hours a 
day five days a week in light weapons antitank weapons and 
antiaircraft guns 
after training each recruit is given a firearm and allowed to 
keep it they are required to report to their bases every week to 
determine if theyre needed for active duty 
the militia was initially formed by saddam in 1970 as the 
paramilitary wing of the ruling baath arab socialist party its 
main function was to act as an ideological counterweight to the 
army to prevent any attempt at a military coup 
led by one of saddams closest associates deputy prime minister 
taha yassin ramadan the wellarmed militia has been responsible 
for guarding the political leadership 
from an original strength of around 3000 the popular army 
swelled to around 450000 including 40000 women during the 
198088 iraniraq war it was deployed at the front and suffered 
heavy casualties some 10000 men were captured 
during the iraniraq war the iraqi regular forces often 
resented having the less experienced militiamen deployed alongside 
them 
western diplomats and western military experts still doubt the 
popular armys fighting abilities but some asian diplomats believe 
that the popular army cadres could put up a fight if necessary

meat researchers have developed a new grade of 
beef with half the fat of the usual cuts that may be quite 
appealing to consumers watching their calories and cholesterol 
supermarkets are starting to carry meat labeled usda select that 
has 40 percent to 55 percent less fat than completely trimmed 
wellmarbled meat graded usda choice said dr larry cundiff a 
genetics expert at the agriculture departments meat and animal 
research center 
usda select beef contains about 40 calories per ounce compared 
with 43 to 50 calories for usda choice beef said cundiff this 
resembles the difference between regular and 2 percent lowfat milk 
in the dairy case 
he said scientists have been working for 20 years to 
characterize breeds of cattle for leanness tenderness juiciness 
and flavor of the meat 
the search for leaner beef led to crossbreeding hereford and 
angus breeds with 24 european breeds known for their leanness 
butchers at two large supermarket chains in the washington dc 
area said that select cuts are not as tasty or tender as choice 
but are less expensive 
chef gus at blackies house of beef restaurant in washington 
said he wouldnt serve select beef 
this is very lean meat a different texture he said you 
have to chew it a very long time 
cundiff and his colleagues whose lab is at clay center neb 
have worked to identify breeds or breed crosses that help improve 
tenderness while reducing fat 
piedmontese cattle are an italian breed with 115 percent more 
lean meat than hereford and angus said cundiff their 
offspring produce lean exceptionally tender meat 
he said about 40 percent of us cattle already have at least 
some of the genetic makeup of the newer european breeds the clay 
center lab keeps about 200 animals of each european breed 
including british continental and south asian cattle for its 
research 
we believe that our research has helped the industry produce 
leaner beef said cundiff 
equals 
washington ap household liquid detergents and cooking oils 
are being recommended by agriculture department researchers as 
lowcost extremely effective killers of garden pests 
this is great stuff for the homeowner said dr thomas 
henneberry a usda insect expert its completely nontoxic and 
simple to mix up its as effective as an insecticide 
he said it may be even more effective than chemicals because 
many pests have developed a resistance to such sprays 
we can mix up a gallon of this home brew for less than 30 
cents said dr george butler one of henneberrys colleagues 
commercial insecticide mixes for the homeowner can cost at least 
1 a gallon and we have a pest spray that is environmentally 
clean 
henneberry and butler said their detergentoil mix has been 
effective against some of the worst insects and mites 
including aphids whiteflies and spider mites 
the scientists say homeowners should mix one tablespoon of 
dishwashing detergent and one cup of oil either peanut 
safflower corn soybean or sunflower 
when ready to use mix one to 2 teaspoons of the prepared 
solution to one cup of water then spray on infested plants using a 
pump sprayer like the one on a bottle of window cleaner 
the researchers have used the mixture successfully on eggplant 
carrots lettuce swiss chard celery watermelon pepper and 
cucumber 
we found the only disadvantage is that squash cauliflower and 
red cabbage are sometimes hurt butler said the oil may burn 
the tender leaves of these plants 
the oils are toxic to insects while the dishwashing detergent 
acts as an emulsifier making the mixture adhere more readily to 
the plant 
the key to control is getting the oildetergent mixture on the 
insects said henneberry usually these common pests seek 
protection from the sun and wind by hiding under plant leaves be 
careful to spray all leaf and stem surfaces with a light coat 
he recommended checking again about one week to 10 days after an 
application

advocates for the elderly are claiming a big 
victory because new budget rules make the 265 billion social 
security system virtually untouchable in future efforts to reduce 
the federal deficit 
the change has critics complaining that it makes little sense to 
exempt the governments single biggest domestic program from future 
attempts to narrow the budget shortfall 
but it is a relief for more than 39 million elderly handicapped 
and other americans who get monthly checks from the program and 
for politicians loath to cut the politically popular pension 
system 
its an important victory said spokesman bill ritz of the 
national committee to preserve social security and medicare which 
lobbies for senior citizens 
in federal budget politics removing one program from possible 
cuts simply means that other areas are exposed to potentially 
deeper reductions as a result some defenders of other programs 
are upset by the favorable treatment for social security 
whether theyre elderly or children if theyre poor theyre 
poor said susan rees executive director of the coalition on 
human needs a washingtonbased group that champions aid for 
lowincome americans of all ages why should one have to 
sacrifice for the other 
as part of their budget deal last month the bush administration 
and congressional leaders agreed to take social security out of the 
calculations used to determine the federal deficit 
proponents said with the pension program running an annual 
surplus of tens of billions of dollars the overall budget gap was 
being shrunk artificially under the old system 
that sounds like a dry accounting change but its not what it 
really means is there is no longer any reason to look to social 
security for budget savings because cutting the program wont make 
the pool of red ink any smaller 
groups working for the elderly had been pressing lawmakers to 
make the change for years they argued that since social security 
pays for itself by payroll tax deductions it has nothing to do 
with the burgeoning federal deficit and thus should not be asked to 
help solve that problem 
whats the rationale for keeping it in there other than 
trying to dodge difficult choices elsewhere in the budget said 
martin corry director of federal affairs for the american 
association of retired persons the nations biggest organization 
for seniors 
social security benefits average 571 a month this year and will 
climb to 602 on jan 1 when a 54 percent inflation adjustment 
takes effect 
those are earned benefits sen daniel p moynihan dny 
chairman of the senate finance social security subcommittee said 
last week thats not the governments money 
in political terms cutting social security has been offlimits 
for years because the elderly have proven they are a voting bloc to 
be reckoned with that lesson was driven home dramatically a few 
years ago 
in 1985 the senates majority republicans agreed with the white 
house to a deficitreduction plan that included a freeze in social 
securitys annual inflation increase the senate adopted the 
proposal 5049 with the deciding vote cast by thenvice president 
george bush 
two months later president reagan backed away from the measure 
after democrats agreed to allow higher defense spending that left 
republican lawmakers in an awkward position they soon paid for 
when the 1986 election was over the gop had lost control of the 
senate and has yet to regain it 
ever since budget writers have been reluctant to even consider 
reining in social security costs 
because of that some activists say the new budget process means 
little 
congress wasnt going to cut social security and taking it 
out of the budget calculations was just one more symbolic way to 
show its politically untouchable said marsha simon legislative 
director for families usa a lobbying organization for the elderly 
the government spent 246 billion on social security in the 
fiscal year that ended sept 30 199 percent of the entire 124 
trillion federal budget the only budget component that was bigger 
was defense at 297 billion 
the nonpartisan congressional budget office which studies 
budget issues for congress projects social security spending to 
grow by about 7 percent a year reaching 265 billion this fiscal 
year and 334 billion by 1995

with the fear of soviet aggression no 
longer serving as glue the uspakistan relationship is 
threatening to come apart under the strain of frictions over 
pakistans nuclear program diplomats say 
congress and the new government of pakistan appear ready to walk 
away from the fourdecadesold relationship that served as a 
cornerstone of us policy in south asia and gave washington an 
important friend in the moslem world 
in october the united states demanded that islamabad reverse 
its nuclear program and froze 573 million of economic and military 
assistance to pakistan part of a sixyear 4billion aid package 
begun in 1987 
after winning elections last month by capitalizing on growing 
resentment of us influence in this moslem country of 110 million 
president ghulam ishaq khan and his rightwing coalition have 
declared they can do without us aid 
we should tighten our belts we should learn to run our hands 
deep into our own pockets instead of stretching them before 
others ishaq khan said in a strident stateoftheunion address 
last week 
no matter how important foreign aid is we shall not compromise 
our independence and our freedom for it we may be poor but we 
highly cherish our national honor and dignity he said 
ishaq khan is expected to meet with vice president dan quayle in 
japan this week to discuss the nuclear issue and american aid but 
analysts and diplomatic sources doubt pakistan will be able to 
adequately reassure washington 
although a few screws may be missing or bolts left to tighten 
the united states is convinced that pakistan has the bomb said 
one diplomatic source insisting he not be identified further 
pakistan is the thirdlargest receipient of us aid behind 
egypt and israel and the benefits are easily recognizable in a 
country relatively free of the daunting poverty that plagues much 
of the subcontinent 
but before assistance is granted president bush must certify to 
congress that pakistan neither possesses nor is building nuclear 
weapons 
for more than a decade the united states found reasons to look 
the other way as evidence mounted that pakistan was moving closer 
to becoming a nuclear power 
that was particularly true at the height of the war in 
neighboring afghanistan determined to keep pakistan away from 
soviet influence and beholden to islamabad for funneling hundreds 
of millions of dollars in arms to the moslem resistance washington 
managed to secure certification 
but in december 1988 diplomatic sources say pakistan was 
warned to hold its nuclear program in check 
early this year their assurances no longer held up said one 
western diplomat also speaking on condition of anonymity 
diplomatic sources say pakistan crossed the nuclear threshhold 
when relations with neighboring india began to deteriorate there 
have been fears in recent months that the two traditionally hostile 
neighbors would go to war for a third time over kashmir the 
disputed mountain territory claimed by both 
india exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and neither country has 
agreed to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty which would 
require them to open their facilities to periodic inspections 
washingtons decision to freeze aid coming on the eve of 
national elections embittered pakistanis and fueled criticism of 
former prime minister benazir bhutto who was overwhelmingly 
defeated in the oct 24 parliamentary vote 
most thought the antiamerican rhetoric would subside after the 
elections but it has persisted 
pakistans strategic importance to the united states has 
diminished with the thaw in the cold war and the winding down of 
the war in afghanistan 
and with greater demands for us assistance among the emerging 
democracies in eastern europe diplomats say the current aid level 
to pakistan cannot be sustained 
but others contend the united states cannot afford to lose a 
friend that served as the frontline state in the fight against 
soviet communism the window to iran following the 1979 revolution 
and an intermediary that helped washington open the door to china 
the united states doesnt have a lot of friends in the moslem 
world said an arab diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity while the soviet threat is gone there are other 
alliances that pakistan could enter that would not be in the us 
best interests washington may yet again discover that a onceloyal 
friend has become one of its worst enemies

secretary of state james a baker iii is 
making a hastily arranged visit to bermuda for talks with canadian 
external affairs minister joe clark on resolving the persian gulf 
crisis 
canada has dispatched more than a dozen jet fighters to the gulf 
in support of the usled multinational effort there and it has 
not ruled out the possibility of sending ground forces 
it was not clear however whether todays talks would touch on 
a possible increase in the canadian military contribution 
the whole purpose of meeting is to get them together so they 
have a chance to discuss facetoface bakers view of the situation 
and our view of the situation said abbe dann clarks 
spokeswoman 
baker met last week with the other four members of the united 
nations security council during his swing through europe and the 
middle east he decided only last saturday that a consultation with 
clark would be useful 
clark was expected to reaffirm canadas view that iraq must 
withdraw from kuwait the same view that baker heard last week in 
his talks with leaders from the soviet union china britain 
france turkey egypt saudi arabia bahrain and the exiled kuwaiti 
regime 
but the majority view among those baker sounded out was that 
more time is needed to give diplomacy a chance to work before the 
military option against iraq is seriously considered 
bush last week ordered 200000 more american troops to the gulf 
to supplement the 230000 already there 
bermuda was chosen as the site for todays meeting because clark 
is en route to europe and the middle east for discussions on the 
gulf situation he was to leave bermuda for london at midday after 
a 90minute discussion with baker at the residence of the us 
consul general 
after a luncheon in bermuda with local officials baker planned 
a midafternoon return to washington to take part in a meeting 
between president bush and italian prime minister giulio andreotti

mayor anthony senecal has his hand out 
to panhandlers hoping a proposed 50ayear licensing fee will 
persuade them to move on 
ive always been appalled that people who come downtown to 
shop are always being asked have you got 25 cents have you got 
50 cents senecal said thats bull it isnt right pretty 
soon theyre going to stop coming downtown to shop 
senecal wants to require panhandlers to buy a 25 license every 
six months violators could get a 500 fine and 10 days in jail 
city council is scheduled to consider the ordinance thursday 
james tobin 63 who says he panhandles some doubted the 
ordinance would do much good 
i panhandle when i go broke he said i guess ill buy a 
license if i have to but it aint right it just aint right 
robert obrien spokesman for the state chapter of the american 
civil liberties union called the proposal preposterous and said 
the group may challenge it 
robert bastress an expert in constitutional law at west 
virginia university said panhandling is a form of commercial 
speech the supreme court has recognized that commercial speech 
is entitled to some protection under the constitution not as much 
as other forms of speech perhaps but some protection he said 
the idea came to the mayor after three men asked him for money 
during the threeblock walk from his tobacco shop to city hall 
we cant afford having people on the street giving people who 
come downtown the bums rush senecal said some of these guys 
get right up in your face if you refuse 
obrien said the ordinance wont solve the problem 
winos are going to take their government check spend 25 on a 
license and then panhandle freely he said but the guy who has 
been living in washington dc and is moving back to ohio and 
runs out of gas and needs to panhandle to get enough money to get 
home is the guy who is going to get arrested 
senecal said the ordinance isnt aimed at the working poor he 
said the salvation armys bellringers and other charities also 
would be exempt 
what im after are the winos who make a good living off 
government checks and beg for money the final two weeks of every 
month after they blow all their government money senecal said 
one supporter of the measure is the rev bill crowe who 
operates union rescue mission in martinsburg a growing town of 
more than 13000 just over an hours drive from washington 
the town has a 2 percent jobless rate but its homeless shelter 
usually is full and 39 of the 52 beds at the mission were occupied 
on a recent night crowe said 
theres no reason for anyone in martinsburg to bum money or 
meals or anything else crowe said we serve meals 24 hours a 
day seven days a week these people are just living off the 
bottle they just drink and drink and drink and then start 
panhandling to get more money 
senecal said he doesnt know if his plan would work in big 
cities like los angeles detroit and new york 
the biggest difference between us and new york city is we know 
all our bums he said

one year after salvadoran soldiers 
slaughtered six jesuit priests a un human rights expert says 
abuses ranging from torture to executions persist in the central 
american nation 
but the report cites a general decline in killings during the 
first eight months of 1990 with the exception of governmentbacked 
death squad activity 
thus far in 1990 government action against humanitarian 
trade union peasants and other organizations has continued said 
jose antonio pastor a university professor from spain who compiled 
the report 
pastor added he continued to receive information about 
harassment of religious organizations and workers by the 
authorities 
the report issued monday blames both the usbacked 
conservative government of president alfredo cristiani and the 
leftist rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front for 
the persistent violence 
but it indicates that both groups have sought to improve the 
human rights situation 
at least 72000 people have been killed have been killed in the 
11yearold civil war 
the government has cut back on summary killings since signing 
the san jose agreement on human rights on july 26 and fmln 
assassinations of suspected collaborators ceased after that date 
the report says 
the report notes 40 politically motivated summary executions of 
civilians by soldiers or other security forces from january to 
august compared with 51 in the same period in 1989 citing figures 
from the archdiocesan legal protection office 
the office however counted 46 assassinations by death squads 
in the period compared with 17 slayings in the same months of 
1989 
the salvadoran governments human rights commission reported 42 
summary killings in the first eight months of 1990 compared with 
68 in the same months of 1989 
the government did not keep figures on death squad activity 
for the fmln the church counted 12 assassinations from january 
to august 1990 compared with 30 during those months in 1989 the 
government counted 49 in the period compared with 173 in the first 
eight months of 1989 
the government has been severely criticized since soldiers 
killed six jesuit priests their cook and her daughter on nov 16 
1989 a day after the beginning of a guerrilla offensive in the 
capital that left 2000 dead 
bringing the soldiers and their commanders to justice makes the 
massacre a test case for the credibility of efforts to bring 
about judicial reform in the country pastor wrote 
there seems to be a lack of cooperation on the part of the 
armed forces which has gone so far as the destruction of important 
evidence said the report referring to the loss of an officers 
notes made the night of the killings 
rightwing elements of the military and government view the 
roman catholic churchs advocacy of human rights and social justice 
as a legal adjunct to the rebel effort 
since the assassination of archbishop oscar arnulfo romero 
during a mass in 1980 death squads and rightists have often 
targeted the clergy 
cases of politically motivated disappearances of individuals 
continue to be reported pastor added he said both death squads 
and the guerrillas were probably responsible for the 
disappearances 
pastor also found torture of prisoners continued with the worst 
treatment given to those from political organizations or unions 
some of the common abuses included long periods of 
interrogation while being blindfolded and without being able to sit 
down or relieve themselves extensive beatings the occasional use 
of a hood which impedes breathing and causes fainting immersion of 
the head in tanks of water electric shocks and threats to 
themselves or their families 
witnesses who did not belong to organizations complained only 
of intense interrogation while blindfolded he added 
pastor also said there have been reports of harassment of 
priests monks and nuns

former junk bond financier michael milken 
once paid 550 million in a single year by drexel burnham lambert 
inc may have received an additional 1 billion during the 1980s 
congressional investigators say 
information from the general accounting office indicates that 
about 30 limited partnerships milken formed with other drexel 
employees paid out as much as 2 billion between 1981 and 1989 a 
house subcommittee staffer said monday confirming earlier 
published reports 
as much as 1 billion of the money went to milken himself said 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
there was no indication how much of that amount was actual 
profit and the amount attributed to milken was only an estimate 
based on larger sums paid out by the partnerships 
milkens sentencing in a massive wall street fraud case is 
expected to be scheduled soon he could be sentenced up to 28 years 
in prison 
one of the nations richest men milkin already has paid a 
record 600 million in penalties he pleaded guilty in april to six 
felonies including conspiracy securities violations and tax fraud 
for his role in the wall street scandals of the 1980s 
the house source also said convicted stock speculator ivan f 
boesky testified behind closed doors in august to the 
investigations subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee about his dealings with milken 
boesky once a leading speculator in the stock of potential 
takeover targets paid 100 million to settle insidertrading 
charges pleaded guilty to one felony and was sentenced to a 
threeyear prison term which he has completed 
drexel settled criminal and civil charges in 1988 by agreeing to 
pay a record 650 million in penalties as well as pleading guilty 
to six felony charges the firm filed for bankruptcy reorganization 
in february 
the house subcommittee has been investigating hundreds of 
milkencreated drexel partnerships for several years but no 
evidence of illegal activity has been presented drexel ended the 
practice shortly after it came to light two years ago 
a spokesman for milken declined comment on the matter 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the investigations panel 
and the full energy and commerce committee wants milken to testify 
after his sentencing about trading accounts owned by the limited 
partnerships he formed with drexel coworkers family members and 
friends 
milken invoked his fifth amendment rights against 
selfincrimination when he was called to testify before the 
subcommittee two years ago 
dingell asked the gao the investigative arm of congress to 
look into the partnerships 
the partnerships bought up large amounts of junk bond issues 
before they were made available to the general public critics say 
the activity drove up the price of those issues at the expense of 
drexel customers but there has been no final determination of the 
activitys legality 
federal prosecutors revealed that drexel paid milken mastermind 
of the firms rise to prominence in the highyield highrisk junk 
bond business a total of 11 billion between 1984 and 1987 
including 550 million the final year that 550 million paycheck 
put him the guinness book of world records 
the gaos information consisted of a list of 30 limited 
partnerships and the total amount each distributed to investors 
during the 1980s but it did not specify individual investors or 
indicate how much of the payouts were profit above the initial 
investment 
the subcommittee source said investigators knew from court 
documents what percentage was held in the partnerships by major 
players in the drexel scandal 
it gives you a pretty good road map in terms of who was 
involved in what the source said

buildups of arteryclogging fatty deposits that 
can cause heart attacks may result when a persons defense system 
turns against the body researchers say 
dr william hollander of boston university said his latest 
research supports the theory he pioneered two decades ago that 
hardening of the arteries is an autoimmune disease in which the 
body mistakenly destroys itself 
the theory has become a hot topic of research in recent years as 
doctors try to identify the forces that cause blood vessels to fill 
up with fatty deposits like rustencrusted pipes 
this process which doctors call atherosclerosis results in a 
heart attack or stroke if a clot accidentally squeezes off the flow 
of blood 
i would say that our findings indicate that immune factors 
play a key role in the formation of the fibrous lesions that are 
the fundamental cause of heart attacks and strokes hollander 
said 
several other research teams around the world also are finding 
signs that antibodies and other proteins of the bodys immune 
system play a role in triggering or speeding up this disease 
i consider that hollander is being vindicated for studies he 
began many years ago said dr robert wissler of the university 
of chicago this all now seems to fit together into a rather 
important accelerating factor in relation to atherosclerosis 
hollander presented his latest evidence monday at the annual 
scientific meeting of the american heart association about 26000 
doctors and other health professionals are in dallas to hear more 
than 3000 scientific presentations 
blood cells ordinarily produce antibodies to fight foreign 
invaders such as bacteria and viruses but hollanders research 
suggests that in atherosclerosis the body produces antibodies that 
seek out one variety of lipoprotein the molecules that transport 
cholesterol through the body 
as a result cholesterol becomes trapped in the blood vessel 
walls contributing to the damaging buildup the arteries are 
further damaged by other chemicals produced in the immune system 
attack 
hollander has studied the process in both people and animals in 
animals his evidence suggests that the autoimmune mistake is at 
play in the deposit of fatty streaks on blood vessel walls this is 
considered to be the earliest stage of atherosclerosis and in 
people occurs during childhood 
in his latest research conducted in people hollander found 
that the antibodies are targeted solely against an abnormal form of 
apolipoprotein b one of the bodys major cholesterolcarrying 
proteins just why some people make a mutant form of this protein 
and whether or not it is passed on through the genes are still not 
known 
however the finding could help explain why some people with 
seemingly healthy levels of cholesterol in their blood get heart 
disease while others escape trouble despite high levels 
the research also raises the prospect of new ways to treat and 
perhaps prevent atherosclerosis hollander said for example that 
drugs that suppress the immune system might be useful against 
artery disease caused largely by an immune system gone awry 
wissler added that researchers may someday also be able to 
perform blood tests routinely to check people for the damaging 
antibodies

sluggish state tax revenues despite large 
rate increases passed by some legislatures suggest that many 
states already are in a recession according to a national survey 
a study by the center for the study of the states in albany 
ny indicates that new england and midatlantic states are 
experiencing the weakest tax revenues in contrast to the far west 
where they are strongest 
in the three months from july through september the average 
increase in state tax revenues was 54 percent compared with the 
same quarter a year ago in half the states the increase was 51 
percent or less which is lower than the rate of inflation the 
study said 
the revenue picture would have been even bleaker without large 
tax rate increases passed in kentucky nebraska new jersey and 
oklahoma excluding those four the average increase was 49 
percent 
such a small increase has important implications about both 
the health of the economy and the state of state finances said 
steven gold the centers director it implies that the economies 
of many states are in recession and that many state budgets are 
afflicted by fiscal stress 
of the three main state taxes the corporate income tax had the 
worst results with a 09 percent average decrease reflecting 
sharply lower profits twentythree of the 42 states with corporate 
income taxes reported decreased revenues from them 
general sales tax revenue was up an average 45 percent and 
personal income taxes were up 56 percent 
the sluggish growth of the sales tax indicates that 
consumption spending is very weak gold said the relatively 
small increase in the personal income tax reflects weakness in the 
growth of wages salaries and other forms of income 
states with the largest revenue increases according to the 
report were nevada kentucky hawaii west virginia nebraska 
oklahoma new jersey texas missouri idaho illinois and south 
carolina 
overall revenue decreases were reported by montana connecticut 
new york massachusetts ohio wyoming and due to an accounting 
change north carolina 
during legislative sessions this year 10 states made tax 
changes expected to increase annual revenue by at least 5 percent 
while seven more raised taxes by 1 percent to 5 percent the study 
said most are already in effect 
the study was based on information from state officials three 
states were not included because information was not reported 
alaska north dakota and wisconsin

the 50 saudi women who took to the 
road last week to protest saudi arabias prohibition on female 
drivers are suffering an unexpected backlash with six being 
suspended from their university jobs 
the six professors were suspended by from the social sciences 
department of the allfemale campus at king saud university in 
riyadh sources said monday 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
atmosphere at the university has been emotionally charged since the 
womens protest last week they said some students tore the 
professors name plates off their office doors and scrawled 
infidel in their place 
there is tide of fundamentalism among the young people one 
said 
there was no official comment on the university protests 
there is no law in saudi arabia against women driving but it 
goes against a strict moslem tradition observed in this country 
that once kept women completely isolated at home 
several women in the the professional community have complained 
that the driving protest could reverse significant strides for 
women made over the past several years 
we feel that we have taken a hundred steps back said one 
professional on condition of anonymity driving would have come 
not tomorrow or the next day but it would have come now it may be 
impossible 
the saudi women said they were welltreated by police during the 
protest police stopped their cars and drove them to the police 
station where in the presence of male relatives they signed 
pledges not to repeat their actions 
a senior saudi official reportedly went to the police station 
and kept away the religious police known as the committee for the 
propagation of virtue and the condemnation of vice 
riyadh in the conservative heartland of the islamic nation has 
a reputation for having the strictist chapters of the muttawa as 
the religious police are known 
the countrys imams or moslem preachers were also instructed to 
tread lightly in their friday sermons some however did call for 
punishment of the infidels claiming the protestors favored 
eschewing the veil 
all 50 women were completely veiled in black cloaks during their 
protest on nov 6 conforming to traditional dress for women in the 
islamic kingdom 
they rode in 15 cars and included businesswoman and housewives 
all went with the consent of male relatives women in saudi 
arabia need male permission to travel to check into hotels and for 
many other actions 
the women said their unprecedented public demonstration had been 
compelled by the persian gulf crisis they said they are afraid 
that if war breaks out they would be left immobile 
thousands of kuwaiti women refugees and american women soldiers 
have driven on the kingdoms roads since the crisis began on aug 
2 
the saudi women who drove in the protest had learned to drive 
outside saudi arabia in their country they must resort to 
chauffeurs

more than two months after armed iraqi 
soliders kicked in their front door and took them prisoner don and 
brenda swanke were confronted by the commander of a military site 
south of baghdad 
youre going to america pack swanke said they were told 
the swankes were leaving the ranks of the hundreds of westerners 
held in iraq as human shields to discourage a feared us 
attack 
they planned to depart germany today for their home in the los 
angeles suburb of westlake village but they say their thoughts 
linger on iraq and kuwait where friends and others remain captive 
we feel guilty because we were set free and they were not 
said mrs swanke who spend 65 days in captivity with her husband 
we want whatever has to be done to get them out he said 
the couple spoke to the associated press a day after they were 
discharged from the us regional air force hospital in wiesbaden 
they underwent two days of physical examinations following their 
release friday 
they both got a clean bill of health despite a combined loss of 
55 pounds 
the couple was among more than 170 western hostages released 
following a visit to iraq by former west german chancellor willy 
brandt 
the swankes said they were fed mostly rice during their 
captivity but were generally treated well 
i took the position that you guys are the enemies and were 
the prisoners and well do what you say there was no use getting 
hardnosed with them and they were very respectful of that 
swanke said 
after iraq invaded kuwait city on aug 2 swanke said the couple 
found out they could still move around the city 
until aug 18 we could sort of roam around he said 
after the iraqis ordered all americans to report to the 
international hotel swanke said the couple tried to keep a low 
profile and remained in their apartment 
on te night of sept 5 about 730 we heard them iraqi 
soldiers kicking doors down at the apartment complex where they 
lived 
in a matter of time they came and they kicked our door down 
about 15 soldiers came in with ak47s assault rifles quite 
polite but rather threatening he said 
they took our passports and told us to throw some things in a 
bag and follow them swanke said they also took his car keys 
the couple were told they were illegally in kuwait and later 
taken to the regency hotel in kuwait city under guard where they 
remained two nights 
a night later they were taken to baghdad by bus along with 14 
or 15 americans and several british 
on the way to baghdad an iraqi driving my car passed the bus 
if you dont know how to take a joke dont be a hostage swanke 
said 
he said they were taken to the mansour amelia hotel and over 
the days other hostages disapperared onebyone out to strategic 
sites 
after about a week the swankes were taken to a strategic site 
in mosul about 240 miles north of baghdad 
he said they were placed in a threestory house where they could 
cook for themselves with supplies provided by the iraqis 
although we only got about a fourth of what we asked for 
later the couple were moved onto what appeared to be a missile 
storage and assembly base in a wing of an administraton building 
office with beds swanke said he said the base was 
wellguarded 
they kept doors locked kept us guarded and ran around with 
guns but i did not see anybody touched or directly threatened 
in any manner he said swanke became ill 
it was the food the stress mrs swanke said they were 
eventually moved to another site south of baghdad were swanke 
spent four days in a hospital 
brenda and i give mr brandt total credit for getting us 
out swanke said 
another american miles hoffman of columbus ga who was shot 
in the arm when he was captured in kuwait on sept 5 was also 
allowed to leave 
hoffman was discharged from the wiesbaden hospital late monday 
air force officials declined to reveal hoffmans plans for

aids activists want researchers to turn their 
attention over the next 18 months to coming up with effective 
treatments for the infections that most often kill people with 
aids 
members of act up the aids coalition to unleash power released 
a detailed research plan at a meeting monday with aids researchers 
saying potential therapies still have not been studied 
this is a realistic plan said garance frankeruta of act 
up its about removing the obstacles to getting science 
done quickly and saving lives 
the coalition complained that research efforts have focused too 
narrowly on deactivating the aids virus and not enough on 
preventing and treating the infections that prey on the weakened 
immune systems of aidsinfected people 
most of what theyre talking about is already in motion 
said dr anthony fauci head of the national institute on allergy 
and infectious diseases whether these infections will be 
conquered in 18 months i cant predict i hope we can 
the plan targets the five infections that kill 90 percent of 
people with aids pneumocystis carinii pneumonia cytomegalovirus 
toxoplasma gondii mycobacterium avium intracellulare and various 
fungal infections 
though drugs have been developed to combat some of those 
infections not all patients can tolerate the treatments and in 
some cases the drugs are too toxic to be used with azt the only 
fdaapproved drug that fights the aids virus directly

a titan 4 the workhorse rocket that 
will let the pentagon reduce its dependence on the space shuttle 
lifted into orbit what was believed to be a satellite capable of 
warning against missile attack 
the 20storiestall titan americas mightiest unmanned rocket 
lit up nasas two shuttle launch pads a few miles away one 
occupied by atlantis the other by columbia as it headed out over 
the atlantic on monday night 
the launch had been delayed two months by problems that included 
leaking propellant 
air force officials refused even to acknowledge the launch prior 
to liftoff and would not disclose the nature of the payload but 
civilian experts said they believed it was a 180 million missile 
warning satellite 
a spacecraft of this type could be used to detect instantly the 
launch of iraqi missiles against sites in the middle east said 
john pike director of the federation of american scientists space 
policy project 
it was the air forces third launch of the titan 4 valued at 
173 million the first one was in 1989 and the second one in 
june neither had a similar leak problem said col frank stirling 
director of the titan program 
martin marietta space launch systems of denver has a 71 
billion contract with the air force to supply 41 titan 4 rockets 
with an option for eight more the air force wants 75 by the end of 
1997 
the air force ordered the rocket in 1985 to lessen its 
dependence on the pace shuttle 
a fleet of titans will allow the air force to launch with more 
consistency stirling said should we ever have a problem or an 
outage with the vehicle we would still be able to recover and 
continue operations he said 
atlantis flight on thursday during which it will put into 
orbit a military satellite is the last classified pentagon shuttle 
mission 
two more defense department shuttle flights are planned both 
next year but they will not be surrounded by secrecy 
nasas shuttle the strongest cargo carrier used in the united 
states is capable of putting a 52000pound payload into orbit 
the titan 4 can lift a 39000pound cargo into low earth orbit 
or carry 10000 pounds to stationary orbit 22300 miles high

the first allwoman team to strike out for 
the south pole hopes to return from the stark polar laboratory with 
valuable data on how women react to extreme cold and monotony 
for us its not just a ski rally we are trying to complete a 
science project soviet expedition member irina gureva said 
monday we strongly believe that women can live in the south pole 
and alongside men can carry out scientific research 
the expedition of three americans one japanese and 12 soviets 
is scheduled to reach antarctica on nov 23 to begin the 70day 
800mile trek on skis from the soviet scientific station at vostok 
to the south pole 
along the way scientists will gather data on the womens 
medical biological and psychological reactions 
the cold and wind will be something to contend with the 
altitude is something were not sure of said julie hyde an 
outward bound instructor in ely minn thats the kind of thing 
that makes me most apprehensive the monotony of the vast whiteness 
is something ive never experienced before 
some scientists have argued that previous cold weather research 
on men should stand for women but the expeditions researhers 
arent convinced 
we dont know that there is a difference but how can you say 
there are no differences unless youve looked asked dolly 
lefever a nursemidwife from alaska who will be studying changes 
in the womens menstrual cycles 
studies by the soviet scientists will be of greater scope a 
team of doctors will test blood and other bodily fluids to 
determine how a womans metabolism is affected by the extreme cold 
and physically demanding conditions 
a psychologist also will monitor how the women handle isolation 
and interact with other team members 
the expedition should hold fewer surprises for some of the 
soviet members who participated in a 198889 antarctic expedition 
after returning to moscow we could not accept external 
disturbances we became more sensitive to outside noises loud 
voices cars gureva said 
such research could give insight into other situations where 
people live in closed isolated quarters for long periods such as 
in space and in submarines 
the expedition allows us to study the human stress factor in 
real circumstances said irina solovyova a soviet psychologist 
and cosmonaut 
besides the scientific goals the women also hope to bring 
attention to next years international antarctica treaty signing 
which will determine if the continent will remain a world park 
we are hoping that antarctica will remain as it is not 
belonging to anyone we hope that mining exploration there can be 
kept at a level that will keep antarctica pristine hyde said 
some of the participants conceded that the length and dangers of 
the journey caused some stress in their families 
gureva said her 10yearold daughter was at first upset by the 
separation but became enthusiastic about the trip after seeing 
stories about it in the soviet press 
i think its useful for a child when their parents can fulfill 
something great in their life i think its a great example for 
them gureva said as for husbands they are not very glad 
but i think their love does not decrease

a newspaper publisher and the protege of a 
former military dictator begin a duel for the presidency today 
after forcing a runoff with a tight firstround race 
it is the second presidential bid for both publisher jorge 
carpio nicolle and jorge serrano elias a bornagain christian and 
onetime adviser to former military ruler jose efrain rios montt 
rios montt was barred from mondays election under the 1986 
constitution which bans former dictators from being president or 
vice president 
carpio 58 said he cried for joy when preliminary returns 
showed him headed for the jan 6 runoff 
we won because of our short intensive campaign serrano 
said 
with 76 percent of the ballots counted late monday carpio had 
253 percent of the vote to 25 percent for serrano 45 who had led 
earlier 
former guatemala city mayor alvaro arzu irigoyen 44 who was 
strongly backed by guatemalas hardline conservative private 
sector had 185 percent and conceded defeat in the late afternoon 
carpio who has been campaigning nearly nonstop for seven years 
was trounced in the runoff with president vinicio cerezo in 1985 
serrano placed a distant third 
the candidate from cerezos christian democratic party alfonso 
cabrera took 163 percent of the vote eight other candidates 
shared the remainder 
cerezo whose government was criticized as corrupt and weak 
offered to help the future president with my experience the 
constitution barred him from seeking reelection 
religion may become an issue in the runoff because carpio is a 
roman catholic while serrano is a member of te usbased shaddai 
church while guatemala remains predominately catholic evangelical 
churchs have attracted many followers 
but the two men said they want to concentrate the debate on 
issues afflicting guatemala which suffers from widespread poverty 
rampant crime and inflation running at about 60 percent a year 
a 30yearold guerrilla war has claimed an estimated 100000 
lives 
serrano who sat on a panel that sought peace talks with leftist 
rebels apparently attracted some of the vote that would have gone 
to rios montt who took power after a 1982 coup and was deposed in 
1983 he presided over some of the worst human rights abuses in 
guatemalas history 
serrano headed rios montts advisory council in 1982 and 1983 
and helped draft electoral laws he later gained a more mainstream 
political identity and was an important member of the national 
reconciliation commission created to work toward implementing the 
1987 central american accords on regional peace and 
democratization 
the winner of the runoff takes office jan 14 which would be 
the first time in guatemalas history that one elected civilian has 
succeeded another 
election day was peaceful but the election season brought an 
outbreak of assassinations disappearances and death threats that 
put guatemala back on the international human rights watch list 
the united states has poured nearly 1 billion in aid into 
guatemala since civilian rule was restored in 1985 
election officials say the turnout appeared to be about 60 
percent of 33 million registered voters 
guatemalans also voted for a vice president 116 members of a 
new congress 20 delegates to a new central american parliament and 
300 mayors

marinade the chicken for up to five days in 
olive oil and herbs or cook the bird in a tiny spa consisting of a 
plastic bag 
voila that bane of banquet dining the rubber chicken 
disappears 
seven of the citys top hotel chefs gathered monday in the 
semiserious best banquet chicken cookoff to drum up business in 
this major convention site and maybe improve the reputation of 
hotel catering whose predictably elastic fare gave rise to the 
term rubber chicken circuit for the campaign trail 
none of these dishes are anything close to what youd call 
rubber chicken sniffed john skaggs top chef at the nikko hotel 
he won the general category award for his sesame seed chicken and 
grilled chicken with white bean relish 
the chefs agreed that the secret to nonrubbery chicken is to 
make sure the bird doesnt lose moisture and isnt cooked too 
quickly or too long 
todd lough an assistant chef at the stanford court hotel 
marinates the chicken for four or five days in olive oil and herbs 
we go out of our way to make it flavorful because a lot of times 
chicken isnt served the way it should be he said 
dave thompson executive banquet chef at the marriott said he 
cooks his spa chicken in a plastic bag to hold in the herbs and 
juices 
thompson whose spa chicken is poached with basil and bell 
pepper and served with oriental noodles admitted having served 
rubber chicken before buy only a few times in the past a long 
time ago 
i wouldnt dare do that now he said 
chicken breast lambada a baked boneless breast stuffed with red 
and yellow peppers and splashed with a wine glaze was the fairmont 
hotel entry served with polenta and artichoke hearts it won in 
the most nutritious category 
presentation is very important said vincenzo cucco an 
assistant chef at the fairmont as he diced chicken and chopped 
peppers 
poultry has been on banquet tables particularly at political 
gatherings since at least the early days of the republic george 
and martha washington served chicken at a mount vernon reception 
for lafayette nowadays chicken is served at an estimated 65 
percent of banquet meals 
oh i have some bad rubber chicken stories said food writer 
camille bounds one of the events judges i went to china and 
they dont waste anything there chicken feet were in my soup 
theres nothing wrong with serving chicken as long as its the 
best chicken said w andrews kirmse vice president and general 
manager of the nikko hotel after this hopefully rubber chicken 
will never be the same

rivals stars powerful friends and even former 
employees who left under less than happy circumstances paid final 
tribute to cbs founder william s paley 
he was a master builder and cbs was his monument said frank 
stanton a former cbs vice chairman who was with paley and cbs in 
the glory days of radio then television before he was forced to 
retire in 1973 
about 2500 people attended memorial services at temple emanuel 
on monday for paley who built a string of radio stations into a 
broadcast empire he died oct 25 at age 89 
guests included former president nixon and carl bernstein whose 
watergate reporting helped lead to nixons resignation they and 
others heard paley hailed by former cbs anchorman walter cronkite 
and henry kissinger once on opposite sides of the fence both are 
now cbs board members 
kissinger nixons secretary of state called paley larger 
than life a man of many paradoxes he and cronkite each recalled 
paleys efforts to protect the independence of cbs news 
for as long as he knew paley the cbs chairman was impervious 
to many appeals to intervene with cbs news kissinger said 
bill took the position that the cbs team was beyond his reach 
because it was different the best and most dedicated group of 
journalists that had ever been assembled 
paley like rival network executives came under pressure from 
nixon aides over coverage of watergate and the vietnam war 
perhaps he did bend a little cronkite said without 
elaborating he said he didnt know all that went on at cbs 
headquarters when there was pressure from government figures or 
other sources what i do know is that the integrity of cbs news 
prevailed and i know that it happened on bill paleys watch 
cronkite said paley had for more than 50 years held 
steadfast to a conviction that only a strong news organization 
with a reputation for fairness and impartiality could withstand 
the inevitable charges of bias and prejudice and the inevitable 
attempts to corrupt 
you bet he was interested in the bottom line cronkite said 
but he never failed to give to the news managers that which they 
said they needed to set the standard for which cbs news was known 
the world over 
the memorial came the same day cbs news said it was making a 
small number of job cuts one report put them at between 30 
and 40 because of lean economic times and the costs of covering 
the persian gulf crisis the biggest layoffs in recent history at 
cbs news more than 200 were made in 1987 
other notables at the memorial included former cbs correspondent 
daniel schorr abcs barbara walters cbs dan rather nbc 
commentator john chancellor designer oscar de la renta novelist 
kurt vonnegut and mash star alan alda 
two former federal communications commission members also 
attended richard wiley and newton minow the latter now is a cbs 
board member 
cbs president laurence a tisch was there as was his 
predecessor thomas wyman ousted in a 1986 management shakeup 
wyman will receive a 40000 annual pension from cbs until he dies 
even the ushers were a whos who of the broadcast industry 
they included cbs broadcast group president howard stringer 
capital citiesabc chairman thomas s murphy and cbs entertainment 
president jeff sagansky

a un official has dismissed assertions 
by the united states that it has been bypassed in the process to 
fill the world bodys top post for refugee programs and policies 
spokeswoman nadia younes said the united nations leadership 
categorically denied that the us mission was not consulted on 
the nomination of indias virendra dayal to become high 
commissioner for refugees 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar favors promoting 
dayal his chief of staff but a bush administration official 
complained that the choice was not discussed with washington 
representatives from some western nations which pay the bulk 
of the agencys 550 million annual budget are seeking to have to 
have their nominees considered saying the job has traditionally 
gone to a westerner 
un sources said perez de cuellar would probably formally 
announce dayal to the general assembly as his nominee even if the 
europeans and other western nations oppose the choice 
a un statement said perez de cuellar is disturbed by 
allegations of cronyism and the insinuation that he has not been 
consulting member states and described dayal as eminently 
qualified 
dayal was a senior official in the refugee agency from 1965 to 
1979 
but the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
he was outraged at the moves to fill the post 
the united states and other nations plan to find a mutual 
western candidate to present to perez de cuellar said the 
official canada britain france austria norway and new zealand 
have all submitted nominees 
the office of the commissioner which is responsible for 
protecting 15 million refugees has lost two commissioners in less 
than a year 
last week the secretarygenerals office announced that dayal 
was the only candidate being considered by the un chief to 
replace thorvald stoltenberg who resigned two weeks ago to become 
deputy prime minister of norway 
stoltenberg served as high commissioner for only 11 months of 
his threeyear term he had replaced jeanpierre hocke of 
switzerland who resigned in october 1989 amid allegations of 
misuse of funds 
the secretarygeneral nominates the commissioner and the 
general assembly votes on the selection perez de cuellar conferred 
last week with the heads of the regional groups in the general 
assembly and is awaiting their reaction 
the western countries would be reluctant to vote against a 
candidate from india one of the major developing countries said 
un sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
perez de cuellar is traveling in japan and europe and will not 
return to new york until about nov 20 
no final nomination or decision is expected before then

saddam husseins closest aide flew to the 
moroccan capital of rabat today to discuss moroccos call for an 
emergency arab summit conference to discuss a possible settlement 
to the persian gulf crisis 
first deputy prime minister taha yassin ramadan said before his 
departure that he was carrying a letter from saddam to the moroccan 
leader king hassan ii the official iraqi news agency reported 
morocco has contributed 1700 troops to the usled 
multinational force that has massed in the saudi desert as part of 
international efforts to force iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
at the same time morocco has maintained contact with the iraqi 
leadership in an effort to find a settlement that would spare the 
region a destructive war 
the iraqi news agency quoted ramadan as saying the letter to 
hassan deals with the dangers facing the arabs as a result of the 
great conspiracy which led to the intervention of american ground 
naval and air forces 
in response to a question about the summit call ramadan said 
baghdad supports any serious arab effort on any level that will 
serve the interests of the arab nation but not a gathering for 
endorsing conspiracies like the cairo summit on which the agent 
egyptian president hosni mubarak and the traitor saudi king 
fahd imposed their decisions 
that was a reference to the summit held in the egyptian capital 
just days after the aug 2 iraqi seizure of kuwait 
at that gathering mubarak and fahd pushed for resolutions that 
supported the deployment of us and allied arab forces in saudi 
arabia 
ramadan said arab summits should not be forums at which the 
american pentagons policies are translated into arabic 
he repeated the three conditions iraq has set for attending such 
a meeting 
that iraq is consulted in advance on the agenda 
that the timing and location are chosen so that saddam will be 
able to attend 
that the agenda include not only the persian gulf crisis but 
all middle east issues including the palestine question

us armed forces will have expanded use of 
military bases in singapore under an agreement signed today after 
two years of negotiations 
the new arrangement comes as us and philippine officials 
negotiate the future of six american bases that have long been the 
pentagons anchor in southeast asia the bases leases expire next 
year 
the agreement will permit the enhanced use of facilities for 
american ships and aircraft and will facilitate a robust us 
presence in the pacific vice president dan quayle said at the 
signing ceremony in tokyo 
the accord was also signed by singapores prime minister lee 
kuan yew who leaves office next month 
quayle and lee were in tokyo for the enthronement of emperor 
akihito 
under the pact the air force will be permitted to send aircraft 
to singapore several times each year on training deployments of 
several weeks each a us embassy statement said 
more us navy vessels will also visit the tiny islandnation 
about 1450 miles southwest of the philippine capital of manila 
about 95 navy and air force personnel will be assigned to 
singapore yearround and about 75 air force personnel will rotate 
through singapore on each training deployment the statement said 
the statement said the increase will start in the next three to 
six months at paya lebar airport and the port at sembawang 
i think the agreement shows the determination of the united 
states to retain a presence in asia as a key to economic and 
political stability in this region said a us official 
speaking on condition of anonymity at a briefing 
he said improvements singapore agreed to make to the port would 
be minor this is not the creation of a new base 
the official stressed that the agreement is not intended to 
substitute for the continued use of the philippine bases which are 
among the united states oldest and largest on foreign soil 
some philippine officials have demanded complete withdrawal of 
us military presence 
lee said negotiations for expanded use of singapores bases 
began after a meeting with sen richard lugar rind two years 
ago 
i told him that we could do it if it would make it easier 
for the philippines if it were seen that we would share the 
defense burden 
in singapore the ministry of foreign affairs said the two 
governments believe the agreement represents a contribution to 
continuing stability in a region which has been able to achieve 
very high economic growth for many years 
paya lebar formerly the countrys international airport was 
converted to military use in 1981 the sembawang area was a 
dockyard in british colonial days 
us navy ships have visited singapore for more than 25 years 
for maintenance supplies and crew shore leave

the move follows reports bibi would be shunted aside for his 
handling of the temple mount situation the englishlanguage 
jerusalem post said bibi had turned down an offer to be 
secondincommand in tel aviv and threatened to quit the force 
before he was given the post at national headquarters 
a government investigation into the temple mount killings 
concluded earlier this month that police were justified in firing 
live ammunition 
but it criticized police commanders including bibi for failing 
to anticipate trouble and for not being on the mount when rioting 
broke out 
the army said in a statement that levy of the jewish settlement 
of givon in the west bank was killed by a man in civilian clothes 
who opened fire with a pistol it said the attacker was captured 
and was being interrogated 
army spokesman brig gen nachman shai told army radio that the 
attacker was a 17yearold jordanian he said the man was sent by 
the moslem fundamentalist islamic jihad movement and the plos 
fatah faction 
israel radio said it was the seventh infiltration from jordan 
this year 
on thursday an israeli army captain and a jordanian guerrilla 
were killed in a firefight after five jordanians infiltrated into 
the same area four of the infiltrators were said to be jordanian 
police 
army officers said they believed the five infiltrators planned 
an attack in jerusalem to avenge the temple mount incident 
on monday the army said three jordanian teenagers armed with 
knives were captured three weeks ago after they infiltrated into 
israelioccupied territory news reports said they also planned a 
revenge attack for the temple mount killings 
the army did not say why the incident was not disclosed earlier 
the attack in jerusalems old city occurred near an apartment 
owned by israels housing minister ariel sharon the minister was 
not believed to be home at the time police said 
one of the policemen was stabbed in the neck the other suffered 
a hand wound when he grappled with the assailant border police 
commander yossi tovias said 
the policemen were not wearing flak jackets which have been 
issued to many police as protection from the current wave of 
stabbing attacks because they were inspecting police posts tovias 
said 
tovias identified the attacker as a local a phrase usually 
used to describe a palestinian 
israel radio said the attacker was believed to be an arab in his 
early 20s it quoted police as saying he was dressed in white and 
wielded a newly purchased kitchen knife 
police spokesman aharon elhayani said dozens of palestinians 
were detained for questioning 
police closed the gates to the old city but later reopened 
them witnesses said they also ordered arabs street venders to 
leave the area 
on saturday a policeman was stabbed in the back by an arab 
youth on a street near the old city he later underwent surgery for 
repair of damage to his heart and a major artery 
last thursday an arab youth was wounded after he tried to grab 
a rifle from an israeli trooper

referendum supporters of a paid king holiday havenever had 
support from twothirds of the legislature before 
of the 90 state lawmakers 23 are lame ducks seven of whom

president boris yeltsin of the russian republic 
said today that mikhail s gorbachev has agreed to divide authority 
between their rival governments a major step toward ending the 
nationwide paralysis of power 
the agreement appeared to mark a major concession by tahe soviet 
president who has not yet commented publicly on his fivehour 
meeting sunday with yeltsin his political archrival 
russia has chosen its path and is on its way yeltsin told 
russias parliament today in the most detailed account yet of 
sundays session 
the two men have appointed commissions that are discussing how 
the two governments should divide such fundamental responsibilities 
as foreign affairs national security taxation banking and 
currency yeltsin said 
the commissions decisions would redefine the very basis of 
power in the soviet union the vast russian republic is home to 
half the soviet unions 287 million people and comprises twothirds 
of its territory 
yeltsin said he had proposed to gorbachev a new system of 
state power the formation of a coalition government of national 
unity in which the candidates for several posts would be proposed 
by the russian parliament 
the russian president was greeted with laughter and applause in 
the chamber when he added that he did not ask for many posts 
just three prime minister defense and finances jobs which form 
the crux of soviet power 
the nation has undergone a crisis of authority since a 
declaration of sovereignty last june by the russian republic which 
has the lions share of the nations natural resources and wealth 
the result has been a series of conflicting laws and decrees 
issued by yeltsin and gorbachev and the national and russian 
parliaments that have virtually paralyzed commerce across the 
country worsening the already dire shortages of food and other 
consumer goods 
we are starting the process that should have started after we 
passed our declaration of russian sovereignty in june yeltsin 
said 
he said he told the soviet president that the crisis was caused 
because you are conducting a policy of diktat from the center 
in violation of the old soviet constitution and violation of recent 
agreements between the two men 
you did not officially recognize the division of functions 
between the center and russia yeltsin said 
the same happened with the economic program that is 
everything is coming from the center with gorbachev unwilling to 
share power with the national and russian parliaments yeltsin told 
the lawmakers 
late in the summer the two men agreed to work together to 
implement a program to transform the soviet union from a centrally 
planned to a market economy within 500 days 
but gorbachev balked under pressure from conservatives and 
persuaded the national legislature to grant him sweeping powers to 
implement a far more modest reform program 
his program skirts such crucial issues as whether to break up 
collective farms and gorbachev has called for a national 
referendum to decide whether to allow private ownership of land 
since nov 1 yeltsin and his government have gone ahead with 
their own more radical 500day program although they have been 
stymied because the republic does not have clear control of prices 
currency interest rates land and real estate 
yeltsin said he and gorbachev agreed that the commissions would 
work in parallel with negotiations on a new union treaty which 
gorbachev is pushing to replace a 1924 document that formed 
republics into the soviet union 
all but one of the current 15 soviet republics has declared some 
form of independence or sovereignty and gorbachev has been 
increasingly powerless to enforce his will on the country 
yeltsin said that in the meeting gorbachev insisted on 
rushing quickly through completion of a union treaty and that 
russia should play a great consolidating role in the process of 
signing a new union treaty 
but yeltsin said he insisted that gorbachev respect the 
sovereignty of the russian republic and sign such a treaty only 
after the central government and republics had carefully defined 
their powers

fouryear term said monday he will not try to follow his parents 
into the governors office

how it affects people closest to you

devote more time to his hobby of writing and would consider 
returning to academic life 
the basic reason and the major reason is i have seen how it 
can affect your family he said most people in political life 
tend to focus on politics and it takes you away from your family 
and those closest to you 
his father fourterm gov george c wallace survived an 
assassins bullet in 1972 but was left paralyzed and confined to a 
wheelchair his mother the late lurleen wallace also was 
governor 
there had been speculation that wallace would seek the 
governorship in four years 
wallace said he had not discussed his decision with his 
71yearold father and did not know how he would react 
its a decision i reached inside myself he said 
wallaces father indicated after his third term as governor that 
he was probably through with politics but after four years out of 
the spotlight he returned and won a fourth term in 1982

the defense minister has confirmed that france was 
involved in a secret cold war project to prepare underground 
resistance in the event of a soviet takeover of western europe 
a paris newspaper liberation reported today that the french 
network was formally dissolved only after recent disclosures of a 
similar operation in italy created a political controversy 
however the paper said the french network had been in a state of 
clinical death for many years 
the defense minister jeanpierre chevenement said on monday 
that the network was established in the early 1950s to plan for 
liaisons between a governmentinexile and an underground 
resistance in the event that france was occupied by east bloc 
forces 
he said the network was dissolved on presidential orders but 
declined to specify when the order was issued for most of its 
existence the network was dormant chevenement said 
officials in italy belgium and greece have confirmed the 
existence of similar networks in their countries they reportedly 
were coordinated by the north atlantic treaty organization and 
funded at least in part by the us central intelligence agency 
liberation said the overall network was known as the allied 
coordination committee the paper said france engaged in liaisons 
with the other participating countries but did not go so far as to 
organize secret arms caches 
under the french plan several dozen people not known to each 
other were recruited by the intelligence service to serve as 
liaisons between local authorities and exiled leaders in the event 
of a takeover

the countdown toward thursdays 
liftoff of atlantis with a spy satellite proceeded smoothly despite 
mounting concerns over launch day weather nasa said today 
the fivemember allmilitary crew was due to arrive at kennedy 
space center this afternoon from johnson space center in houston 
atlantis blasts off sometime between 630 pm and 1030 pm 
est in nasas fifth night launch of a shuttle because the pentagon 
flight is secret the exact time will not be announced until nine 
minutes before liftoff 
the mission is expected to last about four days during which 
the crew will deploy a satellite that reportedly will spy on iraq 
nasa spokesman george diller said today the countdown which 
began sunday night was proceeding without trouble 
everything is great not a hitch he said 
but air force meteorologists today were forecasting only a 30 
percent chance of good weather at launch time down 10 percent 
from mondays predictions the main concern is cross winds at the 
launch site diller said 
better weather conditions were expected on friday and saturday 
the mission originally was scheduled for july but was delayed 
like shuttle columbias flight by dangerous hydrogen leaks the 
shuttles were pronounced safe to fly after fueling tests last

a supreme court justice 
appointed to investigate unsolved killings of antiapartheid 
activists said today he found no evidence the police or army 
operated death squads 
government opponents who have long blamed the security forces 
for the deaths of dozens of activists were certain to protest the 
finding 
in another development police said today that seven blacks were 
shot and stabbed to death in the troubled black townships outside 
johannesburg an eighth death was reported in wenbezi northwest of 
durban 
the finding on the death squads came from supreme court justice 
louis harms the sole member of a governmentappointed commission 
he described as unreliable three former policemen who said they 
carried out more than 10 killings as part of authorized death 
squads 
harms said killings described by the former policemen 
undoubtedly took place but that it would be very difficult 
in the extreme to prove the veracity of the allegations in criminal 
proceedings 
police and the military have denied the existence of death 
squads they said any criminal acts carried out against the 
antiapartheid camp were undertaken by individuals acting on their 
own 
harms said there was a probability that police committed violent 
crimes against members of black opposition groups such as the 
african national congress which was legalized in february after 
being outlawed for 30 years 
but he added there was no evidence that a particular policeman 
committed a particular crime of violence for a particular 
purpose 
another government commission that investigated the allegations 
last year and released its findings saturday reached the same 
conclusion 
harms also said a covert military group the civil cooperation 
bureau had contaminated the whole security arm of the state 
and there was reason to suspect it was involved in more crimes of 
violence than the evidence shows 
among the few operations the bureau admitted carrying out was 
hanging a baboon fetus on the door of a home belonging to anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu 
harms heard testimony from dozens of witnesses from march 
through august as he examined more than 60 unsolved killings of 
antiapartheid activists he said two 1986 slayings should be 
investigated further by prosecutors but did not make such a 
recommendation in any of the other killings 
former policeman almond nofomela caused the inquiries into the 
alleged death squads oct 19 1989 the day before he was scheduled 
to be executed for a killing with no apparent political overtones 
nofomela said he and two former colleagues took part in many 
killings and kidnappings authorized by superiors the other two 
fled the country then said they had joined in the killings 
described by nofomela who remains on death row

in the township violence the worst fighting was in katlehong 
southeast of johannesburg where police discovered five bodies this 
morning with bullet and knife wounds 
a police spokeswoman lt ida van zweel said the battles were 
between rival zulu and xhosa residents of a squatter camp who have 
been fighting since sunday she said the bloodshed began after one 
group demanded the other take part in a rent boycott 
authorities also found a body in evaton and another in 
vosloorus both south of johannesburg 
meanwhile police denied that they deliberately targeted winnie 
mandela wife of anc leader nelson mandela when they fired tear 
gas on blacks in atteridgeville township outside pretoria on 
monday 
a police spokesman maj reg crewe said tear gas was used to 
disperse a stonethrowing crowd in the township where police and 
residents have clashed several times in recent days 
mrs mandela who was visiting residents to show support said 
it is clear the attack was deliberately directed at me and my 
delegation 
in another development a white extremist testified he stabbed

the three main moslem and leftist 
militias announced today they have completed their withdrawal from 
beirut ahead of a government deadline to remove the forces from the 
capital 
in the christian heartland the lebanese army began closing down 
militia centers estabished by syrianbacked groups a condition set 
by the main christian militia for pulling out of beirut 
president elias hrawi seeking to reestablish central authority 
and end lebanons 15yearold civil war has ordered all militias 
out of the beirut area by nov 19 the militias are responsible for 
most of the 150000 deaths in the civil war 
the proiranian hezbollah or party of god said it has 
withdrawn its fighters and weapons from the southern slums of the 
capital where moslem militants once held most of the 13 westerners 
missing in lebanon 
hezbollahs rival shiite moslem group amal and the leftist 
druse progressive socialist party made similar announcements 
we have completed implementation of the part concerning us of 
the greater beirut plan said a hezbollah spokesman who asked 
not to be named 
beirut newspapers have reported that the hostages were moved out 
of the capital to east lebanon in early october when it became 
apparent that hrawis government was serious in ridding beirut of 
the militias 
the 13 hostages include six americans the longestheld is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
who was kidnapped on march 16 1985 
most of the hostages are held by underground factions linked to 
hezbollah although the group denies any involvement 
druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist party said 
in a statement that it has pulled out of the southeastern suburbs 
to the chouf mountains southeast of the capital while nabih 
berris amal withdrew to south and east lebanon 
the government said its army would begin housetohouse searches 
on nov 20 to make sure there are no militia elements remain in the 
capital area 
hrawis government took control after a syrianled assault on 
oct 13 crushed an 11month rebellion by gen michel aoun 
aoun had opposed an arab league plan to end the civil war 
saying there was no guarantee that syria which had 40000 troops 
in lebanon under a 1976 arab league mandate would leave 
the peace pact includes political reforms that redistribute 
power equally between christians and moslems aoun and hrawi are 
christians 
christians had maintained the upper hand in government since 
independence from france in 1943

demands that president bush do a better job 
convincing the american people of the need for a persian gulf war 
escalated today when the republican former chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee urged the president to clarify us 
aims in the region 
i think the president must lay out now to the nation and the 
congress specifically what our aims are said sen richard lugar 
of indiana 
in an appearance on nbcs today show lugar also urged bush 
to call a special session of congress to debate the issues involved 
in the us confrontation with iraq and vote affirmatively i 
would prsume so that we have authorization for what is 
required 
sen bob kerrey dneb who has criticized the administrations 
policy in the persian gulf said on abcs good morning america 
that as representatives of the people we should be engaged in the 
debate about the purpose of this involvement and perhaps some 
suggested alternatives 
i dont think weve done a very good job in the administration 
of explaining to the american people in depth what this is all 
about said lance tarrance a republican pollster based in texas 
we learned from vietnam that americans have to be convinced 
and sold on a rationale for our involvement said neil newhouse 
a pollster with the republican firm headed by richard wirthlin 
war worries swept washington the past week after bush announced 
a substantial increase in the us military presence in the persian 
gulf the announcement also triggered speculation on the impact 
that hostilities would have on the 1992 presidential election 
public support for bushs handling of the gulf crisis has fallen 
from 82 percent in late august to 51 percent this week according 
to a poll published today by usa today 
the telphone poll monday of 615 adults also showed that only 51 
percent approved of bushs decision last week to send 200000 more 
us troops to the region while 38 percent said they disapproved 
the newspaper said 
the poll by gordon s black had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 4 percent meaning that if every adult in the country were 
surveyed the results would not differ more than 4 percentage 
points either way 
during the final days of this years campaign bush stepped up 
his attacks on iraqi president saddam hussein and was widely 
credited by politicians with shifting the focus of the debate from 
domestic issues that were hurting republican candidates 
would a war guarantee bushs reelection most analysts said 
hostilities contained more political dangers than benefits for him 
dont overestimate the patience of the american people and 
dont underestimate the expectations said newhouse he added 
that most americans expect a war with iraq would be won as quickly 
as the actions against grenada and panama which ended within days 
i think thats going to be the wild card in this next 
presidential election said john white a former democratic party 
chairman if we have a war if there are high casualties it will 
be a referendum on george bush 
white predicted that in the event of war the democrats would 
have to nominate for president in 1992 someone who warned or 
tried to prevent this thing from happening 
democrats who fit that description are beginning to emerge 
among them sen sam nunn of georgia chairman of the senate armed 
services committee 
nunn said sunday that the last thing we need is to have a war 
over there a bloody war and have american boys being sent and 
brought back in body bags and yet not have the american people 
behind them 
nunn frequently is mentioned as a likely contender for the 1992 
democratic presidential nomination 
we can say heres what we think will happen or heres how the 
american people will react said democratic pollster peter hart 
nobody can know you dont know how you would react i dont know 
how i would react 
the one area on which all analysts agreed was the need for the 
president to explain more compellingly the need for americans to 
fight and die in the middle east 
conservative david keene said the impact of a war on the 1992 
elections would depend on how the war goes and how well the 
president is able to articulate his reasons for taking that step i 
think the public will support a winning military effort if it isnt 
too costly or too long if they understand the reasons for it 
the problem at this point is that weve gotten ourselves 
bogged down over there for a long period of time with the president 
issuing conflicting reasons and rationales for our being there 
keene said sometimes its to deter aggression sometimes its 
energy sometimes its democratic values 
tarrance said the politics are too complex and americans are 
too used to these complexities to buy simple naked aggression as 
the only cause 
the texas pollster suggested that bush must explain that iraqi 
control of a substantial portion of the worlds oil would bring 
western civilization to its knees and somebody better start 
describing what that means 
people look toward the president today as an explainer of 
events he said

a leading radical lawmaker in iran was 
quoted today as saying british hostages held in lebanon will be 
freed within a few days 
ali akbar mohtashemi a former interior minister who reportedly 
has close links to fundamentalists in lebanon said the releases 
will come over his objections he acknowledged that proiranian 
militants holding the hostages were under increasing pressure by 
unspecified lebanese moslem groups 
i can only express my regret the parliamentarian told the 
iranian newspaper abrar in response to a question about the four 
british hostages 
we see that the british hostges are due to be released within 
the next few days due to the pressures on lebanese moslem groups 
friends and relatives of the british hostages reacted 
cautiously 
it looks like a very good piece of news but unfortunately we 
have heard many comments like it before though not as far as i 
know from mr mohtashemi said catherine comerford a member of 
a support group for hostage john mccarthy 
my reaction is understandably cautious after all that we have 
heard before said david waite brother of anglican envoy terry 
waite who disappeared in beirut in 1987 
the other british hostages are writer alec collett and former 
pilot jack mann 
the british foreign office said it did not have any information 
to substantiate the mohtashemi report 
knowledgeable sources in the middle east who follow the hostage 
issue closely said there was nothing to indicate a hostage release 
was imminent 
the sources insisting that they not be identified further said 
mohtashemis remarks may be aimed at increasing pressure on iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani to seek word on iranians missing in 
lebanon 
mohtashemi did not further specify where the pressures to free 
the four britons were coming from but in the course of the 
interview he complained about a syrianbacked plan to pacify 
lebanon and disband militias there 
pressures to free the hostages could also be coming from 
mohtashemis iranian rivals led by rafsanjani who reportedly are 
seeking to end the ordeal of hostages in lebanon to improve his 
countrys relations with the west 
mohtashemi did not comment on the fate of the nine other western 
captives in lebanon including six americans 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 in beirut 
mohtashemi said five iranians have been held by christian 
militiamen in lebanon since 1982 it was the first time that an 
iranian official has spoken of five iranians 
earlier rafsanjanis government had offered to help free 
western captives in return for information about four iranians who 
were kidnapped in 1982 by christian militiamen in north lebanon 
mohtashemi identified the fifth as an alim or a moslem scholar 
he only provided his second name as tavassoli and said he 
disappeared during israels 1982 invasion of lebanon 
lebanese sources say the iranians are dead but iranian 
officials have said in the past that they have information four are 
alive 
most of the western captives in lebanon are believed held by 
proiranian extremists operating under the hezbollah shiite moslem 
group 
there had been speculation at least one british hostage would be 
freed after the resumption of londontehran relations last month 
but these hopes dimmed after a syrian government newspaper 
tishrin wrote that no hostage will be freed from lebanon until 
london restores ties with damascus their relations were broken in 
1986

right after the fraternity party the 
young woman could remember it all so clearly a pledge had raped 
her as several others watched she told police 
a week and a half later her memory failed but by then one 
youth who had been at the party was dying an apparent suicide and 
another had been held without bail for a week in prison accused of 
a rape he denies committing 
the 18yearold woman who accused the student now says she was 
drunk and testified in court that she no longer remembers 
everything that happened she has not been identified by the media 
because of the nature of the case 
its just a big mess said sandra wall 21 who writes for 
the university of rhode island newspaper i want to hold somebody 
responsible but its a tragedy there really is no answer and 
there is nobody to blame 
michael lindell 20 never a suspect in the alleged rape oct 27 
at the tau kappa epsilon house at the university of rhode island 
died wednesday at a hospital after shooting himself in the head at 
the house he shared with john j birchall who owned the house 
hours earlier dave lallemand 19 who was charged with the rape 
but maintained his innocence was freed when his accuser said she 
had forgotten the details 
pawtucket police monday disclosed that a note was found at 
lindells home 
it was a very vague note and i would not necessarily term it a 
suicide note said detective lt thomas harris he wouldnt 
elaborate 
harris said lindell a former uri student who knew members of 
the fraternity knew state police wanted to question him about what 
he saw at the party 
investigators havent said whether they were linking his death 
to the alleged rape state police lt brian andrews said detectives 
have concluded their investigation and will present the evidence to 
a grand jury 
neither lallemand nor his accuser could be reached for comment 
monday there was no answer at the womans dorm room lallemand was 
not at his parents home in westford mass where he abruptly 
returned on sunday 
no one knows what hes going through said michael p brady 
21 tau kappa epsilon president 
we really dont know what happened said brady of albany 
ny were not saying nothing happened we cant really fit 
things together 
the woman an 18yearold freshman told police she was raped in 
an upstairs bedroom at tke in south kingston by a man she met that 
evening 
police interviewed her three times within hours of the incident 
she said her attacker wore a tke pledge pin and immediately 
identified the 6foot7 lallemand when shown pictures of the 21 
fraternity pledges police said 
lallemand was charged and held at the state prison for a week 
until a bail hearing wednesday it was then the woman testified she 
had been very drunk at the party and could no longer recall 
everything that had happened 
dave began touching me and you know i was telling him im 
not that kind of girl she testified from then on im 
blank 
the next thing she remembers she said was standing up from a 
sofa with her pants and underwear at her knees and seeing lallemand 
and four other men 
two or three men were trying to pull my pants back down she 
said they were just laughing 
she said she couldnt recall other things she had told police 
the judge refused to admit her statements to police as evidence 
and dismissed the case 
the university suspended activities at the fraternity after the 
incident 
brady said one of tkes 85 members had his car vandalized and 
the word rapist scrawled in lipstick on his windshield 
were taking kind of a beating he said if the same thing 
happened in a dorm it wouldnt even get in the press 
the 10000student university suspended two fraternities in 
1988 one for hazing and one for possession of stolen goods 
weve made so many changes and become so strict im 
surprised anything happened said lloyd sprague president of a 
student board that oversees the universitys 14 fraternities 
its definitely put us back a few years

iraq will release four more american 
hostages former us attorney general ramsey clark said today 
after concluding an independent peace mission to baghdad 
i was told that two were going to be released today and 
apparently did not make it on the plane and that they will be out 
on the next plane whenever that is clark told reporters on 
arrival in amman from baghdad 
i think it will be tomorrow and there will be two more after 
that said clark who arrived on the daily iraqi airways flight 
from the iraqi capital 
clark a peace activist who traveled to hanoi during the vietnam 
war is the second prominent american to go to baghdad since iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 former presidential candidate jesse 
jackson was there in august 
during his threeday visit clark criticized the united states 
for not seeking a negotiated settlement to the persian gulf crisis 
and chastised iraq for holding foreign hostages as a human 
shield against air raids by the predominantly us forces 
deployed in saudi arabia 
the official iraqi news agency reported that clark had conferred 
with top iraqi officials including president saddam hussein 
clark said he met with american hostages who have taken refuge 
at the us ambassadors residence in baghdad 
they want to go home they want liberty they want to be free 
but their physical and mental health seem excellent as far as i 
could tell he said 
there were 3500 americans in iraq and kuwait before the 
invasion some 600 remain in hiding or are held in kuwait about 
330 are detained in iraq including 104 men held at 30 strategic 
sites throughout the country 
many western leaders have said independent missions to baghdad 
by former leaders could be used to split the alliance against iraq 
clark was attorney general under president johnson from 1966 to 
1969

tom perdue onetime top aide to georgia gov 
joe frank harris failed today in a supreme court attempt to kill a 
libel lawsuit against him by state public service commission member 
j mac barber 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that barbers 
allegations that perdue falsely accused him of bribery should go to 
a jury 
the commission was the target of a bribery investigation in 1984 
and 1985 barber was never charged with a crime as a result of that 
investigation but others were indicted 
barber resigned from the commission in 1985 but qualified to run 
in 1986 for the seat he had left 18 months previously 
in that 1986 election barber lost to gary andrews the man 
appointed to succeed him 
barber regained a commission seat in elections this month 
during the 1986 campaign perdue sent a letter to about 350 city 
and county officials throughout the state urging them to oppose 
barbers election 
in the letter perdue said a public service commissioner 
betrayed the public trust by accepting what amounted to a 
bribe 
the letter added when confronted with the fact that the 
attorney general and the georgia bureau of investigation had this 
information and were about to seek a felony indictment mac barber 
chose to resign his office rather than face the prospect of 
indictment and conviction the trucking company official who gave 
mac barber the money was convicted and fined a total of 12000 
a state trial judge threw out barbers suit ruling that there 
was no actual malice knowledge or reckless disregard of 
falsity 
but the georgia court of appeals reinstated the suit by a 54 
vote last year 
there is undisputed evidence that perdue knew that barber 
had not been convicted or even indicted for bribery yet stated 
that he was guilty of it the state court said a jury can 
reasonably infer that he stated his opinion as though it were an 
official fact despite the accusations not having been proved 
beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law 
the georgia supreme court refused 42 to hear perdues ensuing 
appeal 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for perdue said the case 
is not one that should reach a jury 
they said perdue had sat in on a meeting between the governor 
and barber before the 1985 resignation had reviewed the gbi file 
on the commission bribery investigation discussed his letter with 
the attorney general and received approval by a lawyer on the 
governors staff 
in urging the justices to reject perdues appeal lawyers for 
barber said the former governors aide uttered false statements 
of fact which perdue knew to be false or whose falsity perdue 
recklessly disregarded 
the case is perdue vs barber 90502

the supreme court today turned away a 
wisconsin controversy over how much money associations may spend in 
communicating with their members about political matters 
the justices without comment left intact rulings that the 
dispute is not yet ready for intervention by the courts 
the wisconsin education association council weac a voluntary 
organization of teachers and other public school employees had 
urged the court to rule that a state law limiting campaign spending 
cannot be applied to an associations messages to its members 
the appeal acted on today said applying the campaignspending 
limits to such communications would violate freespeech and 
associational rights 
weac announced in the spring of 1988 that it intended to hire 
about 20 of its members to work toward mobilizing the associations 
membership in support of those candidates whom weac planned to 
endorse in the november elections 
after learning of weacs intention members of the state 
elections board expressed concern that certain activities if 
undertaken at the request or suggestion of a candidate might 
constitute contributions to that candidate 
wisconsin law imposes limits on individual campaign 
contributions of 1000 per state senate race and 500 per state 
assembly race 
the elections board met with weacs legislative director in july 
1988 and in august sent the association a letter stating the board 
planned no formal action because there was no evidence that weac 
had violated any campaign law 
weac sued the elections board in state court that september 
seeking a ruling that any expenses incurred in political 
communications with its members were exempt from the spending 
limits even those incurred as a result of contact with an 
endorsed candidate or that candidates campaign committee 
state courts including the wisconsin supreme court last june 
refused to rule on weacs constitutional claims the state courts 
said the claim was premature because the elections board had taken 
no action 
to resolve weacs constitutional claims would require the 
court to speculate both on the nature of weacs conduct and on the 
enforcement posture of the board with respect to that conduct 
the state court said 
in a dissenting opinion from the june ruling justice william 
bablitch said such associational expenditures need not be 
reported and are not contributions within the meaning of the 
wisconsin law 
bablitch chastised his court for leaving weac leaders in an 
untenable position in which they could forego political 
activity which they believe is constitutionally protected or 
proceed with their plans at their peril 
the case is wisconsin education association council vs 
wisconsin state elections board 90492

leningrads reformist mayor urged the city council 
today to ration eggs flour meat and other necessities saying it 
is the only way the city will get through the winter without hunger 
and unrest 
the entire country is introducing ration cards and we 
unfortunately cannot avoid it either mayor anatoly sobchak said 
soviet television showed shoppers in leningrad the countrys 
secondlargst city waiting in 500yardlong lines for ordinary 
items like butter milk and chocolate 
citizens standing in queues since morning want their 
representatives to take faster and most of all more decisive 
actions the television announcer said 
a few items are already rationed in leningrad but the new plan 
if adopted would be one of the most comprehensive rationing plans 
in the country 
leningrad officials said the council was likely to make a 
decision thursday 
sobchak suggested that without rationing public anger over 
shortages could endanger president mikhail s gorbachevs political 
reforms 
democracy is facing a hungry winter he said it is 
crucial for democracy to survive this winter the only solution i 
see is to introduce ration cards now 
moscow already has rationed sugar and cigarettes limiting 
residents to 44 pounds of sugar and 10 packs of cigarettes per 
person in november 
moscows city council is expected to expand its ration system to 
include meat butter and flour starting dec 1 soviet newspapers 
have given varying accounts of the amounts of those items that 
moscow residents would be allowed to buy 
local officials in other cities have rationed meat vodka 
butter and similar staples in some regions particularly in 
northern russia where supplies grow scarce in winter limited 
rationing has been in effect for years but it is becoming more and 
more widespread 
in leningrad the citys 48 million residents already receive 
monthly ration coupons for 44 pounds of sugar one bottle of vodka 
and two bottles of wine 
a commission headed by marina salye a prominent reformist 
politician has recommended new limits of 26 pounds of meat 11 
pounds of chicken and 22 pounds of sausage 
in addition each resident would be allotted 10 eggs 11 pounds 
of butter 22 pounds of cereal or pasta 11 pounds of flour and 
twothirds of a pound of vegetable oil leningrad residents also 
would receive monthly coupons for five packs of cigarettes 
the threat of widespread hunger is a particularly sensitive 
issue in leningrad where many still remember the nazi siege of 
september 1941 to january 1944 when thousands died of starvation 
leonid dobrovolsky deputy chairman of the leningrad food supply 
commission opposed the rationing proposal he told the council 
that stateowned plants might not be able to supply even the 
limited amounts of food the council had in mind 
in 1991 none of the food factories in leningrad will be able 
to guarantee the manufacture of foodstuffs or make plans because 
their suppliers are not meeting their obligations and have not 
signed new contracts he was quoted as saying by maxim korzhavin 
a freelance soviet journalist who spoke to the associated press by 
telephone from leningrad 
an alternative proposal would raise prices on basic foodstuffs 
to give suppliers an incentive to send food to the city poor 
families would receive state subsidies or food coupons to make up 
for the higher prices 
but korzhavin said the majority of the city council members 
appeared to favor the expanded rationing

the supreme court today set aside a ruling 
that let louisiana officials give mindaltering drugs to a 
convicted mass murderer in the hope he could be made sane enough to 
execute 
the justices ordered a state court to restudy its ruling in the 
case of death row inmate michael owen perry 
todays oneparagraph unsigned opinion directed the louisiana 
court to reconsider perrys case in light of a supreme court 
decision in february permitting prison officials to force inmates 
to take powerful antipsychotic drugs without a judges consent 
the february ruling gave officials broad power to administer the 
drugs to maintain order in the prisons but only if prison doctors 
determined the medication is in the inmates medical interest 
it was not immediately clear what effect todays ruling will 
have on perrys case 
he was convicted of killing his parents and three other 
relatives in their lake arthur la home in 1983 
perry was judged to be sane when he committed the crimes and 
mentally competent to stand trial officials said he became 
psychotic while on death row 
a 1986 supreme court ruling bars states from executing anyone 
who is insane 
psychiatrists have testified that when perry is taking 
antipsychotic drugs he is competent to be executed meaning he 
realizes he is going to be executed because he killed five people 
the medical director at angola prison in louisiana testified 
that perry told him its very simple take my pills and die 
dont take my pills and live 
there were no recorded dissents from todays ruling justice 
david h souter did not take part in the case 
the case is perry vs louisiana 895120

a man who said he was among a group of 
americans hiding in kuwait urged us military action against iraq 
during a telephone call to a television station 
we feel that our protectors have hidden us away well enough 
and safe enough so that if they start bombing we feel very good 
95 percent sure we can come through the war and get back home 
the caller said 
wjwtv received the unsolicited call monday and confirmed it 
came from kuwait producer tom reed said newsman john oday spoke 
with men from ohio and maryland the station did not identify them 
the ohio caller said the group has gone from place to place to 
avoid detection 
about 2000 westerners are believed to be in hiding in kuwait in 
addition to the more than 400 being held by iraq as socalled human 
shields according to us state department figures 
the caller said the consensus among the group is that military 
force should be applied as soon as possible 
if they use the military option i really feel that in three or 
four days i could be out of kuwait and on a plane back to see 
my family he said 
the caller said the group hangs on every bit of news from the 
united states 
we go from a very high high to very low lows he said to 
give an example last week when we heard the president was willing

the soviet union has created a moscow stock 
exchange the first in the country since the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution 
the official tass news agency said the exchange was founded 
monday by 187 soviet enterprises and banks it did not say when 
trading would begin 
president mikhail s gorbachev issued an order oct 26 
permitting soviet citizens to buy stocks bonds and other 
securities as part of his plan to switch from central planning to a 
market economy 
tass said the moscow stock exchange would be represented 
overseas by an international brokerage company that has asked not 
to be identified the exchange plans to open offices in the worlds 
major stock exchanges in new york frankfurt tokyo and singapore 
the news agency said 
trading in shares was outlawed following the bolshevik 
revolution a flourishing stock market in st petersburg now 
leningrad was closed along with more than 100 commodity exchanges 
elsewhere in russia 
the new york stock exchange recently gave a threeday seminar in 
moscow on how to revive operate and regulate financial markets 
nyse chairman john phelan and his soviet hosts agreed that 
limited trading could begin within a year 
soviet businessman eduard tenyakov one of the main organizers 
of a moscow stock exchange said the ruble would be valued on a par 
with the us dollar in estimating the currency exchange values of 
shares 
the ruble is not a convertible currency and exchange rates are 
set artifically by the government a new commercial exchange rate 
was imposed on nov 1 cutting the value of the soviet currency by 
nearly 70 percent to discourage imports 
the new rate for international commercial transactions is 18 
rubles per us dollar compared to the old 56 rubles to the 
dollar 
the rate for foreign tourists exchanging money in the soviet 
union remained unchanged at six rubles to the dollar

iraq may have used usbacked loans to obtain 
trucks and other equipment for its invasion of kuwait and 
kickbacks on its subsidized purchases of us food to buy weapons 
according to a report 
cable news network reported monday that iraq diverted millions 
of dollars from loans backed by the us department of agriculture 
intended to help iraq buy surplus food from us farmers to 
obtain trucks and other hardware used in the invasion 
unfortunately the us soldier in operation desert shield 
faces an iraqi army that probably has been fed with usdaguaranteed 
loans on food and has been transported around the country of iraq 
on transportation equipment that was provided as bribes for 
companies to do business with iraq rep charles rose dnc 
told cnn 
and that should send a cold shiver up and down the back of 
every american he added 
iraq has borrowed 5 billion in usdabacked loans since 1983 
when president reagan started the program to aid the iraqis in 
their war with iran and to help us farmers sell surplus 
commodities 
iraq still owes 2 billion on the loans but stopped making 
payments when it invaded kuwait this summer 
although iraq was supposed to buy only food and other 
agriculture products with the loans iraqi officials demanded the 
american exporters give them trucks trailers cranes spare parts 
and other industrial equipment as part of their purchases cnn 
said citing federal investigation reports 
investigators also believe iraq used the usbacked loans to 
buy weapons by overpaying american companies for food and then 
demanding that they transfer cash kickbacks to bank accounts in 
europe cnn said 
cnn said several unidentified agricultural companies confirmed 
that they wired money to european banks for iraq but said iraqi 
officials told them the money would be used to buy agriculture 
items not weapons 
rose told the network federal investigators have told me that 
they have found instances in which ammunitions and guns instead of 
agriculture commodities went to iraq under these loan programs

the supreme court today agreed to decide in a 
case from california whether employers sometimes must submit a 
unions grievance to arbitration even though the complaint centers 
on a sinceexpired contract 
the justices said they will review rulings that if upheld 
would force litton financial printing division a subsidiary of 
litton industries inc to submit a 1980 dispute to arbitration 
litton prints blank checks at six plants where employees are 
represented by the printing specialties district council no 2 
in november 1980 litton decided to close down the coldtype 
printing operation at its santa clara calif plant and expand its 
hottype operation there 
the move sparked the laying off of 10 employees who had worked 
in the coldtype operation the employees were not laid off on the 
basis of plantwide seniority 
the collective bargaining agreement with the printers union had 
expired in october 1979 about 11 months before the layoff dispute 
arose litton was refusing to recognize or bargain with the union 
the expired contract contained a grievancearbitration procedure 
for resolving such disputes and the union filed grievances for 
each of the 10 laidoff employees 
litton noting that the contract had expired refused to process 
the grievances 
the union then filed unfair labor practice complaints with the 
national labor relations board and the board ruled that litton had 
violated federal labor law 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld the boards ruling 
last january 
the board reasonably concluded that the layoff was a mandatory 
subject of bargaining and that litton therefore violated the 
national labor relations act by refusing to bargain about the 
layoff decision the appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for litton argued that 
just as the employer had no obligation to bargain over shutting 
down the coldtype printing operations in santa clara it had no 
obligation to bargain over the resulting layoffs 
there is no obligation to arbitrate seniority grievances 
based upon facts which occur long after contract expiration the 
appeal said 
justice department lawyers had urged the court to reject the 
appeal 
the case is litton financial printing division vs nlrb 90285

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration its views of whether a special federal court may 
protect black voting rights in arkansas by forcing officials to get 
its approval before making election changes there 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
before saying whether it will hear arguments by arkansas officials 
that the threejudge panel improperly exceeded its authority 
the governments response could take months 
the threejudge court by a 21 vote in may ruled that state 
officials must get its approval before making changes affecting 
majorityvote requirements in the states general elections 
the lower court also said any plan to reapportion state 
legislative districts based on the 1990 census must be delayed for 
60 days after a plans adoption by a state apportionment board 
the delay will allow time for any voting rights challenge to the 
new districts the threejudge court said 
the lower court invoked a socalled preclearance provision of 
the federal voting rights act giving federal courts power in some 
cases to review election changes in southern states 
the preclearance authority is based on a finding that blacks 
were victims of deliberate voting rights abuses in the past the 
threejudge court said not merely that past practices 
unintentionally diluted black voting strength 
the panel cited four such abuses in which the arkansas 
legislature hampered the ability of black candidates to win local 
offices black candidates who amassed pluralities in earlier 
elections lost after laws were changed to require majority 
victories in a runoff 
devotion to majority rule for local offices lay dormant as 
long as the plurality system produced white officeholders the 
threejudge court said but whenever black candidates used this 
system sucessfully the response was swift and certain laws 
were passed to close off this avenue of black political 
victory 
the threejudge court said it credited testimony by gov bill 
clinton that the pace of political reform in arkansas is 
quickening and that the rights of blacks are being protected but 
the lower court said the states past record still warrants 
intervention by the federal courts 
the supreme court has asked the bush administration for its 
views in a related arkansas case in which black voters in a rural 
county challenged a majorityvote requirement for party primaries 
and countywide general elections lower courts have upheld the 
system 
the case acted on today is clinton vs jeffers 90394

a sale of impressionist and modern paintings 
from the estate of henry ford ii brought 20 million less than 
expected further proof that the air has been let out of the art 
market balloon 
i think if it was held six months ago it would have gone 
better said sothebys auctioneer john marion after mondays 
auction 
thirteen of the 36 artworks were not sold because bidding failed 
to meet the minimum price set by the seller 
of the 23 works sold 13 went for less than the presale 
estimate 
tonight at sothebys the art collection of the late greta garbo 
will go on the block including three works by auguste renoir 
the ford collection included works by paul cezanne amedeo 
modigliani henri matisse joan miro and marc chagall 
the auction had been expected to fetch more than 50 million 
but winning bids totaled just 3043 million 
ford who was vice chairman of sothebys from 1960 to 1980 and 
headed ford motor co from 1945 to 1980 died in 1987 he was the 
grandson of automobile magnate henry ford 
some blamed the low prices on the quality of the art 
the ford collection is not great said manhattan dealer 
edward nahem 
others blamed the falling market 
every speculator in any market likes to buy when its going 
up said paris art dealer mickey tiroche 
marion even suggested that the gulf conflict could be having an 
impact 
theres nobody walking the earth that doesnt have some 
feeling about whats happening in the middle east and there is no 
way it could not have some effect on buying said marion 
renoirs the cup of chocolate was auctioned apart from the 
rest of the ford collection and fetched 1815 million the 
painting was valued at 15 million to 18 million 
at sothebys sale of postwar art last week only half the works

thousands of european farmers some wielding 
pitchforks and clanging cowbells marched through the city today to 
protest efforts to cut agricultural subsidies at world trade talks 
about 10000 farmers demonstrated outside the administrative 
headquarters of the general agreement on tariffs and trade in 
geneva site of the talks on freeing commerce in farm products and 
14 other areas 
the farmers mainly from france germany italy and switzerland 
carried signs denouncing the talks and singling out us trade 
representative carla hills for destroying european farmers 
gatt farm talks were suspended after washington and a group of 
allied farm exporting nations rejected as insufficient a european 
community offer for cuts in state supports 
france and germany led opposition inside the 12nation ec to 
offering even the proposal now on the table 
millions of family farms in europe are threatened in their 
extistence due to the proposals at the gatt talks a leaflet 
distributed by the demonstrators said free trade without 
barriers destroys structures oriented toward family farming 
forces an industrialization of agriculture and creates instability 
on agrarian markets 
the farmers said they do not oppose sensible adaptation and 
proposed an improved balance of markets in international 
agriculture 
gatt directorgeneral arthur dunkel of switzerland received a 
farmer delegation inside the trade organizations lakeside 
building the marchers then continued through geneva 
no injuries were reported in the demonstration swiss police 
were out in force for the protest 
dunkel who oversees the entire gatt talks warned on monday 
that plans to conclude an ambitious package of marketopening 
accords at a dec 37 ministerial meeting are now in jeopardy 
in an emergency meeting of senior negotiators he appealed to 
all sides to show more flexibility within a matter of days 
us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said last week it 
would be a big mistake to even contemplate extending the 
negotiations 
the united states and the australianled 13nation cairns 
group which also includes major third world farm exporters on 
saturday refused negotiations on an ec offer to cut farm supports 
by 30 percent 
the proposal provides for cuts in overall aid over 10 years 
backdated to 1986 thus giving the ec credit for mesaures already 
taken 
there are no separate provisions for cutting export subsidies 
which washington has said it considers indispensable 
the united states and the cairns group are seeking cuts of 75 
percent in domestic supports and import barriers and 90 percent in 
export subsidies spaced over 10 years with 1991 as base year

iran on tuesday freed 44 egyptians 
captured while fighting alongside iraqi troops during the 198088 
persian gulf war tehran radio reported 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia said the prisoners were 
freed in response to a request by egyptian theologians visiting 
tehran they were handed over to sheik mohammed ghazali a 
prominent egyptian theologian 
egyptian press reports have estimated that iran seized 13000 to 
20000 egyptians during the war hundreds of other arabs mainly 
lebanese and somali soldiers also were captured before a 
unsponsored ceasefire halted hostilities in august 1988 
after the ceasefire iranian president hashemi rafsanjani moved 
to end irans international isolation and improve ties with arab 
and other countries 
the prisoner release is seen as a gesture by tehran to end more 
than a decade of acrimony with cairo it moved the two countries

gradeschool children who watch two hours of 
television a day are at increased risk of having high cholesterol 
levels and the risk climbs the more they watch researchers said 
tuesday 
children watching television four hours a day are four times as 
likely to have high cholesterols as are children who watch less 
than two hours the researchers reported 
previous research showed that children who watched too much 
television exercised less were overweight and had bad diets 
we made the next step to look at tv and cholesterol said 
thomas k hei who reported the findings at the annual meeting of 
the american heart association 
the message is if you cant get your children to stop watching 
tv maybe get them to exercise more and keep them from unhealthy 
food said hei a student at the university of california 
irvine 
the study of 1077 suburban southern california children 
demonstrated that television habits are the best clue to 
identifying children with high cholesterol said dr kurt v gold 
of the university of california irvine who directed the study 
in families with a history of heart disease or high cholesterol 
levels television habits facilitated the identification of nine 
out of 10 of the children with cholesterol levels above 200 gold 
said 
it provides another tool to help us identify the many children 
with elevated blood cholesterol levels who might otherwise go 
undetected 
peggy charren the president of action for childrens 
television blamed television commercials shown during childrens 
shows 
the food messages you get for children couldnt be worse 
she said 
we have never sold kids the foods that anyone wants them to 
eat we sell candy we sell highfat snacks and we push fastfood 
restaurants 
the average american child watches 23 hours of television per 
week charren said 
the children in the study who watched two to four hours of 
television a day were average viewers hei and gold found that the 
childrens risk of having elevated cholesterol levels was 50 
percent higher than children who watched less than two hours of 
television per day 
the two researchers sent questionnaires to parents whose 
children had had their cholesterol tested the questionnaires 
inquired about the childrens television viewing habits and the 
familys history of heart disease 
nearly all of the chldren in the study were between ages 2 and 
12 with an average age of 7 hei said they were mostly white and 
uppermiddle class he said 
the american academy of pediatrics which supported the study 
says any child with a cholesterol level over 175 should be treated 
since cholesterol levels tend to rise somewhat when a child 
reaches adulthood many of these children could have dangerously 
high levels in later life gold said a level above 240 is 
considered high for adults and levels between 200 and 240 are 
borderline high according to the american heart association 
it would be wonderful if you could buy a tv set that only 
operates when the people watching it are exercising gold said

the monterey harbor has become a sort of 
sea lion motel where the sardines are plenty and the living is 
easy but the pinnipeds may soon face eviction as officials renew 
their fight to roust the mammals 
city officials hope to drive away the mammals by enforcing a 
proposed amendment to a 1972 federal law that protects sea lions 
from harm the change which could go into effect early next year 
would make it illegal to feed marine mammals putting an end to 
concessionaires selling sea lion snacks that tourists have used to 
lure the animals to shore 
to the average joe the sea lions look like something out of a 
walt disney movie but until you go down to the docks and stand 
right next to one of these monsters its hard to understand what 
the city is dealing with said mitch whippern administrative 
assistant for the monterey public facilities department 
most of the hundreds of sea lions who gather off the monterey 
coast sun themselves on rocks about a football field away from the 
harbor but tourists have lured dozens of the animals to the wharf 
and onto floating boat slips to the dismay of city officials and 
fishermen 
a dozen of the 300 to 800pound mammals recently climbed on a 
tugboat and sank it others have prevented some boat owners from 
docking the city has spent 40000 so far this year repairing sea 
lion damage at the docks 
whippern said city officials have tried to scare away the sea 
lions by spraying them with high pressure hoses banging together 
garbage cans hitting brooms against the docks and using an 
ultrasonic whistle 
if we had a guy out there with a hose all day we could keep 
them off but if you leave for a minute they come right back 
whippern said

a report financed by the american bankers 
association said tuesday the cooperatively owned farm credit system 
fueled a land boom in the 1970s that ultimately led to hard times 
in the 1980s 
the report said a 1971 law liberalizing collateral requirements 
for farm real estate loans made by the system unleashed a boom in 
land prices in rural america that saw the inflationadjusted value 
of farmland nearly double from 1971 to 1980 
but the report added this land boom was unsustainable and 
the bubble burst in 1980 by 1986 six years later the average 
real value of farmland had dropped back almost to its 1971 level 
the 1971 law raised the systems collateral limit to 85 percent 
of the market value of farmland from the previous standard of 65 
percent of its agricultural incomeproducing value 
the report the farm credit system reckless lender to rural 
america was prepared for the american bankers association by ely 
amp company inc an alexandria va financial consulting firm 
ron erickson a spokesman for the farm credit administration 
which oversees the system said he had not seen the report 
but erickson said it has been widely known and talked about for 
years that during the 70s when commodity prices were good and 
land values were inflating farmers were eager to expand and were 
borrowing heavily to do so they were basing that and so were the 
lenders on inflated land values 
erickson added in a telephone interview from his office in 
mclean va that the boost in the lending limit allowed by the 
1971 law was an important signal 
in fact he said the previous lending limit of 65 percent of 
farmlands agricultural value was usually around 50 percent of 
the lands market value thus the increase to 85 percent of market 
value was in effect even greater in many cases 
bert ely president of the consulting firm said tuesday in 
remarks prepared for a conference in denver colo sponsored by 
the bankers that the farm credit system unwisely used its new 
powers in the 1970s to overlend to american farmers 
ely said the ensuing financial crunch on farmers will ultimately 
cost taxpayers about 100 billion 
as a result of the damage caused by fcs overlending federal 
government payments to farmers in the 198289 period exceeded the 
earlier eightyear period by 75 billion measured in 1990 
dollars he said 
future government payments to farmers plus losses suffered by 
the farmers home administration account for the balance of this 
100 billion fiasco ely added 
the farm credit system which includes federal land bank 
associations and other lending entities is traditionally subject 
to federal government oversight but it ran into huge financial 
difficulties in the early 1980s with congress in 1987 passing a 
package of reforms and financial bailout 
ely said the 1987 reforms however did not roll back the 
collateral liberalization of the 1971 law 
therefore he said the fcs still has the power to 
overlend again to american farmers and to spark yet another 
farmland boom and bust

state legislators erred when they passed a 
law that allows poor students in milwaukee to attend private 
schools using state funds an appeals court ruled today 
the 4th district court of appeals in madison said it was 
unconstitutional because the law was passed as part of the state 
budget the court said that violated a provision in the state 
constitution designed to prevent bills benefiting local interests 
from being smuggled through the legislature 
the court did not directly address the merits of the school 
choice program 
the program passed last spring and begun this fall allows 
parents to send their children to nonsectarian private schools 
with state funds 
the program was authorized to provide a 2500 stipend each for 
as many as 1000 students this year but only about 400 were able 
to enroll in about 10 eligible private schools because of space 
limitations 
the money for the program comes from state aid provided to the 
milwaukee public schools system which has about 97000 students 
the program is the first in the nation to directly provide 
parents with a voucher to allow them to send their students out of 
public schools and into private institutions 
critics charge it undermines public education and benefits only 
a few while ignoring the majority of students left behind in 
declining public schools 
roger sundby assistant to state schools superintendent herbert 
grover said the program will continue for at least 30 days to 
allow for further appeals 
sundby said the state department of public instruction which 
has opposed the program considered the ruling a victory but would 
have preferred a ruling on the programs merits

the number of children receiving heart transplants 
is likely to increase substantially as doctors find new uses for 
this dramatic surgery and overcome a critical shortage of organs 
physicians predict 
doctors at the annual meeting of the american heart association 
also said the outlook for young heart transplant patients is 
improving largely because of better ways to prevent their bodies 
from rejecting the new organs 
the use of heart transplants especially in the very young grew 
quickly during the past decade in 1979 doctors performed just one 
of these operations in children by 1989 there were 187 operations 
at 58 hospitals around the world 
i think the number will become much larger said dr david 
baum of stanford university transplantation in the very young 
will become a more widely accepted procedure especially as 
survival is increased 
until now heart transplants in the young have been reserved 
largely for children with a muscle disease called cardiomyopathy 
but several doctors said the procedure is being expanded to 
children with severe heart birth defects 
as our success continues to improve and as patients chances 
for lifelong survival increase we are starting to perform 
transplants for conditions in which there are other surgical 
interventions said dr daniel bernstein another stanford 
physician 
until recently doctors only option for youngsters with 
misformed hearts was to try to fix the abnormality surgically but 
the operations are often very risky and doctors believe that 
replacing the heart entirely may be safer for some young patients 
bernstein said stanford doctors have performed 20 transplants in 
youngsters with birth defects and are extremely encouraged 
among the best known young transplant recipients was stormie 
jones who received a new heart and liver in the same operation in 
1984 the girl died sunday at age 13 after developing problems with 
her transplanted organs 
one of her physicians dr david bilheimer of the university of 
texas in dallas said she would have died years ago without the 
transplants 
there is not anything else we could have done for her he 
said for five years she had an excellent quality of life 
as heart transplants become more routine patients survival has 
increased at stanford for instance 75 percent of patients are 
still alive one year after their operations and 70 percent survive 
at least five years 
the improvement in the survival of transplant patients 
including children results largely from the discovery of 
cyclosporine a drug that keeps the body from rejecting the foreign 
organ 
dr f jay fricker of childrens hospital of pittsburgh said 
doctors there have treated 12 young patients with an experimental 
new drug called fk506 which he said in preliminary use appears to 
work better than cyclosporine 
but a shortage of donor organs continues to limit the number of 
operations dr mark boucek of loma linda university said 40000 
children whose organs could be donated die each year but less than 
half of 1 percent of their organs are offered for transplants 
if we could have a yield of 2 percent of all deaths we would 
probably be able to satisfy all of the babies who could benefit 
from transplants boucek said 
but baum said he believes the situation is improving in part as 
more doctors and parents become willing to suggest using the organs 
of young victims 
also he said doctors are finding better ways to preserve organs 
so they can be transported farther and they are also finding ways 
to keep young patients alive with mechanical pumping devices until 
donated organs arive 
he noted that many insurance commpany also have recently agreed 
to routinely pay for childrens heart transplants and that should 
make the procedure more widely available

a federal judge frustrated by delays in paying 
manuel noriegas attorneys said today he will appoint two 
governmentpaid defense attorneys if their fee problem is not 
resolved by friday 
it is obvious that we simply may not be able to unfreeze any 
money us district judge william hoeveler said during a hearing 
on the fees 
in june hoeveler ordered prosecutors to unfreeze about 6 
million in 27 noriegalinked bank accounts for use by the noriegas 
private lawyers 
but five months later defense lawyers have not received a 
penny and today they asked hoeveler to light a fire under the us 
government and banks in france switzerland and austria to release 
the funds 
but justice department attorney drew arena told the judge that 
the foreign governments had frozen the accounts for their own 
investigations and have so far refused to release them despite the 
us governments request 
the problem is the united states had alleged the money was drug 
proceeds but was now reversing course by asking that it be given 
to noriega arena said 
its rather your honor like trying to unring a bell 
arena said 
lead defense attorney frank rubino accused the us state 
department of undermining efforts to unfreeze the funds by 
encouraging foreign governments to act on their own hoeveler 
however said he was frustrated by the delays and wanted the case 
to proceed as quickly as possible 
the judge has agreed that the trial will not begin jan 28 but 
said it will not be delayed by much 
under the law covering courtappointed counsel the attorneys 
could receive only a maximum of 60 an hour far less than the 350 
an hour noriegas attorneys have said they needed 
meanwhile noriega and cable news network have agreed to let the 
us supreme court decide whether the deposed panamanian dictators 
taperecorded conversations with his lawyers can be broadcast 
cnn aire excerpts of one tape over the weekend in defiance of 
hoeveler 
the defense and the network agreed monday to suspend their feud 
until the us supreme court decides whether cnns freepress 
rights outweigh noriegas right to a fair trial the network 
planned to file the appeal this week 
i will be interested in seeing what the supreme court will do 
in this novel situation hoeveler said 
the atlantabased network agreed not to play any of the disputed 
tapes until the supreme court rules in return noriegas defense 
delayed a request for contempt penalties of up to 300000 per 
broadcast against the network and hoeveler stayed his order that 
cnn hand over seven disputed tapes to the court 
cnn attorney terry bienstock said the network had the right to 
play other noriega tapes as long as they did not include 
conversations with his attorneys the judge agreed 
cnn defied hoeveler by broadcasting on friday and saturday an 
excerpt of a tape in which noriega spoke in spanish with a defense 
attorneys secretary who translated for his defense team on the 
tape noriega speculated that the government would use as witnesses 
against him two panamanians in us custody 
rubino has said he will seek dismissal of all charges against 
noriega alleging government misconduct in recording the calls made 
from the metropolitan correctional center outside miami 
noriega has been held there since his surrender to us forces 
shortly after the invasion of panama in december he is accused of 
accepting 46 million in bribes to protect the cocaine trade

the supreme court today threw out the murder 
conviction of a louisiana man because the jury that convicted him 
was given an impermissible definition of beyond a reasonable 
doubt 
the justices unanimously ruled that tommy cage currently an 
inmate on louisianas death row is entitled to a new trial 
in other action the court 
set aside a ruling that let louisiana officials give 
mindaltering drugs to a convicted mass murderer in the hope he 
could be made sane enough to execute 
the justices ordered a state court to restudy its ruling in the 
case of death row inmate michael owen perry the oneparagraph 
unsigned opinion ordered reconsideration of the case in light of a 
supreme court opinion in february permitting prison officials to 
force inmates to take powerful antipsychotic drugs without a 
judges consent 
agreed to hear an appeal by a maryland man who said a federal 
judge illegally increased his sentence 
the justices said they will use the case of thomas braxton to 
decide whether federal judges may base stiffer sentences on a 
charge that was dismissed 
turned down the bid of an ohio legislator robert e netzley 
to avoid a libel lawsuit for using the term mafia in opposing 
the reelection of james p celebrezze to the states highest 
court 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that netzley a 
republican member of the ohio house of representatives from miami 
county must defend himself against celebrezzes lawsuit 
turned away an effort by tom perdue onetime top aide to 
georgia gov joe frank harris to kill a libel lawsuit against him 
by state public service commission member j mac barber 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that barbers 
allegations that perdue falsely accused him of bribery should go to 
a jury 
cage had been convicted of fatally shooting arthur johnson while 
robbing him of a gold chain and medallion on a new orleans street 
corner april 16 1986 cage had been sentenced to death for the 
crime 
jurors who convicted cage were told they had to conclude he was 
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
the judge said this doubt however must be a reasonable one 
that is one that is founded upon a real tangible substantial basis 
and not upon mere caprice and conjecture it must be such doubt as 
would give rise to a grave uncertainty what is required is not 
an absolute or mathematical certainty but a moral certainty 
the louisiana supreme court in upholding cages conviction and 
death sentence said the jury instruction was constitutionally 
permissible when taken in its complete context 
but today the nations highest court said the state court was 
wrong 
it is plain to us that the words substantial and grave as 
they are commonly understood suggest a higher degree of doubt than 
is required for acquittal under the reasonable doubt standard 
the justices said in an unsigned opinion 
a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction to 
allow a finding of guilt based on a degree of proof below that 
required by the constitutions due process clause the justices 
said 
the case is cage vs louisiana 897302

two senior republican senators today called for a special 
session of congress to authorize action against iraq and saddam 
husseins chief deputy flew to morroco to discuss an arab attempt 
to avert war in the persian gulf 
sen richard lugar rind said a congressional vote would 
give saddam and the world another signal that president bushs gulf 
policies have overwhelming american support and that his threats of 
force are credible 
senate republican leader bob dole called for a declaration of 
support and a willingness to commit whatever resources it takes to 
fulfill the mission 
a democratic critic of bushs decision to send 200000 more 
troops to the gulf agreed that congress needs to play a greater 
role in the crisis 
but the white house rejected the idea of a special session of 
congress 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said we dont 
think thats necessary there is no war he also said the 
president believes he has consulted sufficiently with members of 
congress and will continue to do so 
in other developments today 
former us attorney general ramsey clark said iraq will 
release four more american hostages clark spoke in amman the 
jordanian capital after concluding an independent peace mission to 
baghdad danish radio said iraq also agreed today to release some 
of the 38 danish hostages held in baghdad 
president hosni mubarak of egypt made a surprise trip to libya 
and met leader moammar gadhafi for talks on the gulf situation the 
visit came a day after deputy premier saadoun hammadi of iraq held 
talks with gadhafi 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said she believes 
saddam is close to acquiring nuclear weapons speaking in the house 
of commons she reiterated that force must be used unless iraq ends 
its 3monthold occupation of kuwait 
cable news network reported that iraq may have used kickbacks 
paid by american companies to purchase weapons it used in the 
kuwaiti invasion cnn also said monday iraq diverted millions of 
dollars from us department of agriculturebacked loans to buy 
trucks and other hardware used in the invasion there was no 
immediate comment from the bush administration on the report 
regarding the call by lugar today bush refused to comment on 
whether a special session of congress was needed when questioned by 
a reporter at the start of a cabinet meeting this morning 
lugar speaking on the nbcs today show said i think the 
president must lay out now to the nation and the congress 
specifically what our aims are 
and then he must call for a session of the congress and set a 
date for the return of the congress to debate those issues and 
vote affirmatively i would presume so that we have authorization 
for what is required 
lugar a member of the senate foreign relations committee said 
he was not suggesting what form an authorization vote should take 
it occurs to me congressional leaders and the president can 
agree upon an authorization but clearly the president needs to 
have an upanddown vote by members of the congress representing 
the people of this country so that our unity is clear our staying 
power is clear and the people around the world friend and foe 
alike know that we are in this 
sen sam nunn who publicly questioned bushs decision to deploy 
another 200000 troops to the gulf agreed the congress should be 
involved here 
if there ever is a casebook example of the constitutional 
power of congress to declare war this is it the georgia 
democrat and chairman of the senate armed services committee said 
on the same program 
before leaving baghdad for morocco iraqs first deputy prime 
minister taha yassin ramadan said he was carrying a letter from 
saddam to the moroccan leader king hassan ii noting the dangers 
facing the arabs by the gulf crisis the official iraqi news 
agency reported 
morocco has contributed 1700 troops to the multinational force 
that has massed in the saudi desert following iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait but the nation has maintained contact with the 
iraqi leadership 
ramadan said baghdad supports any serious arab effort on any 
level that will serve the interests of the arab nation but he 
said arab summits should not be forums at which the american 
pentagons policies are translated into arabic 
he repeated the three conditions iraq has set for attending such 
a meeting that iraq is consulted in advance on the agenda the 
timing and location are chosen so that saddam will be able to 
attend and the agenda also include all middle east issues 
including the palestine question 
saddam has insisted on tying his withdrawal from kuwait to 
israels pulling back from the west bank and gaza strip

a wave of opposition arose today to a proposal 
before us roman catholic bishops that would allow lay people to 
conduct funeral services when clergy arent available 
a succession of disapproving speeches at a meeting of the 
national conference of catholic bishops left the plan in doubt 
bishop elden f curtiss of helena mont said such a step would 
send a wrong signal that the church is moving from an 
ordained to a nonordained ministry 
the time when people most want a priest is when they are 
dying at death and afterward he said 
results of a ballot vote on the measure were to be disclosed in 
late afternoon 
while a big proportion of the floor debate consisted of 
criticism of the proposal several bishops strongly supported it 
archbishop francis t hurley of anchorage alaska where 
extreme distances and extreme weather accent the need for 
lay people conducting funeral rites said 
it would be corporately narrowminded and shortsighted not to 
allow this provision for the pastoral needs of people at one of 
their most poignant moments the time of death 
under present rules ordained ministers are required to preside 
at funeral litugies but a worsening shortage of priests has 
brought requests that the task be opened to lay persons 
of 45 dioceses where there are some sunday services without 
priests a report said 17 have received requests to let lay people 
conduct funerals and 18 see a pastoral need for it 
the proposed change would authorize local bishops to permit it 
if they choose 
however such layled services could not include celebration of 
holy communion for which priests are required 
on the second day of their fourday annual fall meeting the 
bishops also weighed moves to straighten out misimpressions given 
by some bible readings in worship 
rephrasing of both sexually exclusive and politically 
stereotyping connotations were under consideration 
among changes proposed for a new lectionary or cycle of 
liturgical bible readings were these 
replacing brothers with brothers and sisters using 
people instead of the generic man and jewish leaders or 
authorities instead of the blanket perjorative the jews 
archbishop john f whealan of hartford conn a scripture 
scholar said the changes went only so far as the original hebrew 
and greek texts allow 
he said the variations were recommended from usages contained in 
a catholicproduced translation the new american bible 
he noted such changes were included in the recently published 
new revised standard version sponsored by the interdenominational 
national council of churches 
like that version the changes would retain father son 
and holy spirit in describing the trinity the christian view 
of one gods triune nature 
while god is neither male nor female the use of the masculine 
pronoun may sometimes be preferred in order to be faithful to the 
biblical text the proposed document says 
but it emphasized that words such as men sons and 
brethren once understood as inclusive generic terms now often 
are understood as referring only to males 
their use has become ambiguous and is increasingly seen to 
exclude women the paper says stressing that words should not be 
used which deny the common dignity of all the baptized 
after calling on the us to exercise restraint to limit 
civilian casualties in any military operation in the middle east 
the bishops slated more discussion of that issue wednesday 
but this was to be in a closeddoor session as moved by cardinal 
bernard law of boston and approved by a close vote of 126 to 118 
several bishops including two from alaska bishops michael 
kenny of juneau and francis hurley of anchorage urged 
unsuccessfully that the discussion be open to the press and other 
observers 
but the closed session may produce a further public statement 
about the persian gulf situation 
the bishops initial joint assessment came in affirming a letter 
sent last week by archbishop roger mahony of los angeles to us 
secretary of state james baker 
it condemned iraqs aggression and brutal treatment of 
civilians and said there was a clear need to resist it 
but citing the churchs ageold just war theory the bishops 
said any military operation must be in proportion to the evil to 
be overcome and must rule out tactics targeting civilian 
populations 
it thus would have to be a limited war raisingthe price to 
be paid the bishops said urging the us to stay the course 
of persistent peaceful and determined efforts

the supreme court on tuesday rejected the 
appeal of an ohio legislator being sued for libel because he used 
the term mafia in opposing the reelection of an 
italianamerican to the states highest court 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that robert e 
netzley a republican member of the ohio house of representatives 
must defend himself at trial against a lawsuit by james p 
celebrezze the former state court justice 
in a separate case the court also refused to kill a libel 
lawsuit against tom perdue onetime top aide to georgia gov joe 
frank harris 
in that suit state public service commission member j mac 
barber says perdue falsely accused of bribery 
in the ohio case celebrezze was an associate justice of the 
ohio supreme court from january 1983 through december 1984 a 
democrat he was defeated in a 1984 election by republican craig 
wright 
at the time celebrezzes brother frank d celebrezze was 
chief justice of the ohio supreme court his cousin anthony j 
celebrezze jr was the states attorney general anthony 
celebrezze was the unsuccessful democratic candidate for governor 
this month 
netzley chairman of the miami county republican committee 
prepared the campaign pamphlet over which james celebrezze sued 
the pamphlet generally endorsing republican candidates for 
various offices stated its no wonder that some are calling 
ohios justice system the mafia family court take a look frank 
celebrezze chief justice brother jimmy celebrezze associate 
justice cousin tony celebrezze ohio attorney general and frank 
celebrezzes crony angelo gagliardi intimidator in charge of the 
ohio disciplinary council 
in his lawsuit celebrezze contends that no other person had 
ever referred to the ohio supreme court members as a mafia family 
and that netzley knew none of those mentioned in the pamphlet was 
in any way connected with the mafia or organized crime 
a state appeals court ruling that the pamphlet was an 
expression of opinion threw out the suit but the ohio supreme 
court its ranks bolstered by substitute judges who had no conflict 
of interest in the case voted 52 in may to reinstate it 
the state court said the judges denial of the dismissal 
requests could not be appealed until after a trial was conducted 
in the georgia case the states public service commission was 
the target of a bribery investigation in 1984 and 1985 barber was 
never charged with a crime as a result of that investigation but 
others were indicted 
barber resigned from the commission in 1985 but ran in 1986 for 
the seat he had left 18 months earlier he lost to gary andrews 
the man appointed to succeed him 
barber regained a commission seat in elections this month 
during the 1986 campaign perdue sent a letter to about 350 city 
and county officials throughout the state urging them to oppose 
barbers election 
in the letter perdue said a public service commissioner 
betrayed the public trust by accepting what amounted to a 
bribe 
the letter added when confronted with the fact that the 
attorney general and the georgia bureau of investigation had this 
information and were about to seek a felony indictment mac barber 
chose to resign his office rather than face the prospect of 
indictment and conviction the trucking company official who gave 
mac barber the money was convicted and fined a total of 12000 
a state trial judge threw out barbers suit ruling that there 
was no actual malice knowledge or reckless disregard of 
falsity but the georgia court of appeals reinstated the suit by a 
54 vote last year

a teacher built a reputation of 
selflessness and devotion in more than 30 years in this ranching 
region but he also left a legacy of molested male students some 
of whose fathers say he also abused them 
douglas marks 63 is to be sentenced wednesday in this rocky 
mountain community between helena and butte ending a trail of 
crime and government inaction that stretches into the 1950s 
when marks pleaded guilty july 9 to four counts of felony sexual 
assault for molesting four elementary school boys the fathers of 
two of the boys were in the courtroom both men said they too had 
been victims of marks 
a jefferson county sheriffs deputy who received the complaint 
that set off the investigation said he had been a victim 25 years 
earlier 
marks faces up to 20 years on each count 
court records cite 22 molestation accusations dating to 1956 
most too old to prosecute county attorney rich llewellyn says he 
has found 45 victims 
marks was removed from a teaching job in boulder in 1959 after 
three students accused him of molesting them he found another 
teaching job the next year in clancy about 20 miles away then was 
rehired at boulder elementary school in 1965 
in 1984 a young man paul myrhow came forward against marks 
it was more than five years before marks was finally charged and 
all four of the offenses to which marks pleaded guilty occurred 
after myrhows complaint 
many in this ranchingtimbering town of 1400 are quick to 
recount marks decades of generosity two sections of the high 
school were dedicated to him and wall plaques quietly removed 
after his plea extolled his years of service to the 
community 
marks family owns substantial ranch property in the 
helenaboulder area and a lumber mill in clancy a brother robert 
marks was a state legislator from 19691989 speaker of the 
montana house in 198182 and 198788 and republican leader in 
197778 198384 and 198586 
bob laumeyer school superintendent from 1970 to 1987 said 
marks made many donations to the school anonymously by reducing his 
salary several hundred dollars a year 
marks also paid for poor students to take school trips and 
attend basketball camps recalled dick nordon jefferson county 
high schools basketball coach he liked to take students who 
didnt get many other chances to experience these things he 
said 
three victims said that was how marks found the boys he would 
molest 
the school board has set aside 3000 and promised more if 
necessary to provide counseling for any victims who request it it 
also hired investigators to check allegations that some teachers 
and other school officials ignored complaints about marks 
the school board forced marks to take an indefinite leave from 
the high school in december 1959 after three students accused him 
of molesting them he and one of the students were living in a 
former school dormitory for outoftown single teachers 
the boulder board took marks back in 1965 because he was a 
wonderful teacher and highly thought of even though there were 
doubts about his morals said wahle phelen a member of the board 
at the time 
it was 1984 when myrhow told his former boy scout leader deputy 
sheriff daryl craft that he had had a homosexual relationship with 
marks for eight years 
craft told the helena independent record that he too had been 
molsted by marks craft said he took myrhow to sheriff tom dawson 
but nothing happened 
dawson and state investigators have refused to comment 
myrhow now 23 went public this summer after marks pleaded 
guilty 
in june 1989 myrhow turned to phillip pallister a physician 
who had helped force marks out of boulder in 1959 but also had 
helped him keep the job at clancy when some parents protested 
pallister said he had learned more about pedophiles by 1989 
and had discovered that some members of his own family had become 
victims of marks 
pressed by pallister and others county attorney llewellyn 
called in the state attorney generals office but discovered 
months later that nothing had been done he hired his own 
investigator a social worker with experience in childabuse cases 
and filed charges in february

two key republican senators urged president 
bush today to call a special session of congress to approve us 
military action in the persian gulf the white house rejected the 
idea 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said we dont 
think thats necessary there is no war 
neither senate republican leader bob dole nor sen richard lugar 
called for a formal declaration of war against iraqs saddam 
hussein 
but dole said he wants a declaration of support and a 
willingness to commit whatever resources it takes to fulfill the 
mission lugar said he wants authorization for the president to 
act and said he was concerned that otherwise war could break out 
because saddam misunderstood us resolve 
senate majority leader george mitchell declared that bush has no 
authority none whatsoever under the constitution to commit 
us forces to war without prior authorization from congress 
but he also said bush is using the latest troop buildup as a 
threat which does not require congressional approval a special 
session of congress would be justified only if bush makes a 
decision to go to war mitchell said 
obviously no one wishes to conduct a session of congress 
without a clearly defined purpose he said after a closeddoor 
democratic caucus meeting dominated by discussion of the gulf but 
he added that bushs reasons for the new deployment need to be 
better explained 
sen james sasser dtenn said my sense is a special 
session serves no useful purpose without hearing the 
administrations policy we would be debating in a vacuum 
fitzwater said the president believes he has consulted 
sufficiently with members of congress and will continue to do so 
fitzwater also dismissed public opinion polls showing declining 
public support for bushs persian gulf policy saying you cant 
always make policy by the polls 
asked about lugars call for a special session fitzwater said 
the question he raises about a declaration of war is hypothetical 
at this point it presupposes military action a war that we 
hope will not occur 
normally when congress adjourns for the year it can be called 
back into session only by the president however anticipating 
developments in the gulf lawmakers this year gave their own 
leaders authority to call them back in the adjournment resolution 
passed as congress left town on oct 28 
bush announced last week he was ordering a massive buildup of 
forces in the persian gulf to permit offensive operations if 
necessary to force saddams withdrawal from kuwait there are 
currently about 230000 us troops in and around saudi arabia and 
an additional 200000 are expected 
dole in an interview said obtaining congressional support for 
the persian gulf policy should help build a consensus among the 
public for us actions and quiet domestic critics of bushs 
continued deployment of troops 
i think it ought to be put up to the congress put up or shut 
up and if they say no well then they say no and then the 
president has to decide whether to go it alone the kansas 
republican said 
lugar rind former chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee told reporters earlier 
i am convinced that so long as saddam hussein and the rest 
of the world has any doubt about the unified resolve of the united 
states in this matter the chances for miscalculation and tragic 
mistakes loom much too large 
i think the president must lay out now to the nation and the 
congress specifically what our aims are he said 
lugar said he purposely had avoided using the phrase 
declaration of war or mentioning the 1973 war powers act asked 
whether reporters could accurately portray him as wanting a 
declaration of war without calling it that lugar replied that 
is correct 
what we really want is authorization for the president to 
act he said lugar said his worst fear is that war could break 
out because saddam misunderstands the us resolve 
lugar said he is concerned there has been an erosion around 
the edges among allies for support of us policy in the gulf 
while he finds no erosion of support among his constituents 
lugar said there is a desire to know where we are there they 
almost are left to their imaginations 
after spelling out us goals lugar said bush must call for 
a session of the congress and set a date for the return of the 
congress to debate these issues and vote affirmatively i would 
presume so that we have authorization for what is required 
lugar said on nbcs today show 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee agreed that the congress should be involved here 
bush has made a fundamental change in policy in ordering the 
additional troops to the persian gulf nunn said on the same 
program he now is giving the military the role of liberating the 
country of kuwait 
if there ever is a casebook example of the constitutional 
power of congress to declare war this is it nunn said 
the war powers act requires presidential consultation with 
congress and puts limits on troop deployments without direct 
congressional authorization if troops are fighting or under 
imminent threat of hostilities 
also today defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff briefed nunn and sen 
john warner of virginia ranking republican on the armed services 
committee 
nunn said after the closeddoor capitol hill session that the 
lawmakers went through a list of country after country in the 
coalition against iraq and questioned each ones level of 
involvement 
members of congress have wondered why egypt which promised to 
deploy a second military division this past summer has not done so 
and why only a limited number of kuwaiti forces are involved

senate democrats elected majority leader 
george mitchell to a second term today while wendell ford was 
chosen unanimously for the no 2 job in the democratic leadership 
ranks 
mitchell of maine had no oppositio among the senates 56 
democrats ford was chosen assistant majority leader after sen 
david pryor of arkansas who had considered challenging him 
abandoned that plan and was reelected as secretary to the 
democratic conference 
ford of kentucky will replace alan cranston of california who 
earlier said he would not seek reelection to the senate in 1992 
on the other side of the aisle sen thad cochran of mississippi 
was mounting a challenge against sen john chafee of rhode island 
the incumbent chairman of the senate republican conference the no 
3 gop job 
like mitchell republican leader bob dole of kansas had no 
opposition for reelection republicans were caucusing later in the 
day to select their leadership team 
in addition to the reelection of mitchell and pryor and the 
elevation of ford to the leadership job the democrats also 
reelected sen alan dixon of illinois as chief deputy whip and 
thomas daschle of south dakota as chairman of the democratic policy 
committee they also elected sen charles robb of virginia to head 
democratic senatorial campaign committee all votes were unanimous 
mitchell said democrats now hold 56 of the 100 senate seats 
mitchell described ford as a close friend and the new no 2 
leader told reporters he would work closely with the maine 
democrat noting that 1992 will be a critical election year as 
we all know 
ford 62 who is up for reelection in 1992 has been serving as 
chairman of the senate rules committee he has long coveted the job 
that cranston is vacating cranston in announcing last week that 
he would not run for reelection to the senate said he was 
suffering from prostate cancer and would relinquish his leadership 
post 
ford is more conservative than cranston and consumer activist 
ralph nader said that means liberals will have to fight harder to 
push their agenda in the senate 
hes protobacco pronuclear lukewarm on consumers and not 
very good on the environment nader said of ford he said the 
election of party leaders is crucial because you get a guy up 
high in the leadership and its very important during those crunch 
times at the end of a session as to whether you can get legislation 
out 
cochran would present a more conservative image in the no 3 
senate republican job he was rated 94 out of 100 by the american 
conservative union in a ranking of senators on several key votes 
through last august compared with chafees 38 rating 
bob billings executive director of the acu said he thought 
cochran would be a little more aggressive than chafee in 
looking out for conservative interests in the senate 
cochran was reelected to his third term in the senate last week 
after having served in the house from 197378 his effort to win a 
leadership position comes amid mounting conservative worries about 
the loss of sens james mcclure william armstrong and gordon 
humphrey three conservative republicans who did not seek 
reelection 
i think chafee has been somebody that the conservatives have 
tolerated for a long period of time said republican political 
consultant tom edmonds i think conservatives have been on hold 
for the last two years to wait and see what kind of leadership was 
coming out of the white house 
but stuart rothenberg editor of the political report a 
newsletter said he wasnt sure whether the contest for the no 3 
gop leadership post was about ideology 
a lot of this has to do with personal campaigning for 
leadership office he said it says more about the 
discussions republicans have among one another id have trouble 
portraying it as merely a rightvsleft struggle for the heart of 
the party

president bush who has attacked the 
democraticcontrolled congress as soft on crime will sign the 
anticrime bill lawmakers sent to him the white house said 
tuesday 
bush in recent campaign speeches to bolster republican 
candidates often accused the democrats of choking his 
anticrime package 
but his press secretary marlin fitzwater said the president 
would sign the congressional version a strippeddown package that 
avoided fights over such contentious issues as the death penalty 
and a ban on assault weapons 
we think it should have gone further fitzwater said they 
left out some key provisions that we though should have been 
included 
the house and senate cut major provisions from the legislation 
that bush had sought as a way of making the measure more 
acceptable that included a provision to permit use of the death 
penalty for new categories of federal crimes 
the bill toughens penalties for certain whitecollar crimes 
including a possible life prison term in some cases involving fraud 
by savings and loan officials 
it also increases penalties for offenses committed against 
children and for the first time makes possession of child 
pornography a federal offense

the government effort to reunite beirut 
has kindled hope and skepticism about peace prospects in lebanon 
after 15 years of civil war 
optimists contend the new attempt is the first since the war 
started in 1975 to be part of a comprehensive peace accord 
sponsored by the arab league and backed by the un security 
council 
never before has there been such an international consensus to 
resolve the lebanese conflict said christian warlord elie 
hobeika 
the syrian army is dead serious this time to help lebanese 
troops smother any defiance by any militia said hobeika a 
staunch ally of syria 
pessimists argue the two previous bids to unite beirut collapsed 
in renewed warfare despite the presence of the syrian army in 1976 
and an international peacekeeping force in 1984 
we hope it will work this time but frankly what guarantees do 
we really have that history wont repeat itself said a 
commentary broadcast by beiruts voice of the people radio station 
president elias hrawis government has given the eight major 
moslem and christian militias 10 days beginning last saturday to 
evacuate beirut and its suburbs with their weapons 
all militia commands have publicly pledged to meet the monday 
deadline hrawis troops then are scheduled to conduct a 
housetohouse search for weapons that might have been left in 
secret hideouts 
the militia pullout is a key element in the peace plan which 
was brokered by the arab league and approved by the lebanese 
parliament in a session held in the saudi town of taif in september 
1988 
the plan provides for creating a militiafree greater beirut 
as a first step toward restoring government authority over all 
lebanons territory 
it also gives the moslem majority of 55 percent an equal share 
of power with the christians who dominated the government army 
parliament and judiciary since lebanon gained independence from 
france in 1943 
despite the militia pullout hrawi faces the tough task of 
getting the private armies to disarm also sectarian suspicions 
run deep and not all the warlords are happy about the even 
distribution of power 
the 200000strong druse moslems for instance fear the larger 
sects like the 12 millionstrong shiites the shiites insist that 
as the biggest sect in lebanon they should have a share of power 
befitting their numbers rather than be treated the same as other 
sects 
many among the maronite catholics the main christian sect 
deeply resent the syrians and their allies 
the peace accord stalled but it was revitalized when the syrian 
army teamed up with hrawis troops to crush christian gen michel 
aouns mutiny in lebanons christian heartland oct 13 
the syrian army entered lebanon as peace enforcers in july 1976 
at the request of christian leaders who were losing the war to the 
moslems and their palestinian guerrilla allies 
the arab league later mandated syrias intervention stating 
that it had prevented the emergence of a plocontrolled government 
in lebanon that would have provoked israel to attack its northern 
neighbor 
the syrians then dismantled the green line that had split beirut 
into moslem and christian sectors 
all militias were disbanded and there were muchpublicized raids 
on their arms hideouts newspaper pictures showed senior syrian 
officers alongside heaps of confiscated weapons 
beiruts honeymoon lasted 26 months the christians resenting 
the syrians highhandedness in their neighborhoods took up arms 
to drive them out 
when the syrians withdrew from the christian zone in september 
1978 after a 100day war the green line was restored and christian 
and moslem militias were again at each others throats 
new alliances were forged rightwing christians struggling to 
maintain their western ties aligned themselves with israel 
leftleaning moslems and palestinians fighting for an arab 
identity sided with syria 
the israeli army invaded lebanon in june 1982 to rout yasser 
arafats guerrillas from their main middle east power base 
in august that year israelibacked christian militia chieftain 
bashir gemayel was elected president of lebanon only to be killed 
in a bomb blast three weeks later 
his vengeful militiamen infiltrated beiruts sabra and chatilla 
palestinian refugee camps which were surrounded by invading 
israeli troops and massacred hundreds 
outrage over the atrocities prompted the west to dispatch a 
multinational force of us marines french foreign legionnaires 
italian bersaglieri soldiers and british paratroopers to keep peace 
in beirut 
in december 1982 beiruts demarcation line was again dismantled 
by the western peacekeepers and the city was reunited anew 
the 5800strong western force angered the moslems by helping 
the mainly christian lebanese army establish control in their zone 
of the capital 
on april 15 1983 a suicide bomber drove an explosivespacked 
van into the us embassy compound in moslem west beirut and 
detonated it killing more than 60 people including 17 americans 
on oct 23 the same year the us marine base at beirut airport 
and the french legionnaires headquarters in the city were 
simultaneously truckbombed killing 241 american servicemen and 59 
frenchmen 
the attacks were the beginning of proiranian shiite moslem 
terror waves of gunpoint kidnappings followed driving most 
westerners and their embassies out of beiruts moslem sector 
on feb 6 1984 moslem militiamen again took to the streets and 
drove the mainly christian army under former president amin gemayel 
out of the moslem sector 
the multinational force fled ending a 17month unification 
experiment the green line was reestablished until hrawis 
government dismantled it again last month 
i think its more than a prolonged truce but probably not a 
lasting peace this time i dare not be that optimistic said 
gamil kassem a moslem pharmacist

said laughing 
arroyos said he applied for the job when he graduated from 
angelo state college 
i got hired as a mail opener and page counter he said 
whenever anyone needs copies of cases on file the agency has 
to print up the copies my job was to count the number of pages 
reproduced and then submit the bill 
he said he counted so many pages he thought there has to be a 
better way of doing this 
after checking several copier services arroyos discovered a 6 
page counter that attaches to most copying machines 
was he afraid he would lose his job 
the thought did briefly cross my mind he said but then i 
thought that if the state saw me as an individual who cared enough 
about the taxpayers to suggest eliminating his own job then there 
might be room for me elsewhere 
arroyos was assigned to other duties at the agency before he 
resigned to take a job as a probation officer

natos supreme allied commander in europe praised 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on tuesday as a courageous 
man of vision but said he still had some concerns about soviet 
military might 
us gen john r galvin told a news conference he was 
optimistic gorbachevs reforms would succeed and said he received 
indications soviet military production was easing 
both galvin and norwegian gen vigleik eide chairman of natos 
military committee said they were confident a treaty reducing 
conventional forces in europe would be signed in paris later this 
month and that it would form the basis for further cuts 
galvin said after meeting gorbachev on tuesday i came away 
from that feeling that i had seen a man of courage and a man of 
vision 
there is no doubt that the road ahead for the soviet union is 
rocky and difficult but i personally think for what thats worth 
that its the right road galvin said im upbeat im 
optimistic 
galvin and eide arrived in the soviet union on sunday guests of 
defense minister dmitri yazov it was the first such visit by 
highranking military officials of the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
our presence here must be seen as a clear demonstration of the 
changing times eide said he said the two generals had very 
open and productive conversations with their soviet counterparts 
eide refused to comment on reports of a lastminute hitch in 
negotiations for the conventional forces treaty scheduled to be 
signed by 22 nations on nov 19 
we know that there have been some lastminute negotiations 
he said that is normal and that should be expected i am 
confident and i also sense the feeling here that we will have a 
conventional forces agreement signed in a few days time 
galvin asked whether soviet tanks and other heavy arms have 
been moved east across the ural mountains out of reach of the 
european treaty said he was concerned about such reports but not 
sufficiently to raise enough flags to scuttle the treaty 
i have been provided with some interesting and in my view 
partially satisfying answers he said 
galvin also said he received indications from soviet 
officials that production of military equipment was decreasing 
i see some important changes here in terms of the possible 
turndown of production and i think it is whats going to happen 
he said 
i think there will still be enough production in the soviet 
union to provide for a highquality force i am concerned with 
the overall size even after the agreement 
eide said there was broad eastwest agreement to resume 
conventional arms control talks in vienna after the conventional 
forces treaty was signed aimed at deeper cuts in the present 
equipment categories maybe identifying other categories and also 
the question of manpower 
the treaty would limit the number of tanks artillery pieces 
armored combat vehicles aircraft and helicopters that nato and the 
warsaw pact could maintain in europe

the secretary of energy has the authority to 
operate new yorks inactive shoreham nuclear power plant in the 
event of an energy emergency the department contends in a brief 
filed with the nuclear regulatory commission 
the doe gave no indication that it intended to try to employ 
this authority the department did not immediately return a phone 
call tuesday seeking comment 
obviously the use of this authority is one of the options 
available to the secretary depending on the course of events both 
in the middle east and in this country as those events affect the 
local regional or national energy supply and security doe said 
in a brief filed nov 9 
its definition of energy emergency included sudden increases 
in consumer demand and inability to obtain adequate amounts of 
fuel 
joseph mcdonnell a spokesman for the long island lighting co 
which built shoreham said tuesday it was highly debatable 
whether the federal government has the authority to order the 
operation of the shoreham plant 
the statutes the doe has cited never contemplated a situation 
where a state government had decided to close the plant down 
mcdonnell said from hicksville ny 
lilco has agreed never to operate shoreham and to sell the plant 
for a symbolic 1 to new york state the state plans to 
decommission the plant and find some means to replace the 800 
megawatts of energy shoreham could have generated the deal capped 
years of bitter debate before the nrc 
but after george bush was elected president the energy 
department began a public relations campaign to stop shorehams 
decommissioning energy secretary james watkins asked that shoreham 
be kept intact and ready to operate on the assumption that public 
opinion would eventually turn in favor of the plant

students teachers and administrators they 
say it over and over again they write it they shout it 
dartmouth college is not the dartmouth review 
for 10 years dartmouth college has been portrayed as a theater 
of war a battlefield of racism sexism and political intrigue 
all reflected in the activities of the obstreperous rightwing 
review 
the review has dominated national news coverage of dartmouth 
but interviews with faculty members and a broad spectrum of 
students indicate that they believe their school has been shown in 
a false light 
my experience has been that there is no one here that is 
overtly prejudiced that is overtly racist that is overtly 
sexist says junior mindy waterhouse a founder of a campus 
womens group and an intern at a collegerun clearinghouse on 
womens lifestyle issues 
the review a studentrun publication unaffiliated with the ivy 
league college is nothing if not overt 
on martin luther king jrs birthday in 1986 review staff 
members used sledgehammers to tear down shanties erected on the 
campus green by apartheid protesters in august music professor 
william cole who is black resigned citing the strain of years of 
review attacks 
the publicity has taken its toll alfred quirk admissions and 
financial aid dean says black enrollment is down a bit this year 
from 6 percent to 5 percent of the incoming class of 1067 he 
blames the review contretemps 
in september a quote from adolf hitlers mein kampf was 
inserted in the masthead of the review edition circulated on the 
jewish holy day yom kippur the review blames a saboteur and has 
hanover police investigating 
whatever the source it was a campus call to arms 
administrators and students denounced the review and 2500 people 
rallied 
i was heartened beyond words at the warm loving response of 
dartmouth students said senior allen drexel chairman of the 
dartmouth area gay and lesbian organization 
i think that dartmouth students who have gone silent for a 
long time with regard to the reviews attacks on vulnerable social 
groups were able to collectively absolve themselves of past 
neglect 
apathy or fear of disrupting the status quo not pervasive 
bigotry is to blame for the atmosphere in which the review has 
flourished drexel said 
i would say dartmouth students rather than being conservative 
in any partisan sense are conservative in the sense of 
reluctance to rock the boat drexel said in a system that 
seems to work for them why even think about changing things 
the review also flourishes because of support from prominent 
conservatives like columnist pat buchanan and former treasury 
secretary william simon who has written that college 
administrators are persecuting the paper and its staff 
conservative alumni also contribute funds to the review some 
see it as a hedge against liberal forces that have forced the 
rewording of the alma mater men of dartmouth and the 
abandonment of the school mascot an indian 
our perception of tradition today is different from what 
tradition was in the past said student brian pierce now we 
have women on campus now we have native americans who are against 
having the symbol because its offensive to them 
tradition should be kept if it enhances the dartmouth 
experience now but if it detracts from it theres no point in 
clinging to tradition 
dartmouths defenders do not deny that prejudice exists on 
campus 
i would say that dartmouth is a frightening place to be gay to 
the same extent that the country is a frightening place drexel 
said the institution isnt perfect i think everybody will 
freely admit that 
trecia canty a senior and president of the afroamerican 
society said she has at times felt distinctly uncomfortable as 
a black student 
she said the reviews attacks on music professor cole in her 
freshman year made the whole black community feel under fire 
at the time i perceived it as moving from his credibility 
and qualifications as a professor being questioned to all the 
qualifications of all africanamericans faculty and students 
alike being questioned she said 
but canty considers the occasional insensitive comment made 
in her presence more the result of ignorance than actual 
intent to be hurtful 
and blacks like english professor william cook credit dartmouth 
with fighting intolerance especially under college president james 
o freedman 
cook attributed dartmouths problems at least partly to its 
location in a small town on the border between two predominantly 
white states vermont and new hampshire 
what happens on this campus with respect to race is more 
important because there is no larger black community he said 
thats why were getting all the attention the same things 
happen on other campuses 
the ultimate question for female minority and gay students and 
faculty members is whether they would recommend dartmouth to others 
like themselves 
i definitely would cook said we need that critical mass 
of people to constitute a community 
drexel said that while he is glad he came to dartmouth it was 
hard 
in retrospect i know my college experience at a place like 
yale or harvard or another urban institution would have been a lot 
less challenging as regards to my orientation he said 
however the challenges of coming to grips with my identity at 
dartmouth have without question made me a stronger person

in this city where favorable laws lawyers 
and cooperative doctors can make insurance fraud a popular sport 
douglas collins story is typical to a point 
on jan 20 1984 collins crawled up the steps of his south 
philadelphia home in obvious pain he told his wife he had been 
hurt as he pushed a womans car out of the snow and wooden blocks 
under the tires shot out and hit him 
that part was true doctors treated him for fractures in his 
neck and legs and gave him a neck collar and crutches 
the next day collins left the crutches and collar at home got 
on a bus and at one of the stops threw himself out the door at 
the hospital he laughed as he told his wife he was a good 
actor she later recalled 
he sued the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority 
which agreed to a 25000 settlement 
then his wife by now estranged called septa with the real 
story 
last month collins was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison 
a kind of poster child for septas fullcourt press against 
fraud 
they think they can make a living this way everyone the 
claimant the doctors the lawyers everyone said eileen katz 
deputy counsel for septa and the culture the fabric and makeup 
of philadelphia supports it 
septa which runs the citys trains buses and trolleys charges 
a base fare of 150 highest in the country 
it paid 47 million in claims in fiscal 1990 or 177 percent of 
the amount collected in fares a percentage well above other 
bigcity rates 
we are if not the worst area one of the worst in the 
country for insurance fraud said james kilcur septas chief 
counsel 
pennsylvania law puts few obstacles in the way of someone who 
wants to make a claim and all claims under 25000 go before an 
arbitration panel within eight months 
its a good system for moving cases but its also a system 
that makes it easy for the people who make claims kilcur said 
we also have a lot of lawyers who do this kind of work here and 
we have a lot of doctors who treat these people and physical 
therapists and psychiatrists 
it gets a life of its own after a while he said everyone 
is making money in the system here and in septas case were an 
easy target 
so septa is fighting back 
earlier this month septa won a state supreme court case 
challenging a state law that limits liability to 250000 per 
person or 1 million per accident 
guess whos stealing part of your fare asks one of the 
billboards erected as part of the agencys antifraud campaign 
started in 1989 it shows a man in a neck brace carrying a sack of 
money file a false claim and you could go to jail says 
another 
the campaign includes radio spots and cards in buses and subway 
cars the ads also run in publications read by doctors and lawyers 
the authority has built an elaborate system to ferret out 
fraud a line has been set up for phone tips computers check for 
repeat claimants and video surveillance is used to see if alleged 
victims are really injured 
septa tells its investigators to look for telltale signs of 
fraud a bus or train crash that makes the news usually means a 
rush of shaky claims unemployed men between 22 and 35 are most 
likely to file false claims 
someone who is vague or wrong on details like the woman who 
had a train going the wrong way is eyed suspiciously in one 
case when a car crashed into a bus with no passengers 11 people 
filed suit claiming injury 
after an accident septa sends its investigators out quickly to 
record the names of the injured a subway crash in april that 
killed four has attracted 278 claims far more than the number of 
people septa says were on board some of the claims were filed 
about five months after the crash 
youd think people would have realized by now if they were on 
the train and were injured kilcur said 
about 40 percent of all claims are closed without payment 
septa says new claims dropped from 13005 in fiscal 1989 to 
10355 in fiscal 1990 eight people have been convicted of fraud in 
the last two years most got fines and probation though a doctor 
who submitted fake medical reports was sentenced to prison 
its pretty early on in the game but the campaign is pretty 
active and we are seeing a noticeable decrease in claims katz 
said 
edward s chacker a lawyer and vice president of the 
philadelphia trial lawyers association insists the vast majority 
of claims are legitimate 
no one wants bad claims lawyers doctors or septa chacker 
said 
chacker and katz said septa and the association are working 
together to fight bad claims septa says it will establish a phone 
line for instance so lawyers can call to see if a client is 
listed by septa as having been on a certain bus or train 
trial lawyers are trying to work it out trying to get rid of 
the trash chacker said

today is wednesday nov 14 1990 a day that 
with luck may slip through the clutches of instant recall a 
syndicated halfhour of television history 
that oxymoron aside nothing much happens in todays show 
despite the flashy neonized set and lots of sleek zoomy graphics 
that include a chrome octahedron with the shows logo 
zoomy graphics do not a documentary make instant replay is 
an attempt to evoke our memories of the recent past with video 
footage from critical moments in our recent history 
it tries to give us that by installing solid trusted newsreader 
john palmer formerly news anchor of the today show as anchor 
and sometime interviewer of the show 
the pace is blistering 
todays show opens with a look back at feb 12 1955 why feb 
12 1955 you say 
because thats the night james dean returned to his hometown of 
fairmont ind after the premiere of east of eden the only 
one of the actors movies to be released while he was alive seven 
months later he was dead 
theres an interview with deans college roommate an interview 
with deans high school drama teacher and martin landau talks 
about his old buddy 
and there are lots of still pictures of dean in fairmont ind 
yes but what happened on feb 12 1955 
oh well nothing really it was a publicity stunt dean went 
to a high school gathering and showed off for his old classmates 
end of story end of segment 
if youre not already stunned by the profligate waste of a good 
topic then youll be anguished and appalled by the next segment 
which revisits oct 6 1981 and the assassination of egyptian 
president anwar sadat by moslem extremists 
not even palmer can emerge unscathed from this line that the 
writers foist upon him 
the middle east the cradle of civilization is still nursing 
ancient hatreds that haunt us to this day 
whew 
that would be almost forgivable if the producers fulfilled the 
premise of syndicated reality programs go for the viewers hot 
buttons 
palmer does a nice quiet interview with sadats widow jihan 
who has become famous in her own right as a lecturer and teacher 
who obtained a muchpublicized 200000 teaching stint at the 
university of south carolina 
she relives the day of her husbands assassination which was 
televised to the world her composure is admirable but the 
videotape does little to relive the horror we experienced on that 
day 
video footage and still pictures for some reason excised from 
the instant recall version showed sadats submachine gun 
killers at pointblank range spraying the reviewing stand where he 
lay dead or dying 
it was a singular image of fanatic brutal ferocity that would 
help to explain the depth of those ancient hatreds or 
titillate a syndication audience nine years later and yet 
inaccountably it is missing 
the final segment on instant recall takes us to detroit in 
1964 for the disintegration of the supremes of course you 
remember where you were a time that will live in infamy 
and it closes with a still picture and passing mention that four 
years ago today nov 14 1986 inside trader ivan boesky was fined 
100 million for his transgressions there is no footage no 
followup its just there 
instant recal not made by wicked people with evil 
motives nevertheless it is an insidious program 
it seems to include only the memories of anyone born after 1950 
perhaps because older tv recordings dont have the video quality 
needed to support the show 
television is great for events but it doesnt lend itself to 
history it gives us a single perspective or a series of single 
perspectives onto an event 
history is the weaving together of multiple viewpoints into a 
coherent account of what was instant recall is an incoherent 
mess 
if instant recall had the intellectual wherewithal to stick 
with one subject and cover it in detail it might be worth 
watching as it is todays show concludes with the no 1 hit of 
nov 14 1986 and a crushing irony 
it was robert palmer singing i didnt mean to turn you on 
 
elsewhere in television 
i didnt mean to turn you on george burns the oscar and emmy 
awardwinning actor and show business classiest survivor plans to 
celebrate his 95th birthday with a cbs special george burns 
95th birthday party is scheduled for taping jan 6 at cbs

good evening class welcome to understanding 
twin peaks a onenight course weve giving because the 
instructor of the usual class has croaked 
if memory serves his class is about tv criticism and is called 
depth perception is a myth 
anyhow that fits right into tonights class because theyve 
asked me to bring you up to speed on the latest developments in 
twin peaks 
whats twin peaks well miss its a surreal and even 
unconventional abc series by david lynch and mark frost 
who is david lynch good question sir can i get back to you on 
that 
now just for the record how many people in this class have 
seen twin peaks thank you sir uhhh sir please dont eat 
your donut in class 
in case the rest of you havent seen twin peaks its set in 
a pacific northwest logging town there a high school homecoming 
queen has been murdered her name is laura palmer 
whats that sir you say the series is more than just a series 
you say its richly textured riveting television a uniquely 
nonlinear lynchian vision of the dark underbelly of americana 
well i guess so but youve got to remember im just subbing 
for the teacher who croaked and to tell the truth i dont watch 
twin peaks much sure wish they gave me some cliff notes on it 
anyhow as i understand it twin peaks is the sort of show 
where a giant pops up now and then and says things like the owl 
has to go to the bathroom 
or maybe its the log lady who carries around a log as i 
understand it she is a cousin of zamfir the wood flute guy she 
plays the log and just cut a cd called log lady plays what now 
my love just for you 
occasionally a white horse shows up and hangs around the living 
room or so im told and then there is a sheriff harry s truman 
who is no relation to former president dwight d eisenhower 
but the sheriff is adopted or so im told 
anyhow i tuned in twin peaks last saturday night because 
abc said the show would reveal who killed laura palmer theyd 
promised this twice before but they couldnt get david lynch to 
write it 
well class the show opened with a bunch of navy guys bouncing 
rubber balls in a lodge then a bearded guy in the lodge had a 
seizure then someone was found hanging from a rope he killed 
himself 
apparently the poor guy couldnt figure out twin peaks 
after that a guy named leo in a wheelchair sort of burped he 
also drooled and said new shoes 
i am not sure what happened next there was a blinding flash of 
light and and a tall gaunt man appeared and said in this big 
booming voice i am pretentious 
the vision continued an owl appeared and said the log lady 
is all bark and no oh never mind then came andy a 
sheriffs deputy he began crying and saying im stuck in a dumb 
series 
and then laura palmer herself appeared 
its not clear who killed me she said 
then class the vision faded to black when i came to the real 
show was over 
so to prepare for tonights course i called abc and said id 
had a vision during last saturdays twin peaks and somehow 
missed the part where they revealed the killer of laura palmer 
i asked if they could tell me who killed her 
they told me they werent releasing that information until last 
saturdays show was over they said they didnt really know when it 
would end 
i forget who was speaking but i could have sworn she also said 
get a log 
 
elsewhere in television

times of cbs founder william s paley who died last month at the

glory a new biography of paley and marks the second time that

americans really are up to their necks in debt 
and more people than ever before are sinking even deeper toward 
financial suffocation and bankruptcy 
americans owe money to banks finance companies credit unions 
pension funds retailers gasoline companies foreigners they owe 
on cars homes farms and their very lives the latter by borrowing 
on insurance policies 
they even owe money to future generations by allowing government 
to run up debts they can never repay and that will be passed on to 
those not yet born sadly much of the money was for frivolous 
rather than meaningful items 
americans owe money personally and institutionally the former 
through such means as credit cards and the latter through debts run 
up by federal state and local governments and by companies in 
which they hold stocks or bonds 
it is a crush of bad loans to third world countries real 
estate developers and bigtime thieves that underlies the demise 
of financial institutions such as commercial banks savings banks 
and thrifts 
it is this debt in all its forms that compels those who peek 
into the economys future to turn their heads instead it is what 
forces economists seeking a way out to give up and hope instead 
that we can muddle through debt is the economys biggest burden as 
it tries to ascend from recession 
home mortgages insured or guaranteed by the federal housing 
administration and the veterans administration now total about 60 
billion commercial bank credit is more than 26 trillion 
while much of that debt is very sound used to finance housing 
and profitable commercial enterprises an unknown percentage wont 
be repaid and that means everyone will pay in higher borrowing 
rates or perhaps in higher taxes or in even more government debt 
there also is more than 700 billion of consumer installment 
credit on the books and a good deal of that also wont be repaid 
professor robert johnson director of purdue universitys credit 
research center says the number of people filing for personal 
bankruptcy in fiscal year 1989 was 35 times the number recorded a 
decade ago 
he estimates net bankruptcy losses on consumer installment 
credit for 1989 were 14 billion with 430 million of it for visa 
and mastercard alone these amounts he points out do not include 
debts that would have been written off anyway as uncollectable the 
amounts reflect bankruptcy losses alone 
rather than believing americans simply went mad over the past 
decade or so credit analysts try to explain the phenomenon in 
terms of americans succumbing to bait lenders and regulators 
lowered lending standards 
perhaps american adults remember the old standards those of the 
1970s when borrowers approached lenders as they would a federal 
judge knowing they would be grilled about the purpose for which 
the money was sought 
under the newer standards borrowers simply stayed home and 
waited for the lenders to seek them out not only did the lenders 
find them but they offered a credit card with thousands of dollars 
in credit 
something of the sort occurred in commercial banking with 
lenders seeking to press money into the hands of real estate 
developers in 1984 real estate loans as a percentage of total 
loans and leases was 25 percent recently the percentage was more 
than 37 percent much of the money wont be recovered of course 
lax regulation by federal and state officials receives a great 
deal of the blame especially in commercial lending but johnson 
believes there is a more fundamental issue involved in the consumer 
debt 
it is education or the lack of it most consumers receive no 
education in personal financial planning in high school he says 
we spend far more money teaching them to drive cars that they 
dont know how to finance

as a child josef dundr would 
stroll with his father past the snug three ostriches inn a 
buffcolored 17thcentury building that had belonged to the family 
until the communists came 
my father would say this used to be ours maybe it will be 
again some day said dundr who was born there 44 years ago i 
didnt see that day coming i was so downtrodden by that time 
the communists no longer run czechoslovakia and the day may come 
after all 
on dec 1 the government will start selling or giving back to 
private owners 100000 restaurants small shops and other 
businesses the return of many factories and other large 
enterprises will begin next year 
in the new nofrills capitalism of czechoslovkia however 
individuals may lose out to economic expedience they risk losing 
their jobs as well as the chance of ownership but the winners can 
get rich 
officials cite the soviet unions many false starts in their 
argument against moving slowly all east european countries have 
lost time since their communist regimes fell last year but 
czechoslovakia now may be poised to outpace the others 
for people with money the switch to private enterprise is a 
golden opportunity not to be repeated in this century said 
miroslav zamecnik spokesman for finance minister vaclav klaus 
there are few guarantees in the new system 
dundr may not get the three ostriches back alena kubistova is 
not sure she will have a job when a private owner takes over the 
meat market she manages just off wenceslas square 
down the street ctirad fuchs 30 looks for a compromise 
between his wish to own the music and book store he manages and the 
interests of the buildings new owner 
president vaclav havel has warned that failure to protect such 
people as fuchs and the others could lead to unrest but appears to 
have yielded to klauss desire for quick reform 
when parliament approved the privatization law oct 25 the 
finance minister acknowledged it would not satisfy all 
completely 
dundr now assistant manager of the jointventure palace hotel 
considers the three ostriches a sure moneymaker it nestles at the 
foot of the charles bridge on the royal route to prague castle and 
enjoyed a good reputation even under state ownership 
he estimated its worth at 25 million to 70 million crowns or 
from 1 million to nearly 3 million 
emotion is deeply involved in the desire to get the inn back 
dundr said his father now 81 wants to feel that he can pass 
this on to his children and grandchildren 
his likely rival for the three ostriches is the man who runs the 
restaurant and the 18room hotel the state made from the family 
apartments above it dundr fears the managers connections in the 
bureaucracy give him an edge 
in a case like this millions are involved he said 
stamps can be issued documents can be signed 
if he gets the inn back dundr said he will fire the manager 
and staff of about 20 for inefficiency and rudeness 
zamecnik the finance ministry spokesman sees nothing wrong 
with such action the sooner they kick these people out the 
better he said 
under the privatization law property must be returned to former 
owners or their heirs or be auctioned local governments will set 
bid prices and any small business can be bought for a minimum of 
half the asking price 
even before the law was approved managers of staterun stores 
held brief strikes to express concern that czechoslovaks who got 
rich on the black market or through past communist party 
connections would have an advantage 
according to zamecnik the government will not examine buyers 
too closely because a quick change to private enterprise offers a 
way to put illgotten wealth back into legal circulation 
dundrs position is that the three ostriches should be returned 
to the family rather than auctioned it falls into a gray area 
however 
the family acquired the restaurant in about 1930 and was 
nationalized after communists took power in 1948 the dundrs kept 
the building until 1962 then turned it over as a cultural monument 
they could not afford to preserve 
to protect consumers the law requires that any shop going 
private must continue selling the same goods for one year but 
privatization is much farther along than efforts to cushion its 
effects 
there are no requirements for private owners to retain current 
employees or even to pay a minimum wage 
ms kubistova like most working czechoslovaks has no 
experience of market economics she was 3 years old when the 
communists took over 
after her first talk with the new owner of the meat market she 
said she is about 80 percent sure he will keep her on as manager 
at least for now 
her current salary of about 110 a month is above the national 
average but she said more important than pay is whether you will 
have a job 
fuchs would like to reach an agreement to own his music and book 
store and perhaps others of the approximately 100 in prague 
the store manager said he should have the chance not by right 
but because prague needs such stores managed by competent people 
culture as a commodity will not be very attractive when the 
price of paper and food go up he said wryly

law enforcement officials say 
violent crime is on the rise in some of europes traditionally 
lawabiding nations critics accuse them of stirring up fear to get 
bigger budgets 
the average homicide rate in europe remains only about onefifth 
that of the united states which has approximately nine homicides 
per 100000 people each year according to the un world health 
organization in geneva 
homicide rates for the netherlands and switzerland rose 20 
percent and 13 percent respectively in 1989 according to police 
figures 
norway reported a 29 percent rise in violent crime from 1986 
through 1988 and italian homicides increased by 35 percent last 
year mostly in mafia regions 
rape and theft skyrocketed last year in eastern europe 
accompaniments to economic instability and a deepseated mistrust 
of police under the former communist regimes 
in denmark france and portugal however the low homicide rates 
have hardly changed in recent years significant declines have been 
recorded in britain germany and belgium 
our whole society is getting more aggressive said 
commissioner herman bergsma of the central police intelligence 
service in holland what used to end up in fistfights now ends up 
in gunfights 
the number of assaults with firearms in the netherlands nearly 
doubled from 134 in 1985 to 245 last year mainly because of 
killings by drug traffickers bergsma said 
according to who statistics the homicide rate in this nation of 
149 million people had been one of the worlds lowest just above 
britain and ireland 
herman franke a criminologist at the university of amsterdam 
believes police are classifying more crime as violent to support 
requests for larger budgets and more officers 
crime statistics are highly political he said theyre 
used to influence public opinion in every country 
in the norwegian parliamentary elections the conservative party 
of progress went from 2 of the 165 seats to 22 on a wave of public 
anxiety that followed reports of the 29 percent growth in violent 
crime 
violent crime is not increasing franke said only our 
sensitivity to it 
nils christie a university of oslo criminology professor said 
our biggest crime problem is the unfounded anxiety people feel 
although the murder rate in neighboring sweden has barely 
changed in years tighter gun laws are to take effect in 1991 
total crimes reported in poland rose from 137000 in 1988 to 
more than 50000 last year 
the crime we witness today is a result of the political 
situation said janusz wydra deputy police chief of warsaw 
the more freedom there is the less security 
poland has embarked on a conversion from communism to capitalism 
that has cost about 1 million people their jobs and driven most 
prices up more than 180 percent 
franke the dutch criminologist argued that skyrocketing 
statistics in former communist countries indicate the old regimes 
doctored figures for political reasons not that crime has 
increased dramatically 
he conceded that homes and businesses in the new east european 
democracies are easy targets for thieves since their owners have 
little experience with crime prevention 
in warsaw the situation is terrifying said wincenty 
grzeszczyk of the polish general prosecutors department stores do 
a booming business in window grates auto alarms deadbolt locks 
and mace 
statistics in czechoslovakia indicate crime has increased 400 
percent in some prague districts since president vaclav havel 
declared a general amnesty in 1989 for most prisoners jailed under 
the communists the amnesty brought the release of about twothirds 
of the prison population 
muggings rose 250 percent in urban areas during the first six 
months of 1990 and total crime was up 138 percent in the same 
period according to official figures 
italy is the most crimeprone country in western europe last 
years 1295 homicides reflected a 35 percent increase from 1988 
britain tightened gun laws after a gun collector in hungerford 
60 miles west of london killed 16 people including his mother in 
august 1987 then took his own life the homicide rate has fallen 
by half under the new laws 
most european countries severely restrict gun ownership but 
firearms are relatively easy to buy on the black market 
police in copenhagen found hundreds of hand grenades mines 
antitank rockets handguns and rifles in the possession of a 
propalestinian group that had robbed banks for seven years 
still franke credited tough guncontrol laws with making 
european cities relatively murderfree because he said people 
cant resort to guns to solve their quarrels

his colville indian forefathers fished 
this stretch of the columbia river with dip nets and spears 
catching hundreds of salmon a day yet hank cate stood recently at 
the chief joseph dam rod in hand hoping to snag just one 
my wifes starting to think im fishing down at the bridgeport 
tavern its been so long since i came home with a salmoncate 
said 
the bountiful runs of salmon here died out decades ago banging 
their heads against the impassable walls of chief joseph and grand 
coulee dams a century ago 12 million to 16 million salmon a year 
swam up the columbia to spawn today only 28 million make the 
trip 
one of the pacific northwests most prized natural resources has 
been decimated by overfishing habitat destruction pollution and 
most of all a gantlet of hydroelectric dams obstructing the 
salmons passage and flooding their spawning streams 
now despite one of the biggest wildlife restoration projects in 
us history conservationists say some runs of columbia river 
salmon face extinction theyre pushing for action under the 
federal endangered species act 
once again the battle lines are drawn in the pacific northwest 
between economics and the environment 
the columbia river is an example of technology gone mad 
said bill bakke executive director of oregon trout a conservation 
group weve squeezed benefits out of the river with technology 
and now were trying to fix the problems with technology its not 
working 
oregon trout and other conservation groups heated up the salmon 
debate earlier this year by proposing that four wild runs or 
subpopulations of columbia basin salmon be listed under the 
endangered species act 
federal wildlife officials wont decide on the listing until 
next spring but the proposal already has ignited tempers among 
competing river users who include dam operators farmers on 
irrigated land and commercial tribal and sport fishermen 
to some in the northwest the salmon issue looks all too 
familiar the region already faces enormous social costs in 
protecting the northern spotted owl a forestdwelling bird whose 
recent threatened listing by federal officials has devastated 
some timberdependent towns 
the salmon issue has a greater potential to impact far more 
people right in their pocketbooks than the spotted owl said rich 
brown an aide to rep ron wyden dore 
wydens office has estimated that if hydropower production is 
cut to save salmon northwest electricity rates could rise by up to 
33 percent 
the technological attempts to save the salmon began in 1980 
federal agencies and dam operators have spent more than 1 billion 
to pump up populations with hatcheries barge tiny salmon 
downstream around dams even shoot off fireworks to scare predatory 
sea gulls away from dams 
but after 10 years conservationists claim the costly effort has 
accomplished little whats worse they say a flood of 
hatcherybred fish actually is pushing wild salmon closer to 
extinction 
there are six species of pacific salmon in the texassized 
columbia basin and hundreds of distinct runs or stream 
populations a listing would apply only to a few of the most 
endangered runs but protective action might be necessary from 
hatching areas 700 miles inland all the way to the pacific ocean 
where salmon mature before returning upstream to spawn 
environmentalists say protecting a few runs would benefit other 
columbia basin salmon and bakke says applying the endangered 
species act would force a philosophical change among river 
managers instead of taming the salmon make the river more wild 
on the columbia river thats an unconventional idea 
the 1200mile columbia is the secondlargest us river by 
volume and one of the worlds most domesticated rivers over 60 
years its onceraging waters have been turned into a chain of 
stillwater lakes its flow is regulated on the main stem and its 
tributaries by 56 hydroelectric dams which produce cheap 
electricity and irrigated farmland vital to the northwest economy 
the grand coulee dam in eastern washington the nations largest 
hydro dam blocked 1100 miles of spawning habitat upstream when it 
was completed in 1941 the dam has no fish ladder a stairstepping 
channel that allows fish upstream fourteen years later chief 
joseph dam was built 50 miles downstream again with no ladder 
chief joseph is 545 miles upstream from the pacific 
most other columbia basin dams do have fish ladders but even 
those dams kill fish 
spring torrents that once swept young salmon downstream now 
stall out in reservoirs the salmon known as smolts must race to 
the ocean against their own biological clock which in 30 days 
turns them into saltwater fish some dont make it and die in the 
river 
an additional 10 percent to 15 percent of smolts die each time 
they pass through or over a high dam some are chewed up in the 
turbines some emerge so dazed they are easy prey for gulls and 
squawfish 
other manmade hazards await at every turn sediments from 
logging roads can turn the porous gravel of streambottom egg beds 
into suffocating concrete salmon swim into unscreened irrigation 
ditches only to die amid the alfalfa 
it makes you wonder how they do it said greg hovland a 
fish and wildlife specialist who tags salmon and traces their 
migration for the grant county public utility district 
the ambitious salmon recovery plan is coordinated by the 
northwest power planning council created by congress in 1980 
under the councils direction dam operators spend about 100 
million a year for salmon about 36 for each returning fish in 
the annual run 
the plans most successful program also is the most hotly 
debated starting fish in hatcheries then releasing them into 
streams as young salmon hatchery fish now comprise more than 70 
percent of the columbias adult salmon helping to increase the 
total annual run by 12 percent since 1980 
but those gains may be shortlived oregon trouts bakke said 
hatchery fish can dilute genetic stocks of wild fish compete for 
food and spawning areas and reduce the entire populations ability 
to survive he said 
hatchery supporters acknowledge there are problems but say 
hatcheries are needed to jumpstart depressed salmon populations 
new hatcheries that better match fish to their local environment 
will help they say 
bakke suggests less artificial remedies release more water over 
dams to help smolts swim downstream limit commercial fishing and 
stop destroying spawning habitat 
he says applying the endangered species act would give federal 
wildlife agencies more authority to enforce such measures now 
they often must negotiate compromises with other powerful river 
interests 
some of those interests aware that reserving more water for 
fish would mean higher electricity rates and irrigation costs say 
the salmon already have enough clout 
wed rather avoid a listing mainly because a listing throws a 
lot of extra bureaucracy into it said al wright executive 
director of the pacific northwest utilities conference committee a 
hydropower group 
in october the power planning council started a series of 
salmon summits it invited all interested parties to help 
create a new river management plan 
but even the best intentions cannot dissolve a hard reality the 
mighty columbia no longer has the water the power or the salmon 
for all the hungry mouths that want to take a bite 
well be lucky indeed if over the next 30 or 40 years we can 
double the number of fish said tom trulove a member of the 
power planning council thats about the limit of the available 
habitat well never have 16 million fish again

shirley ceasar is 27 years old and shes 
expecting her 10th child but another baby wont be a burden for 
her like the rest of her kids the child will be taken care of by 
its grandmother 
shirley a crack addict for at least four years lives in harlem 
with her boyfriend the father of all her children her mother 
sarah mae ceasar lives a 15minute subway ride away in a housing 
project in lower manhattan 
there in a cramped threebedroom apartment mrs ceasar takes 
care of five of her grandchildren including 11yearold walique 
who was born deaf and mentally retarded shirleys other children 
are cared for by their paternal grandmother 
i used to go up and see them and there was nothing in the 
refrigerator to eat no clothes for them to wear they werent even 
going to school said mrs ceasar 57 who is hoping to adopt the 
children id bring them clothes their father would sell the 
clothes for drugs 
in new york city and other large metropolitan areas 
grandmothers like mrs ceasar are the glue holding together many 
poor black families splintered by drugs 
in the past five years the crack epidemic has made addicts of 
more young minority women than any other drug in history in 
particular experts say it has threatened the tradition of black 
women who often hold their families together 
theres a quality in crack that is so quickly addictive that 
people dont get away with experimenting with it said richard 
johnson director of the jewish child care association of new york 
women who would normally retain some responsibility and some 
conscience about their children dont have the chance theyre 
addicted so quickly theyre just lost 
since 1985 the number of children in new york citys kinship 
foster care program which allows grandmothers and other relatives 
to receive aid for taking care of dependents has jumped from 150 
to 17000 
seventy percent of the placements of children within kinship 
foster care are the result of mothers crack addiction johnson 
said 
certainly the absence of a father is bad but now the mother 
is missing said melba hamilton director of the harlem dowling 
childrens service these children are facing a very bleak 
future 
and as a result grandmothers such as mrs ceasar have been 
called upon to assume enormous family burdens 
they are mostly southern women tied to a rural past while mired 
in the harsh economic realities of the inner city according to 
social workers many came to new york as newlyweds hoping for a 
better life most have outlived their husbands and lost some of 
their children to drugs and the streets 
now they must become mothers again sometimes caring for 
children born toxic and mentally handicapped because of their 
mothers addictions 
a lot of the grandmothers are really exhausted and would like 
to not have to do this said johnson but if it has to be done 
theyre going to do it 
some grandmothers care for their grandchildren on an informal 
basis but a growing number are taking advantage of kinship foster 
care and the financial aid it offers depending on the age of the 
child foster grandmothers are allowed anywhere from 450 to 900 
per month for their care 
despite the strain the grandchildren add to their lives some 
grandmothers are surprisingly resilient and learn to enjoy having 
kids around again 
some are younger than the stereotypical grandmother in the 
words of lorraine hale director of hale house a harlem home for 
the children of unwed working and drugaddicted mothers they 
dont all wear their gray hair in a bun and act wise but theyre 
often realistic when it comes to the problems of their own 
children 
its not my fault said mrs ceasar of the drug addiction of 
her daughter shirley and her other children its their fault 
and its their life if they dont want to make anything out of 
their life theres nothing i can do about it 
her grandchildren remain loyal to their parents but said they 
love their grandmother and the security of her home 
she takes us out places and does a lot of things with us 
said rasheeda 10 i like being home with her instead of a foster 
home 
the childrens father lorenzo adderley 28 also said he was 
grateful to sarah ceasar as he stood in the doorway of the harlem 
apartment he shares with shirley ceasar whom he met when he was 
14 adderley said he was looking for work and that shirley soon may 
go into a drug rehabilitation center 
mrs ceasar said both adderley and her daughter are addicts 
adderley said shirley was but denied that he was an addict though 
he appeared to be under the influence of drugs during an interview 
shirley ceasar declined to be interviewed 
mrs ceasar who was born and raised in sumter sc is not 
unlike many of the grandmothers who look a decade or more older 
than their age testament to unusually harsh lives 
mrs ceasars life story the details of which she recounted 
stoically in her living room as her grandchildren did their 
homework at the dining room table has been one of frequent 
tragedy 
her father was an alcoholic who beat his wife and children and 
forced her to begin work in the field picking peas and corn at the 
age of 8 two of her brothers were murdered as young adults she 
got pregnant at 13 and married the father 
after the family moved to new york one of mrs ceasars sons 
was strangled at age 17 and another died of a heart attack in her 
living room at age 30 
seated in a manhattan social services office with her 
caseworker blanche giles 68 who arrived in harlem from atlanta 
in 1949 recounts an equally tumultuous life 
she copes by rising at 5 am every day and opening to the 91st 
psalm in the bible she brought from georgia 
it opens up the day for me she said it keeps me going 
mrs giles needs all the spiritual sustenance she can muster 
she has been a widow since 1967 her only child a daughter died 
of a heart attack brought on by alcoholism and other addictions at 
the age of 45 the same year 
mrs giles then raised her two granddaughters one of whom 
marilyn also an alcoholic died of a brain tumor in 1987 mrs 
giles who often had cared for marilyns children over the years 
now has custody of rochelle 17 randy 15 andree 13 eunique 
11 and tenell 10 rochelle is pregnant with twins 
mrs giles other granddaughter also has had problems with 
addiction and her two children are with their paternal 
grandmother

viola jenkins 63 has lived in the same apartment building in 
the south bronx ever since she arrived in new york from her native 
fayetteville nc in 1945 her husband with whom she had four 
children died in 1982 
since 1985 shes taken care of her grandson and granddaughter 
they were placed in her care after authorities were tipped off that 
the children were being tied to the radiator in the apartment they 
shared with their parents who fought often and were involved with 
drugs 
every morning after the kids leave the apartment for school 
mrs jenkins walks over to her bedroom window she keeps a pillow 
there to rest her elbows while she gazes out onto union avenue and 
watches her two grandchildren until they disappear from sight 
i can see them almost all the way to school she said on a 
recent morning as she craned her neck out the window if i try to 
walk them to school they think im treating them like babies 
she tries not to worry too much about the drug dealers who 
infest union avenue she points them out as she gazes out the 
window at the desolate landscape of vacant lots and gutted 
buildings 
new york city is such a fast city she said but coming 
from the south makes me strong it gave me roots and a

by making a bid to merge with pan am corp 
trans world airlines inc chairman carl c icahn has shown he wants 
to cut a deal that could reshape his airline analysts say 
i think twa has to do something said edmund greenslet at 
esg aviation services in jacksonville fla they either have to 
acquire more airline assets or sell their assets to somebody else 
 
kevin murphy at morgan stanley said icahn might not have had his 
eyes set on a merger with pan am when he made the offer 
what you see isnt what you get with this guy murphy said 
monday there are other ways he can benefit 
pan am declined to commment monday on the merit or the status of 
icahns offer made friday in a letter to pan am chairman thomas g 
plaskett pan am said its focus was on a previously announced 
deal to sell prized london routes to rival ual corp in a deal that 
also includes a marketing combination with united airlines 
pan am said it understood icahns offer for about 150 million 
in cash and securities with a face value of about 300 million 
would come into play only if the ual deal is not completed by 
wednesdays deadline 
several airline analysts said they believed pan am will proceed 
with the ual deal even though a merger with twa would be 
beneficial to both pan am and twa they are considered among the 
weaker of the large us airlines which all have been hit hard by 
rising fuel costs but a merger would give the resulting carrier 
strength in europe and latin america 
even if icahns offer for pan am falls through the twa chairman 
loses nothing by making it experts said 
if he can prevent united airlines from going into london that 
would prevent a more formidable carrier from going into heathrow 
murphy said by creating more market forces for international 
assets and routes that can only come back and help him should he 
also decide to sell assets 
without a merger with pan am twa will be left in a position 
where it either needs to buy assets such as the atlanta hub and 
miami overhaul base of eastern airlines that it has expressed an 
interest in or sell its own assets analysts said 
the head of the twa branch of the air line pilots association 
kent scott agreed icahn may have been sending a broader signal 
through the merger offer 
i think this is icahns way of stirring up interest in twa and 
saying hey i want to do a deal whether its buy sell or 
whatever scott said 
the twa offer raised new questions about pan ams immediate 
future 
as far as i can see its sort of hazy at the moment said 
thomas canning at standard amp poors weve got to wait for the 
reaction from pan am for their fiduciary duties they have to 
consider it 
pan am did not preclude merger talks 
we are not going to comment on whether or not we have had any 
communications with mr icahn since we have received his letter 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said 
ual refused to say whether it believes the twa offer jeopardizes 
its pact with pan am talk to pan am spokesman joe hopkins 
said 
since the cash value of the securities offered by twa would 
vary analysts were uncertain whether pan am stockholders would 
gain money or lose money through the transaction 
pan am stock rose 25 cents to 187 in active trading monday 
pan am and twa are the only us carriers to fly into londons 
heathrow airport the most desirable destination in the city that 
is considered the gateway to europe analysts predicted a twapan 
am merger would face regulatory troubles because the government 
would not want to see all of those routes fall into the same 
corporate hands 
amr corp the parent of american airlines has said it would 
pay in excess of 500 million for the london routes but pan am 
said it was not interested in merely selling the routes pan am 
said its marketing arrangement with ual would help build up its 
latin american service with flights connecting through miami

several competitors are trying to break intel 
corps lucrative monopoly over a microprocessor that increasingly 
is the chip of choice for ibm personal computers and compatible 
models 
intels 80386 microprocessor has been a runaway success 
bringing in about a billion dollars a year in revenue and some of 
the highest profit margins the semiconductor industry has ever 
seen said michael slater editor of the newsletter microprocessor 
report 
microprocessors are fingernailsized wafers of silicon 
containing circuitry that acts as the brains of personal computers 
one of the wouldbe interlopers advanced micro devices inc 
began giving private demonstrations monday of its 386 clone at the 
huge comdex computer show here amd removed intels chips from 
several personal computers and replaced them with its own version 
there are no compatibility problems with it it works said 
amd spokesman david frink he said about 20 computer makers are 
testing the chip or have already evaluated it 
a public announcement of the amd microprocessor awaits a 
determination of its price and availability date officials of the 
semiconductor company said 
amd says it used a process called reverse engineering to devise 
a chip that mimics the 386 but uses different circuitry in fact 
amd says its chip is better because it uses less power 
several other semiconductor companies also are working on 386 
clones industry analysts say 
but intel one of the worlds largest semiconductor companies 
is not sitting still while competitors try to chip away at its 
blockbuster product it is involved in a thicket of legal conflicts 
with amd with which it once enjoyed a cooperative relationship 
intel has filed two lawsuits one contending amd has no right to 
a crucial component of the 386 chip called microcode and the 
second charging that amd would infringe on intels trademark if it 
uses the 386 name to market its chip 
on friday a federal judge denied intels request for an 
injunction to block amd from using the 386 name but it was unclear 
whether the ruling would give computer makers who use the amd chip 
the right to call them 386 machines 
the microcode suit stems from a 1976 agreement in which intel 
granted amd the right to the patents and microcode for intel 
microprocessors intel now claims amd may only copy the microcode 
for its own use not to sell chips containing it 
microcode is a set of software instructions contained in a 
memory device on each microprocessor it tells the circuits how to 
process data 
amd based in sunnyvale calif will devise microcode of its 
own to mimic intels if it loses the suit frink said 
amd also is involved in another legal battle with intel that 
could result in amd gaining rights to make a carbon copy of the 386 
chip that dispute now in abritration stems from a 1982 
technologysharing agreement between the two companies 
intel claims amd reneged on the agreement amd says it met the 
terms of the pact and should be given access to the 386 chip as 
well as 500 million in damages 
an arbitrator ruled last month that intel did not act in good

four companies including amd make clones of the 286 chip under 
license from intel said intel spokeswoman pam pollace from the 
companys santa clara calif headquarters 
but no such licenses are planned for the 386 chip despite the 
fact that intel has been rationing its production to customers

attempts to overhaul the troubled manville trust 
to compensate asbestos disease victims have hit roadblocks because 
of a dispute in a separate case 
negotiations to settle 65000 asbestos claims against 
eaglepicher industries inc were designed as a first step toward 
clearing a nationwide court backlog 
but lawyers for asbestos disease victims are upset over a 
perceived proindustry bent on the part of us district judge jack 
b weinstein who is seeking to resolve the asbestos litigation 
crisis 
in an apparent effort to speed negotiations and placate 
plaintiffs lawyers weinstein on monday approved a request by 
eaglepicher to pay asbestos victims who already have settled with 
the company 
weinstein earlier had halted all payments by the 
cincinnatibased maker of industrial products and auto parts for 
one month during settlement negotiations that would create an 
independent compensation fund and free the company of future 
liability payments 
what theyre looking for is to cut off their exposure in 
return for a total payment which the plaintiffs find 
acceptable said peter angelos a baltimore plaintiffs lawyer 
appointed by weinstein to negotiate with eaglepicher 
but other plaintiffs lawyers want victims to receive a majority 
stake in eaglepicher stock they also are angry at weinstein for 
making orders that would reduce legal fees and delay payments by 
the company to victims 
in apparent response the lawyers threatened to break off talks 
on restructuring the manville trust which has 130000 pending 
claims the most in the nation 
manville corp turned over a majority equity stake to an 
independent trust set up to resolve present and future asbestos 
claims manville emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
1988 
but that trust ran out of money to meet its payments earlier 
this year manville recently agreed to inject up to 520 million 
over seven years into the fund 
negotiations with plaintiffs lawyers in the manville case are 
seeking a scheme for paying victims with more serious diseases 
before those with lesser ailments people involved in those talks 
said they were within hours of a settlement recently before 
plaintiffs lawyers backed out 
in the eaglepicher case once an agreement is reached weinstein 
is expected to approve a classaction lawsuit to apportion money to 
victims 
on monday eight plaintiffs lawyers asked weinstein to be added 
to the settlement talks further increasing tensions in the case 
they said the courtappointed plaintiffs lawyers negotiating with 
eaglepicher were not representative of all victims 
any of the proposed settlements only prevents the victims from 
getting their full value and all the other creditors and the 
stockholders to continue business as usual said gene locks a 
philadelphia plaintiffs lawyer 
eaglepicher earlier this month said it was close to a 
settlement individuals involved said the company would have set 
aside about 500 million over 20 years but plaintiffs lawyers 
disputed that amount and said no agreement was reached 
angelos said the proposal fell short of what they were capable 
of doing in the present and future in light of the resources 
available to them 
eaglepicher has said it needs to settle all its claims or face 
insolvency by the end of 1992 its liability stems from its 
production from 1934 to 1971 of an asbestoscontaining cement used 
primarily in navy yard boiler rooms the company has said its 
liability from the product will exceed 1 billion 
the eaglepicher case is being closely watched as a possible 
model for dozens of other companies facing huge and growing 
liabilities because of asbestos products that caused lung cancer 
and other ailments several companies have entered bankruptcy 
proceedings because of their liabilities 
more than 90000 asbestos lawsuits are pending in state and 
federal courts nationwide many victims were exposed decades ago to 
the insulation and heat resistance mineral but still await 
compensation

americans wrongly believe offshore oil drilling 
is more threatening to the environment than shipping oil in 
tankers says interior secretary manuel lujan jr 
the real problem is tankers and when we prevent the 
production of domestic oil supplies then were inviting more 
imports lujan said at a news conference monday at the american 
petroleum institutes annual meeting 
lujan said the main reason he came to the meeting was to try to 
persuade leaders of big oil companies to explain their case better 
if theres going to be any production there must be better 
public relations to try to explain why something can be done in an 
environmentally sensitive manner he said 
if the public is not convinced that we can do it in an 
environmentally sound manner then we will continue with moratoria 
by congress and we will continue with opposition by the general 
public he said 
lujan was referring to a oneyear moratorium that congress 
renewed before it adjourned last month the moratorium maintained 
the widereaching prohibition on oil and gas leasing along 
thousands of miles of coastal waters from alaska to new england 
one oilindustry representative said at the time that the outer 
continental shelf contains enough oil to replace the united states 
imports from the persian gulf for the next 25 years 
but environmentalists have said the ban is necessary to protect 
coastal areas where congress has blocked drilling for nearly a 
decade through annual bans on lease sales through the interior 
departments budget 
president bush last summer postponed up to 10 years in some 
cases oiland gaslease sales off the west coast new england and 
southern florida until environmental concerns can be resolved but 
lujan said he and bush agree it is advantageous to develop domestic 
supplies 
also at the meeting monday an oil industry analyst said the 
united states should consider investing in the soviet union to 
reduce reliance on persian gulf oil and to help speed economic 
reform in that country 
the area is very very ripe for western involvement said 
lou pugliaresi president of washingtonbased lpi consulting 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait and the emerging crisis in the 
world oil market have underscored the energy security benefits to 
the united states and the west of oil production outside the 
persian gulf pugliaresi said in a panel discussion about 
prospects for the industry

american savings and loans might seem like 
the last place the soviet union would look for advice on how to 
finance its fledgling private housing market 
but valery p sorokin a soviet foreign ministry economist and 
diplomat is enthusiastically pumping executives at the 98th annual 
convention of the us league of savings institutions for 
everything he can learn 
we want to avoid the extremes the bad side of this whole 
business but we want to take the best that you have to 
offer sorokin said in an interview monday 
the soviet union has embarked on a 500day program to transform 
its communist economy into something approaching the freemarket 
system found in western countries 
part of the program he said is an overhaul of the ussr 
savings bank in effect a giant governmentowned savings and loan 
that is half again as big as citicorp the largest us financial 
institution 
according to sorokin who was addressing convention delegates 
today the bank will remain governmentowned but it will lose its 
monopoly on the finances of soviet citizens 
it will compete against savings institutions established by 
soviet republics and eventually against privately owned sampls he 
said 
in addition to lending to people who want to build or buy a 
home the soviet savings bank will finance private businesses 
producing construction material and others building homes and 
apartments for later rent or sale sorokin said 
but first the soviets will have to learn banking basics that 
americans take for granted 
we desperately need to computerize our savings and loan 
operation sorokin said after touring the conventions exhibit 
hall where computer and software firms touted their products 
right now its being done not in moscow certainly but in some 
provinces with abacuses 
we also are very interested in such trivial aspects of savings 
and loans such as verifying the credit standing of the customer 
we just dont have this culture since people never had much 
private property they dont have a credit record he said 
james h grohl senior vice president of the league said the 
trade group first offered its assistance to the soviets about three 
months ago sorokin who until recently was stationed at the soviet 
embassy in washington met with sampl executives before returning to 
moscow to consult with officials of the soviet savings bank 
sorokin said he hopes to establish an exchange program where top 
soviet bank officials would visit the united states to confer with 
their counterparts he also would like to arrange internships for 
soviet trainees at successful us thrift associations 
grohl said league officials are considering the proposals and 
hope to get the program started sometime next year 
sorokin who is quick with a joke is aware of the irony of 
seeking advice from an industry many americans consider a failure 
our professional people will be looking to your system of 
guarantees to your system of auditing and examining and probably 
even thinking of creating a resolution trust the rescue agency for 
failed sampls just in case he said with a laugh 
we understand there is not a perfect example of everything if 
you go to the stock exchange there are good and bad aspects of it 
but its a viable institution and it performs a very useful 
function in a market society the same is true of savings and 
loans he said 
one obstacle that soviet thrifts will have to overcome is 
attracting deposits with governmentcontrolled interest rates less 
than the inflation rate 
soviet sampls at least for a time will avoid one of the most 
basic problems faced by us thrifts the upanddown cycle of the 
housing market 
currently us institutions are suffering from declining home 
sales but in the soviet union demand for housing long 
unsatisfied by the communist economy is strong 
if the environment is stable the demand for housing is 
virtually unlimited sorokin said thats where the savings and 
loan system of the soviet union will be cashing in

dallas billionaire harold simmons wants lockheed 
corps help in completing a 2 billion offer for the stock he 
doesnt already own in the aerospace company 
lockheed which has rebuffed simmons previous attempts to 
increase his 20 percent stake said it needed more details on the 
40 a share offer 
simmons made the offer monday through houstonbased nl 
industries inc which he controls but a letter containing the 
offer made plain simmons will need help from lockheed maker of spy 
planes and the stealth fighter 
in order to effect a transaction of this magnitude in todays 
capital markets it is essential that we have lockheeds 
cooperation and support said the letter from nl president j 
landis martin to lockheed chairman daniel m tellep 
takeover transactions have become more difficult since the 
collapse of the junk bond market the highyield highrisk debt 
securities helped fuel the takeover frenzy of the 80s in 
addition major banks have been reluctant to lend money for 
buyouts 
martin said nl and its affiliates own 500 million worth of 
lockheed stock and have cash and other assets we are willing to 
dedicate to this effort 
calabasas califbased lockheed has treated simmons coolly at 
best since he first began acquiring the companys stock last year 
but on monday the company said it would give full consideration 
to nls indication of interest when further details are provided 
simmons was traveling and could not be reached for comment 
monday but martin said the 40 per share offer is a number we 
think would be overwhelmingly supported by shareholders 
he said the offer was made to boost the value of lockheeds 
stock which has been trading at about 25 after trading at twice 
that in the past year simmons paid about 43 each for his 125 
million shares in lockheed 
news of simmons offer came after the markets closed monday 
lockheed closed up 75 cents at 3025 on the new york stock 
exchange nl closed down 12 cents at 1125 on the nyse 
since he first started buying stock in lockheed last year the 
company has viewed simmons as an opportunistic raider simmons has 
maintained that he is just trying to make the company more 
profitable 
in mounting a proxy war that culminated at lockheeds annual 
meeting last spring simmons enlisted help from several large 
institutional investors who agreed with him that lockheeds board 
had been unresponsive to shareholders 
at the meeting lockheed made several changes in its corporate 
rules that were regarded as concessions to shareholders but the 
company left intact its chief defense a poison pill that made 
it prohibitively expensive for an unwanted suitor to buy more than 
20 percent of lockheeds common stock 
in september lockheeds directors agreed to suspend the poison 
pill if a takeover offer meets certain conditions they include 
that it must be for 100 percent of the company be in cash and be 
approved by a majority of shareholders not counting the one making 
the offer 
before that change simmons had tried to increase his stake by 
offering 35 a share for 10 million shares in lockheeds employee 
stock ownership plan lockheed directors established the plan to 
secure that voting stock with workers simmons has said

business and consumer interest rates should 
begin falling soon if private economists are right in forecasting 
that the federal reserve is ready to ease credit conditions 
members of the federal open market committee the central banks 
top policymaking group gathered for a closeddoor meeting today to 
review recent economic developments and chart a course for interest 
rates in coming months 
in light of a widely held view that the country has slipped into 
a recession many economists predicted that fed policymakers will 
vote to push interest rates lower in an effort to lessen the 
severity of any downturn 
this expectation was bolstered by some good news on the 
inflation front the runup in oil prices that followed iraqs aug 
2 invasion of kuwait has so far not become embedded outside the 
energy area weak demand has kept producers of other goods from 
boosting prices 
the combination of a weak economy and moderation on inflation 
including a big drop monday in oil prices should tilt the central 
bank toward easing credit to lessen the severity of the slump 
analysts said 
we cant really argue very much any more about whether the 
country is in a recession but we can still argue about how bad it 
is going to be said david wyss chief financial economist at 
drimcgraw hill i think the fed will work to keep the recession 
from being a severe one 
the fed trimmed the federal funds rate the interest banks 
charge each other for overnight loans from 8 percent to 775 
percent less than two weeks ago as a vote of confidence in the 
congressionally approved deficit package 
many economists were looking for a further reduction in this 
rate to 75 percent this should be enough to prompt banks to cut 
their prime lending rate by onehalf percentage point to 95 
percent they said 
the prime rate what banks charge their best customers has 
been stuck at 10 percent since last january any reduction would be 
seen as a boost to the economy since about onethird of all 
consumer and business loan rates are tied to the prime 
but even if the fed reduces its funds rate this week banks may 
choose to delay lowering the prime until early december in order to 
bolster their sagging profit margins analysts said 
some analysts said the fed could decide this week to reduce its 
discount rate the interest the central bank charges to commercial 
banks 
the discount rate now at 7 percent has not been lowered in 
more than four years such a move would be the most dramatic signal 
the fed could send of its intention to fight an economic slump 
however allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said he 
expected the fed to opt for the more modest 025 percentage point 
reduction in the funds rate because of lingering fears that 
inflation from the middle east turmoil still could get out of hand 
the developing recession looks bad enough to prompt the fed to 
make an additional easing move sinai said but even with 
another modest easing move the fed is taking an inflation risk 
hoping that the oil and energy inflation rate does not creep deeply 
into the underlying inflation rate 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he 
believed the central bank under the chairmanship of alan greenspan 
was in danger of repeating the mistakes made by the fed following 
the first oil shock of 197374 
evans said the fed under the direction of thenfed chairman 
arthur burns eased too quickly and ended up allowing inflation 
from the oil shock to become embedded in the economy 
i am concerned that the greenspan fed could be setting the 
stage for a severe bout of inflation later on in the decade 
evans said 
other analysts said they believed the inflation risk is worth 
taking in an effort to jumpstart the economy 
with oil prices taking a sharp drop monday many economists said 
that should spell further relief for home buyers in terms of lower 
mortgage rates which tend to follow the price of longterm bonds 
wyss predicted that fixedrate mortgages which stand just above 
10 percent nationally could dip to 95 percent in coming weeks

conference to announce the merger which is subject to approval by 
the finance ministry the fair trade commission and japans central 
bank 
a statement by saitama bank said the merger would help 
strengthen management to cope with liberalization and 
internationalization of japans financial markets

the economic crisis in the northeast has 
stayed out of silicon valley so far defying the doomsayers on wall 
street but fears of a recession have clearly arrived 
remembering the hard times in 1985 and 1986 when bloated 
silicon valley companies laid off tens of thousands of workers the 
operative phrase for most firms here these days is tighten up 
companies are avoiding unnecessary trips watching the cost of 
meals trimming inventory and work force lavish christmas parties 
are out 
computer and chip companies in this hightech mecca have been 
bracing for a recession for months although there is still no 
strong evidence that a major downturn in the electronics business 
is imminent 
sales overall are up from a year ago inventories are down and 
there are no big layoffs despite pockets of trouble 
cash is king apple computer inc is sitting pretty on a 1 
billion hoard built up from 800 million a year ago to get 
through future economic bumps 
apple chairman john sculley says the only people who arent 
acknowledging an oncoming recession are government economists he 
and other silicon valley leaders have been preparing for a slowdown 
by cutting manufacturing and sales costs and lowering prices to 
attract buyers 
entering a recession its better to be coming out with more 
aggressively priced items than highend items said apple 
spokesman christopher escher our newest macintoshes are 
positioned well for a tighter economic situation 
although fat work forces are out companies here have been 
avoiding heavy layoffs 
premature layoffs have mostly been a new england phenomenon 
said jerry jordan chief economist at first interstate bancorp in 
los angeles unlike california that area is really in a serious 
recession 
hewlettpackard co slimmed down a bit from 95000 workers to 
92000 so far this year and it continues to cut back by attrition 
it also plans to close four extra days with mandatory vacations 
between christmas and new years day to save operating costs and 
remove days off as a liability on its books 
national semiconductor corp restructured this summer and cut 
jobs from 32000 to 30000 advanced micro devices inc is expected 
to cut about 1200 jobs by years end 
in each of those cases though the cuts are related to the 
distinct business conditions impacting the companies as a whole 
the computer and chip industries here are holding off a major 
downturn 
in the last couple of months theres been a general 
tightening said fred zieber of dataquest inc a hightech 
market research firm in san jose theres a lot of concern among 
management about the nearterm future because they just dont know 
what sort of recession there may or may not be 
its been more of a management control reaction more 
anticipation than reality the numbers by and large dont support 
the concern 
unlike the hard times that have hit the northeast especially 
along the hightech corridor of route 128 in massachusetts the 
computer companies here are not heavily dependent upon military or 
aerospace contracts which have suffered in recent years in 
silicon valley the computer companies focus more on workstations 
personal computers and peripherals 
one sign that things may get worse came earlier this month when 
businessland inc a san josebased retail firm reported a 198 
million loss for its first fiscal quarter and said it would lay off 
780 people or 20 percent of its work force by years end 
david norman businesslands chief executive officer attributed 
the revenue drop to industry pricecutting new product 
introductions and sluggish capital equipment spending by 
corporations 
apples new lowerpriced macintoshes appear to be selling 
briskly and sales are good at hewlettpackard sun microsystems 
inc and other computer companies sun is expected to receive a 
boost from the sparcstation 2 line recently introduced the 
graphics workstations which range in price from 14995 to 
49995 are far more powerful and versatile than the bestselling 
sparcstation 1 
computer chip orders rose modestly through the summer 
increasing 98 percent in september alone over a year ago theyre 
expected to keep increasing into next year 
the statistics at this point do not indicate a recession in 
the semiconductor industry said tom beermann spokesman for the 
trade group semiconductor industry association 
a recent sia forecast estimated worldwide chip sales would grow 
125 percent in 1991 following a year of relatively flat growth 
from 1989s 488 billion to about 495 billion this year if war 
breaks out in the middle east the group estimated chip sales would 
grow by a more moderate 625 percent next year 
but those rosy numbers mask a severe drop in sales of memory 
chips which are down 18 percent this year according to dataquest 
the drop there is mostly hurting the japanese manufacturers who 
dominate the memory market 
silicon valley chipmakers who specialize in more advanced 
devices are benefiting from a 12 percent rise in microprocessor 
sales 7 percent in logic chips and 7 percent in analog chips 
the chip and computer industries may be just fine overall but 
that doesnt mean there isnt a lot of pain in a lot of 
companies said dataquests zieber i think youll have a tough 
market for awhile but not one that completely falls apart if 
theres a debacle coming its not real evident so far 
inventories of semiconductors are relatively flat and 
inventories of computers are up only slightly zieber said 
by historical standards theyre both a little below average 
which is good he said if you get too much inventory then you 
have to cut back twice as far if a recession sets in 
even companies that are flush such as intel corp maker of the 
popular chips that act as the brains of international business 
machine corps personal computers and ibm clones are yielding 
to the economic uncertainties 
were looking at critical hires only said pam pollace an 
intel spokeswoman were seeking to be conscientious about 
internal controls inventory spending were asking people to 
avoid unnecessary travel and expenses 
intels earnings remain strong rising to 172 million in the 
third quarter from 72 million a year ago 
intel is boosting spending for research and development from 
422 million last year to 600 million this year pollace said 
because in this business you need to continue that to keep moving 
ahead with the technology 
advanced micro devices lost 237 million in the last two 
quarters and expects to post another loss in the current quarter 
but the company is cautious about laying off workers because it 
believes its longterm prospects are solid 
the company recently completed a 200 million development center 
and this past week introduced a microprocessor to compete against 
intels hotselling 80386 microprocessor 
weve been doing things to react to our own business 
conditions which has had the same effect on us as a recession 
said amd spokesman john greenagel amd has not performed as well 
as the semiconductor industry as a whole for some time the actions 
weve taken wed have to take regardless of the economic 
conditions

chicago title and trust co the largest us 
title insurer announced plans to purchase its biggest competitor 
ticor title insurance cos 
the merger would create an almost 1 billion per year company 
chicago titles revenues were about 561 million in 1989 and the 
ticor companies were 408 million said joann shanley spokeswoman 
for ticors parent westwood equities corp 
chicago title a unit of alleghany corp in new york said 
monday the deal is expected to close during the first quarter of 
1991 subject to approval by regulators and other conditions 
no antitrust or other difficulties were expected to interfere 
with the purchase ms shanley said 
the deal follows a consolidation trend among title insurers who 
check property records and guarantee to buyers and lenders that a 
seller of property actually owns it 
ticor once the largest title insurer has lost money recently 
as has the 4 billion industry in general price squeezing claims 
inflation and sagging real estate markets have contributed to the 
problems 
a previous agreement to buy ticor by general motor corps data 
processing unit fell apart last month reportedly because ticors 
problems were worse than anticipated 
ticor is privately owned and doesnt disclose profit and loss 
figures but ms shanley acknowledged it lost money in 1989 
the same would be the case in 1990 especially with the real 
estate situation the way it is she said 
the title insurance industry reported losses on operations of 
112 million in 1988 and 154 million in 1989 although investment 
income cushioned the losses according to the american land title 
association 
ticor will become the fourth of the largest 12 companies in the 
industry to go out of business or be taken over since 1987 chicago 
titles chief executive richard p toft last month predicted 
further consolidations 
toft and other chicago title officials declined to discuss any 
details of the purchase monday 
the ticor title insurers ticor title insurance co of 
california ticor title insurance co and new yorkbased ticor 
title guarantee co are based in los angeles along with westwood 
equities 
westwood also owns ticor realty tax services which handles the 
impound accounts in which taxes are placed and then forwarded to 
the government when property is sold trts accounted for a bit more 
than a quarter of westwoods 549 million in 1989 revenues its 
not being bought by chicago title

principal and interest payments until the hotel chain can complete 
a restructuring of 744 million in debt much of it in highyield 
bonds 
officials of the atlantabased company maintained that its 
daytoday operations are sound days inns president john d 
snodgrass said he was confident the restructuring could be worked 
out by early 1991 
snodgrass said the companys debt structure high interest rates 
and short amortization schedules rather than its operations were 
the cause of problems 
if you look at the operating side of the company its 
extremely healthy he said 
reliance group holdings which sold the chain to new yorkbased 
tollmanhundley hotels in 1989 accumulated much of the debt 
the 1100unit chain which marks its 20th anniversary thursday 
said monday it has not made recent payments of principal and 
interest related to about 325 million of longterm and shortterm 
obligations it is paying an average interest rate of 14 percent 
the company would not identify its major debt holders but said 
fewer than 10 own about half of the debt currently in default 
there are a total of about 200 debt holders snodgrass said 
days inn said it is working with the major debt holders as well 
as with an undisclosed new york investment banking firm to 
restructure the debt 
following the companys announcement monday moodys investors 
service lowered its rating on days inns subordinated debt of about 
149 million from caa to ca moodys said the lowering reflected an 
overcapacity in the lodging industry as well as the economys 
slowdown 
snodgrass said the chains reservations are up 95 percent over 
last year and the company is paying its vendors on a timely basis 
within 60 days the company has franchise agreements for 350 new 
hotels in the next two years

michael hornung is a vinyl romantic 
he plays albums at home and keeps a record player in his office 
he also has resisted pleas from his 21yearold son to get with 
it and buy a compact disc player 
as director of operations at mca manufacturing corps record 
and tape plant in gloversville ny hornung runs one of the few 
remaining plants in the country that manufacture vinyl records 
its sad to think there may come a day when records are no 
longer made hornung said demand for vinyl has fallen off but 
were still producing it its still selling 
the 37yearold plant in this old tannery town in upstate new 
york manufactures cassette tapes and vinyl records for mca whose 
artists include elton john tom petty and the heartbreakers bobby 
brown and the oak ridge boys 
mca also owns motown records and the jazzoriented grp records 
label in addition to universal pictures and the universal city 
theme park in california the company recently purchased geffen 
records in a deal expected to be completed by early next year 
the gloversville plant is the only place in the country where 
mca makes vinyl records which account for 20 percent of music 
recording sales nationwide according to hornung he said it might 
be the only place in the country where 45s are still made 
hornung whos worked at the gloversville facility for 20 years 
believes that records will disappear at some point in his lifetime 
i think were getting closer to that point said mick 
borthick head of production at chrysalis in new york 
several developments this year seem to indicate that chrysalis 
and polygram announced that with a few rare exceptions all their 
new releases will be on cassette tape and cd only 
warnerelektraatlantic reported that it will cut out more than 
40 percent of its vinyl catalogue that means 1205 album titles 
owned by the conglomerate will no longer be available on records 
the tower records chain said it will no longer sell 7inch 
single records because several major labels wont accept returns on 
unsold records 
record buyers are in the minority said robert cohen 
manager of the finyl vinyl record store in new york vinyl is 
becoming a specialty item 
in 1982 the year before cds were introduced manufacturers 
shipped out 244 million records for sales of 2 billion according 
to the recording industry association of america last year 
manufacturers shipped out only 34 million records for sales of 220 
million 
by comparison 207 million cds were shipped out in 1989 for 
sales of 26 billion the association said about 446 million tape 
cassettes also were sold 
cds and cassettes have really taken over borthick said 
he noted that cassette players are favored by youths and most 
other music lovers have been seduced by the clearer sounds of cds 
chrysalis with annual sales of 70 million worldwide said 
recent releases by sinead oconnor and billy idol sold few record 
albums in this country slightly more than 1 percent the rest were 
cd and cassette sales 
you can understand why were not anxious to manufacture 
records bothrick said its not economical to operate pressing 
plants when theyre only turning out a few records he said 
merchants said they would rather discontinue records so they 
could have more room for cassettes and the more expensive cds 
records account for only 2 percent of sales in the 82store record 
world so vinyl is being phased out said mitch imber purchasing 
director 
thats left many feeling that records are being killed off 
prematurely 
manufacturers are looking to remove the option of buying 
records from consumers said cohen of the finyl vinyl record 
store they have abandoned a big segment of the recordbuying 
community in order to push the more expensive cd format 
merchants who still want to carry records said return policies 
and reordering difficulties are putting pressure on them to relent 
cohen said hes charged anytime he returns an album whether 
its defective or not theres no penalty for cassette and cd 
returns 
hornung is paying close attention to the changing times but he 
said his plant which distributes tapes and records throughout the 
northeast and as far west as ohio isnt planning to manufacture 
cds 
instead the gloversville plant is expanding its tape production 
capabilities the facility is the no 3 producer of tapes in the 
country behind warnerelektraatlantic and cbs records hornung 
said 
weve shrunk vinyl operations and expanded into this 
hornung said 
the factory still makes 7inch and 12inch records and will 
continue to do so as long as theres demand for them hornung said 
bless them said cohen whose store caters to vinyl 
romantics especially with hardtofind records from the 1960s 
and if were the last store still selling these 12inch pieces of 
black plastic then thats just fine with me

the carmaker volvos advertising agency quit 
today saying it was taking responsibility for the bogus commercial 
depicting a volvo that resisted the stomping of a big pickup truck 
while other cars collapsed 
scali mccabe sloves inc said it was resigning as the ad agency 
for volvo cars of north america because of questions raised about 
the production of the socalled monster truck commercial for 
the swedish car 
the ad showed a volvo was the only car left standing a pickup 
truck with oversized tires ran over a row of cars 
it was later discovered the volvo had been reinforced and the 
other cars were weakened before the ad was shot 
the ad agencys chairman marvin sloves said in announcing the 
agency was resigning the account that agency executives had worked 
for 23 years to establish volvo as one of the most respected and 
admired brand names in north america 
as a result he said felt agency executives wanted to insure 
that our actions in no way diminish the value and reputation of 
the volvo name 
to this end it is imperative that we resign and accept 
ultimate responsibility for what happened now is not the time to 
point fingers at anyone he said 
he said it had been established that the issue was only the 
making of this advertisement and not the strength or durability 
of volvo cars the integrity of the car company or any previous 
advertising 
a call was placed to volvo for comment on the development but 
it was not immediately returned 
under pressure from the state attorney general of texas volvo 
announced last week it had pulled the commercial and would run 
corrective ads because it turned out the volvo in the ad had been 
reinforced with steel or wood 
at the same time volvo admitted that those who made the 
commercial had removed supports in the other cars in the ads 
the automaker which admitted no wrongdoing in settling the 
dispute with the attorney general in texas said the ad was a 
dramatization of a 1988 vermont event and should have stated it was 
a dramatization but the commercial carried no such disclaimer 
volvo said the modifications were made to the cars to ensure the 
crews safety while making the ad

the government said tuesday it wants to introduce 
more competition into britains multibilliondollar 
telecommunications market and end the control held by giant british 
telecom 
british telecommunications plc which the government privatized 
six years ago controls about 97 percent of the local telephone 
market the rest is held by mercury communications ltd 
trade secretary peter lilley outlined to the house of commons 
the governments proposal for allowing new players into the local 
domestic long distance and international markets 
foreign companies would be allowed to apply for licenses in all 
three telecommunications categories the trade department said 
the new competitors progressively would be allowed equal access 
to british telecoms existing british infrastructure lilley said 
lilley also said government price constraints on british telecom 
should remain in place until 1993 under the constraints set by the 
office of telecommunications the company can raise no more than 
45 percent below the rate of inflation which is 109 percent 
this country has already benefited from our policies of 
privatization and competition and because of the uks lead we are 
becoming a telecommunications hub for western europe lilley 
said 
the government is committed to reinforce this lead and to 
ensure that consumers have the widest possible services at the most 
competitive price he said 
british telecom said it welcomed the governments general 
thrust for greater competition and choice but it was 
disappointed that cable television companies would be allowed to 
continue their monopoly in providing entertainment services 
lilley said british telecom would be barred from that market for 
the next 10 years 
british telecom has 19 million residential and 6 million 
business customers it had aftertax profit of 154 billion pounds 
or 3 billion in its last fiscal year on revenue of 123 billion 
pounds 24 billion 
the government invited comment on its plan until jan 14

the european court of justice tuesday approved 
the european communitys 1985 ban on the use of hormones in cattle 
breeding 
the court ruled tuesday that the ban was justified to allay 
health concerns of european consumers as expressed by the european 
parliament the european economic and social committee and various 
european consumers associations 
the luxembourg court at first voided the european directive 
mainly for legal technicalities and the ec immediately revised its 
text to comply with the court objections 
european producers of pharmaceutical and veterinary products 
then attacked the ban before the court claiming there was no 
scientific evidence the use of hormones was harmful to humans 
the 1985 ban led to us trade reprisals the us government 
claimed its cattle breeders were losing 100 million worth of 
exports because of the ban and slapped tariffs on various european 
food exports
